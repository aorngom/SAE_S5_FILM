00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:08,555  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:344 Y2:415
Orchestrations were
arranged by Sir Rhodri Fenning,

2
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:12,467  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
and Dame Evelyn Blish is a member
of the Kings Lynn players.

3
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:17,505  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
So tune in again next week for more
from the What's My Line? team.

4
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:20,983  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
And that brings us to the end
of programming for today.

5
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:26,023  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, from all of us here at
Alexandra Palace, a very good night.

6
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:31,968  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
£200 overdrawn.

7
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:36,286  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
I need a miracle.

8
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:40,177  X1:078 X2:367 Y1:452 Y2:523
NATIONAL ANTHEM
PLAYS ON TELEVISION

9
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,871  X1:078 X2:221 Y1:488 Y2:523
LAUGHTER

10
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:54,578  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's a caution, that one,
he does make me laugh.

11
00:00:55,547 --> 00:01:00,901  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, our lord and master.
Rita, I'm off out. Dad?

12
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:03,978  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, how many times, son?
We'll see.

13
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:09,209  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
But everyone's getting a telly,
Dad, even Mr Gallagher.
And the Bells at number 67.

14
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:12,006  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, perhaps we'll get one
for the Coronation.

15
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:14,843  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
If you're lucky. We'll see.

16
00:01:14,883 --> 00:01:18,516  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't wait up.
I heard they rot your brains.

17
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:23,314  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rot them into soup and your brain
comes pouring out of your ears.

18
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:25,612  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's what television does!

19
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,365  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Magpie?

20
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:50,885  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Mr Magpie?

21
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,042  X1:328 X2:391 Y1:488 Y2:523
Eh?

22
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:55,278  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
You-hoo! Can you hear me, Magpie?

23
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:57,007  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes.

24
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:02,354  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
I must be dreaming. . .
Oh, no. This isn't a dream.

25
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:05,830  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm going doolally, then.
Not at all, sweetheart.

26
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,267  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, are you sitting comfortably?

27
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:12,384  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good. Then we'll begin.

28
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:19,016  X1:078 X2:259 Y1:452 Y2:523
SHE LAUGHS,
HE SCREAMS

29
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:09,724  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought we'd be
going for the Vegas era.

30
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:13,796  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
You know, the white flares
and the chest hair.

31
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:17,314  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are kidding! If you wanna see
Elvis, you go for the late Fifties.

32
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:21,828  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
The time before burgers,
when they called him the Pelvis
and he still had a waist!

33
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,025  X1:078 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's more, you see him in style!
ENGINE REVS

34
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:35,573  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
You going my way, doll? Is there
any other way to go, daddio?

35
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,570  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Straight from the fridge, man!

36
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,687  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ah, you speak the lingo!
Yeah, well. . .

37
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:45,645  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Me, Mum, Cliff Richard movies -
every Bank Holiday Monday. Cliff!

38
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:48,227  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
I knew your mother'd
be a Cliff fan.

39
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:54,996  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:344 Y2:415
Where're we off to?
Ed Sullivan TV studios.

40
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:57,593  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:380 Y2:451
Elvis did Hound Dog
and there were complaints.

41
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:02,626  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:308 Y2:379
Bit of luck, we'll just catch it.
That'd be TV studios in. . .

42
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,753  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
What, New York? That's the one!

43
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:12,530  X1:078 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
SHE LAUGHS
Dig that New York vibe!

44
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,053  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, this could still be New York.

45
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:17,929  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
I mean,
this looks very New York to me.

46
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:21,326  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
A sort of. . .
Londony New York, mind, but. . .

47
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,839  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
What're all the flags for?

48
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:30,477  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:523
# We want Muffin
Everybody sings!

49
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:34,811  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
# We want Muffin the Mule. . #
Smashing!

50
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,748  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Smashing, innit?

51
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:41,226  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
You'd have thought
they was in the room with ya!

52
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,300  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fair do's, Tommy, you had a point.

53
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,937  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
New television. There, that
should cheer you up a bit, Rita?

54
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:49,573  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Give us a smile, then, eh?

55
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:52,811  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can't. Nothing's the same
any more. Not with her. . .

56
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:54,405  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop going on about it!

57
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:55,925  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
But her face, Eddie.

58
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:58,245  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
What happened to her?

59
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:01,245  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
That awful face. I said, stop it!

60
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:04,885  X1:078 X2:281 Y1:488 Y2:523
LOUD BANGING

61
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,235  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's awake!

62
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,832  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think she's hungry.

63
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:15,867  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
There you go, sir!
All wired up for the great occasion.

64
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:20,383  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Great occasion? What do you mean?
Where you been living,
out in the colonies?

65
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:22,697  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Coronation, of course!

66
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:24,933  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
And what Coronation's that, then?

67
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:28,055  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you mean? THE Coronation!

68
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,967  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the Queen's! Queen Elizabeth!

69
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,527  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh! Is this 1953?
Last time I looked!

70
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:39,243  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Time for a lovely bit of pomp
and circumstance, what we do best!

71
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:40,840  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at all the TV aerials.

72
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,515  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Looks like everyone's got one.

73
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:46,754  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's weird, my nan said
tellys were so rare, they all
had to pile into one house.

74
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:50,592  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
Not around here, love.
Magpie's Marvellous Tellys,
only five quid a pop.

75
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:54,068  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, but this is a brilliant year,
classic!

76
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:59,700  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Technicolor, Everest climbed,
everything off the ration.

77
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,655  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
A nation throwing off the shadows
of war and looking forward
to a happier, brighter future!

78
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:08,129  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Someone help me, please! Ted!

79
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,569  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leave him alone, that's my husband!
Please! What's going on?

80
00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:17,321  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oi! What are you doing? ! Police
business, get out of the way, sir.
Who'd they take?

81
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:20,358  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you know him?
Must be Mr Gallagher.

82
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:26,913  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
But it's happening
all over the place -
they're turning into monsters.

83
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,070  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tommy! Not one word!

84
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,705  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get inside, now!

85
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:32,388  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry, I'd better do as he says.

86
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:41,745  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
All aboard!

87
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:48,078  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Operation Market Stall.
Go! Go! Go!

88
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:08,748  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lost them.
How did they get away from us?

89
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:13,900  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm surprised they didn't turn back
and arrest you for reckless driving.
Have you passed your test?

90
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,697  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Men in black?
Vanishing police cars?

91
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,892  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is Churchill's England,
not Stalin's Russia.

92
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:24,812  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Monsters, that boy said. Maybe we
should go and ask the neighbours.

93
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,489  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's what I like about you.

94
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,129  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
The domestic approach.

95
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,526  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

96
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,778  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold on, was that an insult?

97
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,436  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've finished it.

98
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:41,873  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
As you instructed.

99
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:44,270  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's awfully good of you,
Mr Magpie.

100
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,908  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
So you'll go soon?
You'll leave me?

101
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:49,864  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
We'll see.

102
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,979  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you're a very good boy.
Please.

103
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:54,813  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're burning me.

104
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:59,012  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Inside, behind my eyes. It hurts.

105
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:01,808  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Even my memories hurt.

106
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,087  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
I just want things back
like they used to be.

107
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:11,841  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, but this world of yours is
busy, busy, busy! Forging ahead
into a brand-new age!

108
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:15,635  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can never go back,
that's your tragedy.

109
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:20,671  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
But now. . .
the time is almost ripe, Magpie.

110
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:24,357  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

111
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:29,064  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or lady.

112
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,100  X1:078 X2:171 Y1:488 Y2:523
THUD!

113
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:55,087  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gran?

114
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,710  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gran, it's me, it's Tommy.

115
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:05,138  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm gonna come in, Gran.
Stand back, just don't. . .

116
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:08,297  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry, but I've got to come in.

117
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:10,417  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you think you're doing?

118
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,891  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've got to try and help her, Dad.

119
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:16,253  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Give me that key.

120
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:18,835  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
I said, give me that key, right now.

121
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:27,682  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't think I've finished with you.

122
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:33,713  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
All the warnings
I've given you and every time,
every time, you disobey me!

123
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:37,749  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
But we can't just lock her away.
Excuse me, sunshine. I am talking.

124
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:40,427  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can forget
that college nonsense.

125
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,659  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are gonna come
and work alongside me.

126
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:45,741  X1:078 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get your hands dirty for once.
THUDS FROM UPSTAIRS

127
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,779  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Lord. Won't she ever stop?

128
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:53,291  X1:078 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
THUDS CONTINUES
There, there, Rita my sweet.

129
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,207  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Business as usual.

130
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:59,286  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, let's get these up all over the
house, in honour of her Majesty.

131
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:04,497  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
But, Eddie, what if she's dying?
I am talking!

132
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:12,995  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's better.
A little bit of hush.

133
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:16,635  X1:078 X2:307 Y1:488 Y2:523
DOORBELL RINGS

134
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,383  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
BO TH: Hi!

135
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:22,380  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who are you, then? Let's see.
Judging by the look of you,

136
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,857  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
family man, nice house, fought
in the war, therefore,
I represent Queen and country.

137
00:10:26,897 --> 00:10:31,448  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
Just doing a little check of
her forthcoming Majesty's
subjects before the great day.

138
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:36,528  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, er, very nice, very well kept.
I'd like to congratulate you, Mrs. . .

139
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:41,001  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Connolly. Rita, I can handle this.
This gentleman's
a proper representative.

140
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,116  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't mind the wife,
she rattles on.

141
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:45,359  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, maybe she should
rattle on a bit more.

142
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,117  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not convinced you're
doing your patriotic duty.

143
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:51,310  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Those flags,
why are they not flying?

144
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,750  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
There we are, Rita! I told you!

145
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,223  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get them up! Queen and Country!
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,382  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get it done, do it now.
Hold on a minute.

147
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:01,975  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
Like the gentleman says.
Hold on a minute.
You've got hands, Mr Connolly.

148
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,815  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
Two big hands,
so why is that your wife's job?
Well, it's housework, innit?

149
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,532  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
And that's a woman's job?
Course it is.

150
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:12,129  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Connolly,
what gender is the Queen?

151
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:16,475  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
She's a female.
Then are you suggesting
the Queen does the housework?

152
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,358  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, not at all. Then get busy!

153
00:11:24,398 --> 00:11:26,714  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right. Yes, sir.

154
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,671  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'll be proud of us, sir!

155
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:33,905  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
We'll have Union Jack left, 
right and centre!   
Excuse me, Mr Connolly. Hang on a minute.

156
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:38,500  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:416 Y2:523
Union Jacks?
Yes, that's right, isn't it?
That's the Union Flag.

157
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:44,295  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's the Union Jack
only when it's flown at sea.
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I do apologise.

158
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:48,755  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, don't get it wrong again,
there's a good man. Now get to it!

159
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,965  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right then, nice and comfy.

160
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,522  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
At her Majesty's leisure!

161
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:58,680  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Union Flag?
Mum went out with a sailor.

162
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,717  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
I bet she did.
. .Anyway, I'm the Doctor,
and this is Rose, and you are?

163
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:05,663  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tommy.
Well, sit yourself down, Tommy.

164
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,510  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have a look at this.

165
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,095  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I love telly, don't you? Yeah,
I think it's brilliant. Good man!

166
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,295  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Keep working, Mr C! . . Now, why
don't you tell me what's wrong?

167
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:24,453  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did you say you were a doctor?
Yes, I am.

168
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:28,050  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can you help her? Oh, please.
Can you help her, Doctor?

169
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:33,083  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Now then, Rita, I don't think
the gentleman needs to know. . .
Oh, the gentleman does.

170
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:35,881  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell us what's wrong
and we can help.

171
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,075  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's all right.
It's all right. Come here.

172
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:45,031  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, it's all right.
Hold on a minute.

173
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:48,820  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Queen and Country's one thing,
but this is my house!

174
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,144  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
What the. . .
What the hell am I doing? !

175
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:54,537  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now you listen here, Doctor.

176
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:59,894  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
You may have fancy qualifications,
but what goes on under my roof
is my business!

177
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:02,531  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not if people are being. . .
I am talking!

178
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:05,808  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I'm not listening!

179
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:09,883  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
Now you are staring into
a deep, dark pit of trouble
if you don't let me help.

180
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:13,799  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
So I'm ordering you, sir -
tell me what's going on!

181
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,461  X1:078 X2:383 Y1:488 Y2:523
THUDS FROM UPSTAIRS

182
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:22,015  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
She won't stop.

183
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:25,955  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
She never stops.

184
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:30,859  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
We started hearing stories,
all round the place.

185
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,415  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
People who. . .changed.
Families keeping it secret,
cos they were scared.

186
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:39,690  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then the police started finding out.
We don't know how, no-one does.

187
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,487  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
They just turn up,
come to the door and take them,
any time of the day or night.

188
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:45,761  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Show me.

189
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,881  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gran?

190
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:55,692  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's Tommy. It's all right,
Gran. I've brought help.

191
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:12,706  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Her face is completely gone.

192
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:17,771  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Scarcely an electrical impulse left.

193
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:21,287  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Almost complete neural shut-down,
it's just ticking over.

194
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:27,441  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's like her brain's been. . .wiped
clean. What are we gonna do, Doctor?

195
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:31,120  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
We can't even feed her!
We've got company!

196
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,513  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
They've come for her! What was
she doing before this happened?

197
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:38,669  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell me, quickly, think! She doesn't
leave the house. She was just. . .

198
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,226  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hold on, there are three
important, brilliant

199
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:45,222  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
and complicated reasons why
you should listen to me. One. . .

200
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:47,059  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

201
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:50,856  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leave her alone,
you'll hurt her! Mum !

202
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:53,108  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor! Don't hurt her!

203
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:58,479  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:416 Y2:523
Back inside, Rita.
She's my mother!
Back inside now, I said!

204
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:03,703  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hell of a right hook!
Have to watch out for that.

205
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:09,439  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't fight it, back inside!

206
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:12,836  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose! Come on! Get back inside!

207
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:16,886  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't fight it, son. Don't fight it!
Rose! We're gonna lose them again!

208
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:24,125  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Dad, they took her!
That was Gran, and they took her!
Come on, back inside!

209
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:35,913  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
How did they find her,
who told them?

210
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:40,363  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
You! Get the hell out of my house!

211
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:42,440  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm going, I'm done.

212
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,046  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nice to meet you, Tommy,
Mrs Connolly.

213
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:52,628  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
And as for you, Mr Connolly,
only an idiot hangs
the Union Flag upside down.

214
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:54,186  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Shame on you!

215
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,300  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, very good.

216
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,601  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very good.

217
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:34,878  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stay where you are!

218
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:41,033  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, I'm sorry, miss,
I'm afraid you're too late.

219
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:43,029  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was just about to lock the door.

220
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:45,107  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah? Well, I wanna buy a telly.

221
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:47,387  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come back tomorrow. Please.

222
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,943  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'll be closed, won't you?

223
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,941  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

224
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,861  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
For the big day?

225
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:55,536  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Coronation?

226
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:58,562  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. Yes, of course. The big day.

227
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,929  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sure you'll find somewhere
to watch it. Please go.

228
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:08,282  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
Seems to me, half of London's
got a television, since you're
practically giving 'em away.

229
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:11,763  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have my reasons.
And what are they?

230
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,952  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hungry!

231
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,069  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hungry! What's that?

232
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,708  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's just the television.

233
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:25,504  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
One of these modern programmes.

234
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:30,379  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, I really do think you
should leave, right now.

235
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,896  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not until you've
answered my questions.

236
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:36,729  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:416 Y2:523
How come your
televisions are so cheap?
It's my patriotic duty.

237
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:41,528  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Seems only right that as many folk as
possible get to watch the Coronation.

238
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:44,285  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
We may be losing the Empire,
but we can still be proud!

239
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:47,839  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
20 million people they reckon'll
be watching. Imagine that!

240
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:50,359  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
And 20 million people
can't be wrong, eh?

241
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,756  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
So why don't you get yourself home,
and get up early for the big day?

242
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:56,793  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, I'm not leaving till
I've seen everything.

243
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,330  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I need to close.

244
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:03,304  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Magpie. . .

245
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:05,304  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
something's happening out there.

246
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:08,538  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ordinary people are
being struck down and changed,

247
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:12,098  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
and the only new thing
in the house is a television.

248
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:14,612  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your television.

249
00:20:14,652 --> 00:20:18,289  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's going on?

250
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:21,246  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
I knew this would happen.

251
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,578  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
I knew I'd be found out.

252
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,739  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right, then, just you and me.

253
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:41,426  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
You gonna come clean, then?

254
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:44,263  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's really in it for you?
For me?

255
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:46,179  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Perhaps some peace.

256
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,761  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
From what? From her.

257
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:57,125  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
But that's just a woman on the
telly, that's just a programme.
What a pretty little girl.

258
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,166  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
Are you talking to me?

259
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:03,440  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes.
I'm talking to you, little one.

260
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,596  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Unseasonably chilly for the
time of year, don't you think?

261
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:09,713  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you?

262
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:11,313  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm The Wire!

263
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,363  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I am hungry!

264
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,823  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Magpie, help me!

265
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:24,899  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Just think of that audience
tomorrow, my dear, all settling
down to watch the Coronation.

266
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:27,333  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
20 million people.

267
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:30,608  X1:078 X2:489 Y1:416 Y2:523
Things will never be
the same again.
ROSE YELLS

268
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:34,954  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry, so sorry. Help me!

269
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:42,716  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good night, children, everywhere.

270
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:46,115  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Start from the beginning,
tell me everything you know.

271
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,712  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, for starters,

272
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:52,909  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
I know you can't wrap
your hand around your elbow
and make your fingers meet.

273
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:59,583  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Don't get clever with me! You were
there today, at Florizel Street,
and now, breaking into this place.

274
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:02,100  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, you're connected to this,
make no mistake.

275
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,692  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, the thing is,
Detective Inspector Bishop. . .

276
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:10,573  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
How do you know my name?
It's written inside your collar.

277
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:17,203  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bless your mum. But I can't help
thinking, Detective Inspector,

278
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:21,077  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
you're not exactly doing much
detective inspecting, are you?

279
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:27,071  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm doing everything in my power.
You're grabbing the faceless people
and hiding them. Don't tell me.

280
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,031  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Orders from above?

281
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:32,107  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's Coronation day, the eyes
of the world are on London town,

282
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:34,665  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
so any sort of problem
just gets swept out of sight.

283
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:37,301  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
The nation has an image to maintain.

284
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:42,533  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
But doesn't it drive you mad,
doing nothing? Don't you want to
get out there and investigate?

285
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:45,161  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Course I do, but. . .

286
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,288  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
With all the crowds expected,
we haven't got the manpower.

287
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:56,976  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Even if we did, this is beyond
anything we've ever seen.

288
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,722  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
I just don't know any more.

289
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:07,950  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
20 years on the force, and
I don't even know where to start.

290
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,544  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
We haven't the faintest clue
what's going on. Well. . .

291
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,663  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
That could change.

292
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:15,631  X1:316 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
How?

293
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,013  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Start from the beginning.
Tell me everything you know.

294
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,074  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
We started finding them
about a month ago.

295
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:43,910  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Persons left sans visage.
Heads just. . . blank.

296
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,146  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
But is there any sort of pattern?
It's spreading out from North London.

297
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:51,145  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
All over the city -
men, women, kids, grannies.

298
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:56,494  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Only real lead is there's
been quite a large number in. . .
Florizel Street.

299
00:23:56,534 --> 00:24:00,609  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Found another one, sir. Good man,
Crabtree, here we are, Doctor.

300
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:05,128  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Take a good look.
See what you can deduce.

301
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:06,764  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose. . .

302
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:09,522  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know her?

303
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:13,359  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Know her? She's. . .

304
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:17,437  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Found her in the street, apparently,
down by Damascus Road.

305
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:21,153  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just abandoned. That's unusual,
that's the first one in the open. . .

306
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:26,065  X1:078 X2:507 Y1:416 Y2:523
VOICE FADES, THEN RETURNS
. .we'll have Torchwood
on our backs then. . .

307
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:29,263  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
They did what? I'm sorry?

308
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:32,496  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
They left her where? !
Just in the street.

309
00:24:32,536 --> 00:24:35,975  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
In the street?
They left her in the street.

310
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:39,866  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:416 Y2:523
They took her face,
and just chucked her out
and left her in the street.

311
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:45,763  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
And as a result,
that makes things simple.

312
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:49,240  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
Very, very simple.
D'you know why?

313
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:56,153  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
No. . . Because now, Detective
Inspector Bishop, there is no power
on this Earth that can stop me.

314
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:57,836  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on!

315
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:04,562  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
The big day dawns.

316
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:14,055  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've had your fun
with your little doctor.

317
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:18,008  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
But now you're left with me, Rita,
so you'll behave yourself.

318
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:19,566  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
And smile!

319
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:25,523  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Here we go, everyone, here we go!
Grub's up! Grub's up!

320
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:27,879  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tuck in, everyone! Tuck in.
Take a sandwich.

321
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,336  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, here we go,
here we go, it's started!

322
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:34,743  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look, look, take your places,
sit down, sit down.

323
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,507  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rita, love, just look at
that telly-box, then!

324
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:42,665  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Eh, innit marvellous?
The picture's so clear!

325
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:48,575  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ere, Bet, I says to Rita, I says,
"You didn't need to get
your hair done special, love.

326
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:50,668  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
"The Queen won't be able
to see you!"

327
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:56,528  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where's your old Mum, then?
She can't go missing it!

328
00:25:56,568 --> 00:26:01,202  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry, Mum can't make it down.
Aww! Bless her.

329
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:03,961  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe we could pop up
and see her later.

330
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:07,718  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe you could! It's a good idea,
what d'you think, Dad?

331
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:10,435  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe Aunty Betty could go
and see Gran later!

332
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:13,271  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, he loves his Gran, this one.

333
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:17,586  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
Proper little mummy's boy all round.
Ooh, you know what
they say about them !

334
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:22,376  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
Eddie, you want to beat that out of him!
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

335
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,697  X1:078 X2:425 Y1:452 Y2:523
DOORBELL RINGS
I'll get it.

336
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:31,431  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
ON TV: '. .will first appear
in about 10 minutes' time, riding
in the gold coach of state. '

337
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:37,484  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
Tommy. Talk to me. I need
to know exactly what happened
inside your house.

338
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:41,560  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
What the blazes 'd you think you're doing?
I wanna help, dad.
Mr. Connolly...

339
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,240  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
Shut your face, you!
Whoever you are!

340
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,128  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can handle this ourselves!

341
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:53,311  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Listen, you little twerp. You're
hardly out of the bloomin' cradle,

342
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:57,905  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
so I don't expect you to understand.
But I've got a position to maintain.

343
00:26:57,945 --> 00:27:03,259  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
People round here respect me.
It matters what people think.

344
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,147  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that why you did it, Dad?

345
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:09,730  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
What d'you mean? Did what?
You ratted on Gran.

346
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,767  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
How else would the police
know where to look?
Unless some coward told them.

347
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:16,123  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
How dare you? !

348
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:22,757  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
You think I fought a war just
so a mouthy little scum like you
could call me a coward? !

349
00:27:22,797 --> 00:27:27,113  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't get it, do you? You
fought against fascism, remember?

350
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:32,188  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
People telling you how to live. . .
who you could be friends with,
who you could fall in love with!

351
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:35,305  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who could live and who had to die!
Don't you get it?

352
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:39,101  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
You were fighting so that
twerps like me could do what
we want, say what we want.

353
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:44,892  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Now you've become just like them.
You've been informing on everyone,
haven't you? Even Gran.

354
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:48,647  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
All to protect your
precious reputation! Eddie?

355
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:50,886  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that true?

356
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:52,606  X1:078 X2:327 Y1:488 Y2:523
I did it for us, Rita!

357
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:54,881  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
She was filthy.

358
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:57,160  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
A filthy, disgusting thing.

359
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,537  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's my mother!

360
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:05,434  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
All the others you informed on?
All the people in our street?
Our friends?

361
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:07,811  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
I had to.

362
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,665  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
- I. . . I did the right thing.
- The right thing for us?

363
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:16,019  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or for you, Eddie?

364
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:20,536  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
You go, Tommy. Go with
the Doctor and do some good.

365
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:24,173  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get away from this house.
It's poison.

366
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:28,758  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
We've had a ruddy monster
under our roof all right. . .
but it weren't my mother!

367
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,644  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rita!

368
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:33,692  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tommy?

369
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:46,188  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
What was all that, then?
That was. . . That was
the sound of something ending.

370
00:28:46,228 --> 00:28:48,707  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
And about time too.
Everyone all right?

371
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:53,212  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Smashing! Nothing's going
to spoil our big day, is it?

372
00:28:59,892 --> 00:29:04,807  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Tommy, tell me about that night.
The night she changed.
She was just watching the telly.

373
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:08,606  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose said it!
She guessed it straight away!

374
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,323  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
All these aerials in one
little street. How come?

375
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:15,862  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
Bloke up the road. Mr Magpie.
He's selling them cheap.
Is he now? Come on!

376
00:29:16,236 --> 00:29:19,763  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ere! You can't do that. . .
Shop!

377
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:23,352  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you're here,
come out and talk to me!

378
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:26,708  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Magpie! Maybe he's out.
Looks like it.

379
00:29:30,223 --> 00:29:35,581  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, hello. . .This isn't right.
This is very much not right.

380
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:41,408  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tastes like iron. Bakelite. Knocked
together with human hands, yes.

381
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,831  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
But the design itself. . .

382
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,245  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, beautiful work -
that is so simple.

383
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:51,718  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's incredible, it's like
a television. . . but portable. . .

384
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:53,636  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
A portable television!

385
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:56,423  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
And it's not the only
power source in this room.

386
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,612  X1:078 X2:329 Y1:488 Y2:523
VOICES ARE SILENT

387
00:30:09,262 --> 00:30:11,560  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gran!

388
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:26,101  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm on my way.

389
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,555  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do you think you're doing?
I want my friend restored.

390
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:38,070  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
I think that's beyond a little
back street electrician,
so tell me who's in charge!

391
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,788  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yoo-hoo. I think that must be me.

392
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:42,662  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ooh!

393
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:46,500  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
This one's smart as paint!
Is she talking to us?

394
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,854  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you
brought this on yourselves. May I
introduce you to my new. . .friend?

395
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:54,252  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jolly nice to meet you!

396
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:56,851  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God. It's her.
That woman off the telly!

397
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:01,564  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
No. It's just using her image.
What. . . What are you?

398
00:31:01,604 --> 00:31:06,200  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm The Wire! And I will
gobble you up, pretty boy!

399
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,919  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Every last morsel!

400
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:11,917  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
And when I have feasted. . .

401
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:18,027  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I shall regain the corporeal body
which my fellow kind denied me!

402
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:20,226  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good Lord. Colour television!

403
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:23,341  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
So your own people tried
to stop you? They executed me.

404
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,616  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I escaped, in this form.

405
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:28,376  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
And fled across the stars.

406
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:31,118  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
And now, you're trapped
in the television.

407
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:34,249  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not for much longer.

408
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:37,447  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor! Is this what got my Gran?
Yes, Tommy.

409
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:40,524  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
It feeds off the electrical
activity of the brain.

410
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:43,880  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
But it gorges itself like
a great, over-fed pig.

411
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,635  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Taking people's faces,
their essence, as it stuffs itself.
And you let her do it, Magpie.

412
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:54,548  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
I had to. She allowed me my face.
She promised to release me
at the Time of Manifestation.

413
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:57,264  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
What does that mean? !
The appointed time.

414
00:31:57,304 --> 00:31:58,863  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
My crowning glory!

415
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:00,579  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor! The Coronation.

416
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:05,098  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:416 Y2:523
For the first time in
history, millions gathered
around a television set.

417
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:08,772  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you're not strong enough yet,
are you?

418
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:10,771  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can't do it all from here.

419
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:14,966  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's why you need this!
It needs something more powerful.

420
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:18,681  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
This'll turn a big transmitter
into a big receiver.

421
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:20,840  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
What a clever thing you are.

422
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,280  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
But why fret about it?

423
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,754  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why not just relax? Kick off your
shoes and enjoy the Coronation.

424
00:32:26,794 --> 00:32:30,895  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Believe me!
You'll be glued to the screen!

425
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:39,259  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor! Oh, my. . .
Hungry! Hungry!

426
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:44,573  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Wire is hungry!
Oh! This one is tasty!

427
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:48,334  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh!
I'll have lashings of him.

428
00:32:48,374 --> 00:32:51,171  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Delicious!

429
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:53,447  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Armed!

430
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:55,804  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's armed and clever.

431
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:58,386  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Withdraw! Withdraw!

432
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:04,320  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
The box, Magpie, the box!

433
00:33:06,592 --> 00:33:08,890  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold tight!

434
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:14,869  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Conduct me to my victory, Magpie!

435
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:27,191  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hungry! Hungry!

436
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:30,925  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Feed me!

437
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:35,123  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ooh, she's so lovely! Beautiful.

438
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:38,319  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Makes you forget all your troubles!

439
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:41,106  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone all right for pop?

440
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:52,502  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tommy! Wake up! Tommy, come on!
What happened?

441
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,356  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where's Magpie?

442
00:33:55,463 --> 00:33:58,736  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
We don't even know where to
start looking! It's too late.

443
00:33:58,776 --> 00:34:01,213  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's never too late!
As a wise person once said.

444
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:04,251  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Kylie, I think. The Wire's got
big plans. It'll need. . .

445
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,608  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's gonna harvest
half the population!

446
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:10,486  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Millions and millions of people.
And where are we? Muswell Hill.

447
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:14,959  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Muswell Hill! Muswell Hill!
Which means. . .Alexandra Palace!

448
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:17,199  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Biggest TV transmitter
in North London!

449
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,155  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's why it chose this place!
What're you gonna do? !

450
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:22,612  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm going shopping.

451
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:35,075  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
This what you want?

452
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:40,206  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Perfect!
Right, I need one more thing.

453
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:51,425  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Got it! Let's go!

454
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:40,307  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't do this!

455
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,705  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please! Please don't make me. . .

456
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:44,862  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
The time is at hand!

457
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:47,543  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Feed me!

458
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,636  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Feed me!

459
00:35:53,893 --> 00:35:57,090  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
There! Come on!

460
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:02,607  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wait! Where'd we think we're. . . ?
Oh! I'm very sorry, sir!

461
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:05,884  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Shouldn't you be at the Coronation?
They're saving me a seat!

462
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:08,956  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who'd he think you were?
King of Belgium, apparently.

463
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:25,400  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
Keep this switched on. Don't let
anyone stop you, Tommy! Everything
depends on it, you understand?

464
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:45,285  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
You'll get yourself killed up there!
Your Majesty!

465
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:08,721  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
FEED ME!

466
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:38,461  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, feast!

467
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:41,147  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Feasting!

468
00:37:41,187 --> 00:37:43,479  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Wire is feasting!

469
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:53,494  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's too late.

470
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:55,054  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Too late for all of us.

471
00:37:55,094 --> 00:37:57,955  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
I shall consume you, Doctor!

472
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,554  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I won't let you do this, Magpie.
Help me, Doctor!

473
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:08,158  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
It burns!

474
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:12,544  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
It took my face. My soul!

475
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,942  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
You cannot stop The Wire.

476
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:18,105  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Soon I shall become manifest.

477
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,096  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
No more. No more of this.

478
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:25,492  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
You promised me peace!

479
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:28,893  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then peace you shall have.

480
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,848  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Aaargh!

481
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:35,409  X1:078 X2:357 Y1:488 Y2:523
MANIACAL LAUGHTER

482
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:41,209  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Been burning the candle
at both ends?

483
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:43,435  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've over-extended
yourself, missus.

484
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:46,427  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
You shouldn't have had a crack
at poor old Magpie there.

485
00:38:52,515 --> 00:38:55,700  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rubber soles. Swear by 'em !

486
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:08,176  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, dear. Has our little plan gone
horribly wrong, Doctor?

487
00:39:30,423 --> 00:39:33,051  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
No-o-o-o!

488
00:39:42,891 --> 00:39:44,688  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No!

489
00:39:44,728 --> 00:39:48,644  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's close down, I'm afraid,
and no epilogue.

490
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:50,862  X1:078 X2:269 Y1:488 Y2:523
LOUD SCREAM

491
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,157  X1:078 X2:309 Y1:488 Y2:523
EXCITED CHATTER

492
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:12,019  X1:078 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
NATIONAL ANTHEM ON TV

493
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:14,698  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
What have I missed?
Doctor! What happened?

494
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:18,225  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorted.
Electrical creature. TV technology.

495
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:21,728  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Clever alien life-form -
that's me, by the way.

496
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:27,127  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
I turned the receiver
back into a transmitter, then
I trapped The Wire in here.

497
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:30,972  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I just invented
the home video 30 years early.

498
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,077  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Betamax!

499
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:35,832  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, look!

500
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:37,675  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
God Save The Queen, eh?

501
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:46,527  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
# God save the Queen. . . #

502
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,293  X1:078 X2:349 Y1:452 Y2:523
HUGE CHEER
FROM CROWD ON TV

503
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:03,910  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's my grandson!

504
00:41:24,912 --> 00:41:28,507  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
This was never your house -
it's in my mother's name.

505
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:32,016  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
And on her behalf,
I'm telling you. . .

506
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,234  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Out!

507
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,578  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
We could go down the Mall.
Join in with the crowds.

508
00:42:06,618 --> 00:42:09,055  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nah, that's just
pomp and circumstance.

509
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:14,090  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is history, right here.
The domestic approach. Exactly.

510
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,045  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Will it. . . ? That thing. . .
Is it trapped for good?

511
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:20,606  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
On video? Hope so.
Just to be on the safe side

512
00:42:20,646 --> 00:42:24,089  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'll use my knowledge
of trans-temporal
extirpation methods

513
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:27,277  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
to neutralise the residual
electronic pattern. You what?

514
00:42:27,317 --> 00:42:30,389  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm gonna tape over over it.
Leave it with me,
I'm always doing that!

515
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:33,268  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tommy, you can have the scooter.
Little present.

516
00:42:33,308 --> 00:42:36,192  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Best, em, keep it in the garage
for a few years, though.

517
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:40,295  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good riddance.

518
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:47,183  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is that it, then, Tommy?
New monarch, new age, new world.

519
00:42:47,223 --> 00:42:49,292  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
No room for a man
like Eddie Connolly?

520
00:42:49,332 --> 00:42:51,305  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's right. He deserves it.

521
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:55,446  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tommy. Go after him.

522
00:42:55,486 --> 00:42:57,206  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
What for?

523
00:42:57,246 --> 00:42:59,490  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's your dad. He's an idiot.

524
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,641  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Course he is.
Like I said, he's your Dad.

525
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,881  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you're clever.

526
00:43:04,921 --> 00:43:10,740  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Clever enough to save the world.
So don't stop there. Go on.

527
00:43:48,948 --> 00:43:52,020  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:080 Y2:151
We're beyond the reach
of the Tardis's knowledge!

528
00:43:55,142 --> 00:43:59,026  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
This writing is old!
Impossibly old!

529
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:02,654  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
People! Look at that - real people.
That's us! Hooray!

530
00:44:02,694 --> 00:44:05,407  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
The beast and his armies
shall rise from the pit. . .

531
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:11,653  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Whatever it is, it's not
a natural phenomenon. We could
revolutionise modern science.

532
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:15,134  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
We could use it to fuel the empire.
Or start a war.

533
00:44:15,685 --> 00:44:19,200  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's a black hole.
But that's impossible!

534
00:44:37,938 --> 00:44:44,400  X1:162 X2:604 Y1:452 Y2:523
