1
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:12,352  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:344 Y2:415
The prototype has
passed every test, sir.

2
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:14,025  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:380 Y2:415
It's working.

3
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:16,503  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I hardly think "working"

4
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:18,107  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
is the correct word.

5
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:24,774  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
That would apply only to machines.

6
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:28,221  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry. I should say "it's alive".

7
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:32,808  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can it hear me?
It might still be in shock.

8
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:35,925  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bear in mind the brain has
been welded to the exoskeleton.

9
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:38,962  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Skin of metal. . .

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,432  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
. .and a body
that will never age or die.

11
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:51,384  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I envy it. Do you know me?

12
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:53,345  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Answer.

13
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:55,661  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you know me?

14
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:58,983  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are John Lumic.

15
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,016  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
My child.

16
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:04,852  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mark this day, Dr Kendrick.

17
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:06,809  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are blessed.

18
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:10,447  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, it's not quite over yet, sir.
We need Geneva's approval.

19
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:15,284  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Technically, this is a new
form of life, and that
contravenes the Bio-Convention.

20
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:18,797  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
They need to ratify this.
And they will refuse me.

21
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:20,595  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nonetheless, we need to tell them.

22
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:24,871  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
And if I don't? Well, I'm sorry,
sir, but it's my duty.

23
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:26,786  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I shall have to inform them.

24
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:31,462  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
And how will you do that
from beyond the grave?

25
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:33,822  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't quite understand.

26
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:36,279  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Kill him.

27
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:47,608  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Captain! Yes, sir?

28
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:50,125  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Inform all staff,

29
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:53,202  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
we have a new destination.

30
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:56,524  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Set sail for Great Britain!

31
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,794  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:308 Y2:379
The munchkin lady with the big eyes.
Remember how she looked at you?

32
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,672  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:308 Y2:379
Then she opens her mouth
and fire comes out!

33
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,232  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:380 Y2:415
I thought I was gonna get frazzled!

34
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:43,787  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:308 Y2:379
Yeah, one minute she's
standing there, next minute, roar!

35
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:45,623  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where was that, then? What happened?

36
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:48,141  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, it was on this. . .

37
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,617  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
this planet thing, asteroid. It's
a long story, you had to be there.

38
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:54,055  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um. . . What are you doing that for?

39
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:55,614  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos you told me to.

40
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:57,931  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
When was that?

41
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,809  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
About half an hour ago.

42
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,870  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um. . . You can let go now.

43
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,042  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, how long's it been
since I could've stopped?

44
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:10,919  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
10 minutes. 20. . .

45
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,677  X1:332 X2:387 Y1:488 Y2:523
29.

46
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:15,274  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
You just forgot me!
No, no, no, I was just. . . I was. . .

47
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:18,994  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was calibrating. I was just. . .
No, I know exactly what I'm doing.

48
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:33,933  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's happened?
The time vortex, it's gone!

49
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:36,151  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's impossible, it's just gone!

50
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,909  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Brace yourself! We're gonna crash!

51
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,598  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone all right? Rose? Mickey?

52
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:51,281  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm fine. I'm OK, sorry, yeah.

53
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,992  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's dead.

54
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:02,023  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Tardis is dead.

55
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:03,900  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can fix it.

56
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,258  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's nothing to fix.

57
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:07,782  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's perished.

58
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:16,049  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
The last Tardis in the universe,
extinct.

59
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,806  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can get help, yeah?

60
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:20,803  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where from?

61
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,244  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, we've landed, we've got to be
somewhere. We fell out of the Vortex.

62
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:26,087  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Through the Void, into nothingness.

63
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:31,075  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're in some sort of no-place.

64
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:33,829  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Silent Realm.

65
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:36,741  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Lost Dimension.
Otherwise known as London.

66
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:42,699  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
London, England, Earth.

67
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,223  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold on.

68
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,254  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
The 1st of February, this year.

69
00:04:49,294 --> 00:04:50,850  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not exactly far flung, is it?

70
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,655  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
So this is London? Yup.

71
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:56,047  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Your city? That's the one.
Just as we left it? Bang on.

72
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,140  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
And that includes the zeppelins?

73
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,199  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell? !

74
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:05,598  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's beautiful.

75
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,596  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, so it's London with a big
International Zeppelin Festival.

76
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:11,590  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is not your world.

77
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,784  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
But if the date's the same. . .

78
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:16,584  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's parallel, right?

79
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:18,664  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Am I right? Like a parallel
Earth where they've got zeppelins?

80
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:20,779  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Am I right? I'm right, aren't I?
Must be.

81
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,378  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, a parallel world where. . . Oh,
come on! You've seen it on films.

82
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:27,732  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's like an alternative to our
world, where everything's the
same, but a little bit different.

83
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:32,897  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Like, I dunno, traffic lights are
blue, Tony Blair never got elected.
And he's still alive.

84
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,909  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
A parallel world and
my dad's still alive.

85
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,517  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't look at it, Rose. Don't even
think about it. It's not your world.

86
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:46,475  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
But he's my dad. And. . .

87
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:49,469  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Trust me on this. '

88
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,386  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, that's weird.

89
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:53,986  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
But he's real. . . 'Trust me on this. '

90
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:58,859  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
He's a success. He was always
planning these daft little schemes,
health food drinks and stuff.

91
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,661  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone said they were useless.

92
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:04,335  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
But he did it. Rose. If you ever
trusted me, then listen to me now.

93
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,291  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop looking at him.

94
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:10,647  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
Your father's dead, he died
when you were six months old. That's
not your Pete, that is a Pete.

95
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,485  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
And for all we know he's got
his own Jackie, his own Rose.

96
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:17,242  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
His own daughter, who's
someone else, but not you.

97
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:20,757  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can't see him. Not ever.

98
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,157  X1:368 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Trust me on this.
Trust me on this. '

99
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:26,069  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Trust me on this.
Trust me on this. '

100
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:55,681  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello? Sweetheart?

101
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:57,838  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Only me.

102
00:06:57,878 --> 00:07:00,632  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, the bad penny.
Was this your idea?

103
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:03,839  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't deny it, it's got your
fingerprints all over it.

104
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,066  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
"Trust me on this!"
Oh, I can trust you, all right.

105
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:10,207  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Trust you to cock it up!
What have I done now? Have a look!

106
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:20,774  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's wrong with that? 40!

107
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:23,131  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
It says 40! You ARE 40.

108
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:25,608  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't want the whole
world telling, do I?

109
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:28,245  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're having a party tonight.
My 39th!

110
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:31,563  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
My official biography
says I was born on the same day
as Cuba Gooding Junior,

111
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:35,438  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
and that makes
me 39, thank you very much. Rose!

112
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:38,681  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come here! Rose!

113
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:41,751  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
These are from the
girls in the office.

114
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,387  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Happy birthday.

115
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:49,582  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
I've got hand-sculpted arrangements
by Veronica of Reykjavik, and your
secretary stopped off at a garage?

116
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:53,179  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't think so.
And if you're giving out
presents, where's my zeppelin?

117
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,816  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone else has got one. Rose!

118
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,456  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, Rose!

119
00:07:57,496 --> 00:07:59,613  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look, you didn't even notice,
did you? Special delivery.

120
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:02,049  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Got sent round today.

121
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:08,444  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:416 Y2:523
Birthday present from Mr Lumic.
Latest model, diamond studded. They
pick up signals from Venezuela.

122
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:10,801  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why would you want to pick
up signals from Venezuela?

123
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:13,558  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I don't know!
But now I can find out!

124
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,242  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, for God's sake, where is she?
Rose!

125
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:18,750  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
She needs a good bath before
tonight or she's gonna be honking.

126
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,115  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose! Come to Mummy! Come on!

127
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:23,746  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
There you are, my darling!

128
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,223  X1:078 X2:263 Y1:488 Y2:523
PHONE RINGS

129
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:31,058  X1:078 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Lumic! Jackie was just saying
thank you, that's very kind of you.

130
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:36,455  X1:078 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Those ear pods are hand made. Tell
her to take care. Course I will.

131
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:41,368  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Um, I don't suppose you'll be
joining us tonight for the party?
We'd be very honoured.

132
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:44,892  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
The world below can party,
some of us have work to do.

133
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:49,640  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
My plans have advanced, Peter. The
President has promised a decision.

134
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,111  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm flying in now. We'll be at the
airstrip by five o'clock. Right.

135
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:58,067  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's just that I promised
I'd help the wife out tonight.

136
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:01,825  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
If the President of Great Britain
can make this meeting,
then so can you.

137
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:03,662  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
I dunno, he's not
married to Jackie, is he?

138
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,939  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Five o'clock, Mr Tyler.

139
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,497  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
A famous day!

140
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:14,774  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Voiceprint access, John Lumic.

141
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:17,481  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Initiate ear pod override.

142
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:21,720  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Subject, Jacqueline Tyler.

Tyler residence, February 1st.

146
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:36,430  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Give me security
arrangements for tonight.

147
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,547  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523

148
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:51,322  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
And restore.

149
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,901  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you, Mrs Tyler.

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,834  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Crane? Mr Lumic.

152
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:10,398  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Events are moving
faster than I anticipated.

153
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:14,389  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
I need extra staff. Very good, sir.

154
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:16,357  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
I shall go on a recruitment drive.

155
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,512  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Back her up.

156
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,291  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
I told you to keep an eye on her!

157
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,495  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
She's all right.
She goes wandering off!

158
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:36,208  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
A parallel world, it's
like a gingerbread house!

159
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:38,086  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
All those temptations, calling her.

160
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:40,601  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, so it's just Rose, then? There's
nothing out there to tempt me?

161
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:45,599  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Well, I don't know, I
can't worry about everything! If I
could just get this thing to. . .

162
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,033  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did that help? Yes. Did that hurt?

163
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:49,557  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. Ow.

164
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:31,785  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
And it's good news for Great Britain,
as John Lumic returns to the
country of his birth.

165
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:36,820  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mr Lumic,
the inventor of High Content Metal,
has denied allegations of ill-health.

166
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,500  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're all flesh and blood.

167
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,094  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
But the brain
is what makes us human.

168
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,494  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
And my mind
is more creative than ever!

169
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:48,975  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
'With shares in Cybus Industries
doubling in price, Mr Lumic. . . '

170
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:58,635  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
'In other news. . . The Torchwood
Institute has published
a study, claiming that male. . . '

171
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:01,192  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're not meant to be here.

172
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:04,911  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
The Tardis draws its power
out of the universe, but
it's the wrong universe.

173
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:08,467  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's like diesel in a petrol engine.

174
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:13,822  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
But I've seen it in comics, people
go hopping from one alternative
world to another. It's easy!

175
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:15,426  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not in the real world.

176
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:19,375  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Used to be easy.
When the Time Lords kept their eye

177
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:23,893  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
on everything, you could pop between
realities, home in time for tea.

178
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:26,350  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then they died and
took at all with them.

179
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:30,924  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
The walls of reality closed.
The worlds were sealed.

180
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:35,478  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everything became that bit less
kind. Then how did we get here?

181
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:39,637  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know. Accident?

182
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,219  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Should've been impossible,
now we're trapped.

183
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,143  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's that?

184
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:49,744  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

185
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:51,962  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
That, there. Is that a reflection?

186
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:58,574  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a light!
Is it? Is that a light?

187
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:02,934  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think that's a light,
that's all we need! We've got power!

188
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:05,232  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey, we've got power! Ha!

189
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:14,517  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

190
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:20,352  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I beg your attention. Christmas
has come early, so come and get it.

191
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:23,267  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, smell that, comrades.

192
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:28,586  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Burgers and chips, sausage and beans,
pork, chicken and hot sweet tea.

193
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,419  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
All for free!

194
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,859  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't go! But there's food.

195
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,056  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
All you can eat, free of charge!

196
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:38,615  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't just stand there,
fill your faces with pasties, pies. . .

197
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:40,575  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're lying. Easy for you to say.

198
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,647  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
When did you last starve?

199
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,488  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
All those people,
disappearing off the streets.

200
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:47,604  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's been going on for months.

201
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:49,238  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's them.

202
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,519  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're taking you away. What for?

203
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,193  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Experiments.

204
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,353  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
But hurry now, charity can't sleep. . .

205
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:58,509  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm so hungry.

206
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:00,386  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, come and get it while it's hot!

207
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:04,822  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's it, kind sir!
Get in there and fill your face!

208
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:06,940  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Feast yourself brother,

209
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,941  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
feast yourself.

210
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,672  X1:078 X2:461 Y1:452 Y2:523
SHRIEKS AND CRIES
Take 'em away.

211
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:17,973  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's alive!

212
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:20,849  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is it? Nothing, it's tiny.
It's one of those

213
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:23,486  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
insignificant little power cells
that no-one ever bothers about.

214
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:25,319  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
And it's clinging on to life!

215
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:28,160  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's got one little ounce of
reality, tucked away inside.

216
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,034  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Enough to get us home? Not yet.

217
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:33,638  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
I need to charge it up.

218
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:37,188  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
We could go outside and lash
it up to the National Grid.

219
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:39,909  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wrong sort of energy.
It's got to come from our universe.

220
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:42,525  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
But we don't have anything.
There's me.

221
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:53,814  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
I just gave away
ten years of my life.

222
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:56,146  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Worth every second.

223
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:07,275  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's going out, is that OK?

224
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,275  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's on a recharging cycle.

225
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:12,949  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
It'll loop round, power back up
and be ready to take us home in. . .

226
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:15,349  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ooh, 24 hours.

227
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,667  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
So that gives us 24
hours on a parallel world.

228
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:21,064  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Shore leave. So long as we keep
our heads down, easy. No problem.

229
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:22,780  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's go and tell her.

230
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,657  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
There you are! It's all right,
no applause, I fixed it.

231
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,716  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
24 hours and then we're
flying back to reality.

232
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:35,249  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it?

233
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,125  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
My phone connected.

234
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:40,481  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's this Cybus network,
it finds your phone.

235
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:44,917  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
And it gave me internet access.

236
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:49,271  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, whatever it says,
this is the wrong world.

237
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:53,029  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't exist. What do you mean?
There's no Rose Tyler.

238
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:55,105  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was never born.

239
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:57,104  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's Pete, my dad, and Jackie.

240
00:15:57,144 --> 00:16:01,279  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
He still married Mum. But they never
had kids. Give me that phone.

241
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,340  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're rich.

242
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,390  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
They've got a house and
cars and everything they want.

243
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:12,748  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
But they haven't got me.

244
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:19,119  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got to see 'em.

245
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,236  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
You can't. I just want to see 'em.
I can't let you.
You just said 24 hours!

246
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,674  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
You can't
become their daughter, that's not
the way it works. Mickey, tell her.

247
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:31,308  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
24 hours, yeah? Where are you going?
Well, I can do what I want.

248
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:34,024  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got the address and everything,
Stay where you are, both of you!

249
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:38,502  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come back! Mickey, come back here,
right now! I just want to see them.

250
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,018  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got things to see an' all.

251
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:43,056  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Like what? Well, you don't
know anything about me, do you?

252
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:45,214  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's all about Rose.
I'm just the spare part.

253
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,047  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry, I've got to go.

254
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:52,886  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Go on then.
There's no choice, is there?

255
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,958  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can only chase after one of us.
It's never gonna be me, is it?

256
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:03,674  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Back here, 24 hours. Yeah.

257
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:05,767  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
If I haven't found something better.

258
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,641  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mr Tyler, what's the matter?
Couldn't wait until tonight?
Mr President, honoured.

259
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,521  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm on the fast-track programme.

260
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:36,635  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cybus Industries have
bought up my company,
so I'm part of the firm now.

261
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:39,354  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Some people say they've
bought my government.

262
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:40,954  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've never heard anybody say that.

263
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,230  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Never.

264
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,908  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can trust me on this.
I tried your drink, that Vitex stuff.

265
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:50,665  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
It tastes like pop. Well, it is pop.

266
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:54,619  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
You made money by selling a health
food drink to a sick world.

267
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:58,271  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not quite the ordinary Joe
you appear to be, are you?

268
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:04,369  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
He does like to keep us waiting.

269
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:10,240  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
But tell me, you've had a chance to
observe John Lumic more than most.

270
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,598  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's your opinion?

271
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:15,874  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's very sharp, I'd say.
Sharp as ever.

272
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:18,872  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very clever man. Brilliant, in fact.

273
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:20,909  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then you don't think he's insane?

274
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:25,994  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's not the word I
would've used, no. I see.

275
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:37,759  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I see your ID, please?

276
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:42,740  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, that's in order.

277
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:50,720  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Am I all right to get past?
Yeah, no bother.

278
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,520  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Curfew doesn't start till ten.

279
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,194  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's a curfew? Course there is.

280
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,550  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where've you been living, mate?
Up there with the toffs?

281
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,956  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wish.

282
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:07,037  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
See ya.

283
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,306  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey's mum just couldn't cope.

284
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,444  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
His dad hung around for a while, but
then he just sort of wandered off.

285
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:26,241  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
He was brought up by his gran.

286
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:29,598  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
She was such a great woman.

287
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:32,793  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
God, she used to slap him !

288
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,513  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
But then she died.

289
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:36,870  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
She tripped and fell down the stairs.

290
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,867  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was about five years ago
now, I was still in school.

291
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:43,944  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
I never knew. Well, you never asked.
You never said.

292
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,220  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's Mickey.

293
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,818  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
I suppose I. . .

294
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:50,446  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
We just take him for granted.

295
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,892  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you think she's alive, his gran?
Could be.

296
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:57,809  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Like I said, parallel world,
gingerbread house.

297
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:00,003  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
We need to get out
here as fast as we can.

298
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:02,710  X1:078 X2:317 Y1:488 Y2:523
TWO-TONE BEEPS

299
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,955  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are they all doing?

300
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:10,604  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
They've stopped.

301
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:29,865  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the earpieces.

302
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:35,571  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Like Bluetooth attachments, but
everyone's connected together.

303
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,124  X1:078 X2:265 Y1:488 Y2:523
PHONE BEEPS

304
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:42,119  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's on my phone. It's
automatic, look. It's downloading.

305
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,576  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that what they're all getting?

306
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:51,233  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
News, international news,
sport, weather.

307
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:53,470  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
They get it direct.

308
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,106  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Downloaded right into their heads.

309
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:58,584  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
TV schedules, lottery numbers.

310
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,166  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everyone shares the
same information.

311
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,926  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
"The Daily Download,
published by Cybus Industries. "

312
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:17,763  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
You lot, you're obsessed. You'll
do anything for the latest upgrade.

313
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:20,641  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oi, they're not my lot.
Different world, remember?

314
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:23,718  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's not so far off your world,
this place is only parallel.

315
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,398  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ooh, look at that.

316
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:30,351  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cybus Industries,
owners of just about every company
in Britain, including Vitex.

317
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:34,367  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Pete Tyler's very well connected.

318
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:42,689  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, I give up. Let's go and see him.

319
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,555  X1:102 X2:337 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's that there?

320
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:06,871  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who is it? I know you're there.

321
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:10,828  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Shame on you, tricking an old lady.
I've got nothing worth stealing.

322
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:14,504  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
And don't think I'm gonna disappear,
you're not gonna take me!

323
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:15,983  X1:334 X2:385 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hi.

324
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:20,338  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that you?

325
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:22,335  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's me. I came home.

326
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,053  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ricky? It's Mickey.

327
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,372  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know my own grandson's name,

328
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,773  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
it's Ricky. Now come here.

329
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,398  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK. I'm Ricky.

330
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,878  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Course I am. Ricky, that's me.

331
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:41,556  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
You stupid boy! Ow!
Where've you been?

332
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:43,311  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop hitting me!

333
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:48,665  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's been days and days!
I keep hearing all these stories,
people disappearing off the street.

334
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,619  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's nothing official on
the download. But there's all
these rumours and whispers.

335
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,137  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought they'd gone
and disappeared you!

336
00:22:57,177 --> 00:23:01,134  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
That carpet on the stairs, I told
you to get it fixed. You're gonna. . .

337
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:04,331  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
fall and break your neck.
Well, you get it fixed for me!

338
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:06,086  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I should've done, way back.

339
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:09,842  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Guess I'm just kind of useless.
Now, I never said that.

340
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:11,880  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am though.

341
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,079  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I'm sorry, Gran. I'm so sorry.

342
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,714  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't talk like that. Do you know
what you need?

343
00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:21,514  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
A nice sit down and a cup of tea.

344
00:23:21,554 --> 00:23:25,147  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
You got time? For you, I've got
all the time in the world.

345
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:28,705  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, you say that,
but you're all talk.

346
00:23:28,745 --> 00:23:32,819  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's those new friends of yours,
I don't trust them.

347
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:35,699  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
What friends are they?
Don't pretend you don't know.

348
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:38,416  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've been seen, Mrs Chan told me.

349
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:42,567  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Driving about, all helter-skelter
in that van. What van's that then?

350
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,407  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know full well.

351
00:23:44,447 --> 00:23:47,808  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't play games with me, now
get inside!

352
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:54,387  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've been looking for you
everywhere! Ricky?

353
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,590  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ricky?

354
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,549  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ricky, you were the one who told us.

355
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:05,147  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't contact your family,
cos it puts them in danger.

356
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:06,703  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. Ricky said that.

357
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:08,223  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Course I did, just testing.

358
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:10,420  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
I saw them, I taped them.

359
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,978  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
They went round Blackfriars,
gathering up the homeless
like the Child Catcher.

360
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:20,049  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
They must have took four dozen.
The vans were hired out to a company
called International Electromatics.

361
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:22,325  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I did a protocol search.

362
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:25,683  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Turns out that's a dummy
company established by, guess who?

363
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:27,523  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know, who?

364
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:29,520  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cybus Industries!

365
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,317  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, now we've got evidence!

366
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:33,914  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bad news is, they've
arrested Thin Jimmy.

367
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:35,554  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
So that just leaves you.

368
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:38,551  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Leaves me what? The number one.

369
00:24:38,591 --> 00:24:42,226  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Top of the list,
London's most wanted.

370
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:44,945  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, cool.

371
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,942  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Say that again.

372
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:51,297  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
The most precious thing on
this earth is the human brain
and yet we allow it to die.

373
00:24:51,337 --> 00:24:55,249  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
But now, Cybus Industries has
perfected a way of sustaining

374
00:24:55,289 --> 00:25:00,008  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
the brain indefinitely, within a
cradle of copyrighted chemicals.

375
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:05,959  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
The latest advances
in synapse research allows
cyberkinetic impulses

376
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:08,359  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
to be bonded
onto a metal exoskeleton.

377
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,755  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is the ultimate upgrade.

378
00:25:10,795 --> 00:25:14,592  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Our greatest step into cyberspace.
I'm sorry,

379
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:16,629  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
could we stop at that?

380
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:22,304  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't need the pitch.
I think we all know what this
ultimate upgrade entails.

381
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:25,981  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I'm here to tell you, John,
the answer is no.

382
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:30,375  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
My government does not
give you permission.

383
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:32,972  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I think no government ever will.

384
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:35,929  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've prepared a
paper for the Ethical Committee.

385
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:40,442  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, come on! It's not just unethical,
it's obscene.

386
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:44,080  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr President,
if I might make a personal plea.

387
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,876  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am dying, sir.

388
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,795  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm aware of that.

389
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:49,515  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I'm very sorry.

390
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:52,871  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Without this project,
you have condemned me.

391
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:57,386  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
My inventions have advanced
this whole planet.

392
00:25:57,426 --> 00:25:59,745  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Would you have all that perish?

393
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:02,183  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're a fine businessman, John.

394
00:26:02,223 --> 00:26:03,901  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you're not God.

395
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:09,263  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm really very sorry, but
I think we should end it there.

396
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:13,967  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Tyler, I'll see you tonight.

397
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,727  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think we could all do with a drink.

398
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:18,594  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Lumic.

399
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:31,430  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
Still, it's not the
only country in the world.
There's always New Germany.

400
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,027  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is the homeland.

401
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:35,467  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
My birthplace.

402
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:38,095  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
You may leave. Thank you, sir.

403
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,855  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Crane!

404
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,409  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ready and waiting, sir.
Did the override work?

405
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:51,447  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, needs a bit of fine tuning.

406
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:54,406  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
We weren't exactly delicate,
given the rush. But, yeah, yeah.

407
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,963  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's all working.

408
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:59,306  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've been testing the system, sir.

409
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:05,554  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
They've
grafted on a treat, these have.

410
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:07,871  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Given a little persuasion.

411
00:27:07,911 --> 00:27:09,884  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
If you'd care to observe, sir.

412
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:15,099  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
A-a-and, turn to the right.

413
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,540  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
A-a-a-and, back to the left.

414
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,457  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you having fun, Mr Crane?

415
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:24,451  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, no. Not at all, sir, no.

416
00:27:24,491 --> 00:27:27,212  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's just. . .well, it's irresistible.

417
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:30,604  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then resist. And start the Upgrade.

418
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:33,922  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did we get permission? I am governed
by greater laws, old friend.

419
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:37,440  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
The right of a man to survive.

420
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,998  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now begin.

421
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:44,791  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
And turn to the left.

422
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,520  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Forward march.

425
00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:57,421  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Give us track number 19.

437
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,173  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's a light on.
There's someone inside the base.

438
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:40,300  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mrs Moore, we've got visitors.

439
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:47,925  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
One, two, three.

440
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:49,764  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go!

441
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:53,519  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell are you doing?

442
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,116  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you doing there?

443
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:57,903  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
What am I doing here?

444
00:28:59,752 --> 00:29:01,606  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
What am I doing there?

00:29:09,065 --> 00:29:10,942  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
They've got visitors.

446
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:14,893  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
February 1st. Mum's birthday.

447
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:18,293  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Even in a parallel universe,
she still loves a party.

448
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,450  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, given Pete Tyler's guest
list, I wouldn't mind a look.

449
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,967  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
And there is one guaranteed
way of getting inside.

450
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:26,913  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:488 Y2:523
Psychic paper! Who do you want to be?

451
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,709  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
We could've been anyone.
It got us in, didn't it?

452
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:45,623  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're in charge of the psychic
paper, we could've been guests.

453
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:48,220  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Celebrities, Sir Doctor, Dame Rose.

454
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,740  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
We end up serving.

455
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,094  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
I did enough of this back home.

456
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:55,245  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you want to know what's
going on, work in the kitchens.

457
00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:03,484  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
According to Lucy,
that man over there. . . Who's Lucy?

458
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:06,523  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's carrying the salmon pinwheels.

459
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:08,519  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, that's Lucy, is it?

460
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,354  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah. Lucy says, that
is the President of Great Britain.

461
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,830  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
What, there's a President,
not a Prime Minister? Seems so.

462
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,788  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or maybe Lucy's just a bit thick.

463
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,142  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse me, thank you very much.

464
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:29,656  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thank you. If I could have
your attention, please.

465
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:32,773  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Go on, Pete,
about time you did some work!

466
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:34,627  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought you liked 'em young?

467
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:42,562  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'd like to say thank you to you all
for coming, on this
very special occasion.

468
00:30:42,602 --> 00:30:45,201  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
My wife's 39th.

469
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:47,878  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't believe that one!

470
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:50,156  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Trust me on this. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

471
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,112  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, without any
further ado, here she is.

472
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:57,550  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
The birthday girl,
my lovely wife, Jackie Tyler.

473
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,337  X1:078 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
THEY APPLAUD AND CHEER

474
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,571  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, I'm not giving a speech. That's
what my parties are famous for.

475
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:14,986  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
No work, no politics,
just a few good mates
and plenty of black-market whisky.

476
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,523  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Pardon me, Mr President! So, yeah.

477
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:21,600  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get on with it, enjoy, enjoy!

478
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,411  X1:078 X2:421 Y1:452 Y2:523
APPLAUSE
CAMERA SHUTTERS WHIRR

479
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:30,034  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can't stay, even if there
was some way of telling them.

480
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:31,715  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Of course I can't.

481
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:34,188  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've still got Mum
at home, my real mum.

482
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:36,281  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
I couldn't just leave her, could I?
It's just. . .

483
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:41,262  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
They've got each other.

484
00:31:41,302 --> 00:31:45,107  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mum's got no-one.
She's got you, those two haven't.

485
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:49,331  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
All these different worlds,
not one of them gets it right.

486
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:52,732  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose! Here's my little girl!

487
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:56,044  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come to Mummy, come to Mummy!
Good girl!

488
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:58,467  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good girl, aren't you?

489
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,136  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry.

490
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:15,302  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Platoon zero-two now boarding.
Platoon zero-two now boarding. '

491
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:20,858  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop staring. But what are they, sir?

492
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,498  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm told they're the future.

493
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:25,253  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ain't technology wonderful?

494
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:28,050  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go on, get to the cab, start her up.

495
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,966  X1:078 X2:389 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sir.
MOBILE RINGS

496
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:34,683  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Crane. . .are we mobile?

497
00:32:34,723 --> 00:32:37,680  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just about to hit the road, sir.
And yourself?

498
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,637  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am arriving, Mr Crane.

499
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:42,555  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Prepare the factory.

500
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:45,475  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now send them forth, old friend.

501
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:47,033  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let the good work begin.

502
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:04,330  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's clean. No bugs.

503
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,408  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is off the scale. He's flesh
and blood. How did that happen?

504
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:12,801  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, it could be that Cybus
Industries have perfected

505
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:17,272  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
the science of human cloning,
or your father had a bike.

506
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:24,433  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
And your name's Mickey, not Ricky?

507
00:33:24,473 --> 00:33:25,911  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey.

508
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:29,508  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
My dad was Jackson Smith,
he used to work at the key
cutter's on Clifton's Parade.

509
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:31,112  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
He went to Spain, never came back.

510
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,947  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
But that's my dad.

511
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,535  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
So. . .we're brothers?

512
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:41,574  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Be fair, what else could it be?

513
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:43,337  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know. . .

514
00:33:44,847 --> 00:33:49,123  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
But he doesn't just look like
me, he is exactly the same.

515
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:54,321  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Something else is going on here,
Jake. So who are you lot? We. . .

516
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:56,118  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are the Preachers.

517
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:58,034  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
As in Gospel Truth.

518
00:33:58,074 --> 00:33:59,632  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
You see?

519
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:05,468  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
No Ear Pods. While rest of the world
downloads from Cybus Industries,

520
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:11,361  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
we have got freedom. You're talking
to London's most wanted.

521
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,613  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
But target number one is Lumic,
and we are going to bring him down.

522
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:18,911  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
From your kitchen?

523
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:23,846  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have you got a problem with that?

524
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:25,859  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, it's a good kitchen.

525
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:29,720  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's an upload from Gemini.

526
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,120  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's Gemini? The vans are back.

527
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,877  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're moving out of Battersea.

528
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:36,394  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
It looks like Gemini was right,

529
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:38,234  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Lumic's finally making a move.

530
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:43,399  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then we are right behind him.
Pack up, we're leaving.

531
00:35:42,403 --> 00:35:44,451  X1:078 X2:247 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE LAUGHS

532
00:35:48,997 --> 00:35:53,554  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
I remember her 21st,
a pint of cider in the George.

533
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:56,630  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry. . .champagne?

534
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,212  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Might as well, I'm paying for it.

535
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,979  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
A big night for you.

536
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:04,980  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
For her.

537
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,216  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Still, she's happy.

538
00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:09,933  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
She should be. Great party.

539
00:36:09,973 --> 00:36:12,170  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you think?

540
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,090  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can trust me!

541
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,567  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
"You can trust me on this!"
That's it, sorry, yeah.

542
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:21,802  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, erm. . . how long have
you two been married?

543
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:23,721  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
20 years.

544
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,718  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
No kids or. . . ?

545
00:36:25,758 --> 00:36:28,016  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
We kept putting it off.

546
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:31,892  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
She said she didn't
want to spoil her figure.

547
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,187  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not too late, she's only 40. 39.

548
00:36:37,227 --> 00:36:38,905  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right, 39.

549
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:42,938  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's still too late.

550
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:46,135  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I moved out last month.

551
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:48,968  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
But we're gonna keep it quiet,
you know, it's bad for business.

552
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:56,487  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why am I telling you all this?
We haven't met before, have we?

553
00:36:56,527 --> 00:36:59,149  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know, you just
seem sort of. . . What?

554
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,048  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know, just sort of. . .

555
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,846  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
right.

556
00:37:08,872 --> 00:37:12,319  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Stevie, how's things?
How's it going at Torchwood?

557
00:37:17,342 --> 00:37:20,817  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't what they're doing,
but this seems to be the target.

558
00:37:20,857 --> 00:37:22,457  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Big house, fair bit of money.

559
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:24,894  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now we've got to find
a way to get in there.

560
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:26,931  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've identified the address.

561
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:32,287  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
It belongs to Peter Tyler,
the Vitex millionaire. Pete Tyler?

562
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:36,428  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's listed as one of Lumic's
henchmen, a traitor to the state.

563
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:42,029  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
But. . . We gotta get in there!
Shut it, duplicate,
that's what I just said.

564
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:46,733  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are they doing?

565
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,777  X1:078 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
What the hell are they?
RHYTHMIC METALLIC BANGING

566
00:37:57,098 --> 00:38:03,162  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
LUMIC: 'The most precious thing
on this earth is the human brain. '

567
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:15,041  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mrs Tyler, is there
anything I can get you?

568
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:16,975  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
The last 20 years back.

569
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:22,635  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can manage a glass of champagne,

570
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,217  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
or a nice cup of tea?
Oh, that'd do me.

571
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:31,664  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
My mum loves that.
End of a long night,
she never goes straight to bed.

572
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:35,580  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
She always stays up just to have that
last cup of tea. Oh, I'm the same.

573
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,577  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Two sugars. And me.

574
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:40,000  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
And Pete always says, "You know. . . "

575
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:43,536  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah, never mind him.

576
00:38:45,048 --> 00:38:46,889  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was talking to him earlier.

577
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:49,284  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's a nice man.

578
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:53,603  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
You know, a bit of a Jack the lad,
I suppose, even if he has got money,

579
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:56,278  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
but he's a good bloke.

580
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:58,815  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Better than most.

581
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,553  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's worth a second chance.

582
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:05,908  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you commenting on my marriage?

583
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:09,186  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, I was just. . .
Who the hell do you think you are?

584
00:39:09,226 --> 00:39:13,818  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
You're staff. You're nothing
but staff, you're just the
serving girl, for God's sake.

585
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:19,142  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
And you are certainly not getting
paid. Don't you dare talk to me.

586
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:45,587  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
'This is the ultimate upgrade,
our greatest step into cyberspace. '

587
00:39:45,627 --> 00:39:46,656  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cybus!

588
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,274  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's happening again.

589
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:17,393  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you mean?

590
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:23,905  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've seen them before.
What are they? Cybermen!

591
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:25,998  X1:078 X2:237 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREAMING

592
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:47,001  X1:078 X2:429 Y1:452 Y2:523
PHONE RINGS
Mr Lumic.

593
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:53,155  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mr President. I suppose a
remark about crashing the party
would be appropriate at this point.

594
00:40:53,195 --> 00:40:54,716  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
I forbade this.

595
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:56,316  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
These are my children, sir.

596
00:40:56,356 --> 00:40:58,627  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Would you deny my family?

597
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,904  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are they, robots?

598
00:41:00,944 --> 00:41:03,741  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Worse than that.
Who were these people?

599
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:06,418  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
It doesn't matter. They're people?

600
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:10,894  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
They were - till they had
all their humanity taken away.

601
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:15,849  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's a living brain jammed
inside a cybernetic body,
with a heart of steel,

602
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:17,886  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
all emotions removed.

603
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:19,646  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why no emotions?

604
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,122  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because it hurts.

605
00:41:22,162 --> 00:41:25,360  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I demand to know, Lumic!
These people, who were they?

606
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,717  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
They were homeless
and wretched and useless,

607
00:41:27,757 --> 00:41:32,155  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
until I saved them and elevated them
and gave them life eternal.

608
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:36,065  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
And now I leave you in their
capable hands. Good night, sir.

609
00:41:36,105 --> 00:41:38,738  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good night, Mr President.

610
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:43,700  X1:138 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
We have been upgraded. Into what?

611
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,334  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
The next level of mankind.
We are Human 0.2.

612
00:41:48,374 --> 00:41:53,648  X1:090 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Every citizen will receive a free
upgrade, you will become like us.

613
00:41:53,688 --> 00:41:56,168  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

614
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:59,565  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm so sorry
for what's been done to you.

615
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:01,801  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
But listen to me. . .

616
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:06,117  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
This experiment ends! Tonight.

617
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,836  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Upgrading is compulsory.

618
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:10,753  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
And if I refuse? Don't.

619
00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:12,666  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
What if I refuse?

620
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:14,186  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm telling you, don't!

621
00:42:14,226 --> 00:42:16,903  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
What happens if I refuse?

622
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:20,541  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then you are not compatible.

623
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,978  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
What happens then?

624
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:25,720  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
You will be deleted.

625
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,449  X1:078 X2:209 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREAMS

626
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:34,542  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jackie!

627
00:42:36,044 --> 00:42:37,773  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jackie!

628
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:49,628  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's nothing we can do!

629
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,950  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
My mum's in there!
She's not your mother, come on!

630
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:03,160  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Pete! Pete!

631
00:43:30,865 --> 00:43:32,585  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Pete, is there a way out?

632
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,261  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
The side gates!

633
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:37,173  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
Who are you? How do you know so much?
You wouldn't believe it in a million years.

634
00:43:43,336 --> 00:43:45,409  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's that?

635
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:46,933  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get behind me!

636
00:43:58,361 --> 00:43:59,996  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God, look at you!

637
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:03,316  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought I'd never see you again!

638
00:44:03,356 --> 00:44:07,821  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, no offence, sweetheart,
but who the hell are you? Rose!

639
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:12,423  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's not me,
that's like. . .the other one.

640
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:15,061  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, as if things weren't bad
enough, there's two Mickeys!

641
00:44:15,101 --> 00:44:17,598  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's Ricky.
But there's more of them.

642
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:25,127  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're surrounded. Put the guns
down, bullets won't stop them.

643
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:28,966  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
You! Stop shooting, now!

644
00:44:29,006 --> 00:44:31,322  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
We surrender!

645
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:34,400  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hands up!

646
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,797  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's no need to damage us.

647
00:44:36,837 --> 00:44:41,511  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're good stock. We volunteer
for the upgrade programme.

648
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:45,745  X1:148 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
Take us to be processed. You are
rogue elements. But we surrender.

649
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:49,421  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are incompatible.
But this is a surrender!

650
00:44:49,461 --> 00:44:51,899  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
You will be deleted.

651
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,896  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
But we're surrendering!
Listen to me, we surrender!

652
00:44:53,936 --> 00:44:55,616  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are inferior.

653
00:44:55,656 --> 00:45:01,270  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Men will be reborn as Cybermen,
but you will perish
upon maximum deletion.

654
00:45:03,727 --> 00:45:07,254  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Delete! Delete! Delete! Delete!

655
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:37,392  X1:112 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
