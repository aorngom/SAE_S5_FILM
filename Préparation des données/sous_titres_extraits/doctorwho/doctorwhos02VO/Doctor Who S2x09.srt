1
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:04,317  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a sanctuary base! Deep-space
exploration. Welcome to hell. . .

2
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:07,263  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are you lot doing here? That's
a black hole. That's impossible.

3
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:09,071  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are you lot doing here? That's
a black hole. That's impossible.

4
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:12,788  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
This lump of rock is suspended
in perpetual geostationary orbit

5
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:16,218  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
around that black hole,
without falling in.

6
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:18,738  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Some sort of power source is
holding us here.

7
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:21,195  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're drilling down
to try and find it.

8
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:24,451  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Tardis is gone.

9
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,132  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Whatever it is,
it's not a natural phenomenon.

10
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:29,770  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Some form of civilisation.

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,488  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
They buried something.

12
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:37,680  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are they called? .
They're the Ood, basic slave race.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,278  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's something happening
with the Ood. . .

14
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:42,576  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
ALL: And you will worship him.

15
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:50,265  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can tell Toby what we've found
is civilisation.

16
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:53,781  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
These are the words of the beast. . .
and he has woken.

17
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,137  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
OOD: I have been imprisoned
for eternity.

18
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:59,057  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
But no more.

19
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:02,133  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
The pit is open!

20
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:05,489  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I am free!

21
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:09,246  X1:078 X2:377 Y1:488 Y2:523
"DOCTOR WHO" THEME

22
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:45,331  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Open fire!

23
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:54,119  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're stabilising!

24
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,496  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've got orbit.

25
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,667  X1:078 X2:415 Y1:344 Y2:415
Doctor?
STATIC HISS

26
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,739  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor, can you hear me?
Doctor, Ida, are you there?

27
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,579  X1:304 X2:422 Y1:344 Y2:379
It's me!

28
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,859  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:344 Y2:379
But they're coming. It's the Ood.

29
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,697  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:488 Y2:523
They've gone mad. How many of them?

30
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:18,411  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
All of them, all 50. Danny,
out of the way. Out of the way!

31
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:20,931  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
But they're armed!
It's the interface device.

32
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:24,207  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know how,
but they're using it as a weapon.

33
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,418  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
A-A-A-A-Aaah!

34
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,893  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Close Door One.

35
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:44,984  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Open Door One. Close Door One.

36
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,179  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Lockdown! Seal Door One!

37
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,497  X1:078 X2:285 Y1:488 Y2:523
VOICES BABBLE

38
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,215  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jefferson, what's happening?

39
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,892  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got very little ammunition,
sir, how about you?

40
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:58,409  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
All I've got is a bolt-gun.

41
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,686  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
With, uh. . .all of one bolt.

42
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:04,642  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I could take out a grand total of
one Ood, fat lot of good that is( !)

43
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:07,600  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Given the emergency,
I'd recommend. . .Strategy Nine.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,594  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523
Strategy Nine, agreed. Right, we
need to get everyone together. Rose?

45
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:16,387  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
What about Ida and the Doctor,
any word? I can't get a reply.

46
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:18,866  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just. . . nothing.
I keep trying, but it's. . .

47
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:22,061  X1:078 X2:461 Y1:452 Y2:523
ON COMMUNICATOR:
No, sorry, I'm fine, still here!

48
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,020  X1:078 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, you could've said, you stupid. . .
FEEDBACK WHINES

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,060  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Woah. Careful. Anyway!
It's both of us, me and Ida, hello!

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,613  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
But the seal opened up.

51
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:33,971  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's gone.

52
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:36,851  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
All we've got left is this. . .chasm.

53
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,769  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
'How deep is it?' Can't tell.

54
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,325  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Looks like it goes down forever.
'The Pit is open. '

55
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:47,878  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's what the voice said.
But there's nothing. . . I mean,
there's nothing coming out?

56
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,555  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, no sign of the Beast.

57
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,189  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
It said Satan.
Come on, Rose. Keep it together.

58
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,407  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is there no such thing?

59
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,343  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor.

60
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:01,621  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Doctor, tell me
there's no such thing. '

61
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:05,299  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ida. I recommend that you
withdraw, immediately.

62
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:10,133  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
But we've come all this way. . . !
OK, that was an order. Withdraw!

63
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:12,570  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
When that opened,
the whole planet shifted.

64
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,970  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
One more inch, and we fall into
the black hole. This stops, now.

65
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,767  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
But it's not much better up there,
with the Ood.

66
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:20,564  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm initiating Strategy Nine,

67
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:24,785  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
so I need the two of you
back up top, immediately, no arg. . .

68
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:28,794  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ida. IDA? !

69
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,909  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you think?

70
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:33,149  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
He gave an order.

71
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,596  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, but what do YOU think?

72
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:42,470  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
It said, "I am the temptation. "

73
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:47,774  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
If there's something in there. . .

74
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:50,650  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why's it still hiding?

75
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,016  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe we've opened the prison,
but not the cell.

76
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:58,943  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
We should go down.

77
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:01,275  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'd go.

78
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,800  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
What about you? Ohh, in a second.
But then again. . .

79
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:10,687  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
That is so human.

80
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,724  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where angels fear to tread.

81
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:17,309  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Even now, standing on the edge.

82
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:21,877  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's that feeling you get, yeah?

83
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,514  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right at the back of your head,

84
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:26,951  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
that impulse,

85
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:30,027  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
that strange little impulse,

86
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:35,585  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
that mad little voice saying,
"Go on, go on, go on,

87
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,803  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
"go over, go on. . . "

88
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,997  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maybe it's relying on that.

89
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:47,528  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
For once in my life, Officer Scott,

90
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:50,110  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm going to say. . .

91
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,482  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Retreat.

92
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:55,562  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ohh.

93
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:57,638  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now I know I'm getting old.

94
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:59,235  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose. We're coming back.

95
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,796  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Best news I've heard all day.

96
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:04,512  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you doing?

97
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:07,670  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's infected. He brought that
thing on board - you saw it.

98
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,264  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Are you gonna start shooting your
own people now, is that what you're
gonna do? Is it? If necessary.

99
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:17,030  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, then, you'll have to shoot me.
If necessary. So what's it gonna be?

100
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,812  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look at his face.
Whatever it was, it's gone.

101
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:25,064  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
It passed into the Ood,
you saw it happen.

102
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:28,345  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's clean.

103
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:33,003  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Any sign of trouble, I'll shoot him.

104
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,919  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
You all right?

105
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,637  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

106
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:42,270  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:452 Y2:523
Um. Dunno. Can you remember anything?
Just. . .

107
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,308  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was so angry.

108
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:48,733  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was fury, and rage, and. . .death.

109
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:54,060  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was him.

110
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,417  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was the Devil.

111
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,079  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on.

112
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:08,202  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's Strategy Nine?
Open the airlocks.

113
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:13,996  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
We'll be safe inside the lockdown.
The Ood will get thrown out,
into the vacuum.

114
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:16,396  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
So we're going back to a slaughter.

115
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,239  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Devil's work.

116
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:23,068  X1:078 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
COMMUNICATOR HISSES
'OK, we're in. Bring us up. '

117
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:29,052  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ascension, in three, two, one.

118
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:38,012  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
'This is the darkness. '

119
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:39,808  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is my domain.

120
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:44,207  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
You little things
that live in the light,

121
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,963  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
clinging to your feeble suns,

122
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:49,399  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
which die, in the end. . .

123
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,397  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's not the Ood.
Something is talking through them.

124
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:55,194  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Only the darkness remains.

125
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:59,269  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is Captain Zachary Cross Flane,
of Sanctuary Base Six,

126
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:04,145  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
representing the Torchwood Archive.
You will identify yourself.

127
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:06,182  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know my name.

128
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:07,702  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you want?

129
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:10,539  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
You will die here. All of you.

130
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:12,814  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
This planet is your grave.

131
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:15,212  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's him. It's him. It's him.

132
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:18,448  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you are the Beast,
then answer me this. Which one?

133
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:21,605  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos the universe has been busy
since you've been gone.

134
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:24,122  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's more religions
than there are planets.

135
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:28,595  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Arkiphets, Quoldonity,
Christianity, Pash-Pash,

136
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:32,434  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
New Judaism, San Claar,
the Church of the Tin Vagabond. . .

137
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:34,553  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Which Devil are you? All of them.

138
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:38,028  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
What, then you're the truth
behind the myth(? )

139
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,987  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
This one knows me.

140
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:44,981  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
As I know him.
The killer of his own kind.

141
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,015  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
How did you end up on this rock?

142
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:51,853  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Disciples of the Light
rose up against me,

143
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:55,490  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
and chained me in the Pit
for all eternity.

144
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,607  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
When was this? Before time.

145
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:02,162  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
What does that mean? Before time.

146
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:04,001  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
What does "before time" MEAN?

147
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:08,798  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Before time and light
and space and matter.

148
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:11,514  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Before the cataclysm.

149
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:14,913  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Before this universe was created.

150
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:17,988  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's impossible. No life
could have existed back then.

151
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:20,980  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that your religion?

152
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:25,661  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a belief. You know nothing.

153
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:28,414  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
All of you, so small.

154
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:32,409  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Captain, so scared of command.

155
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:37,805  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
The soldier,
haunted by the eyes of his wife.

156
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:42,720  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
The scientist,
still running from Daddy.

157
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,997  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
The little boy who lied.

158
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:48,274  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
The virgin.

159
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,672  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
And the lost girl.

160
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:53,790  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
So far away from home.

161
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:59,782  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
The valiant child
who will die in battle, so very soon.

162
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:01,862  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, what does that mean?

163
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,215  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, don't listen.
What does it mean? !

164
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:07,092  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
You will die. . .

165
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,834  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
. .and I will live.

166
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,767  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell was that?

167
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,564  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
I had that thing inside my head!

168
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,641  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, what did it mean?

169
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:22,238  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do we do? Jefferson, Zack,
what do we do? Captain. . . ?

170
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,073  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
The orbit, the planet,
the black hole - everything's true.

171
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:28,192  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
How did it know that?
Did anyone. . . ?

172
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:32,288  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
What battle? What did it mean? Stop!
What do we do?

173
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:35,744  X1:078 X2:323 Y1:488 Y2:523
FEEDBACK WHINES

174
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:39,696  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
If you want voices in the dark,
listen to mine.
It's playing on basic fears.

175
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:45,651  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Darkness, childhood, nightmares,
all that stuff. But that's how the
Devil works. Or a good psychologist.

176
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:47,969  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
How did it know about my father?

177
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,566  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK. But what makes his version
of the truth any better than mine?

178
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:55,048  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos I'll tell you what I can see.
Humans. Brilliant humans.

179
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:58,880  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:416 Y2:523
Humans who travelled
all the way across space,
flying in a tiny rocket,

180
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,515  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
into the orbit of a black hole,
just for the sake of discovery!

181
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:05,514  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's amazing! D'you hear me?
Amazing.

182
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:08,272  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
All of you. The captain.
His officer. His elder.

183
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,028  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
His juniors. His friends.

184
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:14,662  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
All with one advantage.
The Beast is alone. We are not.

185
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:17,119  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
If we can use that
to fight against him. . .

186
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,031  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
The cable snapped! Get out!

187
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,081  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, we lost the cable!

188
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:36,959  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, are you all right? Doctor?

189
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,237  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Comms are down.
(Doctor, can you hear me? )

190
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:42,433  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've still got life-signs,
but. . .we've lost the capsule.

191
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:44,990  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's no way out.

192
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,833  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're stuck down there.

193
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:53,457  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
How much air have we got?

194
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:56,698  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
60 minutes.

195
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,336  X1:334 X2:385 Y1:488 Y2:523
55.

196
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:01,373  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
But we've got to bring them back!

197
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:04,809  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're ten miles down. We haven't
got another ten miles of cable.

198
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,415  X1:078 X2:421 Y1:452 Y2:523
EXPLOSION
Captain?

199
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:11,160  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Situation report.

200
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,256  X1:078 X2:207 Y1:488 Y2:523
BANGING

201
00:12:24,908 --> 00:12:26,626  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the Ood.

202
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:30,103  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're cutting through
the door-bolts, they're breaking in.

203
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:32,977  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes, same on Door 25.
How long's it gonna take?

204
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:36,788  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, it's only a basic frame,
should take ten minutes.

205
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,656  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Eight.

206
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,928  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got a security frame -
it might last a bit longer.

207
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:48,402  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
But that doesn't help you.
Right. So! We've got to stop them,
or get out, or both.

208
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:50,919  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll take both, yeah, but how? !

209
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,041  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
You heard the Doctor. Why d'you
think that thing cut him off?

210
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:57,913  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cos he was making sense,
he was telling you to think
your way out of this!

211
00:12:57,953 --> 00:13:00,231  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on! For starters,
we need some light.

212
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:04,547  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Zack, there's got to be
some sort of power, somewhere.
There's nothing I can do.

213
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:07,384  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Some Captain!
Stuck in here, pressing buttons.

214
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:12,176  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
But that's what the Doctor meant!
Press the right buttons!
They've gutted the generators!

215
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:15,813  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
But. . .the rocket's
got an independent supply.

216
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:18,210  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
If I can reroute that. . .

217
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,287  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Jefferson!
Open the bypass conduits,

218
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:23,684  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
override the safety.

219
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:27,084  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Opening bypass conduits, sir!

220
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:30,118  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Channeling rocket feed.

221
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:35,194  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
In three, two, one.

222
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:37,996  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Power!

223
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:41,668  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
There we go! Let there be light!
What about that Strategy Nine thing?

224
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,826  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not enough power - needs 100%.

225
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,498  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right. We need a way out. Zack,
Mr Jefferson, start working on that.

226
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:49,897  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Toby, what about you?
I'm not a soldier!

227
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:53,171  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, you're the archaeologist.
What do you know about the Pit?

228
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:56,892  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
We can't even translate the language,
but. . . Hold on. Maybe. . .

229
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:59,048  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it?

230
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:03,482  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Since that thing was inside my head,
the letters make more sense.

231
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:08,199  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then get to work. Anything
you can translate, just. . .anything.

232
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:12,153  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
As for you, Danny boy,
you're in charge of the Ood.
Any way of stopping them?

233
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:14,311  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well. . . I don't know.

234
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,510  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then find out!

235
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,834  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Sooner we get control of this base,
the sooner we can get the
Doctor out. Now get going. Shift!

236
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:31,253  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've got all this cable,
might as well use it.

237
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:36,047  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
The drum's disconnected,
we could adapt it. Feed it through. . .

238
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,284  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
And then what?

239
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,164  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Abseil.

240
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:42,280  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Into the Pit.

241
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,038  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Abseil! Right!

242
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,758  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're running out of air, with no way
back. It's the only thing we CAN do.

243
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:51,192  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Even if it's the last thing
we ever achieve.

244
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:53,829  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll get back. Rose is up there.

245
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:58,786  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then maybe the key to that
is finding out what's in the Pit.

246
00:14:58,826 --> 00:15:02,139  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well. It's half of a good plan.

247
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:03,939  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's the other half?

248
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:06,806  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
I go down. Not you.

249
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:12,797  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Junctions 5, 6, 7. . .

250
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,748  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Re-route filters 16 to 24. Go.

251
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,839  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's all sorts of viruses
that could stop the Ood.

252
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,676  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Trouble is,
we haven't got them on board.

253
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,394  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, that's handy,
listing things we haven't got.

254
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:31,136  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
We haven't got a swimming pool
either, or a Tesco.

255
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:36,221  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God, it says yes!
I can do it!

256
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:40,739  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hypothetically, if you flip
the monitor, broadcast a flare,

257
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,253  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:523
it can disrupt the telepathy.
Brainstorm ! What happens to the Ood?

258
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:46,053  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
It'll tank them, spark-out!

259
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:48,369  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
There we are then - do it!

260
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:53,127  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, but I'd have to transmit
from the central monitor.

261
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:56,369  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
We need to go to Ood Habitation.

262
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,119  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's what we'll do then.

263
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,636  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Jefferson, sir, any way out?

264
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:06,513  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just about. There's a network
of maintenance tunnels

265
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:09,070  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
running underneath the base.

266
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,304  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ventilation shafts!
I appreciate the reference,
but there's no ventilation.

267
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:17,778  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
No air, in fact - they were designed
for machines, not lifeforms.

268
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:21,694  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I can manipulate
the oxygen field from here,

269
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:24,013  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
create discrete pockets
of atmosphere.

270
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:28,049  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
If I control it manually, I can
follow you through the network.

271
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:32,683  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right! So. . . We go down, and
you make the air follow us? By hand?

272
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:35,843  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
You wanted me pressing buttons.
Yep. I asked for it. OK.

273
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:38,425  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
We need to get to Ood Habitation.
Work out a route.

274
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:42,433  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
That should hold it.

275
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:45,792  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
How's it going? Fine. Should work.

276
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:48,625  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doesn't feel like
such a good idea now.

277
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:54,340  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
There it is again. That itch.

278
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,656  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Go down, go down,
go down, go down. . .

279
00:16:56,696 --> 00:17:01,293  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
The urge to jump. D'you know where
it comes from, that sensation?

280
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:06,048  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Genetic heritage, ever since
we were primates in the trees.

281
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:08,525  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's our body's way of testing us,

282
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:12,881  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
calculating whether or not
we can reach the next branch.

283
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:15,159  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, that's not it.

284
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,117  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's too kind.

285
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:20,876  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's not the urge to jump,
it's deeper than that.

286
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,632  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the urge to fall.

287
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:25,499  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

288
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:29,384  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
You OK? Not bad, thanks.

289
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:33,738  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wall of the Pit seems to be
the same as the cavern,

290
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:36,055  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
just. . . not much of it.

291
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:41,015  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's a crust about 20ft down,
and then. . .

292
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,503  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing. Just the Pit.

293
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,444  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, then. Lower me down.

294
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,093  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here we go, then.

295
00:17:58,274 --> 00:18:01,511  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Danny! Hold on, just conforming.

296
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,628  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:523
Danny, we've got to go now! Come on!

297
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:09,779  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
There! Put that into the monitor
and it's a bad time to be an Ood!

298
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:11,297  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're coming back, got that?

299
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,977  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're coming back
and getting the Doctor out.

300
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:17,494  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, Danny, you go first, then you,
then Toby. I'll go last.

301
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:19,337  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now come on, quick as you can.

302
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:26,925  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
God, it stinks. You all right?
Yeah, laughing( !)

303
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:30,816  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
Which way do we go? Just go straight
ahead, keep going till I say so.

304
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:41,305  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not your best angle, Danny. Oi.
Stop it!

305
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:43,603  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
I dunno, could be worse. Oi!

306
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:47,941  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Straight on till you find
Junction 7.1. Keep breathing.

307
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:51,547  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm feeding you air. I've got you.

308
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:07,200  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're at 7.1, sir.

309
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,054  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, I've got you.

310
00:19:11,638 --> 00:19:13,994  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm just aerating the next section.

311
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:17,191  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Getting kinda cramped, sir.
Can't you hurry it up?

312
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:19,987  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm working on half-power here.
Stop complaining.

313
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,903  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Jefferson said, stop complaining.
I heard. He heard.

314
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:26,464  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
The air's getting a bit thin.
HE's complaining now. I heard.

315
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:31,694  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Danny, is that you?
I'm not exactly happy!

316
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:35,129  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm just moving the air, I've got
to oxygenate the next section.

317
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,208  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, keep calm,
or it's gonna feel worse.

318
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:40,460  X1:078 X2:197 Y1:488 Y2:523
CLATTER

319
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:45,003  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
What was that? Mr Jefferson,
what was that? What was that noise?

320
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:47,119  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Captain. What was that?

321
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,873  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
The junction in Habitation Five's
been opened. It must be the Ood.

322
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:56,467  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're in the tunnels.
Well, open the gate! I've got to
get the air in! Just open it, sir!

323
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:59,904  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where are they, are they close?
I can't tell, I can't see them.

324
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:02,862  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
The computer doesn't register Ood
as proper lifeforms.

325
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,569  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whose idea was that? ! Open the GATE!

326
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:12,274  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Danny, turn left, immediate left!

327
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,444  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Ood, sir - can't you trap them,
cut off the air?

328
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,390  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not without cutting off yours.

329
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:30,711  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Danny, turn right, go right. . .
Go faster, they're gonna catch up!

330
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:34,786  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll maintain defensive position.
You can't stop!

331
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:38,821  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Miss Tyler, that's my job. You've
got your task - now see to it!

332
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:41,528  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
You heard what he said, now shift!

333
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:00,600  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
8.2. Open 8.2.

334
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,077  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Zack, open 8.2!

335
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:05,594  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got to aerate it. Open it NOW!

336
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:08,794  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm TRYING!

337
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,947  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Danny, stop it, that's not helping!

338
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:13,024  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Zack! Get it open!

339
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:16,821  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Jefferson, I've got to open 8.2
by closing 8.1.

340
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:20,537  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've got to get past the junction!
Now, move!

341
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:23,290  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's an order! Now, move!

342
00:21:26,574 --> 00:21:30,999  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm gonna lose oxygen, Jefferson,
I can't stop the automatics!

343
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:36,282  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's it, come on, come on!

344
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:39,359  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Danny, turn left.
Head for 9.2, that's the last one.

345
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,316  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Jefferson,
you've got to move faster!

346
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:45,273  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
John! Move! MOVE! Mr Jefferson!

347
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:48,140  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on! KEEP GOING!

348
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:54,181  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Regret to inform you, sir.

349
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,378  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
'I was a bit slow.

350
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:58,777  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Not so fast, these days. '

351
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,215  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't open 8.1, John.

352
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:03,772  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not without losing
air for the others.

353
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:05,649  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
And quite right too, sir.

354
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:07,947  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think I bought them a little time.

355
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,284  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
'There's nothing I can do, John. '

356
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:14,360  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,557  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
You've done enough, sir.
Made a very good captain,
under the circumstances.

358
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:23,474  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Might I ask, if you can't
add oxygen to this section,

359
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:27,064  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
can you speed up the
process of its removal?

360
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:29,703  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't understand. What d'you mean?

361
00:22:29,743 --> 00:22:33,219  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, if I might choose
the manner of my departure, sir,

362
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:36,376  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
lack of air
seems more natural than. . .

363
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:42,090  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, let's say, death by Ood.

364
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,888  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'd appreciate it, sir.

365
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,167  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Godspeed, Mr Jefferson.

366
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:49,920  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you, sir.

367
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:04,186  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Report.
Officer John Maynard Jefferson, PKD

368
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:08,381  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
deceased, with honours,

369
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:11,941  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
43K 2.1.

370
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:13,819  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
Zack.

371
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,335  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're at the final junction.

372
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,652  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:488 Y2:523
9.2.

373
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:21,849  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
And, uh. . .

374
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,527  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
If my respects could be on record,
he saved our lives.

375
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:30,191  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Noted. Opening 9.2.

376
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,314  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lower 9.2! Zack, LOWER IT!
Back back back!

377
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:40,000  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
We can't go back, 8.2's sealed off -
we're stuck!

378
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:43,452  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on! UP!

379
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:52,430  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on! Toby, come ON !

380
00:23:54,814 --> 00:23:56,451  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Toby, get out of there!

381
00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:59,158  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Help me! Oh, my God, help me!

382
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:06,538  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's this way!

383
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:18,746  X1:078 X2:233 Y1:488 Y2:523
EXPLOSION

384
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:21,044  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hurry it up!

385
00:24:23,184 --> 00:24:25,428  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get it in. Danny, get it done.

386
00:24:25,468 --> 00:24:28,538  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Transmit! I'm trying, I'm trying.
I'm getting it in. . .

387
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:29,982  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop them !

388
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,917  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Danny, get that thing transmitting!

389
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:44,633  X1:078 X2:357 Y1:488 Y2:523
ELECTRONIC SCREECH

390
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:02,901  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
You did it! We did it!

391
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:05,040  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes! Oh, yes!

392
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:10,814  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Zack, we did it, the Ood are down!
Now we've got to get the Doctor.

393
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:12,657  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
On my way!

394
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:17,648  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
You get representations of the
horned beast across the universe,

395
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:20,136  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
in the myths and legends
of a million worlds.

396
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:25,079  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Earth, Draconia,
Vel Consadine, Daemos,

397
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,357  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
the Kaled God of War. . . The same
image, over and over again.

398
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:31,791  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maybe that idea came from somewhere.

399
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,267  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bleeding through.

400
00:25:34,307 --> 00:25:37,385  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
A thought at the back
of every sentient mind.

401
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,221  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Emanating from here?

402
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:42,539  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Could be. If this is the original. . .

403
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:48,292  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
does that make it real, does that
make it the actual Devil, though?

404
00:25:48,332 --> 00:25:50,690  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, if that's
what you want to believe.

405
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,966  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe that's what the Devil is,
in the end. An idea.

406
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,763  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's it.

407
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:01,881  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's all we've got.

408
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:04,518  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
You getting any sort of readout?

409
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:06,512  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing.

410
00:26:06,552 --> 00:26:08,429  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Could be miles to go.

411
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:13,719  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Or, could be 30 feet,
there's no way of telling.

412
00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:18,101  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
I could survive 30 feet.

413
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,433  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, no, you don't,
I'm pulling you back up.

414
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:25,664  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you doing? !

415
00:26:25,704 --> 00:26:29,249  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
You bring me back, and we're just
gonna sit there and run out of air.

416
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:31,297  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got to go down.

417
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:34,166  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you can't. Doctor, you can't!

418
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:36,293  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Call it an act of faith.

419
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,520  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't want to die on my own.

420
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,478  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know.

421
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:50,586  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, are you there?

422
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,745  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor? Ida? Can you hear me?

423
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:56,180  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
The comms are still down. I can
patch them through the central desk

424
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,808  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
and boost the signal. . .
Just give me a minute.

425
00:27:01,974 --> 00:27:07,170  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I didn't ask. Have you got any sort
of faith, or. . . ? Not really.

426
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,245  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was brought up Neo-Classic,
Congregational.

427
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:14,577  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos of my mum, she was. . .

428
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:20,429  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
My old mum.

429
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:23,790  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
But no. I never believed.

430
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,839  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Neo-Classics, have they got a devil?

431
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:29,070  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.  Not as such.  Just...

432
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:32,421  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
. .the things that men do.

433
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:35,413  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Same thing, in the end.
And what about you?

434
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:45,329  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I believe. . .
I believe I haven't seen everything.

435
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:47,672  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
I dunno.

436
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,085  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Funny, isn't it?

437
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,880  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
The things you make up. The rules.

438
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,594  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
If that thing had said it came from
beyond the universe, I'd believe it,

439
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,757  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
but before the universe? Impossible.

440
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:04,816  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doesn't fit my rules.

441
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:09,997  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Still.
Maybe that's why I keep travelling.

442
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,553  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
To be proved wrong.

443
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,261  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you, Ida.

444
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:22,211  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't go!

445
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:24,247  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
If they get back in touch. . .

446
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:27,933  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you talk to Rose,
just tell her. . .

447
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:37,088  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tell her. . .

448
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,608  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, she knows.

449
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:47,382  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Doctor? Are you there?

450
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:50,269  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Doctor? Ida? Can you hear me?'

451
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:53,045  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you there, Doctor? He's gone.

452
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:56,893  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
What d'you mean, he's gone?

453
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:58,812  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
He fell.

454
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:01,235  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Into the Pit.

455
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:05,046  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know how deep it is.
Miles and miles and miles.

456
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:07,611  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
But. . . What d'you mean, he fell?

457
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:10,023  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
I couldn't stop him.

458
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:14,966  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
He said your name.

459
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,541  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,258  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ida. . .
There's no way of reaching you.

461
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:34,895  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
No cable, no backup,
you're ten miles down.

462
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,850  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can't get there.

463
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,478  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523

464
00:29:43,772 --> 00:29:46,229  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's beautiful.

465
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:51,748  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wanted to discover things,

466
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:55,796  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
and here I am.

467
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,387  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've got to abandon the base.

468
00:29:57,427 --> 00:30:00,345  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm declaring this mission unsafe.

469
00:30:00,385 --> 00:30:04,183  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
All we can do is make sure
no-one ever comes here again.

470
00:30:04,223 --> 00:30:06,859  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
But we'll never find out what it was.

471
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,576  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maybe that's best.

472
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:10,874  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

473
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,330  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Officer Scott. . . It's all right.

474
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,184  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just go.

475
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:24,612  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good luck. And you.

476
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:34,668  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:416 Y2:523
Danny, Toby,
close down the feed-links,
get the retrotopes online.

477
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,946  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then get to the rocket and strap
yourselves in. We're leaving.

478
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:41,541  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not going.
Rose, there's space for you.

479
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:44,186  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, I'm gonna wait for the Doctor.

480
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:45,915  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just like he'd wait for me.

481
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:51,211  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry, but. . . he's dead.

482
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,369  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
You don't know him.

483
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:55,837  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos he's not.

484
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:00,202  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm telling you, he's not. . .

485
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:02,837  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
And even if he was,
how could I leave him?

486
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:08,730  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
All on his own, all the way
down there? No, I'm gonna stay.

487
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:12,748  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then. . . I apologise for this.

488
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,825  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Danny, Toby, make her secure.

489
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:17,584  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
No! No! No! Stop! STOP!

490
00:31:17,624 --> 00:31:20,667  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Let me go! GET OFF ME!
I'm not leaving!

491
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:25,901  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've lost too many people.

492
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:28,643  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm not leaving you behind.

493
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:32,566  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's get her on board.

494
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:37,650  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did that one just move?

495
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,719  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the telepathic field,
it's reasserting itself!

496
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,641  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Move it, get to the rocket, move!

497
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:52,762  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ughhh. . .

498
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,560  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm breathing!

499
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,187  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Air cushion to support the fall.

500
00:32:14,206 --> 00:32:17,120  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can breathe down here, Ida!

501
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,880  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you hear me, Ida?

502
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,555  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
Dislocating B clamp, C clamp.

How's the negapact feed line?

503
00:32:23,595 --> 00:32:27,148  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Clear, ready to go, sir. Oh, for
God's sake, get us out of here!

504
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:30,505  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523

a problem. Keep an eye on her.

00:32:30,545 --> 00:32:33,982  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
What did you. . . ?
It's all right, Rose, we're safe.

506
00:32:34,022 --> 00:32:39,511  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm not going anywhere! Get me
out of this thing. . . Get me OUT!

00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:55,812  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523

509
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:04,750  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Take me back to the planet.

510
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,187  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523

511
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,280  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or I'll shoot.

512
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,824  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Would you, though?

513
00:33:13,864 --> 00:33:17,840  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Would you really?
Is that what your Doctor would want?

514
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:27,207  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sorry. But it's too late,
anyway. Take a look outside.

515
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:29,844  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can't turn back.

516
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:33,735  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523

Hope so.

519
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:48,636  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anyway, they defeated the Beast,
and imprisoned it.

520
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:58,988  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,862  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Were's it gone?
Where's that intelligence?

559
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:30,462  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh no. . .

560
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:37,002  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Stats at 53, funnel stable at 66.5,
hull pressure constant.

561
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:40,360  X1:078 X2:375 Y1:380 Y2:451
Smooth as we can, sir,
all the way back home.

562
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,487  X1:078 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Co-ordinates set for Planet Earth.

563
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:46,907  X1:078 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're imprisoned, long time ago.

564
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:51,627  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:416 Y2:523
Before the universe, after,
sideways, in between,
doesn't matter.

565
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,225  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
And the prison is perfect.

566
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:56,862  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's absolute, it's eternal. . .

567
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:58,582  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, yes.

568
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:02,496  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Open the prison,
and the gravity field collapses,

569
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:05,988  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
this planet
falls into the black hole.

570
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,331  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
You escape, you die. Brilliant!

571
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:11,448  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
But that's just the body.

572
00:37:11,488 --> 00:37:14,155  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
The body's trapped, that's all.

573
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:20,152  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Devil is an idea, in all
those civilisations, just an idea.

574
00:37:21,315 --> 00:37:24,033  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
But an idea is hard to kill.

575
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:26,661  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
An idea can escape!

576
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:33,704  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
The mind, the mind of the great
Beast, the mind can escape.

577
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:36,381  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, but that's it!

578
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,538  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
You didn't give me air.
Your jailers did!

579
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:41,858  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
They set this up,
all those years ago.

580
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:44,536  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
They need me alive!

581
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,853  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Because if you're escaping
then I've got to stop you.

582
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:50,230  X1:078 X2:263 Y1:488 Y2:523
BEAST ROARS

583
00:37:53,164 --> 00:37:56,160  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
If I destroy your prison,
your body is destroyed.

584
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,492  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your mind with it?

585
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:10,026  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
But then you're clever enough to
use this whole system against me.

586
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:14,781  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
If I destroy this planet,
then I destroy the gravity field.

587
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,578  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
The rocket.
The rocket loses protection.

588
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:21,421  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Falls into the Black Hole.

589
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,519  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
I have to sacrifice Rose.

590
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,586  X1:078 X2:283 Y1:488 Y2:523
BEAST CACKLES

591
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,596  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
It doesn't make sense.

592
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:38,916  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
We escaped, but there's a thousand
ways it could've killed us.

593
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:44,547  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
It could've ripped out the air,
or burnt us, or anything,

594
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:46,799  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
But it let us go - why?

595
00:38:48,304 --> 00:38:50,341  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Unless it wanted us to escape.

596
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,741  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hey, Rose, do us a favour.

597
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:54,584  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Shut up.

598
00:38:55,578 --> 00:39:00,332  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Almost there. We're beyond the
reach of the Black Hole in 40, 39. . .

599
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,290  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
So that's the trap.

600
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,362  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Or the test or the final judgement,
I don't know.

601
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:09,627  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
But if I kill you, I kill her.

602
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:16,955  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Except that implies,

603
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:20,509  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
in this big, grand scheme
of gods and devils,

604
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:22,948  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
she's just a victim.

605
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:25,706  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I've seen a lot of the universe.

606
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:28,742  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've seen fake gods, and bad gods,

607
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:30,780  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
and demi-gods and would-be gods,

608
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,857  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
and out of all that,
out of that whole pantheon,

609
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:36,973  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
if I believe in one thing,

610
00:39:37,013 --> 00:39:39,350  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
just one thing. . .

611
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:42,783  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I believe in her.

612
00:39:47,242 --> 00:39:49,920  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
What was that?
What's he doing? What is he doing? !

613
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,476  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've lost the funnel!
Gravity collapse!

614
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,593  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
What does that mean?
We can't escape!

615
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:57,710  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're heading straight
for the black hole!

616
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:08,060  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is your freedom !

617
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,779  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Free to die!

618
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:14,055  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're going into the black hole,
and I'm riding with you!

619
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,924  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the planet,
the planet's moving!

620
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:25,097  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's falling.

621
00:40:26,678 --> 00:40:30,394  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am the rage and the bile
and the ferocity!

622
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:33,712  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am the prince and the fool
and the agony! It's him, it's Toby!

623
00:40:33,752 --> 00:40:37,670  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am the sin and the fear and the
darkness! The ship's not stable!

624
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,093  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is he? What the hell is he? !

625
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:45,060  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
I shall never die!

626
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,820  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
The thought of me is for ever!

627
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,255  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
In the bleeding hearts of men, in
their vanity and obsession and lust!

628
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:54,492  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nothing shall ever destroy me!
Nothing!

629
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,790  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go to hell.

630
00:41:07,317 --> 00:41:09,979  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Emergency shield!

631
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:16,068  X1:078 X2:267 Y1:488 Y2:523
BEAST HOWLS

632
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,582  X1:078 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've still lost the gravity funnel.

633
00:41:20,622 --> 00:41:22,303  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can't escape the black hole.

634
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:25,419  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
But we stopped him. That's
what the Doctor would have done.

635
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:29,150  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Some victory. We're going in. . .

636
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:48,155  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
The planet's lost orbit.
It's falling!

637
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:11,045  X1:078 X2:353 Y1:488 Y2:523
THE DOCTOR LAUGHS

638
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:17,443  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
The planet's gone.

639
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:20,150  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry. Accelerating.

640
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,277  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
I did my best.

641
00:42:23,317 --> 00:42:28,110  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
But hey, first human beings
to fall inside a black hole,

642
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,548  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
how about that?

643
00:42:30,588 --> 00:42:33,130  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
History.

644
00:42:44,258 --> 00:42:47,204  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
What happened?

645
00:42:51,284 --> 00:42:54,122  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're turning.

646
00:42:54,162 --> 00:42:55,882  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're turning around.

647
00:42:55,922 --> 00:42:57,998  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're turning away!

648
00:42:58,038 --> 00:42:59,796  X1:078 X2:391 Y1:488 Y2:523
COMMUNICATOR HISSES

649
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:03,952  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Sorry about the hijack, Captain.
This is the good ship Tardis. '

650
00:43:03,992 --> 00:43:07,030  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, first things first,
have you got a Rose Tyler on board?

651
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,907  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm here! It's me!

652
00:43:08,947 --> 00:43:11,108  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God! Where are you?

653
00:43:11,148 --> 00:43:13,025  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm just towing you home.

654
00:43:13,065 --> 00:43:16,581  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Gravity, shmavity - my people
practically invented black holes.

655
00:43:16,621 --> 00:43:19,698  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
In fact, they did. Couple of
minutes, we'll be nice and safe.

656
00:43:19,738 --> 00:43:22,135  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, and Captain? Can we do a swap?

657
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:27,207  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Say, if you give me Rose Tyler, I'll
give you Ida Scott, how about that?

658
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:30,444  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's alive? ! Thank God.

659
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:33,680  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, bit of oxygen starvation,
but she should be all right.

660
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,717  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
I couldn't save the Ood.

661
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:38,358  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I only had time for one trip.

662
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:40,755  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
They went down with the planet.

663
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:43,071  X1:078 X2:279 Y1:488 Y2:523
TARDIS BLEEPS

664
00:43:43,111 --> 00:43:44,911  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Entering clear space.

665
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:47,368  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
End of the line. Mission closed.

666
00:44:06,284 --> 00:44:10,322  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
'I don't know, I can't remember. '

667
00:44:10,362 --> 00:44:12,479  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, it looked like a box!

668
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,277  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
What d'you mean, a box?

669
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:18,113  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Down in the hold. A big blue box.

670
00:44:18,153 --> 00:44:21,111  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
It just appeared - I don't know!

671

'Zack, we'll be off now.
Have a good trip home. '

672
00:44:25,468 --> 00:44:28,784  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
And the next time
you get curious about something. . .

673
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:32,779  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, what's the point?
You'll just go blundering in.

674
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:36,935  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
The human race! But Doctor. . .
what did you find down there?

675
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:39,170  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
That creature, what was it?

676
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,487  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know.
Never did decipher that writing.

677
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:46,644  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
But that's good! Day I know
everything, I might as well stop.

678
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,960  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you think it was? Really?

679
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,078  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think. . .we beat it.

680
00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:55,559  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's good enough for me. It said
I was going to die in battle.

681
00:44:57,872 --> 00:44:59,555  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then it lied.

682
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,746  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523

685
00:45:07,944 --> 00:45:11,738  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hang on though, Doctor.
You never really said. . .

686
00:45:11,778 --> 00:45:14,737  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You two. . .who are you?

687
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:18,662  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. . .the stuff of legend.
