1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:03,628
Good morning, Greendale!

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,877
As you know, it is april fool's day.

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,476
Just kidding...
It's the day before april fool's.

4
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:12,678
You know what, Leonard?
Strike two!

5
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:18,142
<i>Anyway, just reminding you
to keep any april fool's prank</i>

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,519
<i>physically safe,
politically balanced,</i>

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,302
<i>and racially accessible.</i>

8
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:25,657
<i>When in doubt, check the guidelines
in our college pranks literature.</i>

9
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:28,833
"Guidelines
for school-sanctioned pranks."

10
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,821
Reminds me
of my favorite college comedy.

11
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:33,280
- Which one?
- Exactly.

12
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:34,953
The dean doesn't get it.

13
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:37,785
The point of a practical joke
is to shake up the system.

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,247
For example,
who wants some of these?

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,529
Cool, yeah.

16
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:47,471
- Looking for something?
- Nice.

17
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,361
They allow volunteers
for campus security

18
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:52,634
during times
of heightened shenanigans.

19
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,969
I want to be security.

20
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,013
Let's do it together.
We can be partners.

21
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,195
That's a buddy cop movie
I would watch.

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,810
But who would be by the book,
and who would be the bad-ass.

23
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,896
Abed, you're so silly.
I'd be the bad-ass.

24
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,066
Greetings, mortals!

25
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:09,568
Morning!
Snake in a can?

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,404
No, thanks. I'm fasting.

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,657
My buddhist church is having
its annual ascension ceremony,

28
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,447
and I will be becoming

29
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:19,822
a level six laser lotus.

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,041
I know. I was speechless too.

31
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,502
Anyway, I have to detoxify
for the ceremony.

32
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:30,256
I get all the nutrients I need
with salt water and honey.

33
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,435
Even better
if it goes down the wrong...

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,595
the wrong pipe.

35
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:39,485
So what happens in level six?

36
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,017
Nobody in my hive
has ever seen a six.

37
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,618
But from what I hear,
I'll have immunity to germs,

38
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:46,021
psychic ability,

39
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,606
and improved night vision.

40
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,358
Any bonuses to your <i>kombat score?</i>

41
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,582
I assume I'll fight better
if I can see more.

42
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:52,528
Dumb ass.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,128
Pierce, I just remembered.

44
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:57,897
Right before you got here,
some guy was delivering

45
00:01:58,022 --> 00:01:59,869
level six ceremonial robes?

46
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:02,079
What?!
Why didn't you tell me?

47
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,748
If you run, you can catch him.

48
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,169
Way to use your brain, Winger.

49
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,920
How fast can you run
to the theater department?

50
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:10,796
37".

51
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,840
Don't come back without
something ridiculous.

52
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,239
Got it.

53
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:18,285
You realize
you're exploiting the naivete

54
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,890
of a man who is being brainwashed
by a cult?

55
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:23,653
It sounds a lot less fun
when you say it.

56
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:25,478
Everything does.
She's a buzz kill.

57
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm not a buzz kill.

58
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,074
That doesn't really describe it.

59
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,099
You're more of a fun vampire,

60
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:34,695
because you don't suck blood,
you just suck.

61
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,699
- He wasn't there.
- I think Abed found him.

62
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:40,653
Give me that.

63
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:47,583
Amazing.

64
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,504
It is absolutely gorgeous.

65
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,170
How do I look?

66
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:55,299
Magical.

67
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,425
Great.

68
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,587
Of course, the only one
who doesn't like this is Britta.

69
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:03,849
Do you ever get tired
of being a buzz kill?

70
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,490
- Feygnasse Team -

71
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,234
.:: La Fabrique ::.

72
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:11,198
1x20: The Science of Illusion

73
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:13,651
This is gonna be exciting, ladies.

74
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:17,196
I hereby deputize you
as campus security

75
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,123
for 48 hours.

76
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,491
Windbreakers.

77
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:24,602
Whistles.

78
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:36,463
I only have the one pepper spray.

79
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:37,588
It's mine.

80
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:40,094
But I'll get my groceries
in a better neighborhood.

81
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:41,769
I'll carry it.

82
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:44,538
Between the two of us,
I'm sort of the bad-ass.

83
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:46,308
You are?
How do you figure?

84
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,227
How did you figure I wasn't?

85
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,645
I guess I didn't figure

86
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,689
'Cause I was busy
being the obvious bad-ass.

87
00:03:52,244 --> 00:03:54,080
Sounds like
we're both pretty convinced.

88
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:56,151
We'll find out who's right
once we're on the job.

89
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,570
I guess we will.

90
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,990
- Sorry, what is going on here?
- A twist on a classic formula.

91
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:04,816
With buddy cops, one's a straight-laced
stickler, and the other's a renegade.

92
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:07,037
But these two have equal
claim to both roles.

93
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,497
And why are you here?

94
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:10,123
Short answer:

95
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,959
My cable went out.

96
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:16,941
Can I run something by you?

97
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:20,259
I was thinking of pulling
a little prank tonight.

98
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,142
For april fool's, a prank.

99
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:25,055
You know how they have live frogs
in the anatomy lab?

100
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:27,433
I was gonna sneak in there,

101
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,894
get a frog, and then tomorrow,

102
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,854
when señor Chang's class is coming in,
there will be a frog on his desk,

103
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:34,857
wearing...

104
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:42,156
You're done.

105
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,729
- Did you read the hat?
- Señor Chang.

106
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,330
- You don't get it.
- I guess I don't.

107
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,040
The frog is Chang.

108
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:54,820
- I did get it. It's funny.
- I know it's funny.

109
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:58,547
I forgot... It's not your kind of joke.
It's not at anyone's expense.

110
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,781
Why waste your time
envying my gift for levity

111
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:04,086
when there's so much you could be doing
with your natural talent for severity?

112
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:08,812
My prank will cause a sea of laughter,
and I am gonna watch you drown in it.

113
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,768
That a girl!

114
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,315
- Seven.
- That's right.

115
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,110
- I can read minds.
- No way.

116
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:22,969
What color am I thinking of?

117
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:24,406
Pink?

118
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,860
What the hey?

119
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,095
Must be the robe.

120
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:32,581
Cookie crisp.
Cookie crisp.

121
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:34,994
- Is he talking to me?
- No.

122
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:38,205
That guy came back
that brought your robes

123
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,798
and said he forgot to deliver this.

124
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,299
What is it?

125
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,301
He said it focuses your powers?

126
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:54,773
Is that a cookie?

127
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,065
Maybe it's a piece of meteor.

128
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,109
Buddha arrived on a meteor!

129
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,986
When was the last time he ate?

130
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,642
I am the coolest guy

131
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:06,991
in the world.

132
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:24,925
Hello, Mr. Frog.

133
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,969
Can I borrow you for a second?

134
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,830
<i>"I am señor Chang.</i>

135
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:36,311
Now tell me that's not funny.

136
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:39,231
Wait!

137
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:41,699
Here froggy, froggy.

138
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,031
Here froggy.

139
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,992
Now real quiet.

140
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:11,652
That's horrible!

141
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:20,647
What makes it worse
is this was a brand-new sign.

142
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,442
I don't want this to tarnish
our school's reputation.

143
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,986
Don't worry, our school's reputation
is worse than this.

144
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:29,948
Here's our campus security.
Stop right there.

145
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:31,700
Ladies, don't pull up...

146
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,664
Mornin', boys.

147
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,551
I'm Annie Edison.

148
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,356
People call me "psycho"
'cause I had a breakdown in high school.

149
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:44,713
My partner's a christian housewife.

150
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,931
- Can we help you?
- Can we not help you?

151
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:52,137
- I tend to play by my own rules.
- She loves rules. I only have one.

152
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:55,307
Stay out of my way.

153
00:07:57,451 --> 00:07:59,603
Stay out of mine more.

154
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,939
You know what?
This is misdemeanor vandalism.

155
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:04,108
You can take care of it yourselves.

156
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,946
Wait, wait, wait...
What?

157
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,347
- Call us when you find a perp.
- Yeah, we'll be waiting.

158
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,283
- You go.
- Look what you have done!

159
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:18,095
Tell them they got 24 h
to solve the case.

160
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,124
You have 24 hours to solve it,
or else.

161
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:21,875
Figure it out!

162
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,420
That's the poster.

163
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:29,299
This is the part of my job
that I enjoy the least.

164
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,911
The part where I inform you that,
last night,

165
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:35,639
someone murdered
a partially clothed animal

166
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,101
and threw a human corpse
out a window.

167
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,244
You can thank the person that did it,
a person that may be in this room,

168
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:45,732
for the fact that, from now on,

169
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,943
april fool's day is banished.

170
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,418
At Greendale, april 1st

171
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:53,574
is officially march 32nd, forever!

172
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,450
How do you know it was one of us?

173
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:58,838
If I may answer
a question with a question,

174
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:01,749
why are you dressed like a wizard?

175
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:07,796
Is he having a stroke?

176
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:09,923
I'll tell you how I know!

177
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,178
Security officers Bennett and Edison

178
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,467
found this at the scene.

179
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,973
This hat says "Chang" on it.

180
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,004
We ruled out your teacher,

181
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,935
'cause he has
a crippling fear of frogs.

182
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:24,730
I told you that in confidence!

183
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,192
How about whoever did this
just fesses up?

184
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:36,849
That wasn't just a cadaver
that was thrown out that window.

185
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:38,202
It was a person.

186
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,329
With family and friends.

187
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:44,223
And for every day
that nobody confesses,

188
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:46,848
this class will be meeting
one of them.

189
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:50,714
Glenda! I apologize.
Can you come on in here?

190
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,300
And tell us about your son.

191
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,642
Hello, everyone.

192
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,269
Harry was a wonderful man.

193
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:06,563
He kept a dream journal.

194
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:08,148
Page one.

195
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,150
"I had that dream

196
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,144
"again"

197
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:13,153
"where I'm in a forest.

198
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,155
"But the trees are pencils."

199
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:21,734
Impressive.

200
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,302
And hilarious.

201
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:26,208
- You gonna'fess up, weirdo?
- It wasn't me.

202
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,809
And even if it was,

203
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:33,006
- this was an accident.
- I knew it. Well done.

204
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:35,748
If I come forward,
it's gonna play into the whole

205
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:37,594
"Britta's a buzz kill" mythology.

206
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,427
Well, the toe tag fits, Britta.

207
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:41,157
You single-handedly killed

208
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:44,059
an entire school's buzz,
not to mention a frog.

209
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,560
And according to Glenda,

210
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,826
cadaver Harry had 13 nieces
and nephews

211
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,583
that I'm not interested in meeting.

212
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,740
So you better think
about coming clean

213
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:53,931
or I'm just gonna
tell everybody you did it.

214
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,521
Star-burns doesn't do very much.

215
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:04,329
I guess fascinating people don't resort
to shapes on their faces.

216
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,581
He makes a false move,
I'm gonna Shirley on him.

217
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:09,251
That's what my high school friends
called crazy.

218
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,462
Yeah? Are you gonna go Shirlier
than I did when I got addicted to pills?

219
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,604
Why you concerned with being
a bad-ass?

220
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,011
Everyone thinks of me as a little girl!
I wanna be in charge of how I'm defined.

221
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,595
How do you think I feel?

222
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,470
You have two kids, and they stick you.
I'm not done yet.

223
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:25,919
- I still got moves.
- I haven't even started yet.

224
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:28,353
I've got moves
I haven't even seen before.

225
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:32,741
Blocked call.

226
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,807
<i>The man you're looking for</i>

227
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:38,670
<i>is Jeff Winger.</i>

228
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,574
- <i>Jeff Winger.</i>
- Who is this?

229
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:45,579
I didn't recognize the voice.
They say Jeff Winger's our man.

230
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,665
Drop 'em if you smoke 'em.

231
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,822
- Cut to action sequence.
- Let's roll.

232
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:53,211
Security comin' through.

233
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,061
Mr. Winger.

234
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,634
Cagney, Lacey.
What can I do you for?

235
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:02,679
- Just doing a routine search.
- What is this? What do you have here?

236
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,848
- That's my chest.
- Why don't you spread 'em?

237
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,809
I can pat too.

238
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,312
I can do it too.
So, what do you got in the bag?

239
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,613
Let's see what we have here.

240
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,285
Holy Mary, mother of pearl.

241
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,090
What do we have here?

242
00:12:20,215 --> 00:12:23,200
Looks like enough tiny items to equip
an amphibious mariachi band.

243
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:24,409
Of frogs.

244
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,867
That is not my stuff.

245
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:28,914
- Britta planted that.
- Sure she did.

246
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,390
Tell that to what our equivalent
of a judge is.

247
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:36,421
He's getting away!

248
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:38,256
I'm not gonna like you!

249
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:45,180
He's right there.

250
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,646
You gotta go faster!

251
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:49,119
- What are these doing here?
- He's getting away!

252
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:51,599
- Go after him on foot.
- I'm going after him on foot.

253
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:54,005
- Cut on the other side.
- I'm cutting on the other side!

254
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,399
Tell me what you doin'.

255
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:58,276
Stop, or I'll shoot!

256
00:12:58,774 --> 00:12:59,993
I said stop!

257
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:12,318
Oh, it burns!

258
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,610
Great.
He got away!

259
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:24,594
Good job.

260
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,482
He got away
because of your driving, grandma.

261
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,516
I beg your pardon. Hannah Montana!

262
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,601
I'm sorry.
Are you hard of hearing?

263
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,520
This is why
you have hardly any friends.

264
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,022
- Looks like I have one less.
- Do I look like I'm crying?

265
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,335
These are not tears!

266
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,986
This is self-inflicted friendly fire,
okay?

267
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,737
That's what happens to children!

268
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,281
You have no idea...

269
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,905
Excuse me...
I have to go to the bathroom.

270
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,905
I'll give you the rest of these
chocolate if you save my seat.

271
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,919


272
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,167
I don't want you to feel
judged by this,

273
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,049
but your handling of this job
has disappointed me.

274
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:05,135
Your high-speed pursuit caused

275
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,538
$78 dollars worth of damages.

276
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:10,223
And you didn't even get
a statement out of Mr. Winger?

277
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,559
- He got away.
- He ran between two poles.

278
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,103
I see how that would be frustrating,
but the fact is...

279
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,919
- Your ass is on the line.
- My ass is on the line.

280
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:20,954
- You got off the phone with the mayor.
- I got off the phone with the...

281
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,945
- What? The mayor? Stop doing that!
- You're not doing this right.

282
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,703
Maybe you should do it.

283
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:31,286
I'm sick and tired of making excuses
for you two!

284
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,079
You're embarrassing the department!

285
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,541
You're off the case and off the force.
Your badges, your windbreakers, now.

286
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:39,377
Now!
I ain't got all day!

287
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:41,844
Agitated my sciatica.

288
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,007
I'm too old for this!
Now get out of my sight.

289
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:46,134
Thought you were bad-asses.

290
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:48,094
Real bad-asses work together.

291
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:51,765
All I see is a housewife
and a girl scout.

292
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,684
I said get out!

293
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,480
And don't even think about getting near
this case.

294
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,358
Pretty harsh.

295
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,297
Don't worry.
That's what they needed.

296
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,737
That was embarrassing.

297
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:08,792
I know.

298
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:12,073
That african-american police chief
character Abed was playing was right.

299
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:14,006
We should have worked as a team.

300
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,528
I don't know about you.

301
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:18,750
I don't need a badge to finish this.
I say we nail Winger to the wall.

302
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:20,816
- Together?
- Together.

303
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,506
How do you spell "testicles"?

304
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:27,133
Nice frame job, Britta-Dict Arnold.

305
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,840
Colonial burn.

306
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:31,596
Where is
that trademark gift for levity?

307
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:33,056
Well, well, well.

308
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,403
Look who we found.

309
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:36,520
Yes, how foolish of me to hide

310
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,937
in my regularly
scheduled study group.

311
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:42,380
Let's just do this the easy way.
Confess.

312
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,110
I can prove that Britta
has thrown the body.

313
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,114
How?

314
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,488
Britta was going to put a frog
wearing a sombrero

315
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:52,360
on Chang's desk because that's the kind
of thing she thinks is funny.

316
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,326
Don't you?

317
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:56,746
Then why is there a photo
on your facebook page

318
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:58,123
of a cat

319
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,591
wearing a necktie?

320
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:00,959
It's my cat.

321
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:04,296
And the tie makes him...

322
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:06,798
Formal.

323
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,243
This investigation

324
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:10,083
is going nowhere.

325
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:12,053
You need a psychic.

326
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,582
Perfect.

327
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,336
This process may alarm you.

328
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,565
So gay.

329
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,865
Dark nightclub.

330
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:30,193
Throbbing music.

331
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:33,114
Men's roo...
Men's room stall.

332
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:35,786
Penis!

333
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:37,329
Two penises!

334
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:40,672
This is gay!
It's so gay!

335
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:44,169
- What?
- Sit down!

336
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:45,971
We'll take it from here.

337
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:49,132
Where were you last night?

338
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:50,884
- At a bar.
- Called it!

339
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,094
- Who can confirm that?
- Your mama.

340
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:58,308
What the hell, Annie?

341
00:16:58,604 --> 00:17:01,561
Her name's not Annie. It's psycho.
And I'd tell her what she wants to hear.

342
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,237
That's right,
because if I hand you off to Shirley,

343
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:06,756
you're gonna enter a kitchen
of pain.

344
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,667
Guys, stop it!

345
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:10,506
Stop it. I did it.

346
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:12,709
I framed Jeff.

347
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:14,537
I'm sorry, Jeff.

348
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:17,327
- But why?
- Because I'm a buzz kill,

349
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,802
that's why. Because...

350
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,539
that's who I am.
That's my role.

351
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,249
You guys, you create fun,

352
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,918
and I destroy it.

353
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,518
Of course a silly little joke ends
with a...

354
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:29,803
a dead body on the lawn.
I should have known that.

355
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:32,261
But I wanted to do it,
'cause I wanted to be like you.

356
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,718
I wanted to be funny.

357
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,101
Knock knock!

358
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:36,632
Who's there?

359
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:37,717
Cancer!

360
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:39,886
Good! Come on in!

361
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:41,351
I thought it was Britta!

362
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:47,857
I actually wanna be taken
more seriously.

363
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:51,057
The only reason I slammed
Jeff's head against the table

364
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:53,613
was because I wanted
to feel like an adult.

365
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:56,491
Like Shirley!

366
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,306
And I wanted to feel younger,
like Annie.

367
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:03,372
It's not that I'm really old,
people don't know how young I really am.

368
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:05,875
I'm doing it again.
I hate that I obsess about my age.

369
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:09,629
I wish I was really magic.

370
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,339
You know you're not?

371
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:15,981
Somebody must have sent
these robes by accident.

372
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,013
I only pretended I was level six
to impress you guys.

373
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:20,929
I got held back!

374
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,269
I don't deserve this

375
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,645
buddhist meteor wand.

376
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:30,862
It's not a meteor!
It's a cookie wand!

377
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,862
Me and Jeff made it because

378
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,545
it made you look more
like the cookie crisp wizard.

379
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,700
Which is not even a reference I get

380
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,461
because the cookie crisp mascot
wasn't a wizard when I was a kid.

381
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:44,064
It was a burglar.

382
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:46,483
I just...

383
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:49,989
pretended like I knew because
I wanted Jeff to think I was smart.

384
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:54,196
Great, I did again!

385
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,967
I killed the buzz.

386
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,484
Maybe...

387
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,742
maybe "buzz kill"
is a bad choice of words.

388
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,957
What's a good choice of words?

389
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,762
Look, I have no...

390
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,112
you're like the dark cloud
that unites us.

391
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:18,753
Or the anti-Winger.

392
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:23,495
You're the heart of this group.

393
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,335
I don't have a...

394
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,546
real handle on all this mushy stuff.
If I did,

395
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:30,952
then

396
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,816
we wouldn't need you.

397
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:38,134
- Get over here.
- Really?

398
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:45,598
Let's never let Jeff
divide us again.

399
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,356
Why are you and I the only sane...

400
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:51,750
Just watch.

401
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:53,316
It's beautiful.

402
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,911
- Troy, do you want a bite of my wand?
- I do.

403
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,693
- We really appreciate you doing this.
- Sure.

404
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:04,478
<i>Troy and Abed in the mornin'.</i>

405
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,620
We're back.

406
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,665
- Look who's here. Jeff Winger.
- Jeff, how do you stay so fit?

407
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,209
Diet, exercise, genetics.

408
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:13,493
Sure.

409
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:15,839
It seems we have a clip.
You wanna set it up for us?

410
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,008
I'd like to, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

411
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,542
We'll just roll it.

412
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,035
My name's Jeff Winger.

413
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,039
I'm Jeff Winger. I'm so tall.

414
00:20:25,164 --> 00:20:26,468
This watch is expensive.

415
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,601
- Muscles are everywhere.
- That was really funny.

416
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,429
- What's going on? Where is the camera?
- We're not filming this.

417
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:34,425
- No, who'd want to watch this?
- Oh, guys, it's 6:00 a.m.

418
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,400
Jeez!

419
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,126
We're not gonna have him back.

420
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:42,009
- <i>Troy and Abed in the mor</i>...
- No!
