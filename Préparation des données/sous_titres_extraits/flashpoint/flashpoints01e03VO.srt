1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
Look at me!

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,360
You sold me out.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,280
Sean, I didn'T. I didn'T.

4
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,810
Sean, sean, listen to me. Listen
to me, just put the gun down, okay?

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,520
That's not gonna...
that's not gonna help.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,140
trouble. Geddes's moved.
He's in the line of fire.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,920
Hold. Hold. We need
keenan's phone number.

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,780
Your guys are at the door, get him out.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,620
Okay, team, I'm gonna start
talking. Jules, you're my secondary.

10
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:25,450
Sean, you don't want
to do this, man. Okay?

11
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:26,936
I invest in you.

12
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,835
Look, let's think it through, okay?

13
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:31,037
And you spit on all that
to make yourself a deal?

14
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:32,251
It couldn't be jacks, okay?

15
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,321
Just leave the kid alone.

16
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,310
- You had a future.
- Don't do it.

17
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:42,223
One more word.

18
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,423
Sean, please.

19
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:46,952
I trusted you.

20
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:49,321
It wasn't me.

21
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:07,512
{\a6}<i>3 hours earlier</i>

22
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:08,461
Milk-delivery guy show?

23
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:11,380
Uh, yeah, half an hour ago.

24
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:14,962
Awesome. It's so great how the
shipments arrive in time for my shift.

25
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:18,723
Yeah, well, it's done. Uh,
soy milk, whole, fat-free.

26
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:20,943
Sugar packs are refilled and sticks.

27
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,182
My hero.

28
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:26,963
You got a date?

29
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:29,080
Uh, yeah.

30
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,122
Really.

31
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:32,801
You didn't go with flowers.

32
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:36,260
No, they don't play so well
with the four-year-olds.

33
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:42,602
so, see you tomorrow.

34
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:44,973
Julia, what're you doing after?

35
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:46,821
I dunno.

36
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:50,240
Um, maybe I'll swing by later.

37
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:53,343
Okay.

38
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:57,372
Okay. Um, I'll see ya.

39
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:04,630
Hey, ed?

40
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:07,390
- Got you a new mugshot.
- Thank you, sally.

41
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,730
- Warrant?
- Not yet. New mugshot.

42
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:19,102
We're sure he's gonna be alone, right?

43
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:20,931
We don't proceed unless he is.

44
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:22,512
And when we do, it's a no-knock deal.

45
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:24,940
It's all about the first
three seconds of engagement.

46
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:27,612
We lose the element of
surprise; whole new rulebook.

47
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:28,831
Wordsworth: Who's their inside man?

48
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:32,921
Naismith's isn't saying, but they've had a
narcotics cop deep undercover for 8 months.

49
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:33,991
And today is christmas.

50
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:35,650
And it's a record-breaking score.

51
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,511
A brief little window of opportunity
before it disappears onto the street.

52
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:39,513
Eight months of prep.

53
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:41,812
And they get to watch us
fly in for the grand finale.

54
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:44,030
You ain't got the guts...

55
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:45,940
that's why we get the cool pants.

56
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:47,473
That's what I'm saying.

57
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:49,923
Practice area reset.
We're a go for round five.

58
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,612
All right, guys, one more time.

59
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,461
Practice makes perfect.

60
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,703
- Ready, sam?
- I've cleared bad guys before.

61
00:02:58,057 --> 00:03:00,822
It's serving a warrant for the
search of the gentlemen's premises

62
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:03,743
for the highly corroborated
presence of narcotics.

63
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:06,701
Speed, surprise, and aggressive action.

64
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:08,503
Hey, so what about tonight?

65
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:09,642
Not gonna happen.

66
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,322
It's gonna be a long day,
you're gonna get hungry.

67
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:13,571
- Dinner's a very important meal.
- Sam.

68
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:16,332
A burrito and couple of
beers, what's the big deal?

69
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:21,401
All right, I'm not trying to flatter myself, I know
you're just being nice, I don't want to read into this.

70
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:25,861
I've just worked way too hard to be
here, to screw it up by getting personal.

71
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,271
It's not worth it. There's like 500
cops waiting to get into the sru.

72
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:33,913
500 guys waiting for me to
do something that I shouldn'T.

73
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:36,770
So, I'm sorry, but the team comes first.

74
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:39,353
Jules, it was just a burrito.

75
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,401
See you at practice.

76
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:55,593
Jackson.

77
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:58,551
- You can't just-
- I know.I, uh...

78
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,781
should have called, I'm sorry.

79
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:04,041
Hey, ella. Hey, how are you?

80
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:06,701
Sweetie, just go inside
for one sec, okay?

81
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:08,511
Corrie...

82
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:11,003
you're gonna show up here with a
toy and everything's gonna be okay?

83
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:12,820
- She's my niece.
- Not today.

84
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:15,092
Then when, all right?

85
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:18,422
It's eight months, four
days and I am clean.

86
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:22,742
I got a job, I'm doing the
steps and I miss my family.

87
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:24,261
I'm sorry, the money you stole...

88
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:27,800
- I'll pay it back.
- $680 dollars?

89
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:29,540
I'll pay it back.

90
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:34,582
That money was ella's for music lessons I promised
her, because $680 dollars takes a long time to save.

91
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:37,471
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you were sorry before.

92
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,213
Look, I promise...

93
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:41,443
it's always promises with you.

94
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:44,321
If you want me to trust
you, you gotta show it.

95
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:49,472
Okay. I'll get you the money.

96
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,762
Okay, you get the money
and then we'll talk.

97
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:52,831
- I will.
- Okay.

98
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:55,552
Today, I'll get you the
money. I'll pay you back.

99
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,671
Let's make this drill perfect, team.

100
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:09,190
Only one shot in real life.

101
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,221
Okay, team, aggressive
entry, our guy's firing.

102
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,112
Sam: Shoot on the
move, limit his angles.

103
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:17,081
Okay. Our guy's got a flamethrower.

104
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,633
Every eventuality, let's go.

105
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:21,103
Bravo team sends in a
dd, then rappels back up.

106
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:23,100
Lewis: Alpha comes in hard other side.

107
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,993
Okay, team, final rehearsal.

108
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:27,900
Keep sharp and stay in formation.

109
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:33,781
On my count: Three, two, one, go!

110
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,940
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!Down!

111
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:43,423
police! Down! Down! stay down!
Get down! Get down! Stay down!

112
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,442
Your breath is killing me, man.

113
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,083
sorry, shelly made cabbage rolls.

114
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:58,703
You want to file a less
lethal report on those.

115
00:05:58,735 --> 00:05:59,822
Whoa, watch it.

116
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:02,283
Let's see his hands.
Let's see his hands.

117
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,263
Get him up!

118
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:10,433
Subject secured. Again.

119
00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:12,071
Nice work, guys.

120
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,213
Say it.

121
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:14,440
- Again!
- Again!

122
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,012
Let's reload the window.
We're out of glass.

123
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:20,091
Thank you, corporal,
that was very convincing.

124
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,421
Good work, sam, you'll
stand our lead entry.

125
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:25,820
I'm sure our special ops guest will
agree that we covered every eventuality,

126
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,293
backwards and forwards
and in high heels.

127
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:32,741
Yeah, well, if your subject can fight these
guys off, tell him we could use him in kandahar.

128
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:34,650
Good.

129
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:38,711
All right, let's recap in the briefing room
while we wait for the warrant. Good job.

130
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:55,431
I was wondering if you could lend
me, I don't know, maybe, like, uh...

131
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,800
like $700 dollars or $600 dollars?

132
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:02,221
hey, uh, yeah, it's jackson.

133
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:06,053
I was just thinking maybe I could work for
a week or a couple of weeks, if that's okay.

134
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:10,462
no. Yeah. Okay.

135
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:13,092
Um, okay. Well, thank
you. Thank you very much.

136
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:19,023
uh, like uh... $600, $700
dollars. All right, no problem.

137
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,181
Thank you, though.

138
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,231
I could give you, like, forty dollars.

139
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:29,910
That's all I got right now,
but you can totally have it.

140
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:32,333
You know what, it's uh... it's
okay, don't worry about it.

141
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:33,571
It's not a problem.

142
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:37,681
Are you still gonna stop by? Jackson?

143
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:10,900
So, you're gonna join us or what?

144
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,566
My work here is done.

145
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,865
"Deeds not words," my friend.

146
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:17,227
- Isn't that right, braddock?
- That's right.

147
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,990
What do you mean, "deeds not words"?

148
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:20,850
Sarmypecial ops motto.

149
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,962
Used to be his motto.

150
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,053
Right, right. So how you been?

151
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:27,242
Sun always shines on kandahar.

152
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,160
Sally, is that warrant in?

153
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,960
Still waiting.

154
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:45,660
Yeah. Jackson.

155
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:47,510
Where you been, little man?

156
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:50,211
No phone call, no postcard.

157
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:54,933
All this time and that's the first
thing you ask, you ask me for money?

158
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:58,011
No, you know what? No problem.

159
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,100
Why don't you come over
and we can talk about it.

160
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:03,373
Okay, I'm on my way.

161
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,632
What's the deal on the
guy you're taking down?

162
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:18,172
Name's sean keenan, got a boatload of priors,
squeaked his way out of a couple homicide charges.

163
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:19,480
He's looking at his third strike today.

164
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,153
Oh, so he's got nothing to lose.

165
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,253
Aw, man, it's the worst kind.

166
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,442
But still, days like today...

167
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:27,220
- yeah, they make you feel alive. I know.
- That's right.

168
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:31,442
- Look, you know sam braddock was in our unit, right?
- Yeah.

169
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:34,790
What, something I should know?

170
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,243
It's not my place to say.

171
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:37,462
I don't do innuendo.

172
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,683
You got something to say about
a member of my team, say it.

173
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:41,552
I'm saying that...

174
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,070
watch your team's back.

175
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,070
- Good luck today.
- Yeah.

179
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:34,573
Warrants in. Team one,
you're up. You're up.

180
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:18,631
greetings.

181
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,623
Nothing if not punctual, huh?

182
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,863
What, only two sentries?

183
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,540
That's interesting, a day like today.

184
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:25,691
You want a
no-tip-off guarantee?

185
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,350
How 'bout we round up
the whole neighborhood.

186
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:29,701
How's it look?

187
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:31,382
It's good. Just waiting
on word from geddes.

188
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:33,872
Seconds away. Here's
the elevator service key.

189
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:35,420
Geddes' your undercover?

190
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:36,863
- Harlan geddes?
- Yeah, you know him?

191
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,793
Yeah, we partnered at 21 together.

192
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:40,462
Had a barbecue a couple of weeks ago.

193
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:41,403
What's his in?

194
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:43,832
He's worked his way up through the
ranks over the past eight months from,

195
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:46,163
uh, low-life to
mid-level runner.

196
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:49,970
Trust factor's pretty high, so ass-hat's givin'
geddes a slice to sell to the neighborhood kids.

197
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:51,390
Anything else we need to know?

198
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,950
Yeah, you know about the
double homicide, right?

199
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,512
Yeah-yeah, how'd he beat the rap?

200
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:55,622
Joys of the justice system.

201
00:11:55,638 --> 00:11:58,050
Look, if this guy feels
cornered, he's gonna bite, okay?

202
00:11:58,068 --> 00:11:59,532
Speed and surprise, we get it.

203
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:01,660
Yeah, you do this right,
geddes gets a shower and shave.

204
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:03,452
Takes miriam out someplace
nice for a change.

205
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:06,331
I thought "junkie chic" got you
into all the good restaurants?

206
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:08,233
Good to go?

207
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,693
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

208
00:12:12,537 --> 00:12:13,602
Did he say "ass-hat"?

209
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,483
He said "ass-hat".

210
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:20,991
Hey, nice shoes.

211
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:22,440
Hey, what's up, man?

212
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:24,302
You don't look at people
when they're talking to you?

213
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,410
My boy said he likes your shoes.

214
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:27,590
Yeah, thanks.

215
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,882
yo, I ain't hear no respect, B.

216
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:33,052
Yo, you better show some
respect before ya get slapped up.

217
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,641
Hey, yo, do I know you?

218
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:35,871
- Guys, look...
- nah!

219
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,192
Do I know you?

220
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,161
'Cause I don't know you and
you wanna walk my street?

221
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,703
Yo, you gotta drop some paper, B.

222
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,772
Hey, jackson?

223
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,911
Hey, man.

224
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:49,080
Jackson, what's up, man?

225
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:56,611
Yo, you wanna be careful, man.

226
00:12:56,626 --> 00:12:58,893
- You ain't been around in a while.
- Yeah.

227
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:02,341
You need some help? You
need me to hook you up?

228
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,763
Nah, I'm just here to see sean.

229
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:08,451
All right, man, don't
wanna hold you back.

230
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,382
Thanks.

231
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:31,340
- Hey, it's geddes.
- We're a go.

232
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,870
All right, planets are in alignment.

233
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,853
The shipment's in, target's alone.

234
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,381
This is it. Let's do this!

235
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:40,682
Alpha team,we're switching up: Sam, you're
gonna be three, I'm gonna take lead entry.

236
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:44,833
- We're changing the tac plan?
- Tac plan's a thing of beauty. Let's go.

237
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:47,673
- Jules, spike, drop us off, roofside.
- Why?

238
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:52,650
Because when you're democratically elected team
leader, you get to make autocratic decisions. Let's go.

239
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:55,920
Be careful, children.

240
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:09,070
And I've got you on screen.
Alpha bravo, proceed.

241
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:13,990
2:03 pm, elevated risk:
Narcotics warrant...

242
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:17,511
underway. Subject sean keenan.

243
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:21,682
Just like we drilled,
team. Secure, enter, arrest.

244
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,533
Floor 4.

245
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:26,960
Ladies blouses, perfumes and fragrances.

246
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:44,863
Okay, ed, our guys
are almost at the roof.

247
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,722
You know, I'm good here.

248
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,452
You want to check if your boy's
got the outer perimeter secure?

249
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:52,512
Oh, it's secure.

250
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:55,841
I wanna make sure your guys
get my 15 keys out in one piece.

251
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:02,690
how come we can never get along?

252
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:14,692
Bravo team?

253
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,642
- Bravo team?
- Gearing up.

254
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:24,361
Hey, a waste of time, man,
store's closed. Come on.

255
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:26,702
I'm not shopping.

256
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:31,170
Little man! Look at you, eh?

257
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,323
look at you.

258
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,260
Where you been all my life?

259
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:36,891
Hey, we're done.

260
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:38,802
You get that product on the
street. You're still on probation.

261
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,013
Yeah, I ran into jackson on the stairs.

262
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:42,380
We should hit it, man.

263
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:43,610
You two know each other?

264
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:45,660
Yeah, jackson and me go back.

265
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,700
Interesting.

266
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:48,512
Jacks, man, we should shake it.

267
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:51,140
- I got you covered.
- No, I got a better idea.

268
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:55,050
This is good.

269
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:01,061
Get in here.

270
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,953
Bravo team seconds away.

271
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,011
clear.

272
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:50,940
Looks good.

273
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:52,873
Alpha team holding.

274
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:55,680
- Bravo team, prepare to rappel.
- Copy.

275
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:04,272
Where's geddes?

276
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,202
He should be here by now.

277
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,362
Call him.

278
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:20,503
Alpha, bravo, action on my go.

279
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,113
Three...

280
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:32,212
two...

281
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:35,260
yo, I'm still busy with my friend, okay?

282
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:37,731
- Geddes is back inside.
- One.

283
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:39,701
Three...

284
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:41,403
two...

285
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,203
Yo, I'm still busy with my friend, okay?

286
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:46,222
- Geddes is back inside.
- One.

287
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:48,851
Hold, hold. Alpha, bravo, hold.

288
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:51,020
- Holding.
- Holding.

289
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,631
- Geddes's inside. What's he doing?
- I don't know.

290
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:54,562
Still holding.

291
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,150
- Plan's changed.
- Boss?

292
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,850
Fall back, fall back.

293
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,683
Okay.

294
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:02,920
you done?

295
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:05,632
Yeah. Sorry, client.

296
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:11,862
Jackson... see something you like?

297
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:18,111
You're not going in?

298
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:19,090
Give me the tenant profiles.

299
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,670
You know the street value
of the drugs in there?

300
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:22,522
Do you want your guy
caught in the crossfire?

301
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,352
We're falling back. Tenant profiles.

302
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:28,381
Alpha team, let's get eyes in.

303
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:30,651
All right, neighbours to the right.
There's trouble left. Trouble...

304
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,991
stairs?

305
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:33,810
- It's under renovation.
- That's good.

306
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:35,880
- Ed, sixth floor.
- Copy that.

307
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:38,610
Bravo team, fall back
to the sixth floor.

308
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:41,132
- Game's changed.
- Copy.

309
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:47,251
So much for speed and surprise.

310
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,892
So, jackson, you gotta meet
up with your probie today?

311
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:55,321
- no.
- No?

312
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:58,101
Were you on the breakfast tv this
morning, win the free makeover?

313
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:00,292
Yeah, guy looks sharph?

314
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:04,503
think I could clean up as good
as you? Shave and a haircut?

315
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:12,281
So, like, I was sayin',
we should get moving.

316
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll take care of you.

317
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:16,413
Uh, yeah. Yeah, okay.

318
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:17,622
What about your money?

319
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:19,662
- Oh, I'll come get it later.
- Yeah?

320
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,731
- Yeah.
- No.

321
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:25,242
Sit.

322
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:40,052
We need to ask you to evacuate while we take
care of a police investigation in the building.

323
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:42,690
Please exit as quickly as
you can down the stairs.

324
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:00,593
- so, jackson...
- Shut up.

325
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:03,921
So how long were you in for?

326
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:06,070
- Uh, thirty days.
- Thirty days?

327
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:08,431
Must be the choirboy face.

328
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:12,931
So, thirty days, but I haven't seen
you in - what? - Six, eight months?

329
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:15,033
Yeah, I've been busy doing some stuff.

330
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:17,481
Fix you something?

331
00:20:21,768 --> 00:20:24,263
no, man. Thanks, I'm good.

332
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:28,632
Thirty days go by, you're out
and about, you don't call...

333
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:31,311
I feel kinda hurt.

334
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:32,552
Yeah, sorry.

335
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,123
How do you guys know each other again?

336
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:37,112
- I used to see him at the grouse.
- Right.

337
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:41,912
See, smart guys like you don't come round too often
- case in point.

338
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,921
And we had a good thing
going, hm? Give me your bag.

339
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,552
Come on, man, I got customers waiting.

340
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:50,052
You're going into partnership.

341
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:53,133
You remember what I promised you?

342
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:55,081
Big things.

343
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:57,942
I keep my promises, little man.

344
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:04,431
This is me saying, "I want you back."

345
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:09,361
Show of faith. It's on me.

346
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,262
How much did you say you needed, huh?

347
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:14,211
You take this to the street,
you're back in the game.

348
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:18,132
Maybe even got a little
extra left over for yourself?

349
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:25,033
nah, man, I'm good. I'm just...

350
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:27,233
you sure you're good? 'Cause
you don't look so good to me.

351
00:21:27,248 --> 00:21:30,792
- And I'm not so sure who it is I'm talking to, who you turned into!
- What are youtalking about?

352
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:33,563
Sean, come on, man, chill.
It's jacks. It's all good.

353
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:35,593
I'm talking.

354
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:37,881
Can I trust you, little man?

355
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:43,532
Look me in the eyes, 'cause I think
you just failed your first test.

356
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:49,122
- Yo, we been lookin' for you, man.
- What's up?

357
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:51,713
- Cops on the roof,yo.
- Yo, it's swat.

358
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,512
Let's get that ball
camera outside the window.

359
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:04,363
Boss is right, we don't proceed
unless the subject's alone.

360
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:05,880
The undercover knows we're coming.

361
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:08,322
You don't wanna have to send
this guy out unexpected company.

362
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:09,823
Where are my eyes?

363
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:12,093
Coming up, boss.

364
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:16,551
Sean, come on, man, I just
came here for a loan, I swear.

365
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:20,621
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:27,493
Okay.

367
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:30,782
Okay.

368
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:41,572
- you getting this?
- Yeah, I'm getting it.

369
00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:44,302
Okay, that's geddes.

370
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:47,162
'Kay, geddes confirmed. That's keenan.

371
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:51,580
Well, we got somebody else here.

372
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:53,733
There's three individuals.

373
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:56,070
- Who's this?
- No idea.

374
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:59,331
Sally, I'm sending you a snap.

375
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:03,041
We've got a new subject in our friend's
loft, let's see if we can get some id on him.

376
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,310
Copy that, standing by.

377
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:06,760
I knew it!

378
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:08,562
- I could smell it on you!
- Sean! Sean!

379
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:10,060
Keep it cool, man. What's going on?

380
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:12,590
- You got your cop buddies outside?
- Cops?

381
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:14,510
Thirty days?I'm gonna kill
you, you lying piece of-

382
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:16,900
No-no, no-no, sean, I didn't
call the cops, I swear.

383
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:18,802
Come here.

384
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,243
You getting this, boss?

385
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:25,141
The gun's on the unknown, not geddes.

386
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:26,461
What the hell is going on?

387
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:29,281
- I said, come here.
- Sean, I would never do that to you.

388
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:32,483
I took you under my wing, I
gave you financial independence.

389
00:23:32,497 --> 00:23:35,751
Sean, sean, think about this,
man, it's not gonna help us. Okay?

390
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,650
all right, we got a
clean line, let's go.

391
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,091
- Geddes' not armed?
- No.

392
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:46,322
Team, I need options?

393
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,353
Aggressive entry, beta plan.

394
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:50,230
Jules, spike, five and six.

395
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:52,273
Spike, double up on
flashbangs. Let's go.

396
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:54,953
I'm only doing this because
I promised my sister.

397
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:57,072
Look at me!

398
00:23:57,088 --> 00:23:58,883
You sold me out.

399
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,872
Sean, I didn'T. I didn'T.

400
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:03,351
Sean, sean, listen to me. Listen
to me. Just put the gun down, okay?

401
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:06,100
That's not gonna...
that's not gonna help.

402
00:24:07,005 --> 00:24:09,762
Trouble. Geddes moved,
he's in the line of fire.

403
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:13,401
Hold, hold.

404
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:16,940
Give me keenan's phone number. come on.

405
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,863
Sean, you don't want
to do this, man. Okay?

406
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:22,542
I invest in you. I put my trust in you.

407
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,460
Look, let's think this through, okay?

408
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:26,661
And you spit on all that
to make yourself a deal?

409
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:29,991
It couldn't be jacks, okay?
Just leave the kid alone.

410
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:39,193
- You had a future.
- Don't do it.

411
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:40,821
One more word...

412
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:44,600
sean, please.

413
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,231
I trusted you.

414
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:48,441
It wasn't me.

415
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:59,241
Officer down!

416
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:01,413
Sally. E.M.T. 725 parliament.

417
00:25:01,428 --> 00:25:03,172
- No siren, no siren.
- Get him out. Get him out.

418
00:25:03,188 --> 00:25:05,431
No, keenan's still armed;
two people in the crossfire.

419
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:06,571
Just gimme his phone number.

420
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:08,532
Your guys are at the door, get him out!

421
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,191
'Kay, team, I'm gonna start
talking: Jules, you're secondary.

422
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:13,503
- Copy.
- Wordy, lewis, on sentry.

423
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:15,991
- Ed...
- I'm on it. Got it. Copy.

424
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:20,642
You still alive, douche?

425
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,550
- You want some more?
- No, no, no, no, no! Don't kill him. He's a cop!

426
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:23,920
He's not a cop, he's a lousy...

427
00:25:23,945 --> 00:25:28,013
he's a cop, okay? He's a cop.
Don't kill him. Don't make it worse.

428
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:32,120
You see that hit he took?
Shotgun blast out of a revolver.

429
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:34,560
That's no saturday night special.

430
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:36,922
We need a new entry plan.

431
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,791
There's no time. We
should be in there already.

432
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:42,483
Jules, stay on that monitor, let
me know if the geography changes.

433
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:44,542
Sally, I need you.

434
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:46,102
You know he's a cop
and you don't tell me?

435
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:48,222
I didn't know, okay? I just
recognized him just now.

436
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:51,113
He's one of the guys that arrested me.

437
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:55,090
jacks...

438
00:25:57,136 --> 00:26:00,201
hey, you will not negotiate this
while my guy bleeds to death.

439
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:02,901
You want a free-for-all, go in
yourself and take your chances

440
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:07,193
or you let me do what I'm here to
do and maybe people come out alive.

441
00:26:08,027 --> 00:26:10,192
damn it.

442
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:16,303
Sally, isolate the
phone line: 555-0166.

443
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:21,153
A cop. A frickin' cop.

444
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,640
Hey, we're you going?

445
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:24,391
- He's gonna to bleed to death.
- Let him.

446
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:26,500
You want to go down for murder, too?

447
00:26:26,516 --> 00:26:28,603
They ask you, you tell them...

448
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,563
- it was an accident.
- okay.

449
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:31,843
- He jumped me.
- Okay.

450
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:32,860
You saw it.

451
00:26:32,877 --> 00:26:35,843
He jumped me, there was a
struggle, the gun went off.

452
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:37,263
There was a struggle,
it was an accident,

453
00:26:37,277 --> 00:26:39,263
- He jumped me
- The gun went off, It was an accident.

454
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:40,722
It was an accident.

455
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:41,812
I can trust you on this?

456
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:44,923
- Yeah, you can, you can trust me, man.
- Okay...

457
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:46,933
you're not going anywhere.

458
00:26:46,947 --> 00:26:50,270
You and me, little man.

459
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:55,302
let's do this.

460
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:58,003
Bolt the door.

461
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:14,242
yeah.

462
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:17,503
This is sergeant greg parker with
the police strategic response unit.

463
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:19,331
Am I speaking with sean keenan?

464
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,870
Yes you are.

465
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:22,871
How can I help you, greg?

466
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,832
You want to tell me
what's going on here today?

467
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:29,090
Why, greg? What's on your mind, hmm?

468
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:31,823
Option a: We let the boss talk him out.

469
00:27:31,838 --> 00:27:35,241
Option b: We try to isolate keenan,
maybe we got a shot at a clean rescue.

470
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,652
What about immediate entry?

471
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:37,840
Wordy, hold off.

472
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,672
Well, sean, a firearm was
discharged in your vicinity -

473
00:27:41,686 --> 00:27:46,180
in your area, in your neighbourhood
- and we were just wondering if everyone in there was all right.

474
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:47,520
We're great.

475
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:50,091
Thank you very much for asking.

476
00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:53,542
And how 'bout you, greg? How you doin'?

477
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:55,993
hurry up!

478
00:27:57,995 --> 00:28:00,853
You know what, sean, let's cut the
pleasantries and get to the point, okay?

479
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,092
We both know why my team
and i are here, right?

480
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:08,021
Yeah? Well, why don't
you tell me all about it.

481
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:10,603
Thanks, sally.

482
00:28:10,628 --> 00:28:13,623
- Weapon keenan's carrying is called a "jury".
- A jury?

483
00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:15,112
It's a street name. It's new.

484
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,763
It takes five rounds
- shotgun and single bore.

485
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:20,531
- Explains the size of the wound.
- Yeah.

486
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:24,132
- Hey, man, hang on
- Easy, easy, easy.

487
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:26,382
You're gonna be okay, all right.

488
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:29,783
- You gotta- you should get out.
- You know how I remember you?

489
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:32,530
At the green grouse, it
was you who arrested me.

490
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,721
- sorry. - No-no-no,
man, don't be sorry.

491
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:37,033
Turned my life around.

492
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:41,143
Kid... go on, get out.

493
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,513
We got a guy dying in there.

494
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,962
He's in the line of fire.

495
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:54,451
And we also have an unknown
who's in the line of fire.

496
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:56,511
What are we saving cops
or we saving drug dealers?

497
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,033
Don't let it get personal, wordy.

498
00:28:58,045 --> 00:28:59,243
I'm just saying.

499
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:01,112
He had the gun pointed at the kid.

500
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:03,433
- Lover's quarrel.
- Body language.

501
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:06,421
Haircut, nice clothes,
it just doesn't add up.

502
00:29:06,438 --> 00:29:08,370
We do an explosive entry, flashbangs...

503
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:11,140
Keenan still has time
to fire his weapon.

504
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:13,442
He's right. We got
more than one life here.

505
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,593
I'm not putting this kid at risk.

506
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:19,361
I don't give a flying king-sized
crap what you do for a living.

507
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:22,302
I've got a friend in there and
I want to get him out alive.

508
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:26,443
You're a smart guy, I expect you're
fully familiar with how to use a toilet.

509
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:28,693
Hey, you've done this before.

510
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,280
I got nothing but the best
and brightest for you, sean.

511
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,392
Very important to us, so...

512
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:34,873
if we can both handle
this professionally,

513
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:37,282
the boys and I won't have to come
in there and trouble you at all.

514
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:39,760
So you do what you gotta do.

515
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:49,362
go on, get out.

516
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:51,783
No, man, we're both gettin' outta here.

517
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:53,822
Can't do it.

518
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:56,400
'Cause there's only a couple
of ways this can go, right?

519
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:59,562
We're not looking for
more people to get hurt.

520
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,331
This guy's on his third strike.

521
00:30:02,356 --> 00:30:03,800
It's gonna be all about
the blaze of glory.

522
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:05,210
How's geddes doing?

523
00:30:05,227 --> 00:30:06,181
He's hanging in there.

524
00:30:06,197 --> 00:30:09,003
- I don't know how much longer.
- Options.

525
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:12,331
We're not coming up with any other
choices, boss. We go through the window?

526
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,690
And he'll use you as
target practice. No.

527
00:30:14,707 --> 00:30:17,213
All right. Thanks, sal. Okay.

528
00:30:17,618 --> 00:30:22,172
Our unknown is jackson barcliffe,
21, a former client of keenan'S.

529
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,990
He was arrested 8 months
ago for possession.

530
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:28,151
His parole officer says that
he's been on the wagon ever since.

531
00:30:28,165 --> 00:30:29,691
On the wagon until today, I guess.

532
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:33,943
Sean, we can resolve this, peacefully,
right now, if you make the right choice.

533
00:30:33,977 --> 00:30:35,951
Place your weapon on the floor
and you come out your door...

534
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:38,513
okay, greg, I hear ya.

535
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:42,830
I just need to think
over my options over here.

536
00:30:53,857 --> 00:30:55,663
well, you do. You think
about those options,

537
00:30:55,678 --> 00:30:59,862
but you think about them very carefully because
you're already apprehended, right? That's a given.

538
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:02,130
- What about the kid?
- Come on, he's made his choice.

539
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:05,331
- How's he doing?
- He's still breathing.

540
00:31:18,856 --> 00:31:20,373
If you want to make things
better for your future,

541
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:24,163
you should think about showing us
that you can make the right choice.

542
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,311
Running out of time, ed.

543
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:28,881
yeah?

544
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:31,212
It's the kid in the room.

545
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,311
Jackson.

546
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:45,262
My name's ed, I'm a police
officer with the sru.

547
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,631
I want to help.

548
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:49,152
Okay, okay, let's talk.

549
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:54,291
Jackson, you did the
right thing calling.

550
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:56,760
The man who's shot, how's he doing?

551
00:31:56,776 --> 00:31:59,553
Uh, there's A... there's lot of
blood, he's bleeding pretty bad.

552
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:00,603
Okay, is he breathing?

553
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:02,251
Yeah-yeah-yeah,
he's breathing.

554
00:32:02,265 --> 00:32:04,462
Okay, his name's harlan. Now I
need you to do me a favour, jackson.

555
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:06,701
I need you to move your finger
back and forth in front of his eyes.

556
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:09,002
No, no, he's conscious, he's fine.

557
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,570
Okay, that's good. That's good.

558
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:14,961
Look, um, I can't talk
long, if sean comes in...

559
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,921
if he comes back, jackson,
just put the phone down.

560
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,931
Okay, just put the phone down,
but leave it on, all right?

561
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:20,403
That way we can hear you.

562
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:24,350
You make the smart choice and
that sends a positive message.

563
00:32:26,585 --> 00:32:27,990
this is all my fault.

564
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:31,331
This shouldn't have
happened, I just... I just...

565
00:32:31,346 --> 00:32:32,492
take it easy, jackson-

566
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:35,991
I, I need the money.I swear to
god I was clean. I'm clean now.

567
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,502
Jackson, that's amazing.
Are you doing the steps?

568
00:32:38,518 --> 00:32:40,393
Yeah, yeah. Eight months.

569
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:42,032
That's incredible. That's incredible.

570
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:45,311
That shows me that you got a lot
of strength; that you can do this.

571
00:32:45,335 --> 00:32:47,940
All right, you wanna help? I need you to
wrap that towel tight against his stomach.

572
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:51,443
Okay, he's still bleeding,
you gotta slow that down.

573
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:54,091
Okay, we gotta get in there.

574
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:55,942
We gotta get in there and do our job.

575
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,511
I don't wanna see you get
hurt, so I need you to get out.

576
00:32:57,535 --> 00:32:59,960
No-no-no, I'm not
leaving. This is my fault.

577
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:01,381
Nope, we've got an ambulance on the way.

578
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,002
It's my fault. I'm not leaving.

579
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:09,481
Okay. Take a look at the door. Do you
see anything unusual? Any boobytraps?

580
00:33:09,498 --> 00:33:12,083
Any wires around the frame,
around the door handle, any...

581
00:33:12,097 --> 00:33:14,500
No, no, it's two locks and a bolt.

582
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:17,163
Good. Okay, that's good news.

583
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:22,611
Okay, here's the thing, if we come in now, jackson,
you and geddes are right in the line of fire.

584
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:26,020
Okay, so what I'm gonna ask you to
do is move him to the other room.

585
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:29,003
Oh, god, I can try.

586
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:33,613
Jackson? Jackson?

587
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:39,352
Well, you know, greg, I, uh... I
appreciate the approach you're taking here.

588
00:33:39,368 --> 00:33:41,971
You sound like A... reasonable man.

589
00:33:43,227 --> 00:33:47,542
Well, greg, you know, uh...
I respect your point of view.

590
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,352
I do. Yeah.

591
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:55,302
'kay, man, I'm gonna
try and move you, okay?

592
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:58,523
All right, ready? Come on.

593
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:01,081
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

594
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,560
You know, I'd like to
deal with someone...

595
00:34:03,588 --> 00:34:07,622
- my name is harlan.
- What?

596
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:14,743
My name is harlan geddes.

597
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:20,642
Please... tell my wife...

598
00:34:21,108 --> 00:34:23,961
I, I love her.

599
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:27,183
we're losing him.

600
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:28,691
The kid's putting
himself on the line here.

601
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,911
No, we got an officer on the line here.

602
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:32,980
Careful.

603
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:41,802
Tell my boys... that I'm proud of them.

604
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:46,651
And I love 'em, okay?

605
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:48,260
Eddie...

606
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,300
you're gonna be fine, okay, man?

607
00:34:50,316 --> 00:34:53,190
It's all right. I just...
I just gotta move you, okay?

608
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:55,702
I'm sorry, it's gonna hurt.

609
00:34:58,207 --> 00:34:59,363
Okay.

610
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,303
Bravo team, gear up for rappel descent.

611
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:03,500
Stay out of the window
and prepare for flashbangs.

612
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:04,211
There's no time!

613
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:08,013
Sam, we lost surprise. A window
distraction buys us a couple of seconds.

614
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:29,133
- Keenan's onto him.
- End of the road, ed.

615
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:32,311
Immediate action! Beta plan!

616
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:33,362
Sam, damn it!

617
00:35:33,386 --> 00:35:36,630
Keenan, listen to me, this
is really important now.

618
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:39,133
Are you listening to me?

619
00:35:41,628 --> 00:35:43,290
greg, what's the story?

620
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,101
Damn it, sam, hold
formation! Hold formation!

621
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:54,162
- Damn it!
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

622
00:35:57,516 --> 00:36:00,312
- police, get down!
- Hold your fire, officers! Unarmed subject!

623
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:04,592
Get down on the floor! Get down on the
ground! Get down! Stay down! Get his hands!

624
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:06,863
Constable, likes it rough.

625
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:08,471
Clear!

626
00:36:09,006 --> 00:36:10,361
Wordy, how's geddes?

627
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,550
Emt! Get me an emt!

628
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:13,691
How's he doin'?

629
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:17,992
Jackson. I got you, buddy. I got you.

630
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:20,213
The paramedics are just
around the corner. I got you.

631
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:21,413
You're gonna be okay.

632
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:23,080
He's still breathing.

633
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,161
Move your hands. Move your hands for me.

634
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:30,173
You did it. You did
it, buddy. You did it.

635
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:32,373
You did those 12 steps,
you can do anything.

636
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:33,710
You gotta just keep talking. That's it.

637
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,963
You're gonna be fine, just keep talkin'.

638
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:38,992
You're fine. You're gonna just hang
on. Just keep talkin' to me, all right?

639
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:41,633
Okay, you're gonna be
okay. You're gonna be okay.

640
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:44,051
- You're all right, you're okay.
- Ella.

641
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:46,092
Who's ella? Who's ella, jackson?

642
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:50,433
She's such a goof.

643
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:55,581
no, she... she makes me laugh.

644
00:36:56,955 --> 00:36:59,651
Jackson, I bet she's proud
of you. Stay with me, jackson.

645
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:03,783
Jackson, who's ella? Jackson,
who's ella? Stay with me... jackson?

646
00:37:04,735 --> 00:37:06,743
Jackson?

647
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,920
Easy.

648
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,452
These guys said you're
gonna be fine, okay.

649
00:37:30,466 --> 00:37:33,250
I'm gonna call miriam myself.
You don't you worry about a thing.

650
00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:36,493
'Kay, I gotta go debrief.

651
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:39,082
I'm gonna check in on
you as soon as we're done.

652
00:37:50,455 --> 00:37:52,430
kevin, where you going?

653
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:55,642
I don't know.

654
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:59,592
- That was messed up.
- I know.

655
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:03,723
you okay?

656
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:17,110
Looks like geddes is gonna make it.

657
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:19,500
Too bad about the kid.

658
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,293
How else was it gonna end?

659
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:25,040
I don't know.

660
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:27,950
I don't know, but that is not your call!

661
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:29,782
And maybe I was wrong, sam. Maybe.

662
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:34,510
But I need to know that
my team is on my side.

663
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:38,363
- Then treat me like I'm on your team.
- What?

664
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:41,543
You wanna know what happened in
afghanistan? Is that what this is about?

665
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:46,041
I was taking out targets in a
stronghold, 1500 metres away.

666
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:49,462
The reccy was done,
I was cleared to fire.

667
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:54,390
We went down to do the id's,
one of them was my buddy matt.

668
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:58,121
I was sniping with a . 50 cal.

669
00:39:00,586 --> 00:39:03,982
He shouldn't have been
there, I was cleared to fire.

670
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,800
You just had to ask.

671
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,683
You go in on my command.

672
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:18,833
You keep entry formation and
you don't go in without a shield.

673
00:39:19,186 --> 00:39:21,943
- Are we clear?
- Sir.

676
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:48,210
* but often it happens you know *

677
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:56,873
* that the things you donít
trust are the ones you need most *

678
00:39:58,826 --> 00:40:03,822
* so it's cautiously into the dark *

679
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:12,043
* but you see before long
that your eyes will adjust *

680
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:20,173
* and under the night you can hear *

681
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:27,262
* the full moon rise
like a psalm in the air *

682
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:39,382
* and the air goes into your lungs *

683
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:47,002
* and around in your heart
and on through your blood *

684
00:40:50,028 --> 00:40:55,300
* goes cautiously into the dark *

685
00:40:56,906 --> 00:41:03,452
* and you see before long
that we all have a part *

686
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:14,403
* and the air goes into your lungs *
