1
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,051
Here's Joe.

2
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:55,985
Joe, nice to see you.

3
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:58,294
Nice to see you. Good to see you.

4
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,192
- Commander, how are you?
- How are you?

5
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:29,135
And that's why men like Joe are
the future of British policing.

6
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,179
No pressure there then.

7
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:39,485
Keep back.

8
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:43,393
Do not come any... closer.

9
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:51,705
Listen, you've been told once.
I don't want to tell you again.

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,982
We need bold initiatives
in community partnerships

11
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:59,039
to ensure good practice
within a management framework.

12
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,959
This is about the effective delivery
of sanctions to the stakeholders.

13
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:04,079
Stakeholders?

14
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,157
Five years ago we simply
called them criminals.

15
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:10,244
Excuse me, excuse me.

16
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,725
- Night.
- See you tomorrow.

17
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:55,679
My God!

18
00:02:57,363 --> 00:03:00,363
I've got you, love.
You're going to be all right.

19
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:03,839
PCSO Bousfield to control.
Receiving, over.

20
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,296
<i>Receiving you, Mary. Go ahead.</i>

21
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,439
Immediate assistant
and an ambulance required

22
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:11,199
at the old board school
off Commercial Street.

23
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,330
There you go, love.

24
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,319
Christ have mercy.

25
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,111
Fitz, coffee no sugar.

26
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,640
- Two teabags, Skip.
- Thanks.

27
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,957
- Usual, McCormack.
- People can't die at a decent time?

28
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,239
Got your own crappuccino
there, Kent?

29
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:06,363
Right, what have we got?

30
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,845
Let's get suited and booted, boys.

31
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,538
All impressed with you in there.

32
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:13,670
The good money's on you
making commander in three years.

33
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,983
- That's very generous.
- All part of the plan, Joe.

34
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,460
- Yes, sir.
- No need to be formal.

35
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:23,243
It's what your father wanted.
He'd be proud.

36
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,960
We've got a dead woman
in Whitechapel.

37
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:31,799
Probable domestic. No DI.

38
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:33,804
- Bit of a rough squad.
- I'll take it.

39
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,999
- Ready to head up your 1st murder?
- Absolutely.

40
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:37,165
Good lad.

41
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,319
Once you've ticked that box
we can move you on.

42
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,175
Get you out of the trenches and up
to headquarters where you belong.

43
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:46,345
- I don't know what to say.
- How about thank you?

44
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:47,898
Thank you, sir.

45
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:50,893
Excellent.

46
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:57,975
Commander Anderson's
sending us a new DI.

47
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,249
Good.

48
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,490
- Cos we don't know what we're doing.
- Another fast-tracker.

49
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,273
Had I've have known,
I'd have made vol-au-vents.

50
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:10,065
I'll tell the others.

51
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:36,277
Now that's a good look.

52
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,415
- DI Chandler.
- DS Miles.

53
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,007
We'll get you suited up. This way.

54
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,577
The victim's name was Cathy Lane.

55
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:53,668
43 years old. Mother of three.
Separated from her partner.

56
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:57,883
She was found around 2 am
by a community support officer.

57
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:00,134
Cathy was still alive

58
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:04,425
then but by the time the emergency
services got to her she was dead.

59
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:07,902
- Who identified her?
- We all did. Let's go.

60
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,643
Have you worked
a murder scene before?

61
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:13,642
I'm not a virgin, you know.
I've had my fair share.

62
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:15,962
Oh, well, you'll be laughing then.

63
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,199
Streak of piss.

64
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:25,378
- Hello, Ray.
- We've got to stop meeting like this.

65
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:28,243
Wouldn't be the same
without a dead body between us.

66
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:30,159
- Morning.
- DI Chandler.

67
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:32,479
Can you see the cuts to her throat?

68
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,039
On the side here
we have the first incision.

69
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,389
There is a second cut,
more decisive, right round.

70
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,039
This is a deep one. Seems to go
all the way through to the vertebrae.

71
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,060
- Do you want to get a look at this?
- No, I'm good, I'm good.

72
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,599
- There's not much blood.
- No, it doesn't look like much.

73
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,631
I know what you're thinking,
she was dumped but you'd be wrong.

74
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:56,184
It's all here. It's soaked
into her clothing. She's sodden.

75
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:58,599
It's Interesting,
there's no struggle.

76
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:02,513
There's a bruise here
and more on the other side with...

77
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,599
small petechial haemorrhages
around the eyes,

78
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,463
suggesting asphyxia.

79
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:11,011
I think she was strangled first
and this is how he dropped her.

80
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,170
Just a snapshot
based on obvious injuries.

81
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:15,605
Patience.

82
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:30,561
I want a plan of the area.

83
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:33,508
Fitzgerald and McCormack
are doing that.

84
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:37,468
Witnesses.

85
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:40,743
Mary Bousfield, Community
Support Officer. This way.

86
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:48,559
I saw a man with a long knife.

87
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:52,846
He was over 40. Dark coat.
About 5'10".

88
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,127
Posh but shabby.

89
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:59,199
- Had a funny hat.
- Funny, how?

90
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:01,201
Funny, unusual.

91
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,879
- Had flaps.
- Did you see his face?

92
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,959
I'm really sorry. I know police
aren't supposed to cry.

93
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:12,069
I cry all the time, Mary.

94
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:14,608
You should see my mascara run.

95
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:17,607
Thanks.

96
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:20,697
Let 'em get her off to hospital.

97
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:24,532
Cathy Lane was a battered woman.

98
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:28,964
She split from her partner 6 years ago.
Always arguing about money for the kids.

99
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:31,199
He wouldn't pay
while she lived with other men.

100
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,648
They'd have too much to drink,
have huge rows.

101
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:37,291
We were constantly banging him up
in the cells for the night.

102
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:40,634
Once he stuck a potato peeler
in her head. Bang, like that.

103
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,159
- I knew we'd find her dead one day.
- Who is this guy?

104
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,510
Rob Lees.

105
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,383
He's a butcher.

106
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:50,877
- Works with long sharp knives.
- Let's go and talk to Rob Lees then.

107
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,856
Don't you have a desk to go to?

108
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:54,559
No... I don't.

109
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:57,457
Let's go.

110
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,064
<i>- There you go, guv'nor. Lovely.
- Cheers, thanks.</i>

111
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,250
Police.
Can I have a word, please, sir?

112
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:24,615
- Hello, Jim.
- Got a new boy?

113
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:27,441
You'll get me into trouble.
He's the boss.

114
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:29,207
Can I help you, sir?

115
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:32,601
- Rob Lees.
- Rob's not here.

116
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:34,926
- Do you know where he is?
- Nah.

117
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:38,732
His mobile's switched off
and he's not picking up at home.

118
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,189
Has he been at Cathy again?

119
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:45,319
- Is she all right?
- She's dead.

120
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:50,199
Has Rob got a woolly hat?

121
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:53,215
- A woolly hat.
- No, he wears one of those...

122
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,199
furry Russian things with flaps.

123
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:57,389
Get Rob Lees' flat watched.

124
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,010
Can we find out
where his mobile is right now

125
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,345
and get someone down to his local?

126
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,912
He is, I know. But what can you do?

127
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,427
We'd better get a move on.

128
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:11,040
Before we go anywhere can we get
something straight?

129
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,160
- I'm in charge of this investigation.
- I'm just showing you the ropes, son.

130
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:23,501
I didn't expect this.

131
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:28,319
Welcome to hell, gentlemen.

132
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:42,994
I think the killer knelt by her head,
held her with his left hand,

133
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,594
then cut her throat left to right
with his right hand.

134
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,394
The blood would've
run away from him.

135
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:51,914
There are no cuts to her clothing so
I assume her skirt was pushed up.

136
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:56,078
<i>The community support pulled her skirt
down but she thought she'd been raped.</i>

137
00:11:56,761 --> 00:12:00,234
<i>Take swabs but I haven't seen
any physical signs of rape.</i>

138
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:04,070
And here's the surprise.
It's as if he's tried to gut her.

139
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,994
On the left-hand side, two inches
in, we have a deep, jagged wound.

140
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:10,985
On the right-hand side there are
four more cuts.

141
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,712
The stomach has been
cut in several places, and

142
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,947
the intestines have been exposed.

143
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:19,190
<i>I think he stayed at his position
at her head,</i>

144
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:22,794
<i>stabbed down, then draw the knife
towards himself quite violently.</i>

145
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:25,147
These cuts were done quickly.

146
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:28,194
I'd say the whole attack
would have been over in a few minutes.

147
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:31,594
- She wouldn't have known what hit her.
- Rob Lees is what hit her.

148
00:12:33,876 --> 00:12:36,634
- What can you tell us about the weapon?
- It has a strong blade.

149
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:39,394
Long? Like something
you use for butchering meat?

150
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:42,634
The thing is, skin stretches and
soft tissues compress

151
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,565
It's hard to talk about knife size.

152
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:47,834
- I can only speculate very generally.
- So speculate for me.

153
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,434
Something like a hunting knife.

154
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,514
- Or a boning knife?
- I can't rule it out.

155
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,342
Thanks, sweetheart.

156
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,265
And there he is. Half the division
out looking for him,

157
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,194
Rob Lees turns up on his own doorstep
looking like ten kinds of shit.

158
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:11,765
Been up all night,
smells like a pub.

159
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:14,183
- Tell your mum you'll be home for tea.
- Excellent.

160
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,754
- What are you doing?
- Going to interview the suspect.

161
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:20,874
Why? DIs are supposed to sit behind
their desk and drink herbal tea.

162
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:23,841
I'll treat it as an office outing.

163
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,413
Look, I know this guy.
He's a liar, he's a manipulator.

164
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,692
And what's worse,
he knows his rights.

165
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,994
So sit in if you have to,
that's your prerogative.

166
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:36,824
But I'm asking you to let me do
what I'm good at.

167
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:38,670
OK... sir?

168
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:42,742
Fine. But I want this resolved
as much as you do.

169
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:46,394
So we do this together. We get it
right and we get it over with.

170
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,078
OK, boys, phones off.

171
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,153
That's my seat.

172
00:13:57,273 --> 00:14:00,274
And that's my seat in there
but we're all making sacrifices.

173
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:04,394
This interview is being recorded and
conducted at Whitechapel police station.

174
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,875
The time is 10:15am.
The date is 31 August 2008.

175
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:13,172
I am Detective Sergeant Ray Miles.
The other officer present is...

176
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:15,474
Detective Inspector Joseph Chandler.

177
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:17,770
- The solicitor present is...
- Lydia Hart.

178
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,914
Please state your full name
and date of birth.

179
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:23,350
Robert Lees. 11 March 1972.

180
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,852
<i>You do not have
to say anything but...</i>

181
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:27,857
Sanders, shut up.

182
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,914
- Do you understand the caution?
- Yeah, I understand.

183
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:34,914
Where were you this morning at 2am?

184
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,633
Drunk tank. Charing Cross.

185
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:42,781
I got a ten-copper alibi.

186
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:05,813
It checks out. They were looking in on
him every half hour for the whole night.

187
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:08,554
Where's the new DI?

188
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,834
Probably with the commander begging
for a transfer.

189
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:14,327
Arts and Antiques Squad.

190
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:17,394
Never got the chance to know him.
Well, we won't miss hello.

191
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:21,115
Got to be a record that.
Shortest-serving DI.

192
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:28,114
Rob Lees is no longer a suspect.

193
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:31,034
Everybody. Listen, everybody, Rob
Lees is no longer a suspect.

194
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:33,114
Now that we...

195
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:36,375
Now that we no longer
have Rob Lees as a suspect...

196
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:41,066
Now that Rob Lees
is no longer part of this...

197
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:43,402
Is no longer a s... Yeah.

198
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:47,115
Now that Rob Lees
is no longer a s...

199
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:56,194
We've got to start over.

200
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:59,914
We've got a description of the suspect,
so let's find him on CCTV.

201
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:03,337
He's wearing a hat with flaps, so he
should stick out like a sore thumb.

202
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:05,474
- Sanders, you're good at watching TV.
- I am.

203
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:08,499
You take first shift on that.
Fitz, draw up a rota.

204
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:11,394
Right, Rob Lees has been
eliminated from this inquiry.

205
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:14,874
We start afresh. Consider this
a new investigation.

206
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,008
I need some chalk.

207
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,954
I might have some.

208
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:42,989
I can wait.

209
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,468
As long as it takes.

210
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:57,014
Teacher's pet, arse licker.

211
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,801
- Thank you... Kent.
- Kent.

212
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,221
Thank you, Kent.

213
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:08,949
Right, our suspect is in his 40s,
average height and build.

214
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,683
Dark complexion,
wearing a hat with ear flaps.

215
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:13,523
It's a distinctive look so...

216
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:16,253
let's start with CCTV opportunities
and find this guy.

217
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:19,033
- Great idea. We'll start tomorrow.
- No, we start now.

218
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:22,434
End of shift. Unless you're
authorising double time.

219
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:40,922
Oi.

220
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,114
Sorry.

221
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:05,958
Oh, dear God.

222
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:15,372
<i>What's his name? Spell it for me.</i>

223
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,794
<i>Phwoar. Who's let off?</i>

224
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:22,512
You're a detective. Work it out.

225
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,194
<i>Tell him to wait upstairs.</i>

226
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:30,434
Got a bloke upstairs, says he knows
everything about the murder.

227
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:35,577
Miles.

228
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:38,387
I beg your pardon?

229
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,330
In your own time, Mr Buchan.

230
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,841
She was lying on her back...

231
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,514
skirts pulled up.

232
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:57,037
She looked like she was drunk.

233
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:00,554
Her throat was cut and her stomach
had been mutilated.

234
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:09,834
- You saw the mutilation?
- Not exactly.

235
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:13,274
Where were you standing
when you saw her body?

236
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:15,084
I wasn't there.

237
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:18,394
Mary Ann Nichols was the first
canonical victim of Jack the Ripper

238
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:21,794
and she died on 31st August 1888.

239
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:23,514
So? Jesus Christ.

240
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,244
31 August. Same date,
same time of night.

241
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:28,714
She also died next
to a board school.

242
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:32,234
- I was describing her injuries to you.
- I don't bloody believe this.

243
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:34,173
My book.

244
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:38,834
It has all the canonical murders and
some other events I think were linked.

245
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:42,114
I think the man who killed your lady
was copying Jack the Ripper.

246
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:45,034
I'll bet she was lying on her back,

247
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:48,932
head pointing east, eyes open,
hands by her sides, palms open,

248
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:51,302
legs out straight, slightly parted.

249
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,194
- A perfect re-creation.
- You're a Ripperologist, aren't you?

250
00:20:56,454 --> 00:21:00,092
Why, yes, I am. And I also host
an excellent Ripper tour.

251
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,314
A lot of the tour operators promote
inaccurate theories.

252
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:06,310
I pride myself on my strict
adherence to the known facts.

253
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,874
Here's a fact. You're a loser.

254
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:13,182
Now get out before I nick you
for wasting police time.

255
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:20,594
Keep the book. It'll help you predict
what the killer will do next.

256
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:23,778
There are at least 4 more deaths
to come if I'm right.

257
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:24,898
Out!

258
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,554
You should be grateful.
I'm giving you a head start.

259
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:33,678
They never caught the Ripper. Time and
history have spirited his identity away.

260
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:37,594
- Get out.
- Thank you for your time.

261
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:45,714
Every time there's a stabbing
in Whitechapel

262
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,994
they come crawling out
of the woodwork.

263
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:51,172
I hate Ripperologists.

264
00:22:13,787 --> 00:22:15,082
Right.

265
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,679
- Forensics.
- There's nothing.

266
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,314
No prints, no fibres,
no DNA. Nothing.

267
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:24,431
- Witnesses.
- Nobody heard anything.

268
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,237
Well, they all knew there was a fire,
they heard the fire engines.

269
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:31,314
No one heard a scream,
a struggle, nothing.

270
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,827
Well, Mary Bousfield's a witness.

271
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:37,234
Talk to her, see if she remembers
anything else. Friends and family?

272
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:40,218
Well, everyone I spoke to
was very upset.

273
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:42,554
There were no enemies. No motive.

274
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:46,954
Right, so we've got no physical
evidence, no witnesses,

275
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:49,312
no known... no known motive.

276
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:52,292
Right.

277
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:06,474
I want everything done again.
Knock on every door,

278
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:09,775
talk to Cathy's friends,
go through CCTV again.

279
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:19,685
How can you conduct
an inquiry like this?

280
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,629
Look at the state of you,
look at your desks.

281
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:25,074
There could be actions here.
Clean it up and log it in.

282
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:27,437
I want paperless desks.

283
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:30,662
Use your bins, you see?
Use your bins.

284
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:34,172
And empty them
at the end of every night.

285
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:36,292
Who's the office manager here?

286
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:42,744
Well?

287
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,598
- I am, sir.
- Sort it out, McCormack.

288
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,111
It's a disgrace!

289
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:53,362
And haven't... haven't you
heard of showers?

290
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:57,034
Or irons. I mean, where are your ties?
Where's your tie?

291
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:59,741
- Get your feet off. Where's your tie?
- I'll get one.

292
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:03,482
It's no bloody surprise
that potential witnesses aren't talking.

293
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:06,514
You don't look professional.
And it smells in here!

294
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:10,034
Get yourselves organised.
Self-discipline, self-respect,

295
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:12,039
Deodorant. Go!

296
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,981
This is what real policemen
look like.

297
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:23,954
This is what real policemen smell like.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

298
00:24:24,121 --> 00:24:28,113
Your courses may look good on paper
but they count for nothing here.

299
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:30,492
We're not paper policemen!

300
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,874
This is a murder investigation,
not a beauty contest!

301
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:03,754
I think he's got obsessive
compulsive disorder.

302
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:07,279
Never known a man so obsessed
with cleanliness in my life.

303
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:08,591
Must be gay.

304
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,994
Do you think?

305
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:15,674
- I've got gaydar. I can tell.
- Going to have a shower then?

306
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:17,915
Am I going to have a shower?

307
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:22,243
Fresh as a daisy.

308
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:26,073
Oh, my God. I've found him!
I've found him!

309
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:30,954
This is from the camera at Puma
Court just before the murder.

310
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,064
There's the hat.

311
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,905
Looks like a deerstalker.

312
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:40,093
He looks like Sherlock Holmes.

313
00:25:40,213 --> 00:25:43,032
- Or Jack the Ripper.
- Shut up, you nonce.

314
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:45,754
What's he wearing under his coat?

315
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,496
It's an apron.

316
00:26:17,684 --> 00:26:19,396
<i>You can keep the book.</i>

317
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,932
<i>It'll help you to predict
what the killer will do next.</i>

318
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:26,502
<i>There are at least four more deaths
to come if I'm right.</i>

319
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:33,274
<i>The Star's headline read
"Leather Apron".</i>

320
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:35,854
<i>The only name linked
with the Whitechapel murders.</i>

321
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:37,830
<i>A noiseless midnight terror.</i>

322
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,796
<i>A strange character who prowls
about Whitechapel after midnight.</i>

323
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:44,102
<i>Universal fear among the women.</i>

324
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,234
<i>There was a great fire the night
Mary A. Nichols died,</i>

325
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:51,537
<i>only streets away from where she had
her throat cut and body mutilated.'</i>

326
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:53,077
Shit.

327
00:26:58,405 --> 00:26:59,427
Hello!

328
00:26:59,772 --> 00:27:03,365
Are you all here for the world-famous
Buchan's Guider Ripper Tour?

329
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:07,285
Good-o. If you'd all like to step in,
please. Save the old voice.

330
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:10,765
Now, we will be visiting all the
sites of the Ripper's murders

331
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:12,840
as well as some
of his regular haunts.

332
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:15,320
So I must ask
if everyone here is over 18.

333
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:18,040
- Are you over 18, young lady?
- Yes!

334
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:20,177
Good-o. Now...

335
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:22,232
This is a two-hour walk.

336
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:26,042
And it is not suitable for those
of a weak or squeamish disposition.

337
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:27,783
It will be dark.

338
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:29,925
It will be frightening.

339
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:33,492
And maybe tonight
we shall see someof the ghosts...

340
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:34,862
of Whitechapel.

341
00:27:36,392 --> 00:27:38,478
OK, that's £10 per person, please.

342
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:43,515
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

343
00:27:44,335 --> 00:27:45,961
Thank you. Thank you.

344
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:55,278
Thank you, sir. Enjoy the tour.

345
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,876
We're going off-piste tonight.

346
00:27:58,996 --> 00:28:03,183
None of the other tours come here.
They don't appreciate its significance.

347
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:06,198
This passageway was known
as George Yard

348
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:09,700
and it was here on a first-floor
landing on 7 August 1888

349
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,718
that a terrible discovery was made.

350
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,484
A woman, stabbed 39 times
and left to die.

351
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:17,893
Her name was Martha Tabram.

352
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:20,358
And she may have been
the Ripper's first victim.

353
00:28:21,206 --> 00:28:23,941
Some Ripperologists discount her
since her throat wasn't cut,

354
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,558
nor was she mutilated.

355
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,373
She's not a Ripper victim, they say.
Doesn't fit the pattern.

356
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:35,333
A serial killer does not emerge
fully formed.

357
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:38,109
Even he must learn his craft.

358
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:40,413
And Jack learned quickly.

359
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:46,594
Let us visit the place where he
killed his first canonical victim,

360
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:48,064
Mary Ann Nichols!

361
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:09,385
I think this man has killed before.
I want to look for...

362
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:11,404
previous in the last
few months or so.

363
00:29:11,524 --> 00:29:14,918
A murder with overkill. 39 stab
wounds to the torso and legs.

364
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,733
- And this is from where?
- It's an idea.

365
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:21,158
- 39 stab wounds is very specific.
- It might be nothing.

366
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:24,750
- It is. The Ripper's for tourists.
- You're ignoring the possibility...

367
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,358
- There was no murder like that.
- Are you sure?

368
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:29,238
Course I am. It's my job to know.

369
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,878
- Serious assault. Maybe she survived.
- You are kidding.

370
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,693
You've been given a job, will you...
just do it?

371
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:39,237
Sir.

372
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:44,038
Kent, there was a fire on the night
of the murder. It might be connected.

373
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,458
- Find out all you can.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:55,625
And it's not Father's Day, you're not
the world's greatest lover and...

375
00:29:55,768 --> 00:29:57,425
What does IOFB mean?

376
00:29:57,653 --> 00:29:59,838
I Only Fire Blanks.

377
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,572
The wife got it for me
after I got the snip.

378
00:30:02,692 --> 00:30:03,983
Get them off.

379
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:07,993
No sense of humour,
that's his problem.

380
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:10,636
He don't want to be one of us.

381
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:13,561
He's like a wife who wants
to change all your bad habits.

382
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,226
Another plastic copper.

383
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,946
- Not a real detective.
- Sarge! I think you should see this.

384
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:23,254
Emma Jones. August 7.

385
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:25,973
She was found with a lump on her head
and 39 stab wounds.

386
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:28,418
- Spot on, sir.
- Did she identify her attacker?

387
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:31,521
She said he was young,
around 5'9" with dark hair

388
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:33,573
and she reckoned he was a soldier.

389
00:30:33,693 --> 00:30:35,307
- Why?
- She saw tattoos.

390
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:37,798
- Thought they were regimental.
- Which regiment?

391
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,258
Sir, she was stabbed 39 times.
She couldn't really say.

392
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,707
A murder in a school yard,
an attempted murder by a squaddie.

393
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:46,558
- A connection?
- I want to talk to her.

394
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:49,414
- She's in hospital.
- Kent, come with me.

395
00:30:49,775 --> 00:30:53,775
I've got to pack this in, buy a nice
wee pub in the country or something.

396
00:30:56,408 --> 00:30:59,158
He doesn't look well.
I hate hospitals.

397
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:07,566
What do you think's wrong with him?

398
00:31:07,686 --> 00:31:09,552
Excuse me, Dr Phillips, please.

399
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:11,128
I'm looking for Dr Phillips.

400
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:13,158
Are you sure?
Maybe I could help you?

401
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:15,167
Dr Phillips, please.

402
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:18,587
He's not here. I think he swapped
shifts with Dr Cohen.

403
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,998
- Maybe he can help you.
- Thank you.

404
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:27,817
I didn't treat Emma Jones
but I am aware of her case.

405
00:31:27,937 --> 00:31:29,638
Does this account look familiar?

406
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,724
22 stab wounds to the trunk.

407
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:35,343
Left lung penetrated in five places,
the right lung in two.

408
00:31:35,463 --> 00:31:38,563
Heart penetrated once.
Liver penetrated five times.

409
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:41,038
Spleen twice
and the stomach six times.

410
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:43,602
The wound on the breastbone
made a long instrument,

411
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:45,371
possibly a bayonet.

412
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:48,798
This is the attack on Emma Jones.

413
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,998
No, it happened over 100 years ago.

414
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:06,884
Yes, heart penetrated once. I see.

415
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:12,078
In Emma Jones's case
the knife glanced off the ribs.

416
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:14,798
- The heart was not pierced.
- Is that why she survived?

417
00:32:15,527 --> 00:32:18,038
- That and the ambulance.
- I'd like to speak to her.

418
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:20,438
That's not possible.
She's in intensive care.

419
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:22,358
- Even so...
- In a coma.

420
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:24,117
I'm sorry.

421
00:32:26,063 --> 00:32:27,063
Thank you.

422
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:33,042
Why would somebody copy
a hundred-year-old murder?

423
00:32:34,081 --> 00:32:35,985
They never caught the Ripper.

424
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:39,038
Did they come close? Perhaps.
But we'll never know.

425
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,158
The real Jack probably committed
suicide after the last murder.

426
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:47,282
Maybe he plunged into the icy Thames
taking his secrets with him.

427
00:32:47,504 --> 00:32:49,441
And we are left with his legacy -

428
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:51,759
the birth of the serial killer.

429
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,558
My book. An encyclopaedia of facts.

430
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:59,398
All the clues you need
to start your own hunt for Jack.

431
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:02,318
Will you be the one
to find the Ripper?

432
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:08,718
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, thank you.

433
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:11,278
That was very interesting.
Thank you. Good tour.

434
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:12,538
<i>Guten Abend.</i>

435
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:23,977
I normally get a few bites.

436
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:27,505
Wasn't on song tonight.
Too many Germans.

437
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,425
They don't give much back.

438
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:31,963
I like the Yanks. Great enthusiasm.

439
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:33,878
And they like a souvenir.

440
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:36,572
- Can I have a word?
- Absolutely.

441
00:33:36,855 --> 00:33:38,398
You can buy me a drink.

442
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:44,678
So, I suppose you're
the Ripper's biggest fan.

443
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:49,118
I don't think fan is the right word.
I don't admire what he did.

444
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:52,662
You seem to enjoy the murders though.
All the details.

445
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,812
- You pretty much live it every night.
- Oh, dear.

446
00:33:55,932 --> 00:33:59,532
I am a performer for the tourist
hordes, that is true, but...

447
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:03,622
in my heart I'm a detective,
like your fine self.

448
00:34:03,997 --> 00:34:06,478
You know what's it's like,
the irresistible siren call

449
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:09,998
of a mystery, the...
delectable twist of a conundrum.

450
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,200
We are slaves to that delicious
eureka moment

451
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,342
when the scales fall away

452
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:17,558
and everything is laid bare.

453
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:20,038
There's no eureka moment
in what I do.

454
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:24,090
I follow the bloody footprints
and arrest the man holding the knife.

455
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,660
But that is tragic.

456
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,758
To be a detective
and not have the fire.

457
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:34,493
So you're more interested in being
a detective than a Ripper.

458
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,463
I'd be a poor man's Ripper.

459
00:34:36,627 --> 00:34:40,177
Only able to dispatch small dogs
and ladies under five foot.

460
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,121
On the night of the murder,
I was watching my mother sing

461
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:48,838
with the church choir in aid
of the roof restoration fund.

462
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:52,389
I fell asleep and disturbed everyone
with my snoring.

463
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:56,426
Can you help me?

464
00:34:57,063 --> 00:34:58,063
Yes.

465
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:02,373
The man who murdered Cathy Lane...

466
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,410
will kill again.

467
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:11,698
This is the pattern.

468
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,968
Emma Jones, stabbed 39 times.
7 August. Survived, just.

469
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:20,268
Martha Tabram, stabbed 39 times.
7 August 1888. Died.

470
00:35:21,062 --> 00:35:24,038
Cathy Lane, throat cut, mutilated.
31 August.

471
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:28,082
Mary Ann Nichols, throat cut,
mutilated. 31 August 1888.

472
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,328
The man who attacked and killed these
women in 1888 was Jack the Ripper.

473
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:35,417
The man who's attacking
these women in 2008

474
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,360
is his biggest fan.

475
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,358
- We have a copycat.
- Here we go again.

476
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:43,638
Come on. This is your patch.
You should have spotted this.

477
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:47,638
You should be ashamed that it's taken
a plastic like me to work this out.

478
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:49,348
All right, all right.

479
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:53,335
- The Ripper only killed prostitutes.
- Correct.

480
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:56,267
So you think Emma and Cathy
were on the game?

481
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:58,487
- No.
- There's nothing to suggest

482
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:01,087
- either of them were toms.
- Good point.

483
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:03,558
Were they attacked
in the same place as his victims?

484
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:05,306
Those places no longer exist.

485
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:07,733
Theslums were cleared
and the roads changed.

486
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:10,719
With the greatest of respect,
these women were attacked

487
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,638
in unconnected locations
by different people.

488
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:16,169
A soldier in his 20s, about 5'9"

489
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:18,998
and a 40-something man
wearing a deerstalker hat.

490
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,545
Different people,
different location.

491
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:23,315
You had a theory but...

492
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:26,133
you're new to this and it's easy

493
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:29,438
to get carried away
with all the history in the area.

494
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:34,646
- Game over.
- Right, who's hungry?

495
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:38,558
The killer could be dressing up
to match the historical suspects.

496
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:42,518
Dressing up? So he's a perv then.

497
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:44,128
No. No, no, no, no.

498
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:47,998
So that the witness descriptions
match what the police had in 1888.

499
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,080
The police looked for a soldier
after Tabram's death.

500
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,638
The prime suspect with Jones's
stabbing is a soldier.

501
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:56,798
Prime suspect with Mary Ann Nichols,
a man in a leather apron.

502
00:36:57,394 --> 00:36:58,644
Think about it.

503
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:02,369
The guy in the CCTV had an apron
under his coat.

504
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:07,211
I thought Jack the Ripper
had a black bag

505
00:37:07,331 --> 00:37:09,238
a top hat and walked through smog.

506
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,478
I think that'd draw attention
in Brick Lane, don't you?

507
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:17,062
September 8th 1888, the next victim
was Annie Chapman.

508
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:21,016
I think on 8 September we'll have
a murder on Hanbury Street.

509
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:23,186
We need to be there to stop it.

510
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:27,260
<i>- I've heard it all now.
- Total crap.</i>

511
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:55,333
Joe, what you're proposing
goes against all procedures.

512
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:58,811
You gain nothing by chasing bogeymen
and you stand to lose everything.

513
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:02,543
- I can see a pattern emerging.
- You're ambitious, that's good,

514
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:05,948
but you're letting your ambition
cloud your judgement.

515
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:09,341
You want this murder to have meaning
because death should be significant,

516
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,918
but in truth most murders are banal.

517
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,778
- I'm not imagining this.
- Take my advice.

518
00:38:15,178 --> 00:38:17,780
Step back a little. Detach yourself.

519
00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:20,678
And if another woman dies?

520
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,630
Then we never had this conversation.

521
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:50,207
This obbo's a waste of time.
No one will get murdered tonight

522
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:53,447
by a copycat Jack the Ripper.
So eat up.

523
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,840
If my mother could see you now,
do you know what she'd say?

524
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,783
She'd say you shouldn't go
chase any suspects

525
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:03,320
till at least half an hour
after you've finished eating.

526
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,381
Half an hour? We'd be here
all night, mate.

527
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,510
Our historical murder
won't happen till 5am.

528
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:13,048
I thought I could eat
but you take the biscuit.

529
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:16,968
Come on. This is a farewell meal for
our good friend DI Chandler.

530
00:39:17,585 --> 00:39:19,235
He gambled and he lost.

531
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:22,375
This is his last supper...
on expenses.

532
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:24,701
Can we have more beers?

533
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:32,161
When I eat curry I can smell it
on my pits the next day.

534
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:38,861
- Do you want one, sir?
- No, thanks.

535
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,028
You should. You look like
a copper on an obbo.

536
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,800
What he means, sir,
is that you need to relax,

537
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,200
Blend in. Make it look like.

538
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,120
Nothing remains
of no.29 Hanbury Street.

539
00:39:56,913 --> 00:39:59,280
And this is as close
as we can get...

540
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:03,600
to where the body of Annie Chapman
was found in the back yard

541
00:40:03,974 --> 00:40:05,965
on this very night in 1888.

542
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,191
And it was a terrible sight.

543
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:12,044
He didn't just cut her throat.

544
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,880
He tried to cut her head off.

545
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:20,282
He split her open and threw her
intestines over her shoulder...

546
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:23,200
like a grotesque scarf.

547
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,320
Not much left of poor Annie Chapman.

548
00:40:27,242 --> 00:40:29,692
Just a few sad belongings
at her feet.

549
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:31,886
Moving on.

550
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:38,240
Good luck to you, sirs.

551
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:41,071
We should check him out.

552
00:40:42,602 --> 00:40:45,002
He just seems to know
a lot about it.

553
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:46,281
It's his job.

554
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:49,374
Funny job.

555
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:17,597
Bloody waste of time,
resources and my patience.

556
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:19,731
I told you nothing'd happen.

557
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:23,651
As soon as we're stood down
I'm having a word with the commander.

558
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:26,200
I'm having a slash.

559
00:41:31,048 --> 00:41:32,171
5am, Skip.

560
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:38,922
That's it for the DI then.

561
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:42,801
Not so much fast track
as bus fare home.

562
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:49,139
You going to call it then, sir?

563
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:54,200
I tried, didn't I?

564
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:57,617
- You did save a life tonight.
- Yeah.

565
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:00,191
I'll put it on my CV.

566
00:42:25,994 --> 00:42:27,061
Where is he?

567
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:29,411
Number four, round the back.

568
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:31,646
Establish the perimeter.
Get Dr Llewellyn.

569
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:33,716
Get Miles and then follow me.

570
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:44,000
- DS Miles, come in, over.
- Skip.

571
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,661
- Skip, we're up.
- Oh, Jesus.

572
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:11,320
<i>He took hold of her by the chin</i>

573
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,800
<i>and commenced the incision
from left to right.</i>

574
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,880
<i>An attempt had been made
to separate the bones of the neck.</i>

575
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,841
<i>The abdomen had been
entirely laid open.</i>

576
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,390
<i>The intestines lifted out
of the body...</i>

577
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,760
<i>and placed by the shoulder
of the corpse.</i>

578
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,391
It's the Ripper.

579
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,199
- He was right, weren't he?
- Yeah.

580
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,393
Congratulations, you were right.

581
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,847
All you have to do now
is solve the unsolvable

582
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:52,317
and catch the most famous
serial killer that ever lived.

583
00:44:52,971 --> 00:44:53,971
Good luck.

584
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,600
The double event is imminent.
The night he killed two women,

585
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,520
a soldier has been beating up girls
and threatening to gut them.

586
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,040
We've got a prime suspect.

587
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,850
You'll be the man
who captured the Ripper.

588
00:45:52,451 --> 00:45:54,331
