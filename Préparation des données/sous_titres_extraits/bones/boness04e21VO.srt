1
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:14,235
Norway?

2
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,885
We don't have enough
crucified corpses of our own?

3
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,575
Now the Vikings are sending them?

4
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,982
The annual murder rate
in Norway is 0.7.

5
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,498
Less than one murder a year?

6
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,751
In that case, they should solve the ones
they've or they'll never get practice.

7
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,378
The victim is American.

8
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,505
Still, if a Norwegian
was murdered here,

9
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,079
we'd conduct the investigation.

10
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:34,343
But the Norwegians say the victim died
here and then got shipped to Norway.

11
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,618
- What's their evidence?
- Nothing forensic.

12
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:37,972
It's just police work.

13
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,980
The remains were found
in the possession

14
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:42,143
of a Norwegian black metal band.

15
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:45,413
- What's black metal?
- I don't know; it's Norwegian.

16
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,992
- Whole different kind of black.
- Apparently it's a genre of heavy metal

17
00:01:49,117 --> 00:01:52,903
featuring macabre imagery
of death and horrific violence.

18
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,159
Skalle.

19
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:57,575
That's the name of the band.

20
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,868
It means "skull."

21
00:01:59,357 --> 00:02:01,929
- You speak Norwegian?
- No, I'm a forensic anthropologist.

22
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,248
I know how to say "skull"
in every language.

23
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,500
- Well, Skalle...
- "Skall-eh."

24
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:09,253
- "Skall-ay"...
- "Skall-eh."

25
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:13,986
They stole the body
from an American metal band

26
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:16,064
while on tour in DC six months ago.

27
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:18,442
The remains are male, late teens.

28
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,557
Significant staining on the...
"skall-EH."

29
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,683
"SKALL-eh."

30
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:24,852
It leached into the bone.

31
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,313
Desiccated flesh
on the face and scalp.

32
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,689
Perhaps enough for DNA.

33
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,608
If the scraps of clothing
and the boots

34
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,860
were actually on the victim
when he died, then,

35
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,695
maybe Hodgins can give us something.

36
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,915
What's, what's the story on this?

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,159
The posterior ribs were either
broken or severed.

38
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,446
Detached at the spine
and then fanned out.

39
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,634
- It's the Blood Eagle.
- Beg pardon?

40
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:50,708
It was an ancient torture in which
the victim was held face down

41
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,880
while his back was sliced open.

42
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,716
The ribs were then
broken at the spine

43
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,969
and then spread to look like an eagle,
thus the name.

44
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:02,056
Absence of blood
on the periosteal surface

45
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,851
of the fractures suggests
the ribs were broken postmortem.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,729
I'll remove the bones from the cross
and clean them,

47
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,918
- see if we can find the cause of death.
- This is definitely murder.

48
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,526
There are other possibilities.

49
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,821
I have to admit none spring to mind.

50
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,495
One possibility:

51
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:21,158
drunken, death-obsessed,
Satan-worshipping,

52
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,203
drug-abusing teens rob a grave and

53
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,144
reenact an ancien torture.

54
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,249
Just another Saturday night.

55
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:36,194
Right, okay, so for the
Norwegian crucifixion case,

56
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,689
I'm gonna need to know all there is
about the heavy metal music scene in DC.

57
00:03:39,814 --> 00:03:41,976
And tell me what, get me
all the recordings that you can.

58
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:44,765
I think you're going to have
to be more specific than that.

59
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:46,725
Gordon-Gordon!

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,381
There's black metal, speed metal,

61
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:51,105
grindcore, thrash,

62
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,024
doom, drone, glam,
sludge, metalcore,

63
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,152
stoner metal, death metal,
and deathcore.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,986
Must you shake my hand with
quite such a vise-like grip?

65
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,166
Right, yeah, OK,
did you get all that? Go, go.

66
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,082
Thought you were a psychiatrist.
How'd you become a musical expert?

67
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:06,418
I've got quite a...
musical background, you know.

68
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:10,165
Yeah, right, Saint...
Weatherby's Glee Club

69
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,634
in Doo-Daw-on-Henley?

70
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,003
So... I thought
we loaned you out to Interpol?

71
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,795
Yes, part of the serial
killer task force,

72
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,517
traveling the globe
bathed in perversion and gore.

73
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:21,819
Have a seat.

74
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:25,764
And on a happier note, I'm to meet
your bright young thing.

75
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,933
- Dr. Sweets?
- Sweets, why Sweets?

76
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,308
He wants to interview me
for the book he's writing

77
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,479
on you and the lovely Dr. Brennan.

78
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:35,595
Anyway, I can see you're busy.

79
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,195
Listen, perhaps while I'm here
I can barbecue for you one evening.

80
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,989
No, no, I am the barbecue master,
remember?

81
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,673
- You can do the boiling.
- Ah, I have it on good authority

82
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:47,703
that my culinary skills have
advanced somewhat since last we ate.

83
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,289
- Anyway, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

84
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,031
I have a computer rendering of what
our victim might have looked like.

85
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:03,802
Look at him.
He's a puppy.

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,465
- 278-pound puppy.
- Sometimes puppies are big.

87
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,768
Prelim tox results came back
negative for embalming fluid.

88
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,497
So he was never buried
in a sanctioned grave?

89
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,011
So probably murdered.

90
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:17,492
Murdered and his remains crucified

91
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,568
for the entertainment
of people who hate life.

92
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,368
Bones - Season 4 Episode 21
"The Mayhem on the Cross"

93
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,121
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Reborn

94
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,018
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

95
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,063
Gordon, Gordon Wyatt.

96
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,521
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Dr. Sweets.

97
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:01,841
Dr. Wyatt, I am
a huge admirer of your book

98
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,406
on the role of sexual sadism
in female serial killers.

99
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:08,617
Do I detect a certain
caveat in your tone?

100
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,246
The sample is small.

101
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,166
Comparatively speaking, there
are few female serial killers.

102
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:18,713
I was wondering if you had
a chance to take a look at...

103
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:22,381
Your manuscript?
Yes, indeed, and may I say,

104
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:24,614
that I think this is probably

105
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,052
the best work I have ever read

106
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,343
on the dynamics of
opposite personality types

107
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:33,237
working towards a common... cause.

108
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:36,475
Okay, now I'm hearing a caveat.

109
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,688
It's a small one.

110
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,163
It's just that,

111
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:42,568
Brennan and Booth
aren't in any way opposites.

112
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:44,231
Small?

113
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:47,364
What is that?
British understatement?

114
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,045
Well, yes, he's a man;
she's a woman.

115
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,805
He's instinctual; she's empirical.

116
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,789
- Opposites.
- Superficial ephemera, Dr. Sweets.

117
00:06:57,805 --> 00:07:00,807
Okay, what about the sexual
component in their relationship?

118
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:03,453
Would you agree that they have both

119
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:06,850
sublimated their attraction
to each other out of fear

120
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:08,844
of endangering
their working relationship

121
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:11,581
because their working relationship
is paramount to both of them?

122
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:14,476
Alas, I'm afraid I wouldn't
agree with that, no.

123
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:18,520
- Which part?
- With everything you just said.

124
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,654
Yes, one of them is acutely
aware of that attraction.

125
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,247
Struggles with it daily,
as a matter of fact.

126
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,910
I'm sorry I keep saying that...

127
00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:31,825
which one?

128
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,288
It's your book, Dr. Sweets.
I would never tell you what to write.

129
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,124
I was actually going to ask you
to write the introduction.

130
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,002
That's very flattering,
but I'm retiring.

131
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,172
I am relinquishing
the field to young Turks like you.

132
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,727
Do you think
she actually enjoys this?

133
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,979
This whole
sexual abstinence thing...

134
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,347
totally twisting her out of shape.

135
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:08,375
Here, the... staining on the skull was
propylene glycol dicocoate,

136
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,740
alkyl benzoate, and
sorbitan sesquioleate.

137
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:14,782
What is that,
some kind of systemic poison?

138
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:18,700
That's common theatrical makeup.
It leached into the skull during decomp.

139
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,331
Sorry, sorry.
I put the music on to...

140
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:25,003
get me in the right space.

141
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,638
Well, extrapolating
from the stains on the skull,

142
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:30,593
it turns out that at
the time of his death,

143
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,636
our victim looked like this.

144
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,414
Looks like your puppy
moonlighted as a zombie werewolf.

145
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,001
Yeah, I ran this through my
facial recognition program

146
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,312
with an image search
of metal Web pages.

147
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:45,442
- Check this out.
- There's our boy.

148
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,693
Spew.
It's very evocative.

149
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,736
So our victim, Mayhem,

150
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,593
was the bassist.

151
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:54,892
The drummer is Wrath
and the guitarist Pinworm,

152
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,702
but they do have a new bassist now.

153
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:00,164
- His name is Grinder.
- What about real names?

154
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,541
I imagine they play that
pretty close to the vest.

155
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,551
Kind of ruins the
magic when you find out

156
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:08,080
that Satan's name is Todd or Larry.

157
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:12,197
I'll tell Booth to search for
a death metal band named Spew.

158
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:18,903
Wait, what do you mean Gordon-Gordon
is going to quit psychiatry?

159
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:21,098
Well, I asked him to write the intro

160
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:23,233
to my book about you two.
He told me he couldn't

161
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:25,772
- because he was retiring.
- Is it possible he hated your book?

162
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,899
Thank you.

163
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,526
Perhaps now he'll find a pursuit
worthy of his intellect...

164
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:30,973
neurochemistry, for example.

165
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:32,738
Yeah. Booth. Hold on, slow down.

166
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,907
Why would a man with
Wyatt's insights

167
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,453
into the human psyche
want to be a mere scientist?

168
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,601
No offense.

169
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:40,768
Perhaps because psychology
is a field

170
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:44,679
which is ill-defined in conception
and ineffective in execution.

171
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:46,099
Thank you.

172
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,445
Sounds great.
So Cam says we got to track down

173
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,006
a death metal band named Spew.

174
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:54,603
They're totally underground, no concerts
listed, no contact information.

175
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,550
- A death metal band?
- Yeah.

176
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:59,770
But our victim's skeleton was found
in the possession of a Norwegian

177
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:00,974
black metal band.

178
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,685
Death metal, black metal,
what's the difference?

179
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,985
In essence, death metal is about
brutal technical proficiency

180
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,690
while black metal is about emotion.

181
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:11,263
Now, both of 'em exploit
adolescent feelings

182
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:13,094
of alienation, depression...

183
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:15,815
Right, 'cause it all just sounds
like a truck full of cymbals

184
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,533
crashing into a saw factory for me.

185
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:21,818
Historically, picayune
internecine squabbles

186
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,997
account for a huge number of deaths.

187
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,933
Just figure out
cause of death for me,

188
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,709
all right, "interoserine"
or whatever.

189
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,603
How do you know so much about this?

190
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:32,461
I was really into death metal...
as a teenager,

191
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:35,150
not anymore.
Obviously.

192
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,760
- Really?
- Oh, come on.

193
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,138
- Come on, what?
- I don't like that anymore.

194
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,082
According to Booth, there's no way
to track down this band Spew.

195
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:51,341
No bars, clubs, or high schools.

196
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:55,529
The cross is carved
of 120-year-old black oak and was stolen

197
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,533
from St. Benedict
Episcopal Church six months ago.

198
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,080
That is some determined
desecration going on.

199
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,770
Yeah, well, the bones
themselves were covered in a patina

200
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:08,146
of smoke, tobacco, marijuana, meth,

201
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:10,961
animal blood, semen, and saliva.

202
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,423
- Who are these people?
- Sweets sent over a briefing.

203
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,601
Concerts are set up
at secret locations,

204
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:17,384
and then only insiders are invited.

205
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,342
Then, how do we find them?

206
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:22,056
Well, the dried mud from the treads
of the boots

207
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,239
that were duct-taped
to the victim contained

208
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:27,289
bovine fragments
and infectious prion proteins.

209
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:28,437
A slaughterhouse?

210
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,023
A slaughterhouse closed down
due to mad cow disease.

211
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:35,120
Death metal enthusiasts prefer morbid,
horror-centric venues for performance.

212
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,915
In addition, they tend
to perform for their fans

213
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,574
in the same place they practice
and sometimes squat.

214
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:44,422
Like maybe this horror-centric,
condemned slaughterhouse.

215
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:47,430
Wait. How do we know
that those are his boots?

216
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:49,333
He was in Norway for months.

217
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,710
You are going to be so proud.

218
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:58,383
The victim's foot size is 11,
same as his boots.

219
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,919
We need something more
than a matching shoe size.

220
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,191
He's not finished.

221
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:04,175
Wear on his calcaneus
and cuboid suggest

222
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,350
our victim walked mostly
on the outside of his feet.

223
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,370
Supinator.

224
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:10,005
One percent of the population
are supinators.

225
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,063
That's a lot.

226
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,690
One percent of size 11 teenagers
isn't good enough?

227
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:20,627
This missing toe... did it fall off
after decomposition, or

228
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,908
was it a preexisting condition?

229
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,951
That's exactly what I was thinking.

230
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:29,955
You see here?

231
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:32,542
His toes left an impression
inside the boot,

232
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,295
but there is no impression
corresponding with the big toe.

233
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,464
Are you satisfied

234
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,550
that this was the boot worn
y the victim while he was still alive?

235
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,719
It's a reasonable conclusion.

236
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:46,264
- You want to say, "King of the Lab"?
- No.

237
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,096
So, why do I have the feeling

238
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:52,312
that I'm being taken
somewhere terrible for a...

239
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:53,820
a gangland whacking?

240
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:56,095
We are going somewhere terrible.

241
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,277
- We are.
- Look, we... we need your expertise.

242
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,571
Well, I'm sure the
estimable Dr. Sweets

243
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,031
is more than qualified.

244
00:13:03,503 --> 00:13:05,639
- Booth is lying about needing you.
- What?

245
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:08,306
He wants to talk you out
of quitting psychiatry.

246
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:10,038
I was easing into that, okay?

247
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,094
As a matter of fact,
I might be able to help.

248
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:15,711
As a young man, I dabbled quite
extensively in the rock music scene.

249
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,595
Oh, wait a second.
What were you,

250
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,172
lead dulcimer in a flute band?

251
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,212
As a matter of fact, I was the founding
member of a proto-glam rock outfit.

252
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,360
- I don't know what that means.
- It means that for three

253
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:29,725
glorious years,
I wore spandex, silver lamé,

254
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,003
pancake makeup, and played
a guitar shaped like a spaceship.

255
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:34,688
I was quite pretty in my way.

256
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,856
Wait.

257
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:38,400
You... you were Noddy Comet.

258
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,193
- What's that?
- Noddy Comet!

259
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,321
I always wondered what happened to you.
You were Noddy.

260
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,990
I changed jobs.
That's all.

261
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,413
Noddy Comet!

262
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:49,791
I got to get some
of those original tapes.

263
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:08,209
Actually, you know,
that fellow playing the bass

264
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,056
- is really rather good.
- What?

265
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,100
OK, let's shut it down, guys.
Come on.

266
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,310
FBI. Let's go!

267
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,106
Hey, I said...

268
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:16,938
FBI. Shut it down.

269
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:31,371
Yes.

270
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,948
Now, if you recall that
it was shooting inanimate objects

271
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,959
that had you brought to me
for therapy in the first place.

272
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,809
I thought it was
a justifiable shooting.

273
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:42,172
- I agree.
- She agrees, see?

274
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,595
- You going to put your gun down?
- Don't rush me, okay?

275
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,818
- Are you coming?
- Nope, I discharged my weapon.

276
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,363
I pulled desk duty
until the paperwork clears.

277
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,211
- You're 50 feet away.
- At my desk, okay, so just put in

278
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:12,494
the earplug and let's do this.
Don't tell Sweets about the ear bud.

279
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,899
- Booth wants us to interrogate them.
- Yeah, he's not really

280
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:18,442
supposed to be watching on his laptop
and talking in your ear.

281
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,415
So, just tell him
that's not happening.

282
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,576
These are their real names:
Monty Bigelow,

283
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:24,751
Matt Stickney, and Darrel Moss.

284
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,343
All right, Bones,
so just ease into this.

285
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,767
What was Mayhem's real name?

286
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,342
Or you can just go at them
like a freight train.

287
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:39,602
Dabbler.

288
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:42,440
His stage name was Mayhem,
not Dabbler.

289
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:44,585
Mayhem's a dabbler.

290
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,777
A poseur.

291
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,094
A douche.

292
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:50,067
Do you want to spend
time in jail, Pinhead?

293
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:51,866
You can't actually arrest people.

294
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,537
We live in a slaughterhouse.
You got something worse than that?

295
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,883
OK, let's start over.

296
00:15:57,008 --> 00:15:59,523
Tell us the name that Mayhem's
mother and father gave him,

297
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:02,085
and we'll charge you
with assaulting a federal agent.

298
00:16:02,354 --> 00:16:04,504
Oh, no, you have that backwards.

299
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,549
No, Bones, he's right, okay?
They want to be arrested.

300
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:11,052
Reverse psychology.

301
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,057
That term is almost always misused.

302
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:16,536
Look, just tell Tapeworm that
felony assault is the best you can do.

303
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:19,853
Felony assault is the best
we can do... Tapeworm.

304
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,521
Take it or leave it.

305
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,692
Justin.
Justin Dancy.

306
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:27,569
When did you last see Justin?

307
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,864
When I killed him,
ate his heart, and took his job.

308
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,683
I killed him, too. I never
even noticed he was gone.

309
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:39,378
I ate his face off
before I killed him.

310
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,667
I am so much better
at interrogation than I thought.

311
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,563
Those aren't legitimate confessions.
All right, guys.

312
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,738
Come on, give us a real answer.

313
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:51,343
About a year ago,
when he quit the band.

314
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,765
How about those charges?

315
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,438
Where's he going?

316
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:07,016
- Booth.
- Yeah?

317
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:09,653
The one called Grinder
is different from the others.

318
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,781
His body language displays an emotional
connection to the murder victim.

319
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:14,865
Okay, so, what do you think
we should do?

320
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,907
We should arrange to have him
cleaned up, revealed, so to speak,

321
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:21,331
so that Dr. Wyatt and I can talk
to him and exploit that connection.

322
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,208
Okay... all right, then.

323
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,855
You do that.
I'll stay here on desk duty.

324
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:32,237
Posterior ilium, right side,
damage to the cortical bone layer,

325
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:34,362
extending into the trabecular.

326
00:17:34,642 --> 00:17:37,242
This skeleton was carted
from DC to Norway,

327
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:41,317
then used as a prop at ultraviolent
concerts. There's bound to be damage.

328
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,727
I enlarged the X-ray.

329
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,939
See the multiple clefts and wastage?

330
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,608
Suggesting the damage done
to the pelvic bone happened very near

331
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,638
- time of death?
- Now, because Dr. Brennan isn't here,

332
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:54,197
I'll guess that these
gouge marks came from a knife.

333
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,538
Someone went digging into
the victim's gluteus?

334
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:58,785
Yes, bone damage consistent
with a bullet wound.

335
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,900
So... the victim was shot
in the ass,

336
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:04,426
then killed in some way
yet to be determined, then

337
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,929
- the killer dug the bullet out of...
- Gluteus.

338
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,128
Yes.
Okay.

339
00:18:08,732 --> 00:18:10,922
Let's have Hodgins swab
for trace evidence.

340
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:15,301
God knows what he'll find.
Maybe a little piece of Norway.

341
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:20,261
Darrel Moss.
Come in. Sit down.

342
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:22,892
My name's Grinder.

343
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,727
Grinder, have you looked
in the mirror?

344
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,157
Where are the other guys?

345
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:33,082
- Did you delouse them, too?
- No, nobody else. Just you, Darrel.

346
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:35,088
You're the new guy
in the band, right?

347
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:36,865
You replaced Mayhem on bass?

348
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:40,326
I told you.
I killed him for the job.

349
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:42,361
Dr. Wyatt tells me that

350
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,415
you are a skilled,
classically trained bassist

351
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,585
- influenced by... who is it?
- Jaco Pastorius.

352
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:50,587
But you do everything you can
to hide that?

353
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,499
I never heard of him.
No, no, 'cause that would...

354
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:55,216
that would ruin your street cred.

355
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:59,136
Justin Dancy's remains show
evidence of being used as a stage prop

356
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:03,021
for approximately the last six
months, four of those in Norway.

357
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:05,946
His name was Mayhem.
He wasn't always Mayhem.

358
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:08,730
Just as you weren't always Grinder.

359
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:11,236
Look, there he is.
There's Justin.

360
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:13,227
And that's you, Darrel.

361
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,354
Justin and Darrel.

362
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:18,822
You see, what we want to do

363
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,827
is find whoever it was
that killed your boyhood friend.

364
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,456
What makes you think I even know?

365
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,738
Everyone knows everything
in the metal world.

366
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,768
It's a small world breeding

367
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,374
whispers, conjecture... secrets.

368
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,550
You may have even heard
rumors of who murdered him.

369
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:41,070
But you're not going to tell us,
'Cause we're outsiders.

370
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:43,389
That would be breaking the code.

371
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:45,528
So, we're just going to ask:

372
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:47,977
who had him before the Norwegians?

373
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:50,885
Who crucified your boyhood friend?

374
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:54,067
We would have got him back,
you know.

375
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,835
Got him back from who?

376
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,195
Zorch.

377
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:58,488
Excuse me?

378
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:00,615
That lame deathcore outfit?

379
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:03,191
They consider themselves deathcore.

380
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:04,869
I consider them crapcore.

381
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:08,308
What they did to Justin,
though, was totally awesome.

382
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:09,790
It was brilliant.

383
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,669
And what would you have done with
Justin if you had stolen him back?

384
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:18,534
We would have hung him up
behind us, man.

385
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:21,626
It would have been epic.

386
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:23,854
Legendary.

387
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:46,653
I'm disturbed that despite
my extensive training

388
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,570
as an anthropologist,
all of these bands sound alike

389
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:53,435
and appear to share identical
belief systems and mores.

390
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,587
Yeah, except for the trained
anthropologist part,

391
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,423
that's how my dad felt about
Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys.

392
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,133
I have no idea what you're saying.

393
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,448
Listen, Bones, I don't want you
there alone, okay?

394
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,394
Just get a good look at this guy,
and you get out; do you understand?

395
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,519
You ready?

396
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,809
- Sweets
- Sweets is there?

397
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,300
Well, I think it's him.

398
00:21:11,425 --> 00:21:13,804
Yeah, I had to meld
to get information.

399
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:16,279
Zorch's lead singer is Murderbreath.

400
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:24,324
Look at that. Who does he think he
is? The guy with the tongue from Kiss?

401
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,687
Do you know what? Just tell
Sweets to leave Gene alone.

402
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:28,871
Just get a photo,
and get out of there.

403
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,705
Zorch and Spew are sworn enemies.

404
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,792
It started out with the fans throwing
feces at each other, then some attacks.

405
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:37,045
Culminating in medieval torture?

406
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,721
Do it! Do it!

407
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,973
- Wait. He's got a knife.
- Who's got a knife?

408
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,735
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

409
00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:54,896
Nah, don't worry. It's totally fake.

410
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,892
That's... not fake.

411
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:06,741
- What's happening?
- Murderbreath slit his own throat.

412
00:22:07,185 --> 00:22:08,353
Excuse me.

413
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,781
We need a compress.

414
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:17,835
You could've asked.

415
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,931
Hold this against the wound.

416
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:26,302
- Booth, can you call it in?
- Listen, I'm not hanging up, Bones...

417
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:28,983
- Help is coming.
- Bones?

418
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,165
Stand back, please.
FBI. Stand back!

419
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:48,449
Why'd you arrest me?
I'm the one with the cut throat.

420
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,171
Maybe you shouldn't talk too much.

421
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:53,371
- No, his larynx wasn't affected.
- This is my actual voice.

422
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:56,091
Sounds exactly like when you sing.

423
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:57,759
Like gravel in a hubcap.

424
00:22:57,884 --> 00:23:00,503
So, that was
a very good night for you.

425
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,557
Word gets around that you slit
your own throat for real...

426
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,732
You got it.

427
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:06,592
Tonight, I'm a legend.

428
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:09,721
Do you have any idea
who switched your prop knife?

429
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:12,449
One of the guys in the band, a fan,

430
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:15,212
someone from another band, maybe
I did it myself. Who cares?

431
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:17,787
- I bet it was Spew.
- How about Spew?

432
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,863
Evidence indicates that you
killed and crucified their bassist.

433
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:24,574
This just gets better and better.
I'm getting credit for that?

434
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:28,489
No. See, the thing is, that
same credit could send you to prison.

435
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,537
Okay, listen, Bones, just tell him
you don't care if he did it or not,

436
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:34,037
you'll just throw his ass in jail.

437
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:38,750
Look, it's all right to lie during
an interrogation. It's a technique.

438
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:44,014
The evidence is inconclusive
regarding your guilt,

439
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,591
but I'll damn well make
sure it's conclusive!

440
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:49,090
- What?
- Attagirl. Give it to him.

441
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,694
I will perjure myself if I have to,
because you...

442
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:54,891
make... me... sick, punk.

443
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:57,518
I'll put your ass on death row

444
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,147
and laugh at your execution.
I will testify that your knife was used

445
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,698
to make these gouges.

446
00:24:02,823 --> 00:24:05,276
I will also prove that whatever
implements we find...

447
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,360
any props, knives, cleavers,
all of your stage ware...

448
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:12,805
I will show that it was
used to mutilate his remains.

449
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:14,994
Which they probably were.

450
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:17,705
- Good to know.
- There's no rock concerts in prison.

451
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,917
- There are no rock concerts in prison.
- Rock concerts?

452
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,423
I want immunity from desecration
of human remains.

453
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,217
No promises, dirtbag!

454
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:34,339
Just tell him that we will talk
to the prosecutor on your behalf.

455
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,866
But we'll see what we can do.

456
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:49,140
Maybe six months ago,
there's a rumor,

457
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:52,601
Mayhem's dead and buried
under Bridge 6,

458
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:54,909
westbound lane State Road 66.

459
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,870
6 6 6 the sign of the devil.

460
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:00,357
- Who told you?
- I dunno. Nobody.

461
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,291
Everybody. It was in the air, man.

462
00:25:02,692 --> 00:25:04,042
Dug up the bones.

463
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,245
Somebody heard about
this old Viking torture thing.

464
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,675
Sounded like a great gag,
and it was, until Skall stole it.

465
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,884
Skall-eh.

466
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,214
- Doesn't matter.
- Just trying to help.

467
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,849
I dug him up, stole the cross,
fastened the bones to it.

468
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,880
But you didn't kill him.

469
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,886
I believe him.

470
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,892
Now, my last official task

471
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:34,217
as an FBI shrink is to declare you

472
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:35,633
fit for duty.

473
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:37,618
Gordon, Gordon, gun under the table.

474
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,436
I'm sorry. Sorry. Jeez.

475
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,134
- So, Booth is back?
- He's back.

476
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:45,209
So, what's next for you, Doc?
I mean, when you stop shrinking heads?

477
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,795
I've been accepted
by the Institute of Culinary Arts.

478
00:25:48,744 --> 00:25:50,798
- You're going to be a chef?
- That's correct. Yes.

479
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,504
I'm going to put good things into people
instead of taking out bad things.

480
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:56,585
Which I know
sounds rather Freudian, but...

481
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,223
Sigmund's been largely discredited
so to hell with him.

482
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,726
I don't see why you can't do both.

483
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,937
We still don't know
who murdered Justin Dancy.

484
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,020
Baby steps.

485
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:07,315
You will prevail.

486
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,849
This subculture takes every notion

487
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:12,153
of community
and turns it upside down.

488
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,886
No matter what they say,

489
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:16,511
the fact remains
that they are artists.

490
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,315
They create.
No true nihilists ever creates.

491
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,662
These dark tortured people

492
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,659
may rail against the night,
but they make

493
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:25,917
music.

494
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:28,540
On an oscilloscope,
what we call "music"

495
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:31,255
is demonstrably distinct from
we call "noise."

496
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,715
Your Dr. Sweets
liked it as an adolescent.

497
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,516
He's turned out rather well...

498
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,470
for the most part.

499
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,124
"For the most part"?

500
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:42,395
I read his book.

501
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,352
And, as is the case
with most writing,

502
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,117
it reveals more about the writer
than about the subject matter,

503
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:49,864
- which, in this case, is you.
- Can you provide an example?

504
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:50,942
For one thing,

505
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,955
he finds it extremely frustrating

506
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,239
your lack of willingness to discuss
your childhood experiences with him.

507
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,449
- What does that tell you?
- No, don't ask him that.

508
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,618
He'll think
we both had traumatic childhoods.

509
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,513
We did.

510
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:03,948
Your father was a violent drunk
and mine abandoned me.

511
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:05,975
Thanks. Just tell everybody here
at the diner.

512
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,505
- Go ahead.
- Sweets...

513
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:09,774
has scars on his back.

514
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:11,379
Old ones.

515
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,339
- Really?
- What kind of scars?

516
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,652
Like he'd been

517
00:27:14,777 --> 00:27:16,175
- whipped.
- Whipped?

518
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,218
I saw them.

519
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,823
That explains his near-obsession

520
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:22,014
with your childhood trauma
doesn't it?

521
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,898
Okay, I did an Internet search
of Spew's concerts.

522
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,564
Now, this stuff is all uploaded
from cell phones, so

523
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:34,902
the quality is crap.

524
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,279
Check this out.

525
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,920
This girl runs up.

526
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:39,845
Here's the gun. She fires,

527
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:42,410
then Mayhem literally spews

528
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,203
the blood all over the crowd.

529
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,734
And there's the blood.

530
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,208
Obviously fake.

531
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:53,585
It's a set piece. I've seen this same
setup maybe 60 times in two years.

532
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,631
Is it the same girl every time?

533
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,175
I'm pretty sure it is.

534
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,634
The image quality stinks.

535
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,654
Except I combined
all the different cell phone versions...

536
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,763
Nice!

537
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:06,642
We can get an ID from that.

538
00:28:06,922 --> 00:28:09,186
Can you arrange these shows
in chronological order?

539
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:13,208
They all contain
embedded cell phone codes so, yeah.

540
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:16,611
Did he ever bleed from his ass? Because
that's where we found the fragments.

541
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,363
Clark determined that the gunshot
wound to the victim's ilium

542
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,546
occurred 10 months
prior to his death.

543
00:28:21,671 --> 00:28:22,472
There.

544
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,704
He fell down that time
behind the audience.

545
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,745
Have you got another angle on this?

546
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:29,994
Oh, there.

547
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,419
The bullet splinters his instrument.

548
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,870
Right into his ass.
That's our money shot right there.

549
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,986
Not so tough when the blood is real,
are you, metal boy?

550
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,150
So, this is you, isn't it?

551
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:52,021
My manager said not to talk to you
until he gets here.

552
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,154
Death metal chicks have managers?

553
00:28:58,455 --> 00:28:59,605
Look at that.

554
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,913
Metal to what?

555
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:02,241
Power punk?

556
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,055
It's a much larger market,

557
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,619
but I still retain
my artistic integrity.

558
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,288
Right. Do you still shoot
bass players in your new gig?

559
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,997
Is that was this is about?

560
00:29:11,122 --> 00:29:13,501
It's not my fault if someone
replaced the blank.

561
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,336
I think you knew that.


562
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:18,945
Otherwise, you would've shot the guy
in the neck like every other time.

563
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:22,134
I'm waiting until my manager
gets here.

564
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,887
We can do that. In the meantime,
I'm going to show you this picture.

565
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,055
You see...

566
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,548
Your boyfriend is flinching
before you even pulled the trigger.

567
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,437
I say the two of you
were working on this together.

568
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:36,263
It was Justin's idea, okay?

569
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,820
He was always trying to prove other guys
he was more hardcore than them.

570
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,388
- Was he?
- Well,

571
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,140
he wanted me to shoot him,
so, yeah, I gave him his props.

572
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,415
So, what?
Now that I'm making some money,

573
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,332
he's coming after me for shooting him
in the ass two years ago?

574
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,253
Justin's dead. He was murdered.

575
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,193
What?

576
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,300
Oh, God, those stupid bastards.

577
00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:05,857
Those stupid...

578
00:30:06,492 --> 00:30:08,139
- You have to get them.
- Get who?

579
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,057
Probably a fan found out.

580
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,684
Maybe someone in Spew.

581
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,144
This is totally my fault.

582
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,535
Okay, found out what?
Why is it your fault?

583
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,975
Maybe a year ago,
he gave me a call saying that,

584
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,443
he wanted to get back together,
join my band.

585
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,770
Some hardcore metal fanatic
found out and killed him.

586
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:39,991
The striae and kerf width
on each side of the bisected ribs

587
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:42,965
match the saw that the FBI found
at the Zorch concert.

588
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,758
Fingerprints are all Murderbreath's.

589
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,311
He already confessed to digging up
the corpse and mutilating it.

590
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,730
So you're
looking at the greenstick fractures?

591
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,830
Would you mind getting on all fours?

592
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:01,484
- Is that strictly necessary?
- Yes, please.

593
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,460
So the fractures

594
00:31:06,268 --> 00:31:08,831
are adjacent to the articulation

595
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:10,396
with the spine.

596
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:12,912
Now, with evidence
of inward bowing...

597
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,345
Incomplete fractures,

598
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,020
evidence of inward bowing
if I place my knee in your back...

599
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,295
Hello! Tunnel vision, Dr. Brennan.

600
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,010
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

601
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,420
That scenario explains
all the bone damage and fractures.

602
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,810
So stabbed and then garroted?

603
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,574
What if the wounds to the C5

604
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,476
aren't from a stab, but instead

605
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,853
the result of the victim
being garroted?

606
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,395
The puncture occurred
on the back of his neck.

607
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,000
But what would do that?

608
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,225
Barbed wire.

609
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,195
Yes, his ex-girlfriend is right.

610
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,475
Following her into the mainstream
would be seen as the ultimate betrayal.

611
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:54,485
Like leaving a cult?

612
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,756
We think that the victim
was garroted,

613
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,833
most likely with barbed wire.

614
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,877
The murderer will lay claim.
He'll keep a souvenir.

615
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,421
Yes, in the same way
that a serial killer will.

616
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,827
But it isn't for his own satisfaction.
It's a way of

617
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:08,935
boasting of what he's done
to the community.

618
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,586
Yeah, it's a totem,

619
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:14,515
a signifier of some kind that can
only be discerned by the cognoscenti.

620
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:16,684
OK, how are we going
to figure this out?

621
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,811
None of us speak Italian.

622
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,438
He does that, doesn't he?

623
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,049
He wants to be underestimated.

624
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,105
You, you're one
of the cognoscenti, Dr. Sweets.

625
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,230
Oh, no.

626
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:31,115
I've outgrown that.

627
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:34,029
Mostly. Okay, maybe sometimes I'll

628
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,954
listen to a few bootleg tapes
when I've had a bad day...

629
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,630
That's good because this music sucks,
and the people who listen to it

630
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:41,500
- are defective.
- Thank you so much.

631
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,940
I have no doubt that your parents
said the same thing

632
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:46,396
when you were listening
to my music, Agent Booth.

633
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:48,340
According to one
of your squint reports

634
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,775
a bullet was gouged out
of the victim's ass?

635
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,500
- You read Clark's report?
- Only because I was on desk duty.

636
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,481
Now,

637
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,473
that bullet

638
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,088
could be a good totem pole.

639
00:32:58,213 --> 00:32:59,463
A totem, Booth.

640
00:32:59,588 --> 00:33:01,891
A totem pole is much larger.

641
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:06,108
Yes, but nonetheless,
it would be a good totem pole otherwise.

642
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:12,406
Someone murdered the kid
for leaving the fold...

643
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,159
Then uses a knife
to gouge out the bullet.

644
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,527
- Buries the body under the bridge.
- Knowing that

645
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:21,081
the cognoscenti will see the bullet
and assume he is the murderer.

646
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,084
But Murderbreath finds the body,
puts it on display.

647
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:26,211
Stealing credit.

648
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,679
So, we're looking for a bullet then?

649
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,970
Look here.

650
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,780
Our good, happy friend Pinworm

651
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:35,095
wears a smashed bullet

652
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,463
around his neck inside of a cross.

653
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:48,651
Is it too much to hope
that the fellow's scratching out

654
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,694
his confession in block letters?

655
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,755
Right here,
right inside the cross:.22 caliber.

656
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,678
Completely consistent with the mark
it left in the victim's ilium.

657
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:58,243
Bones and I will go in there.

658
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,892
What we do not need to hear

659
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:03,367
is a lot of psychological
mumbo jumbo stuff in our ears.

660
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,128
Okay, so are you bored
with psychiatry?

661
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,422
Is that it, people don't have
the capacity to surprise you anymore?

662
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:13,847
People surprise me. You surprise me.

663
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:14,885
Me?

664
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,596
Few people looking at you
would know what you'd been through.

665
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,780
I beg your pardon?

666
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,635
You were adopted.

667
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,395
And the people who adopted you
were an older couple.

668
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,204
Probably too old for standard adoption
of an infant, meaning

669
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:29,692
you weren't an infant.

670
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,947
You were, what...

671
00:34:31,072 --> 00:34:32,008
four?

672
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,196
Six.

673
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,963
Six, yeah. Special needs.

674
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:38,075
A child who'd been through
some sort of hell,

675
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,741
a damaged child.

676
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,913
But these were loving,
wonderful people.

677
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,306
They saved you...

678
00:34:47,924 --> 00:34:49,211
but now, they're gone.

679
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,729
You're an orphan?

680
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,916
My parents died
within weeks of each other.

681
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,330
Recently, I'd say.
The wound is still fresh.

682
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,897
Just before I came to work here.

683
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,120
So now, you're mostly alone
in the world. But

684
00:35:06,616 --> 00:35:08,416
they had time to save you.

685
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,883
They gave you a good life,
and that's why you believe

686
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:15,195
that people can be saved by other people
with good hearts.

687
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,230
That's the gift
your parents left you. That,

688
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,424
and the gift of a truly good heart.

689
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,080
That gives you a deeper calling

690
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:27,455
I do not share.

691
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:37,820
<i>I don't remember
where I got this bullet.</i>

692
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:43,932
<i>You dug it out of
Justin Dancy's pelvic bone with a knife.</i>

693
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:45,912
Hardcore, man.

694
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,221
I dug it out of his ass,

695
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:50,731
and then hung it around my neck.

696
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:51,845
Legendary.

697
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,500
If people think that means I killed him,
there's nothing

698
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,025
I can do about it.

699
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,641
You know...

700
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:00,346
you're one of us.

701
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:03,051
Up to your elbows in corpses
and murder.

702
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,870
It's hot.

703
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,538
Thank you.

704
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,932
So what, was

705
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,062
Lexie like your Yoko Ono?

706
00:36:10,187 --> 00:36:11,752
What is that? A Bible reference?

707
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,505
So let's just say Justin decided to go
with Lexie.

708
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,495
What would that do to your band?

709
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,415
No way any member of Spew does that.

710
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,762
Never happen.

711
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,888
Why not?

712
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:27,231
Because we are the real thing,
the genuine item.

713
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,603
<i>Our music isn't made to be enjoyed.</i>

714
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,605
It's made to be feared.

715
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,982
It comes straight from hell.

716
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,944
Right. You don't know anything
about hell.

717
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,153
And you do?

718
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:40,781
See, I was a soldier and a cop.

719
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,495
I've identified hundreds of victims
of genocide.

720
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,154
I accept hell as

721
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:47,342
a metaphor for what I've seen.

722
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:50,252
You haven't seen hell
until you've been inside my head,

723
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,130
dreamed my nightmares.

724
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:56,243
Your delusional, cozy reality
doesn't even come close.

725
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,095
He's... he's enjoying
this attention.

726
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,209
It's what he feels on stage, isn't it?
The... the power.

727
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,500
But his sense of power
is totally dependent on an audience.

728
00:37:09,884 --> 00:37:12,381
Ruminate on Milton, Agent Booth.

729
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,440
Think Paradise Lost.

730
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,685
What does that mean?

731
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,724
Oh, Satan's greatest sin was pride,
vanity.

732
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,077
Right, okay, you know what?

733
00:37:32,202 --> 00:37:33,602
You're free to go.

734
00:37:34,823 --> 00:37:35,627
What?

735
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,994
My associate tells me that Murderbreath
confessed to the murder

736
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,425
and crucifixion of Justin Dancy,
so you're free to go.

737
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,801
What? Murderbreath?

738
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,261
Yeah. You're free to go.

739
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,735
No, Murderbreath
did not kill anybody.

740
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,766
He weighs, what, 40 pounds?
Have you not seen Mayhem?

741
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,352
Murderbreath didn't strangle somebody
with barbed wire.

742
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,605
It takes heft to choke a big guy
to death.

743
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,400
"Barbed wire"?

744
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:00,963
Well, you know,

745
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:02,571
nobody said anything about

746
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,839
barbed wire.

747
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,384
I think the correct term
is "gotcha".

748
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,100
Noddy Comet.

749
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,257
Look at that, unbelievable.

750
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,025
This is you singing?

751
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,261
Yeah, my alter ego,
I supposed you might say.

752
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:30,235
A bisexual spaceman with a taste
for six-inch platform shoes,

753
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,391
spandex, glitter

754
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:34,827
and an exhibitionist's disdain
for underclothing.

755
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,618
Well, here's to Gordon-Gordon.

756
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:38,855
Without him,
we would not have solve the murder.

757
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,651
I hate to admit it, but it's true.

758
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,119
- To Gordon-Gordon.
- Stop, please.

759
00:38:43,497 --> 00:38:45,614
This is exactly what Sweets wanted.

760
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,700
I'm too good a psychiatrist ever
to leave, et cetera. Well, no...

761
00:38:49,956 --> 00:38:52,412
Just put your glasses down, would you?
Please.

762
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,631
Might I offer you a word
of advice regarding

763
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:58,919
- young Dr. Sweets?
- Might we try to stop you?

764
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,837
Why do we need advice about Sweets?

765
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,589
We don't. Sweets is just fine.

766
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,592
He most definitely is not fine.
I've read his book.

767
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,553
- Does he say something mean about us?
- On the contrary.

768
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,995
You might as well know
that he lost both his adoptive parents

769
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,187
just before he came to work for your

770
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:16,061
de facto crime-fighting unit.

771
00:39:16,548 --> 00:39:18,230
What are we,
The Land of Misfit Toys?

772
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,845
He's a good lad, Sweets,
but this book he's writing,

773
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,569
he's using it as the vehicle to get
what he actually wants, which is...

774
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,115
A family.

775
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
So he

776
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,868
imprinted on us? Like a baby duck?

777
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,999
- So what do we do?
- Nothing. Sweets is not a baby duck.

778
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,085
He wants what we all want.

779
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,295
He wants to find out
his place in the world.

780
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:44,639
We can find
a permanent place for him.

781
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:45,764
Right?

782
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:51,763
Gordon-Gordon is going to want us
to divulge

783
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,231
or share or bond or something awful.

784
00:39:54,356 --> 00:39:55,956
Perhaps you might just

785
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:59,479
show the lad that he's not the only one
with scars on his back.

786
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,689
But he is.

787
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:03,396
Too literal?

788
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:05,944
By the way, what I'm making here,

789
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:10,113
this is the masterpiece that got me
accepted into the Culinary Institute.

790
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:12,367
But it doesn't keep.

791
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:13,923
So,

792
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:16,163
- be back in an hour, yeah?
- Let's go.

793
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,505
- But where are we going?
- Duck hunting. Come on.

794
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,880
- Not literally. Right?
- Come on.

795
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:44,191
I miss you, rock and roll.
I really do.

796
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,135
What are you doing here?

797
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,178
Well, Gordon-Gordon is

798
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,127
making dinner or us at my place,
family-style. And,

799
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:06,004
you're invited.

800
00:41:06,284 --> 00:41:07,484
Thank you, but

801
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:09,256
I've got a lot of work here...

802
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:12,886
My foster parents locked me in the trunk
of a car for 2 days when I broke a dish.

803
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,554
I was a very clumsy child.

804
00:41:14,936 --> 00:41:16,473
They warned me it would happen,

805
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,891
but the water was so hot and the...

806
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:20,888
soap was so slippery.

807
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,825
I still don't think it was fair,
even though they gave me fair warning.

808
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,600
The water was so hot...

809
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,620
No, it wasn't fair at all.
It wasn't your fault.

810
00:41:31,098 --> 00:41:32,898
Bones, what are you doing?

811
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:35,450
You said that "scars on the back"
was a metaphor.

812
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,165
Isn't that why we're here,
to metaphorically compare scars?

813
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,248
I came to bring Sweets back to my place
for dinner, that's all.

814
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,836
"Scars on the back"?

815
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,838
I saw them, Sweets.

816
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,633
So...

817
00:41:51,356 --> 00:41:52,717
What? You decided to just

818
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,177
share something

819
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,512
from your past?

820
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,100
That is so unlike you.

821
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:01,101
I still hate psychology.

822
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,104
Your turn.

823
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,322
Go.

824
00:42:05,578 --> 00:42:08,859
I came here to bring Sweets back
to my place for dinner, that's all.

825
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,100
Okay, if it wasn't
for my grandfather,

826
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:16,408
I probably would've killed myself
when I was a kid.

827
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,369
That's all I'm going to say
on the subject matter. Understand?

828
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,623
- Are you okay, Bones?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

829
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:25,200
Here.

830
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,530
- Why are you nodding?
- Nothing. Just...

831
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,186
Wyatt made an observation
about you two,

832
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,604
and I think I just saw what he saw.

833
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:48,311
- You coming?
- Booth means

834
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:50,150
that we'd like it if you joined us.

835
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:52,395
- Thank you.
- Great! Here we go. Let's go.

836
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,854
- Gordon-Gordon is making cassoulet.
- It's bean stew.

837
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:57,225
Cassoulet is better than
regular stew, Booth.

838
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,705
Just because it's French
doesn't mean it's better.

839
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,535
- It sounds better than stew.
- See?

840
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,753
- Sounds better.
- It's stew. It's stew.
