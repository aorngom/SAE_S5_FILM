1
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:05,374
Lo, the cave where the princess
doth dwell.

2
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:10,439
Let the light of Mithryleen
guide our path.

3
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:12,428
Smells like ass in here, yo.

4
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:13,792
Yo?

5
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:15,970
Who is this Yo of whom you speak?

6
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:18,643
- I know him not.
- For real, Trev. Let's go back.

7
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,533
Those other freaks are gonna beat us
to the treasure, anyway.

8
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:24,286
The name's Blackthorne,
and you'd do well to remember it.

9
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:28,304
Your name is Trevor Vertuca,
and that is your mom's cell phone.

10
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:30,947
Now call her to pick us up,
or I will.

11
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,968
This is getting old, right, Ezra?

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,032
A rat? Come on.

13
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:39,878
Wait for me! Wait for me!

14
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:43,999
Look, I'm sorry about this.
We don't usually break character, but...

15
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:46,737
I mean, you have to dock points;
I understand.

16
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:53,414
What the...?

17
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,105
Open up!

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,984
All right, all right,

19
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,922
all right, I'm comin', it's...

20
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:08,160
Just keep it down.

21
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,777
What's taking so long?

22
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:16,188
Hi.

23
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:18,727
- What's wrong?
- Nothing; come on in.

24
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,471
How about some coffee?

25
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:21,872
Arabian Bean!

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,249
- You hurt your back again?
- No, no...

27
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:25,167
No.

28
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,337
Yeah, it's that obvious?

29
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,574
Your gait suggests you re-strained

30
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:32,948
your anterior longitudinal ligament.

31
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:35,253
Yeah, well,
I blame the couch, all right?

32
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:37,554
I fell asleep last night
watching the game.

33
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:41,134
Look, I figured you fixed
my back last time, really well,

34
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,199
I just thought that maybe
you could fix it again,

35
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:46,395
so use your little magic knuckles,
and hit it up, and we're good to go.

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,066
If this has become a recurring problem,
you should see a specialist.

37
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,198
Right, I get it,
all disclaimers apply.

38
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:53,857
Here we go, hit the back,
chop, chop, we got a case.

39
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:54,982
No.

40
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,183
No?!

41
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:58,492
Last time I had this,
you were begging to help me.

42
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:01,156
I probably shouldn't have touched you
the last time.

43
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,580
You need a medical doctor.

44
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,542
I'm not asking you
to perform surgery;

45
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:08,589
just do what you did last time,
and fix it with your magic knuckles...

46
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:11,380
Look, there's no one I trust more

47
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,209
to get my back and

48
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,382
crack it, than you.

49
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,677
You want more?

50
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:24,325
No, that was effective.
Turn around.

51
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,011
- Ready?
- Go.

52
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:31,400
This is gonna be good.

53
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:34,122
Believe me,
I really am not going to forget...

54
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,033
... this.

55
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:40,280
How is he?

56
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:43,684
Dr. Patel suspects a herniated disc
in Booth's lumbar region.

57
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:46,041
We'll know which vertebrae
when the X-rays get here.

58
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,313
So you didn't actually paralyze him?

59
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,613
No. The Vicodin seems to be working.

60
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:53,868
He claims it makes
the furniture feel friendly.

61
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:56,183
But he'll be on bed
rest for the remainder of the week.

62
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:57,630
Are you okay?

63
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,609
Of course.
I wasn't the one who was injured.

64
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,002
Admittedly, I shouldn't have let Booth
talk me into adjusting him.

65
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,348
- Agent Perotta.
- Dr. Brennan. Nice to see you.

66
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:11,232
I was honored you requested me
as a substitute for Agent Booth.

67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,625
The variables involved
in breaking in a new person

68
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,591
outweigh the benefit of possibly
finding a better investigator.

69
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,405
Let's not get gushy about it.

70
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:20,840
Agent Perotta and I
inspected the dump site,

71
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:23,272
and I cleared the body to be
transported back to the lab.

72
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:24,934
We haven't determined identity yet.

73
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:28,123
Booth usually waits for me to conduct
my own examination of the scene.

74
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,163
Do you want to go back there?

75
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:31,282
No.

76
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:34,171
I'll examine the remains here,
thank you.

77
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,245
Mr. Fisher, welcome back.

78
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,382
What are your preliminary findings?

79
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:43,105
Victim is female,
25 to 29 years old.

80
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:47,063
Severe damage to the skull; the mandible
is almost completely severed.

81
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:50,557
Avulsions to the tissue at the maxillary
and mandibular incisors...

82
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:51,772
that's very unusual.

83
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,811
It's like her face was hit
by a wrecking ball.

84
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,569
This damage is going to make
facial reconstruction very difficult.

85
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,872
Yeah.

86
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:01,323
Flesh is all yours, Dr. Saroyan.

87
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,640
Does that mean we're officially
investigating a murder?

88
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,913
She's just upset because
she put Booth in the hospital.

89
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:12,403
I understand that, but I still need
someone to officially say "murder."

90
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:13,528
Murder.

91
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:14,876
Thank you.

92
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,734
So... what do we make
of this clothing?

93
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,177
Like a costume
out of Lord of the Rings.

94
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,746
The porno version.

95
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:25,753
Fisher, you're into this stuff.

96
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:28,434
- Porn?
- Fantasy. Sci-Fi. Geek stuff.

97
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:30,102
A superficial judgment.

98
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:33,522
Both feet display erythema
and heavy blistering,

99
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,154
but no calluses.

100
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:38,419
My guess is, she was standing
in those princess pumps for hours.

101
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:39,987
The skin here,

102
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,824
on the back of the hand, is less
desiccated than the area surrounding it.

103
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,826
Not sure what that means yet.

104
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,032
May I?

105
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:54,084
Hello.

106
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,821
It's a spectroline UV stamp.

107
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:03,177
They're designed
to withstand evaporation.

108
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,609
No match to any local bars or clubs,
but I'm still searching.

109
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:09,316
- Agent Perotta discovered this?
- Yes.

110
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,753
You should be nicer to her.

111
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,688
Well, I like working with Booth.
I'm nice to him.

112
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,816
Okay, I admit, I'm a geek.

113
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,069
- You're Greek?
- No, geek, sweetie.

114
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,238
I love it all.
Star Trek, Star Wars,

115
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,449
Buffy, Xena, Akira.

116
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,024
I even watch Fringe.

117
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,537
My girlfriend Jill dumped me
because of it,

118
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,104
which is depressing.

119
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,083
Fisher, what doesn't depress you?

120
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,510
Answers.

121
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,211
I know that insignia.

122
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,086
I bet the victim was
a booth babe at ImagiCon.

123
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,070
I don't know what that means.

124
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:43,217
ImagiCon?

125
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,705
It's a convention
for fans of genre movies,

126
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,100
comic books, video games, anime.

127
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,737
And it's at Union Center
till the end of the week.

128
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:54,232
Click on "gallery"
for Booth Babe Roundup.

129
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:55,606
Yeah. When Dr. Saroyan

130
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,065
talked about the victim standing
on her feet for hours,

131
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,088
sort of started to click for me.

132
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:01,213
Stop.

133
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,696
That's definitely our dress.

134
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:06,753
And judging from
her zygomatic arches

135
00:06:06,878 --> 00:06:08,659
and facial contours,

136
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,131
there's a good chance
that's our victim wearing it.

137
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:12,955
Someone should inform Agent Perotta.

138
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:14,373
That'd be you, sweetie.

139
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,092
Of course.
I will inform Agent Perotta.

140
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,011
These people
don't look like killers.

141
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:30,701
I...

142
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,290
disagree.

143
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:41,900
Bones - Season 04 Episode 05
"The Princess and the Pear"

144
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,903
Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak

145
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,593
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

146
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:09,945
Fascinating.

147
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,788
A summit between the disenfranchised
and the commercial franchises.

148
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:17,227
I'm at a loss
for an anthropological analogue.

149
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:19,980
So you really did a number
on Booth's lower back?

150
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,399
He had a mechanical problem which

151
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,005
didn't show up on his X-rays.
My adjustment aggravated.

152
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:28,530
So, it was an accident.

153
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,181
Yes. Why?
Did Booth tell you something different?

154
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:33,928
No, no, no.
In fact, "aggravated" was,

155
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:36,297
exactly the word he used.

156
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,838
Oh, there's the Grimoire 3.0 Booth.

157
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:50,895
I'm Special Agent Perotta, FBI.

158
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,013
This is Dr. Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

159
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,740
We need you to answer
a couple of questions.

160
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:58,727
Yeah, that's Kendra Kim.

161
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:00,938
- You can call me Shiny.
- Why?

162
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,065
It's my name, Shiny Kopinsky.

163
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:04,422
Shiny,

164
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:07,402
you didn't find it strange at all
that Kendra didn't show up for work?

165
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,690
I just figured the Grimoire people
fired her, for her attitude.

166
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:12,421
What are Grimoire people?

167
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:13,740
Grimoire 3.0

168
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:17,079
is the online encyclopedia fantastica
for the mouth breather crowd.

169
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,252
Your job is to sexualize software?

170
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:21,458
You mentioned
Kendra had an attitude.

171
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,669
Kendra thought she was a princess.

172
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,004
She kept bragging about the fact
that this was her last

173
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,340
trade show and she was sitting
on some gold mine,

174
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,836
- and it was gonna cash in big.
- What was the gold mine?

175
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,426
She wouldn't say.

176
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,638
But one day,
I followed her on a lunch break.

177
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,432
I figured I'd catch her talking
to some game developer.

178
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,727
I mean, those guys are loaded,
and some of them even smell normal.

179
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:45,013
But the only person I saw her talking to
was some loser at the Blacksmith Booth.

180
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,824
Are you Kroon the Blacksmith?

181
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:53,684
Kroon, I am.

182
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:55,472
And who be ye, fair maiden?

183
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:59,496
I be a special agent
in search of justice and truth.

184
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,151
Yea, thou art.

185
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,922
- How can I assist thee?
- By knocking off the medieval stuff

186
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:07,045
- and answering some questions.
- That would make me feel comfortable.

187
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,948
I assume "Kroon the Blacksmith"
is not on your driver's license.

188
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:11,258
The name's Peter Kroon.

189
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:13,495
I don't know what you've heard,
but these weapons

190
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,395
are all legal and accounted for.

191
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,681
- Do you know this young woman?
- I know her first name.

192
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,183
- Kimba.
- Kendra.

193
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,810
Whatever.
She's the girl with Excalibur.

194
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,354
You mean the sword
from the King Arthur mythos?

195
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,369
Yes.

196
00:09:25,494 --> 00:09:28,442
Though in this case, it's a prop sword
from the film "La Mort d'Arthur."

197
00:09:28,754 --> 00:09:30,248
- Is she in trouble?
- No.

198
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:31,498
She's dead.

199
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:33,488
Do you sell nunchaku?

200
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,067
No. No.

201
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,537
Why do you ask if she's in trouble?

202
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,380
She stopped by and asked me
how much I'd give her for it.

203
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:41,609
Excalibur.

204
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,227
I take a look, and go,

205
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:45,584
"Whoa, that ain't
no ordinary cutlery."

206
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:48,128
I have to wonder if it's hot.

207
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,546
You know, stolen.

208
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,685
- Did it have significant value?
- It was worth thousands.

209
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,051
Tens of thousands.

210
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,595
You weren't tempted to kill her,
take it for yourself?

211
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,926
Look, I could've told her
it was worth two hundred bucks,

212
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:00,566
ripped her off, but I didn't.

213
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:02,851
I sent her to Carl Derf
to list it at the auction.

214
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:05,729
Why was this piece of cutlery
worth so much?

215
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:09,188
It was the actual prop
wielded by Guy Thivisol

216
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:11,443
in the first fantasy film ever made!

217
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,820
The Excalibur from this film is

218
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:17,008
the holy grail
of fantasy memorabilia.

219
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,355
Here it is.

220
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,446
Beautiful.

221
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:24,414
And you have no idea
where Kendra Kim got it?

222
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,458
She said she got it from her family.

223
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:28,482
- You don't believe her?
- That sword

224
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,785
hasn't been seen in 20 years.

225
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:34,424
What I thought was that she got it
from someone else here.

226
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,261
- Stole it?
- Stole it, maybe.

227
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:39,292
The girl was hot.

228
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,391
That goes a long way
in a place like this.

229
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,009
Trauma is limited to the skull.

230
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:53,544
Once I clean the skeleton and get a beer
look at the mandibular damage,

231
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,491
I'll know more.
Or get fired for incompetence.

232
00:10:56,616 --> 00:11:00,033
I am finished with the soft tissue,
so you can remove the flesh now.

233
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,488
According to our old friends
Diptera and Coleoptera,

234
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:05,141
I'd place actual time of death
about 72 hours ago.

235
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,624
Also, I discovered soil
under her nails,

236
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,418
along with traces
of Virginia nailwort.

237
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,509
Neither native to the dump site.

238
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,174
What's with the long face there,
sunshine?

239
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,675
Mr. Fisher just broke up with his
girlfriend, he's feeling a little down.

240
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,770
What about me?
My girlfriend and I broke up,

241
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:23,509
I gotta see her at work every day.

242
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:26,560
Obviously, it hasn't blackened
your soul like it has mine.

243
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:29,896
- There was some light charring.
- I'm dead inside.

244
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,774
Okay, you win. Happy?

245
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:34,985
Not that I can ever remember.

246
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,492
What did your doctor say?

247
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,608
Something about a possible

248
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:45,954
herniation

249
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,962
occurred on my disks L-3, L-4.

250
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:52,063
Nothing, you know,
a little rest stretching...

251
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:54,504
Maybe a good massage
will just kick it right out.

252
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,008
Intervertebral disk degeneration
shouldn't be taken lightly.

253
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,298
Are you wearing
your lumbo-sacral support belt?

254
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:01,423
Yeah,

255
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:03,847
a girdle, you mean.
Yes, it's nice and tight.

256
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:05,438
Oh, hold on.

257
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:09,685
- It's Booth.
- Hey, it's Perotta.

258
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,855
How you doing?
You need anything?

259
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,303
No. I am just dandy.

260
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:16,284
Well, if you do...

261
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,987
we found the victim's father.

262
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,890
- We did?
- Who's that?

263
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:23,811
- It's Booth.
- No, no, no, before it was you.

264
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:26,036
Booth, you pressed "conference."

265
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,215
- It's me Booth.
- Booth is on painkillers.

266
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,063
Is the victim's father coming in?

267
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:32,000
- I want to be there.
- No, you can't.

268
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,002
- He can't.
- Why?

269
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,355
Yes, I can.

270
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,316
What are you still doing
on this call?

271
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:40,011
No, Agent Perotta,
his back is very bad.

272
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,429
He can't be there.

273
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,053
You can't let him in.

274
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,537
Yes, I can.
I am the ranking officer.

275
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:48,183
But you are incapacitated
by painkillers.

276
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,544
Bones, enough, okay?
I'm not incapacapitated,

277
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,519
whatever you said there,
all right? I just...

278
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:54,528
Don't listen to her, Perotta.
Don't.

279
00:12:57,446 --> 00:12:59,749
Did you daughter
live at home with you, Mr. Kim?

280
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,375
No.

281
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:04,324
No. Kendra lived
in a condo in Logan Circle.

282
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,202
Look, ask him when was the last time
he saw his daughter.

283
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,738
- What was that?
- This is Agent, Booth.

284
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:11,623
Hello?

285
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,401
He's unable to be with us in person.

286
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:17,644
Kendra and I didn't see
each other much,

287
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,330
despite the fact
that I put a roof over her head.

288
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,683
According to the modeling agency
that booked your daughter,

289
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:24,648
all of her checks were sent
to your address.

290
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:27,931
The money went to pay the mortgage
on the condo, which is also in my name.

291
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,475
It's kind of a weird arrangement,
now isn't it?

292
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,601
So's this.

293
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,396
Well, considering my situation
and my back, just...

294
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,398
continue.

295
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:41,445
Kendra was about as irresponsible
as a person could be.

296
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,821
I told her,

297
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,850
after she paid her debt to me,

298
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:46,805
she could spend her money
how she wanted.

299
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,082
Tough love.

300
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,330
- Did you give her a sword?
- A sword?

301
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,666
It's a knife, but it's only huge.

302
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:55,834
No.

303
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,681
But did you daughter mention
that she might've something of value?

304
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:00,380
Because you'd take it away from her.

305
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:04,092
- Okay, this doesn't work.
- Don't shut me off!

306
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,639
I'd like to take a look
at your daughter's condo, Mr. Kim.

307
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,618
Looks like someone
really wanted that sword.

308
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,077
Precise slashes to the couch
and removal of ventilation

309
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:43,797
screens suggests purpose
frustrated in the search.

310
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:46,801
Digital answering machine
behind the bed. It's cracked.

311
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,221
See if Computer Forensics
can get anything off of it.

312
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,181
Found some running shoes
in the closet.

313
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,517
Soles contain insects,
soil and blood.

314
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,912
- You want our lab or yours?
- Yeah, mine.

315
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:58,427
I'd like to see you try
and get these away from me now.

316
00:14:58,552 --> 00:15:00,106
Figuratively speaking, of course.

317
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,567
Anything else, Dr. Hodgins?

318
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,903
In some ways,
you're just like Booth.

319
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,965
Mean that as a compliment.

320
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,597
I don't think you do.

321
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:12,077
Check this out.

322
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,525
Mandibular trauma downward,
maxillary trauma upward.

323
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,225
Trauma to the molars
extends bilaterally.

324
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,945
The force radiated symmetrically
from the center of her mouth.

325
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,463
It's like her face exploded.

326
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,960
Certainly nothing I've seen before.

327
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,145
Very good, Mr. Fisher.

328
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,270
Really?

329
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,570
Just seems like the truth is further
away than it was before

330
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:36,601
and like laughing at us.

331
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,063
Process of elimination is a key
step to discovering the truth.

332
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,025
I've seen many
unusual murder weapons.

333
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,113
So the fact that I don't recognize
this one, rules out all the others.

334
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:51,658
My kind of silver ling.

335
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,409
It's depressing.

336
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,135
The blood I found on the Booth
babe's running shoes... not human.

337
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,503
I think our princess kissed a toad.

338
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,365
Bufo Americanus. American toad.

339
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,695
- So she stepped on a frog?
- A toad.

340
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,910
Bufo Americanus.

341
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:16,266
Which amphibian is down to
one local population

342
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:17,433
right here

343
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:18,756
near the Potomac

344
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:22,855
in an area which matches the soil and
the flora found beneath her fingernails.

345
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,483
She went for a run, stepped on a frog,
and buried something.

346
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,988
A toad, and yeah, that's the picture
forming in my mind, too.

347
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,835
We pulled this message off
the victim's answering machine.

348
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,245
I don't know who you think
we're fooling, little princess,

349
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,728
but you're playing with a woman
who gets what she wants.

350
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:42,631
You've got three days.
I want that sword.

351
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:47,185
You want me to do a profile from
a voice on an answering machine?

352
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,132
Give it a shot.
You're a smarty-pants.

353
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:51,009
Okay, fine.

354
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:53,869
"You're playing with a woman."
That suggests that the caller

355
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,139
regards the victim
as a child in comparison.

356
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,099
Okay, so, so what, an old woman?

357
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,225
No, no, experientially.

358
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,195
Probably in terms
of sexual experience.

359
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,905
So you're looking for
someone fairly promiscuous.

360
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,805
I think that she's already tried
to take the sword from a man,

361
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,737
and now is truly annoyed that
she has to deal with a girl.

362
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,082
The auctioneer is a man,

363
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:18,286
and he evaluated the sword
before Kendra panicked and buried it.

364
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,514
I can assure you that this
is a clean and fair auction.

365
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,490
We've been running this
auction for 15 years.

366
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,672
Please answer the question,
Mr. Dorf.

367
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,585
"Derf."

368
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,893
Yes, I certified
and registered the item.

369
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,504
I gave the consigner an option
to store it in our secure room.

370
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:35,512
She declined.

371
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,745
Consigner has to give you
detailed contact information, right?

372
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,599
- They want to get paid.
- And sometimes

373
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:43,403
you give that information to certain
parties interested in

374
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:44,780
illegal pre-bidding?

375
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:47,590
What? No, no.
Look, I told you before...

376
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:49,117
Your pupils are constricted,

377
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,240
- suggesting an increase in adrenaline.
- What?

378
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:54,321
And the change in voice pitch
indicates increased pressure in the neck

379
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:56,050
via the laryngeal prominence.

380
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,201
- What, what are you saying?
- You're lying to us.

381
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,746
Kinesthesia is a clear indicator
of dissembling, Mr. Dorf.

382
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:04,207
"Derf." But look...

383
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,825
Do you recognize this voice?

384
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,178
I don't know who you think
you're fooling, little princess,

385
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:10,619
but you're playing with a
woman who gets what she wants.

386
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:13,750
You've got three days.
I want that sword.

387
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:15,844
Did that woman contact
you about the sword?

388
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,324
Yes, she did.

389
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,055
Her name is Valerie Daniels.
She's a medieval weapons collector.

390
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:24,955
And you provided her with Kendra
Kim's address and phone number.

391
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,314
Every auction does private
pre-bids, and no one ever gets...

392
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,725
- Hurt?
- What? Wait a minute.

393
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,230
What about Excalibur? Did you find it?
Is it still going up for auction?

394
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:37,795
Booth is right.
You're like a portable polygraph.

395
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,620
He didn't mean that in a good way,
though, did he?

396
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:49,377
This is quite a collection of medieval
and fantasy weapons, Miss Daniels.

397
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,381
My parents call it a waste of my trust
fund, which is praise enough for me.

398
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,239
Seems like an unlikely
hobby for a young woman.

399
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,130
I like sharp edges.

400
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:01,012
I like sharp against soft.

401
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:04,750
- What do you like, Dr. Sweets?
- What?

402
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,180
Can you account for your
whereabouts Wednesday night?

403
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:09,564
Yeah. I was somewhere
not killing Kendra Kim.

404
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,983
- That's what you wanted to know?
- It's not what I asked.

405
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,495
I was at the Immortal
Comics after-party.

406
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:17,255
You can ask Dean Noveck,
the publisher.

407
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,615
We slept together.
The sex was vanilla.

408
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,451
At least I got an alibi
out of it, right?

409
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,162
You feel a need to be in control,
don't you, Miss Daniels?

410
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:26,664
I'd like to control
you if you're up for it.

411
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,583
Oh, I assure you I'm not.

412
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:32,485
And your attempt to regain
self-esteem through sexual intimidation

413
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,131
will not repair the dysfunctional
relationship you had with your father.

414
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,805
Abandonment, abuse, indifference.

415
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,091
You are far more ripped under those
schoolboy duds than one would think,

416
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,226
aren't you, Dr. Sweets?

417
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,675
Yes, but right now,
I'm more interested to hear

418
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,149
why you trashed Kendra's condo
after you didn't kill her.

419
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,943
Her condo was trashed?

420
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:58,447
They were looking for Excalibur.
That's what you wanted, right?

421
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,556
I travel the world

422
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:03,284
tracking down rare
and beautiful weapons.

423
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,205
I do research, I develop contacts,
I put in serious work.

424
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,720
Along comes this booth
babe with a famous sword

425
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:11,895
thought to be lost for decades.

426
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:14,838
- She didn't deserve it.
- But you deserved it.

427
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,381
I asked her where she get it.

428
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,999
She said somebody dressed
as a black knight

429
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:21,678
just gave it to her
on the first day of imagicon.

430
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,597
Just walked up and presented
it to her as a gift.

431
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,349
She expected me to believe that?

432
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,990
I didn't kill the girl.

433
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:32,644
I just wanted the sword.

434
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,254
- Thanks for coming along.
- Yeah,

435
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,076
Any chance to get some fresh air.

436
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:47,977
Lone guy with a metal
detector in the bushes...

437
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:49,247
Looks kind of creepy.

438
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,149
It is.
And I know you.

439
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,750
Oh, boy!

440
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,295
- Frog!
- Toad, not frog.

441
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,763
Bufo americanus.

442
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,308
And virginia nailwort.

443
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,111
We're close to where
she buried the sword.

444
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:03,586
Hold on a second.

445
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:07,198
I got frequency response.

446
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,343
Excalibur.

447
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,990
I am the once-and-future king.

448
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:26,284
Way to not be creepy.

449
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,938
That is not a toy, dr. Hodgins.

450
00:21:39,063 --> 00:21:40,893
It kind of is.
It's a movie prop.

451
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:42,178
Stainless steel blade.

452
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:43,968
That was new technology
for the time.

453
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,179
- Edge is dull, of course.
- May I see?

454
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,872
It's badly balanced.

455
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,145
The blade is warped.

456
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:57,664
All of the prints on
the sword belong to Kendra Kim.

457
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,069
- Could this be the murder weapon?
- She wasn't stabbed or slashed.

458
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,113
The damage to her jaw is unique.
Wasn't from being struck with a sword.

459
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:05,902
Is that the sword?

460
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:07,235
Can i?

461
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:13,998
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

462
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,023
Actually, the age in which swords

463
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:19,220
were the primary infantry weapon were
some of the most barbaric in history.

464
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:20,755
It's a line from Star Wars.

465
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:21,923
Obi-wan Kenobi.

466
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,876
What language is
that supposed to be?

467
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:25,252
Why is he all excited?

468
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,721
Finding this sword has given us
a unique advantage in this case.

469
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,179
We now have what
the killer wants the most.

470
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:33,685
It only makes sense that the
killer's gonna come after it again.

471
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,627
Dr. Sweets wants to lay a trap.

472
00:22:35,752 --> 00:22:38,315
You said that the auctioneer
is no longer a suspect, correct?

473
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,316
So we lean on him
to fake the auction?

474
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,318
We can't auction off evidence.

475
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,362
Uh, I never thought of that.

476
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:46,914
We could insert an undercover asset

477
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,995
who outbids everyone for the item
no matter how high the price goes.

478
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,815
The auction's tomorrow. I don't have
time to set up that kind of operation.

479
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,956
I'll do it.
You and Dr. Brennan

480
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,126
have already been seen walking around
imagicon asking questions, right?

481
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:01,462
Whereas I am an unknown quantity.

482
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:02,964
An enigma.

483
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,467
Who is this man bidding
so aggressively for excalibur?

484
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:09,470
I'm confident
that if our killer is there,

485
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,472
this will provoke him
to reveal himself.

486
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:13,433
I play the mystery bidder, you...

487
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,566
observe the unsuspecting suspects

488
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:17,478
via video feed in a separate room.

489
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:19,453
Who's gonna run the camera?

490
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,651
We need someone who blends in.

491
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,631
Someone who looks
like they belong there.

492
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:27,655
I drug your ghost across the country

493
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:31,075
and we plotted out my death
in every city

494
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,794
memories would whisper,
"here is where you rest," ah.

495
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,808
What's wrong now?

496
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,299
Sold to the rancor princess.

497
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,193
Congratulations, ma'am.

498
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:51,514
Is there a special reason why
you wanted me here, agent perotta?

499
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:54,682
I- I thought you wanted to
be involved in the investigation.

500
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,017
Uh, um, okay.

501
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,635
Pan around, fisher.

502
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,320
- We have an imperial...
- Good.

503
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:01,741
There is peter kroon.

504
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:04,338
Bidding starts at...

505
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,503
And there is valerie daniels.

506
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,819
Let's hope she doesn't
recognize sweets.

507
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,573
There's the black knight.

508
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,951
Valerie daniels said that a
black knight gave Kendra the sword.

509
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,133
All right, stay on this one, Fisher.

510
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:18,133
Okay, lot 922.

511
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:20,696
We have here the geiger counter,

512
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:23,503
the actual geiger counter
used by ron berger

513
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,213
in the day of the atom.

514
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,966
Who can forget that sound right
before the giant cockroach attack?

515
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,717
Bidding starts at $10,000.

516
00:24:33,842 --> 00:24:35,098
Do I have ten?

517
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,320
Ten to the elven warrior!

518
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:39,852
15 to the snaarflap
in the front row.

519
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:41,562
Do I have 16?

520
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,633
Sixteen?

521
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:43,885
$20,000!

522
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,817
Going once, twice.

523
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:47,984
Sold to the gentleman molnar!

524
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:49,320
Uh, sorry, ma'am.

525
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,780
Female molnar.

526
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,851
- They're, uh, difficult...
- Okay, here we go.

527
00:24:52,976 --> 00:24:54,075
Sword is next.

528
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,785
Fisher, find sweets.

529
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,621
Sweets, you got to try
to keep that giant

530
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,269
fuzzy thing between you
and valerie daniels, okay?

531
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:02,583
She won't recognize me.

532
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,885
Where did he get
that disguise on such short notice?

533
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,629
My guess is his closet.

534
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:09,549
Our last item needs no introduction:

535
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:13,719
the excalibur sword from
the film Le Morte Darthur.

536
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,101
As you may have heard, the seller
of this item tragically died this week.

537
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,936
According to her family's wishes,

538
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,938
the proceeds from
this lot'll go to charity.

539
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,898
Due to the rare nature of this item,

540
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,359
bidding will start at $50,000.

541
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:35,199
This will separate
the men from the boys.

542
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,492
Or the women!

543
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,953
$50,000 to the lady in black.

544
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:40,413
Do I hear 55?

545
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,589
Sixty?

546
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:44,750
60 to the gentleman from
the future with the red lips.

547
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,169
Do I hear 70?

548
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,378
$70,000, yes!

549
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:49,324
Do I hear 80?

550
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:51,174
$80,000!
Do I hear 90?

551
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,550
We have 80 on the table.

552
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:53,574
Do I hear...

553
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:54,969
One hundred and fifty.

554
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,217
Fisher, let take a look at this guy.

555
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:01,285
$150,000.

556
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:04,773
Going once, twice...
One hundred sixty!

557
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,298
One hundred and seventy!

558
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:07,607
Two?

559
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,525
$200,000!

560
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,488
Who is that guy?

561
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,907
Who is that guy?

562
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,060
This was johnny gerard's
first ever fantasy film.

563
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:20,328
$300,000!

564
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:22,261
Sir?

565
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,541
$400,000!

566
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:29,003
$400,000!

567
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,155
In 193 a. d., the praetorian guard
took over Rome

568
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,473
and auctioned off the entire empire
to the highest bidder.

569
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:36,385
I don't know why I'm nervous,
but I am.

570
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,575
Sweets, it's fake money.

571
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,217
- Okay? Just do it.
- ... twice...

572
00:26:40,342 --> 00:26:41,724
- Do it!
- Five hundred!

573
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,576
$500,000 for the excalibur sword.

574
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,647
A half a million dollars.

575
00:26:47,827 --> 00:26:48,606
Sir?

576
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:51,776
Ma'am?

577
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,322
$500,000 going once...

578
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,492
Twice...

579
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,830
Sold to the skinny
gentleman dressed as a...

580
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:06,916
Congratulations, sir.

581
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,751
And thank you, everyone.

582
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:10,327
Great job!

583
00:27:10,452 --> 00:27:13,089
Join us at the medieval weapons
demonstration in the exhibit hall.

584
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:15,216
How you doing?

585
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:19,262
Just making a documentary.

586
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,892
Well, I am gonna
go talk to james bond.

587
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:29,272
Nice suit.

588
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:31,154
Got a minute?

589
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:36,375
Badgley mormont?

590
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,864
- Is that your real name?
- Of course.

591
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,199
It's a family name.

592
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,909
Could I get my passport back?

593
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,996
- You in a big hurry to get somewhere?
- I need to make a flight, yes.

594
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,831
What's your business with the sword?

595
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,126
I represent a group of collectors
known as the arthurian consortium.

596
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:53,812
We house the world's largest collection
of materials relating to camelot.

597
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,923
They wanted the sword.

598
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,580
That was actually pretty wild.

599
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:01,142
But I'm pretty sure no one
realized the auction was bogus.

600
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,930
The auction was fixed?!

601
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,697
I'm going to sue you,
and I'm going to sue you.

602
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:17,236
You know, intellectually, I knew
the auction was fixed, but,

603
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,518
man, my heart was pumping.

604
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:22,457
Well, technically,
your adrenal glands were secreting.

605
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:24,621
Okay, remember last session
when we talked about

606
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,517
the correcting and how it could
be read the wrong way?

607
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:28,642
Right.

608
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:30,624
So...

609
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,209
How did it feel

610
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,545
when you won the sword?

611
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,589
Awesome!
Thank you for asking.

612
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,508
Though I got to say, i'll be glad
to be back behind my desk.

613
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,761
I had enough excitement
to last me...

614
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:08,954
Stop!

615
00:29:35,778 --> 00:29:37,233
Sweets, are you hurt?

616
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,932
I- I don't know.

617
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,486
I don't know.

618
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:43,614
Mad props.

619
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:44,934
Thanks.

620
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,075
You okay?

621
00:29:53,281 --> 00:29:54,712
Okay, you know what?

622
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,836
I'm coming in, right!
You could've been killed.

623
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,580
No, you shouldn't move, booth.
With a herniated disc,

624
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:01,978
the splintered cartilage
can irritate the nerves and...

625
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:03,008
I'm fine.

626
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,712
So the-the pain is gone?

627
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,429
Don't feel a thing.

628
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:08,240
I might not be

629
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:10,746
moving as fast, but, hey,

630
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,772
still haven't lost my edge.

631
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:15,271
So why wasn't perotta with you?

632
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,526
I was with Sweets.

633
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,774
That's like being
protected by a smurf.

634
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,483
Not the sheriff,
the guy who was in charge.

635
00:30:21,964 --> 00:30:25,239
I don't even know his name,
but he was blue, small guy...

636
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,907
Booth have you taken more vicodin?

637
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:29,076
Look, Booth, I'm fine.

638
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,256
Sweets is fine.

639
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:32,631
A little shaken up,
but really, we're both fine.

640
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:34,665
- Please don't come in.
-  If you think so.

641
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:37,835
But I'm ready.

642
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,879
That's amazing in your condition.

643
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,964
Well, you know me.

644
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,403
I really think you should
just take your vicodin and rest.

645
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,261
Okay.

646
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,872
- Let me talk to Perotta.
- All right.

647
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:51,697
He wants to talk to you.

648
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,062
How are you, agent booth?

649
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,939
The only reason
that i'm not coming in,

650
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,571
is because bones told me not to.

651
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:02,444
But she is your responsibility.

652
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,082
Nothing can happen to her, okay?

653
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:07,289
If anything happens to her,

654
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,767
you know,
that silky black hair and...

655
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,621
That soft skin...

656
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,758
I will not let her out of my sight.
You have my word.

657
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:20,336
Now, uh, we should really
get back to the case,

658
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:23,130
- agent booth.
- Am I stopping you?

659
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,524
Let me in.

660
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:32,795
All right, i'm gonna go, uh,

661
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:35,809
round up as many black knights
as I can at imagicon.

662
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,258
In the meantime, please don't
go out in the field without me.

663
00:31:38,383 --> 00:31:39,553
I don't need a sitter.

664
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:41,516
Booth gets needlessly
protective sometimes.

665
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:43,072
I have no idea why.

666
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:44,759
You really don't, do you?

667
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:46,153
No.

668
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,156
Just call me.
Please.

669
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,509
Matched paint chips
that we lifted from sweets's car.

670
00:31:55,634 --> 00:31:59,031
Copolymer comprised of ethylenically
unsaturated monomers

671
00:31:59,156 --> 00:32:01,544
containg hydroxyl groups
and other vinyl monomers.

672
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,004
You know, they could
have been killed, hodgins.

673
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,756
Sweets is way too young for this.

674
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,383
He has to show his id to drink.

675
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,697
- But they weren't.
- And Brennan...

676
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:12,555
She shouldn't be putting
herself in danger like this.

677
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:16,225
She cares too much to keep it in the lab
and you're never gonna change her.

678
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:20,020
Why can't she just get her rocks off
through sex like a normal person, right?

679
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,198
I agree.

680
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:24,525
And in the spirit of friendship,
if...

681
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,448
You know, you ever...

682
00:32:28,505 --> 00:32:30,155
Saved by the beep, huh?

683
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,077
The paint is from
an early'90s ford explorer.

684
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,281
Now, all perotta has to do is find
an evil black knight that owns one.

685
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:45,882
There's blood on the blade,
so you landed some hits

686
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,766
on the errant knight, he's injured.

687
00:32:47,891 --> 00:32:48,882
Can you pull DNA?

688
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,718
Sure, but we've nothing to compare.

689
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,570
There are some fresh
nicks on the blade.

690
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:55,139
Only metal would damage
the blade like this.

691
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,599
Was he wearing armor?

692
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,475
His movement wasn't
constricted at all.

693
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,762
He jangles.

694
00:32:59,887 --> 00:33:01,812
Sweets.
How are you feeling?

695
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,632
Appreciative of the air bag.

696
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:05,983
Doctor says I'm fine.
Thanks.

697
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:07,610
- Jangled.
- Yeah.

698
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,228
A lot of change in his pocket?

699
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:11,494
I wasn't particularly observant
because during

700
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:14,534
the attack, I secreted copious
quantities of adrenaline.

701
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:17,995
An attack is an acceptable excuse,
Dr. Brennan.

702
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,638
I'll have hodgs examine the sword,
and see what he can find.

703
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:21,561
Okay.

704
00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:23,584
I have to thank you,

705
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,634
Dr. Brennan, for saving my life.

706
00:33:25,927 --> 00:33:27,180
I owe you a great deal.

707
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,883
I'm sure you would have done
the same for me, Dr. Sweets, if...

708
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:32,951
I had been trapped in the car.

709
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:37,139
Though I have to say, you were
quite impressive with that sword.

710
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,715
Your moves... Very...

711
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,079
- Xena-ish.
- Xena-ish?

712
00:33:41,204 --> 00:33:42,061
Xena...

713
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:45,848
She's a tall warrior
princess who is really...

714
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:47,441
a fantasy.

715
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,443
Okay, thank you, I... think.

716
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,720
Since we shared
this brush with death,

717
00:33:52,845 --> 00:33:55,854
Dr. Brennan, I was wondering
if I could also call you "Bones"

718
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:57,754
in future moments
of shared camaraderie?

719
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:59,161
Don't call me "Bones."

720
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,827
Sure about that, Bones?

721
00:34:00,952 --> 00:34:02,245
Please, don't.

722
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:06,085
None of them drives a ford explorer,
and they all have alibis.

723
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,391
Four that can be
corroborated by their moms.

724
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,202
Any way for you
to get blood samples?

725
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:12,633
No. Me dressing like
a medieval knight isn't exactly

726
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,828
enough to get a warrant
to collect dna.

727
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,179
Maybe you could get the names
of a few more black knights

728
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,015
from these black knights?

729
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Okay.

730
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,185
But I gotta tell you, being
addressed as "Milady" for 2 hours

731
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,021
makes me a little cranky.

732
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,264
Morning Milady.

733
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:34,236
Mr. Fisher!

734
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:35,906
This is the murder weapon.

735
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,701
Not the literal murder weapon...
I'm not that good...

736
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,245
but it certainly falls
within the genre or type.

737
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,393
What is it?

738
00:34:42,518 --> 00:34:45,454
The pear of anguish,
a medieval torture device.

739
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:46,829
Valerie had it.

740
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:48,502
Valerie...?

741
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,839
One of the suspects
in the case Valerie Daniels?

742
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:53,779
How did you get it?

743
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:56,078
Oh, do we really
have to get into that?

744
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:57,177
Now we do.

745
00:34:58,031 --> 00:34:59,763
Our eyes met at the auction.

746
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,075
We shared a bleak
and profound hopelessness.

747
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,394
You spent the night with a suspect?

748
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,353
Yes.

749
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,190
Valerie enjoys quite a collection
of torture devices,

750
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,219
and other archaic implements used
for pleasure rather than pain.

751
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:16,522
- May I?
- Sure.

752
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:20,584
This particular pear of anguish

753
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:23,705
is to be inserted in either
the vagina or the anus.

754
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,019
There are larger ones for the mouth.

755
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:28,636
As it is opened, it expands
the hard palate

756
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:30,335
and mandible in equal proportion,

757
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,255
which would give exactly
these injuries.

758
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,538
Crushing the maxilla
and zygomatic...

759
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:37,968
thrusting the bones into the brain,

760
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:39,642
killing the victim.

761
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:42,514
That is one horrible way to die.

762
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,159
I wish the depravity and cruelty
of human behavior surprised me.

763
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:48,207
Does that extend
to disciplinary action?

764
00:35:48,332 --> 00:35:50,606
'cause you are in big trouble,
my melancholy friend.

765
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:52,227
Of course I am.

766
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:54,952
Who could expect
a night of love to last?

767
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:09,041
I've done every test
I can think of on this sword.

768
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,669
Can I say something?

769
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,280
I only thing I'm willing to hear
from you right now, Mr. Fisher, is

770
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,941
"I hereby tender my resignation."

771
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:17,969
Practically speaking, this sword
is not worth enough to kill for.

772
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:22,062
If any thing is worth killing for,
then everything is worth killing for.

773
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:24,556
It's worth so much because
it appeared in the movie.

774
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,355
That's conveyed value.

775
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,770
Intrinsically it can't be worth
more than a few hundred dollars.

776
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,791
You mean if it really was a sword from
100 ad, you'd understand killing for it?

777
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:34,846
Yes, I would.

778
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:38,137
I'd like very much to
examine a sword like that.

779
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,164
- What about the marks on this sword?
- Metal.

780
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,199
- You struck metal.
- You said he was a knight.

781
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,417
Chain mail.

782
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:46,161
I'm thinking chain mail.

783
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,388
What?

784
00:36:49,513 --> 00:36:52,263
The knight who attacked
me was authentic in his moves.

785
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:53,903
He used two attack maneuvers:

786
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:55,949
the serpent and the arrowhead.

787
00:36:56,074 --> 00:36:57,574
Could've learned them from movies.

788
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01,093
Movies never show combatants
holding the sword correctly,

789
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,137
which is one hand on the handle
and the other on the blade.

790
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,140
Our assailant's form
was historically accurate.

791
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,979
So, uh, you believe
you were attacked

792
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:11,937
by an actual Arthurian knight?

793
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,524
No. Time travel is
scientifically impossible.

794
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,234
But I was attacked by

795
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,820
someone well-trained in archaic
martial arts, wearing chain mail.

796
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:23,265
Hodgins, we're gonna need to use
your metal detector again.

797
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,390
Sure.

798
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,450
I think she means
that you should go with her.

799
00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:29,137
Oh, yeah, right.

800
00:37:29,262 --> 00:37:30,497
Hey, field trip.

801
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:41,784
What's that?

802
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:44,636
Part of sweets's car.

803
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,180
- Think he wants it back?
- I'll ask him.

804
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,392
So what am I looking for exactly?

805
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,702
Maybe the black knight
dropped his metal wallet?

806
00:37:52,827 --> 00:37:55,532
No. Historically, that would be
a leather sack

807
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:57,138
held together with flax thread.

808
00:37:57,263 --> 00:37:59,651
It wouldn't register
on your metal detector.

809
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,889
I hit him hard.

810
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:03,214
Perhaps hard enough to dislodge...

811
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:04,810
some...

812
00:38:05,488 --> 00:38:06,888
of his chain mail.

813
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:15,034
What we're looking at
is flat riveted chain mail.

814
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,376
Is it real?

815
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,881
If by "real," you mean does
it come from medieval times? No, no.

816
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,091
But it's a very, very good replica.

817
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:24,593
Made of wrought iron.

818
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,679
It's alternating rows of
solid rings and riveted rings.

819
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,183
Historically accurate, but the smelting
methods for the wrought iron are modern.

820
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,644
- Can you trace the manufacturer?
- I had fisher do it.

821
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,608
Hodgins,
are you trying to help someone?

822
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,401
Because that's not
in your character.

823
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:43,528
The way I see it,
fisher's like a deep cover agent.

824
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,187
He infiltrated
the enemy to uncover secrets.

825
00:38:46,312 --> 00:38:48,621
In order to do so, he had
to suffer a night of passion

826
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:50,786
with a beautiful
but dangerous enemy.

827
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,580
You have no idea how dangerous.

828
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,873
He's sort of my hero.

829
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:57,876
All right, what have you got?

830
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,876
I didn't have to go far.

831
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,967
There are only three manufacturers

832
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,966
working at this level
with these materials.

833
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,062
Can I please keep my job

834
00:39:06,187 --> 00:39:08,684
if I promise never ever
to have sex again

835
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:12,265
with anyone, which, by the way,
suits me temperamentally?

836
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:14,752
I happen to be very self-sufficient.

837
00:39:15,513 --> 00:39:19,133
I won't require that, Mr. Fisher,
but I do require discretion.

838
00:39:19,258 --> 00:39:22,275
Nothing will pass these lips again,
Dr. Saroyan.

839
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:25,697
Even if a scary, hot woman
in black leather

840
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,171
uses the pear of anguish on me.

841
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,575
Which I'm actually afraid she will.

842
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,793
Kroon the blacksmith.

843
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:44,872
You started out as
a serious historian at yale.

844
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:49,007
You studied medieval warfare
and chaucerian literature at oxford.

845
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,731
You're a published poet.

846
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:53,046
You're wondering how a man
with all my potential

847
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:55,017
ended up selling artifacts
to fantasy geeks?

848
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:56,567
No, I don't care.

849
00:39:56,692 --> 00:39:58,299
Your car shows you are the person

850
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:00,397
who drove Dr. Brennan
and Dr. Sweets off the road.

851
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,316
Your wound matches the one Dr.
Brennan delivered to her assailant.

852
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,007
It was your blood on the sword,

853
00:40:05,132 --> 00:40:06,876
and we found fragments
of your chain mail.

854
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,871
We know you did it.
We just don't know why.

855
00:40:08,996 --> 00:40:11,257
- But we really don't care why.
- Well, I kind of do.

856
00:40:11,382 --> 00:40:13,878
The motive thing,
it's pretty central to a conviction.

857
00:40:14,003 --> 00:40:15,553
I know why he did it.

858
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,632
Read this to him.

859
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,840
"What is a man without his love?

860
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:23,587
"What is a man without his love?

861
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,263
"If love turn its back on thee

862
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:30,177
"it is as a hearth with no fire.

863
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:33,263
"'tis best to slay
"the false heart, to...

864
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,349
"waken from the dream
that is life than

865
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,817
"live dark hearted in a dark world."

866
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:43,132
What's that?

867
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:44,318
It's mine.

868
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:45,817
I wrote that.

869
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:47,652
It's a confession.

870
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,221
It's a confession.

871
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:51,681
I loved her.

872
00:40:52,941 --> 00:40:54,141
Stupid, but...

873
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:57,553
love is stupid, you know.

874
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,792
You gave her the sword,
your most valuable possession.

875
00:41:02,154 --> 00:41:04,146
And she tried to sell it for rent.

876
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:06,880
You killed her because
she wanted to sell a movie prop?

877
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:09,145
You don't understand.

878
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:13,045
No one understands
true love anymore.

879
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,983
So he killed her because
he loved her so much?

880
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:30,174
The whole age of
chivalry was irrational.

881
00:41:30,885 --> 00:41:34,366
Knights, maidens, thank goodness
we've moved through the reformation

882
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,997
the enlightment into
the age of reason

883
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:40,122
Do...
Do you see what I mean?

884
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,684
Not at all.

885
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:44,068
I gotta tell you, I think they had
a pretty good idea with

886
00:41:44,193 --> 00:41:47,546
the whole chivalry thing, you know?
Open corridors...

887
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,651
kill dragons...

888
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,633
small hearts...

889
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,093
You still on vicodin?

890
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:54,675
Yeah, little.

891
00:41:55,144 --> 00:41:58,016
OK, what I'm trying
to show you is that...

892
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,350
your doctor's wrong.
You've been misdiagnosed.

893
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,145
- Give me that... What?
- Just a slight misalignment.

894
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,055
- I'll be happy to fix that for you.
- No.

895
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,341
Last time you did that,
I almost end up in a wheelchair.

896
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:10,068
- Do you trust me?
- Let's not make it about trust.

897
00:42:10,746 --> 00:42:11,989
But... It's a fact.

898
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:14,631
A fact is not what I make of it,
it's just a fact. Are you ready?

899
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:17,294
No, definitely not ready now,
thanks.

900
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:19,696
It's open.

901
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,411
I didn't...

902
00:42:26,536 --> 00:42:28,489
It's... it's that the door was open.

903
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:31,089
It is open, I'm done,
I'm just leaving.

904
00:42:31,393 --> 00:42:32,562
Oh no, no...

905
00:42:32,687 --> 00:42:35,581
I just brought some
chili I made, but...

906
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:39,472
You know, I'll just leave
that there, and you can...

907
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:43,575
Are you alright?

908
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,229
- He's fine now.
- I gotta tell you, I'm afraid to move.

909
00:42:46,526 --> 00:42:47,560
He's fine.

910
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,191
Please, you stay.

911
00:42:49,586 --> 00:42:52,027
No, no, I really...
I really can't, so... you stay.

912
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:54,495
I've got to go, I can't stay.

913
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,609
Great, now, nobody's staying?

914
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:02,348
Hello?

915
00:43:02,473 --> 00:43:04,536
