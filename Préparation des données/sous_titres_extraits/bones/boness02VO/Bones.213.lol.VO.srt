1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,800
Florida? Today?

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,500
Is that work?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,600
Hot, fun,
Miami, Florida or sticky,

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,700
you know,
swampy Florida?

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,900
Yeah. You're welcome.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,300
What's going
on in Florida?

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,100
Wait a second, what flight?

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,700
Hold on a second,
I can't hear you.

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,399
Enough with the song already,
all right?!

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,200
I'm doing business here.
Deal with it!

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,600
Hold on for a second.

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,300
Wait, now my pen's
out of ink.

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,899
Here.

14
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,899
You know, hold
on, you know.

15
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,899
I can't hear
anything!

16
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,900
The kids love the music.

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,599
Well, I don't
see any kids.

18
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,800
The music
attracts them!

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,400
Did you say the Everglades?

20
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,300
Look, I can't hear anything
because of this insane music!

21
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
You shot my clown!

22
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,700
Okay, flight number?

23
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Okay. Thanks.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, we're all set.

25
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,900
That was not good.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,100
I thought you said you'd be
down on the next flight.

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,300
I haven't met with
the shrink yet.

28
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,099
What shrink?

29
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,599
Oh, the department psychiatrist
has to sign a piece
of paper saying,

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
you know, that I'm not nuts
before I get my gun back.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So I got an appointment
tomorrow.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,600
Great.

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,000
Now I have to break in
this Agent Sullivan.

34
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,899
Wait, wait, Sully's a great guy.

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay? And for your information,
you never broke me in.

36
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,300
I think that's him.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,200
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,100
Dr. Brennan?

39
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,000
Uh-huh.

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,400
Name's Eugene.

41
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,400
Oh, okay, Eugene.

42
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,500
No, not me, I'm Sully--
short for Sullivan.

43
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,700
Well, then,
who's Eugene?

44
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,300
Eugene's been king of this swamp
for as long as I can remember.

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,200
Broke my heart
to have to shoot him.

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Is there an actual human victim?

47
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,700
Inside Eugene.

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,799
He ate somebody?

49
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,500
Damn spring-breakers
think it's a real kick

50
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,800
to come down here and drink beer
with the big fellow.

51
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,300
I just chased off a bunch
of them, and there was Eugene

52
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,699
in the middle of the swamp,
gulping down somebody's arm.

53
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,899
Someone from the group
of kids you chased off?

54
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,300
No, no.

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,000
Gator's don't eat fresh kills.

56
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,200
They drown their prey, then
they stuff it down underwater

57
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,600
to tenderize for a few weeks
before they can eat them.

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Okay, why don't you drag
the rest of the swamp
for any additional remains.

59
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,799
I'll check Fort Lauderdale
missing persons.

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
You, start cutting.
No.

61
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Well... isn't that
what you do?

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Any potential remains are far too sensitive
to be retrieved here.

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,800
Okay, well,
where do you suggest?

64
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,800
My lab at the Jeffersonian.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,100
The whole gator?

66
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,600
I'll handle transport.

67
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
You're gonna need a big crate.

68
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,200
And a lot of ice.

69
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,200
Okeydoke.

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, if you're
doing this,

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,700
then there's a boat for sale

72
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,000
that I'd like to check out.

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A boat?

74
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,500
Booth helps.

75
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,699
Because Booth can't relax.

76
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,300
There's something metal in here.

77
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,900
Don't you have a boat to buy?

78
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:35,700
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

79
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:46,600
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@MAOREN
Sync:FRM@Uranus</font>

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,499
I knew it was a gator,
Brennan told me it was a gator,

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
and yet... wow.

82
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,100
Definitely
confirms one thing:

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
We have the
coolest jobs ever.

84
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,000
Look at all these teeth.

85
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Step away, please.

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,600
There are 80 in total.

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,199
Note the conical shape.

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
"Step away, please"?

89
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,100
Just because you have
a doctorate now,

90
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,999
does not mean I won't
use you as a swizzle stick.

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,699
Animal foot, possibly a rabbit.

92
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,400
Not so lucky
for either of them.

93
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,900
Frog.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,700
Yummy.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,100
Do I hear music?

96
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,200
Hey, I liked
that song.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,400
What do you think, Zack?

98
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,600
Definitely a human foot.

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,900
Lovely.

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Dr. Wyatt.

101
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,200
Ah, Agent Booth, is it?

102
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,900
Yes. Gordon.
Gordon Wyatt.

103
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,000
Right, you
the shrink?

104
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,299
Shrink, yes,
meaning, uh, psychiatrist.

105
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,600
That's great, doc.
How's about you, uh,

106
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,000
just sign my piece
of paper here,

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,099
and I'll get back
to work, all right?

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,299
Certainly.
No, no, I have a pen.

109
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,800
Um, do you mind if I ask what
exactly it was that you did?

110
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,100
Yeah, I shot a truck.

111
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,400
Ah, full of terrorists,
no doubt,

112
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
or plutonium or fleeing felons, was it?

113
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,200
Nah, it was an ice cream truck.

114
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Yeah, the music,
it was bothering me.

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,700
Ah.

116
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,900
Yeah, there
was a speaker in a clown's mouth.

117
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,100
Yeah, I just pulled out my gun,
you know, and...

118
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
(making gunshot
sounds)

119
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,400
Gone.

120
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,600
So the FBI sent you to me
because you shot a clown?

121
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Not a real clown.

122
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,899
I suggest you cogitate
on the underlying reasons

123
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,100
you shot that clown
while I make us some tea.

124
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,100
Cogitate?

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
Tea?

126
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,099
The depth of
these bite marks...

127
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,500
very impressive.

128
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,500
One torn pair
of jeans.

129
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,700
One red linen blouse,

130
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,600
size two.

131
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,700
And one platform wedge.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Made it all the way
to the lower intestine.

133
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Florida FBI just beamed over
names of recent missing persons.

134
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,100
We'll need dental records.

135
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
Sully.
Cam.

136
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,300
Look at you, in charge
of Moon Base Alpha here.

137
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
And you're still a G-man.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,499
What happened to that restaurant
you were gonna open?

139
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,300
Or was it a... petting zoo?

140
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, I'm keeping myself open
for the perfect opportunity.

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I tried out a beautiful boat in Florida.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,600
But he made it back to shore.

143
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,299
Victim is female,
in her late teens,

144
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,400
eliminating three of your missing persons
right here.

145
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,699
So cause of death?

146
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
For the gator?

147
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,700
We have these .45 caliber slugs.

148
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,500
As for the girl,
so far, we got the gator.

149
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,400
Okeydoke.

150
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,700
Well, um...

151
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,700
I am gonna go
grab a slice,

152
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,200
so give me a call
when you got an ID.

153
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,900
Her name's Judy Dowd.

154
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,799
Shouldn't you at least look at
the X-rays before deciding that?

155
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,500
Says right here

156
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
she had surgery to repair
a cleft palate at age two.

157
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,100
The bone graft is here.

158
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,700
She was a freshman
at Virginia State.

159
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,300
Reported missing
three weeks ago.

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,500
An alligator?

161
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
Oh, my ...

162
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,600
When did you last see
your daughter, Mr. Dowd?

163
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,800
The day she left
with her friend

164
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
for spring break.

165
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Her friend, uh...

166
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,800
Abigail Sims?

167
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
Abby.

168
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,500
Good kid.

169
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
I never should've let her go.

170
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,600
We found this among the remains.

171
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
This was her
mother's.

172
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,800
Lainie died

173
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,400
when Judes was 11.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,300
It's just been
the two of us ever since.

175
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,400
Did you get
any calls from her while she was there?

176
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,200
Every day.

177
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Any sign that
she was in trouble?

178
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,800
No.

179
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,200
She...

180
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,100
She sounded happy.

181
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
So happy.

182
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,899
You are really English.

183
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,600
Oh, I don't know, I think
I've assimilated quite well.

184
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,800
Typical American house, right
down to the white picket fence,

185
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,100
truck that's the, uh-- what is
it?-- the heartbeat of America.

186
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,900
But tea, tea is

187
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,600
sacrosanct, thank you very much.

188
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,499
Me, I'm a coffee drinker.
Listen, pal...

189
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,699
You know, in an effort to
understand your culture better,

190
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,799
I've been trying to embrace this very American
practice

191
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,500
of preparing meat in the garden.

192
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,399
Barbeque.

193
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Mm, it's a delightful
word, isn't it?

194
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,200
"Barbeque."

195
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,400
I think it's from
the Caribbean, <i>barabicu,</i>

196
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,800
which means a sort of
sacred fire pit.

197
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,400
Did you know that the Latin
for "hearth" though is "focus."

198
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,600
Isn't that revealing?

199
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,500
It's quite literally
the focal point of every household.

200
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,900
The hearth, the heart. Huh?

201
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,200
I told the ice cream guy
I was sorry, all right?

202
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
I even bought him
a new clown head.

203
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,900
So just sign the paper.

204
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,500
I must apologize,

205
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,900
but I've got to go off and get
some ingredients for my mortar.

206
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,400
Um, why don't we reschedule?

207
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,000
We can't <i>reschedule,</i>
all right?

208
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,800
I got to get back to work!

209
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Oh.

210
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,900
Well, in that case, um,

211
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,699
why not finish off
preparing this area here?

212
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Could you do that?

213
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,400
All the specifications
are on the plans.

214
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,700
You are fit for physical labor,
aren't you?

215
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,900
I mean,
the clown didn't return fire, did it?

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,100
Well, what if I said that the plastic clown
did fire back, huh?

217
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,200
Brilliant.

218
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,700
Now, while I'm gone,
what I want you to do

219
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,800
is to consider what you were
really aiming at

220
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,300
when you drew a bead
on that unfortunate clown.

221
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,200
Hey, buddy,

222
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,299
when I aim
at something,

223
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,500
I hit it.

224
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,800
Precisely.

225
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,000
Anyway, I shan't
be long, Agent.

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
It's all on
the plans here.

227
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,299
I'll be back
before long, Agent.

228
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,999
See you then.

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Do help yourself to
more tea, by the way.

230
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
Like I told the police,

231
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,000
me and Judy were just doing
the usual spring break stuff.

232
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,799
The whole night
was kind of a blur

233
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,700
until I woke up the next morning
at the hotel

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,100
and Judy wasn't there.

235
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,100
She hadn't come back with you?

236
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I can't remember.

237
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,199
So why didn't you report it to
someone till later that night?

238
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,900
I thought maybe she'd hooked up.

239
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,900
Hooked up?

240
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,900
With anyone in particular?

241
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,400
We met so many guys.

242
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,500
You know how it is.

243
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,900
I'm guessing that she doesn't.

244
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,599
Do you have any pictures
from that night, Abby?

245
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,800
No. The police
took most of them.

246
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Wait, most of them?

247
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,200
There's a couple on my personal Web page

248
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,400
I didn't want them
showing poor Mr. Dowd.

249
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
Judy would never want him
seeing her like that.

250
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,900
Like... what?

251
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
Here's the spectrophotometric
evaluation on Judy Dowd.

252
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,900
Any results yet
on her tox screen?

253
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,999
No drugs, but her blood-
alcohol was sky high.

254
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Point one-one, and...

255
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,500
Oh, dear.

256
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,200
What?

257
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,700
SPM reveals hidden hematomas
in decomped tissue.

258
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,199
See this shaded
area here?

259
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,000
It indicates bruising
to her vaginal wall.

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,300
Meaning Judy was raped?

261
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,200
Or at the very
least, subjected to some extremely
unpleasant college sex.

262
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
With one of these
fine lads?

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,600
Without DNA, it's the proverbial
needle in a haystack.

264
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,600
Wait.

265
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,000
Our victim was an HSB?

266
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,100
Excuse me?

267
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,100
Hotty-Student-Body.com.

268
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,300
It's this website that
gets drunk college girls

269
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,300
from all over the East Coast
to take their clothes off.

270
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,200
I clicked on a pop-up,
got caught in a pornado.

271
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, splendid.

272
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,899
So, was it your father who
taught you to read plans?

273
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,300
Wrong tree, Doc, okay?
Dad and I were tight.

274
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,799
Only, it's just that
earlier you said

275
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,099
you weren't used
to drinking tea with men,

276
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,700
which suggests
to me that you are usually pretty rigid

277
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,900
in
your assignment of gender roles.

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What? No, no, m-m-my
partner's a woman, okay?

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,400
A woman who needs my help.

280
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,500
Ah, but are you currently
involved with anyone?

281
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,600
I just broke up
with someone, okay?

282
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,900
Me. And I ended it.

283
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,799
And how long had you been
involved with her?

284
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,699
Or, or him?

285
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,400
Her. Let's get that
straight, okay? Her.

286
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,900
Couple months this time.

287
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,300
This time?

288
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,800
We'd gone on-- we'd gone out
b-before a, a few years ago,

289
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,600
and, uh, you know,

290
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,799
we, uh,
I broke it up when, uh,

291
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
you know, my ex wanted
to give it another go.

292
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,900
Complicated.

293
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,899
Ah... that's it!

294
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,900
I shot the clown
because I can't let go
of the women in my life.

295
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,900
Ha! Thanks, Doc.

296
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,600
All right,
now I can go back to work,

297
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,900
and you can
sign the paper.

298
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Excellent theory,
but quite wrong.

299
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,600
And... we're
out of time.

300
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,100
Tomorrow all
right for you?

301
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,600
I tried.

302
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,700
We found a stab wound.

303
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
Let's see it.

304
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,499
It's more of a puncture really

305
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,000
hidden here among the bite
marks just below her scapula.

306
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,700
Angela doesn't like me
being her superior.

307
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,099
Because you're acting superior.

308
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,899
Which is what a superior is.

309
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,299
Don't be
a horse's ass.

310
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,000
She's your friend;
that's all that matters.

311
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,800
These ridge marks
inside the wound look like the threads of a screw.

312
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,400
We're trying to ID the weapon.

313
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,499
Well, at
the very least,

314
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,799
it proves that Judy
didn't stumble into the swamp and feed herself to Eugene.

315
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
That was my conclusion as well.

316
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,600
Okay.

317
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,700
And the hits
keep coming.

318
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,200
Seems Judy Dowd
was raped <i>and</i> murdered.

319
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,099
No more rough college sex?

320
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,400
Now that we know
it's a murder,

321
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,800
I'm feeling
a lot less charitable.

322
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,300
(young women cheering
and giggling on video)

323
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,600
What is all this?
Have a look.

324
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,800
Hotty Body rule...!

325
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,400
It was shot in Fort Lauderdale
the same night Judy disappeared.

326
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,400
Who's that?

327
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
His name is Monte Gold,

328
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,299
internet kingpin
and aspiring Hugh Hefner.

329
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,000
Monte has made millions off of this site.

330
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,299
He also paid out a million
in fines last year

331
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,900
for filming underage girls.

332
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,900
??

333
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,500
Monte Gold?

334
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,399
Uh-oh, grown-ups with badges.

335
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,200
Lloyd!

336
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,900
Hi, I'm, uh, Monte's
producer, Lloyd.

337
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,899
We've got, uh, shooting permits
and signed waivers.

338
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,000
You know this girl?

339
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,400
She's on your Web site.

340
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, and a thousand more
like her.

341
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,399
Might as well ask a Chinese guy
to remember a grain of rice.

342
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,300
She's not a grain
of rice, sport.

343
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,000
She's dead.

344
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,099
Eddie, off! Cameras off!

345
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Go away, babies, come on,
shoo, let's go.

346
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,500
What do you mean dead?

347
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,700
Her name's Judy Dowd.

348
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,399
We found her in Florida
raped, murdered and fed to an alligator.

349
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,300
And she's posted on <i>my</i> Web site?

350
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,200
Lloyd, do you
know about this?

351
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,300
How would I know?
Get her off now, Lloyd.

352
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,600
Now! Go!
Right, right.

353
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,100
Did you say an alligator?

354
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,499
We never would have posted her
if we knew.

355
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Monte is insanely careful.
Not always,
from what I hear.

356
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,400
But he learns
from his mistakes.

357
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,999
Now, every ID,
triple-checked for 18

358
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
before any girl signs
the waiver.

359
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,600
Idiot!

360
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,599
You let her on my bus?

361
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,700
I didn't want to
be rude, Monte.

362
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,800
Off the bus.
Your boyfriend has no warrant.

363
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,199
You know,
anthropologically speaking,

364
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,900
you follow a very
ancient tradition.

365
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,700
Okay.

366
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,600
Entrepreneur?

367
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,300
Pimp.

368
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
Class is over.

369
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Off the bus.

370
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,499
Here you go.

371
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Follow His path, learn His word.

372
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,200
You, too, follow His
path, learn His word.

373
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,899
Uh-oh, there it is!

374
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,200
Another misguided waif tumbles from
the Devil's sin-mobile.

375
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,899
Excuse me?
Uh, no, uh,

376
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,799
she's with me.
Why are you winking?

377
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,900
I'm not with--
h-he's with me.

378
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,200
This is Isaac.

379
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Isaac's with the Church of the High Calling
way down in Eldon, Kansas.

380
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,700
Yeah, but let me
tell you something,

381
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,099
there is no
distance too great

382
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,700
to dissuade
these lost young women

383
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,100
from the grips
of Monte Gold's carnal temptation.

384
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,700
Looks like you plan on
saving a lot of souls.

385
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,800
Women like this?

386
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Oh.

387
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,000
Uh-oh.

388
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Who is she?

389
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,399
Huh, what did Monte do to her?

390
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,699
Give it a rest, Isaac.

391
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,800
Monte, hey, hey,
remember me?

392
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,599
I'm Alan;
I sent you, uh, my résum?

393
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,499
Not now, man.

394
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Hey, hey, look, I'm,
I'm a great webmaster.

395
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,700
Another sinner about to throw
hisself into Satan's hellfire.

396
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,300
Shut up, freak!

397
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,799
Hey, hey, you come back,
I call the cops.

398
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,700
Get him out of here.

399
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,400
You'll never work
for me, pal.

400
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,800
Has God even fed you today,
Isaac?

401
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,700
Okay, let's get you
a sandwich, Isaac.

402
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,200
Eddie, make the preacher
some food, will you?

403
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,599
What?

404
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,300
The wing nuts come
with the territory.

405
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,099
Okay, let's quit
playing games.

406
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,499
What is it
you want to know?

407
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,800
Fort Lauderdale.

408
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,000
Lauderdale was
Lauderdale.

409
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,300
Partied that night,

410
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,600
gave some willing girls
their 15 minutes of fame,

411
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,200
and, uh, headed out to Daytona
for the next day's gig.

412
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,900
Any girls ride with you?

413
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,799
Much as I hate
to disappoint you, uh,

414
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,500
the fact is I'm not
"entertaining" like I used to.

415
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,399
Ah, getting too old
to exploit little drunk girls?

416
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,100
You seen the videos?
They exploit themselves.

417
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,700
Ready to roll
when you are, Monte.

418
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,300
Now they all want
to be a Hotty Body.
Walk into a place

419
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
and the shirts fly
off, making what used
to be a rush kind of,

420
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,600
I don't know, mundane.

421
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,399
Because you objectify them.

422
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,300
You never see
what makes them human.

423
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,199
Man, you have to spend all day
with her?

424
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,100
Yeah, an actual woman.

425
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
You ought to try it sometime.

426
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,900
Video's off the site, there's
a copy of the girl's waiver.

427
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,200
You know, I think I, uh,
think I remember this girl.
You do?

428
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,499
Yeah, you remember, Lloyd.

429
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,799
We were leaving the Lauderdale
gig and you made a joke

430
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,400
about the bouncer
swapping spit with that girl?

431
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
That was this girl?

432
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,400
Pretty sure.

433
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,300
Oh, she was hot.

434
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,200
Passed the two of them
playing tonsil hockey in the doorway.

435
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,100
That bouncer was
a big dude, too.

436
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,900
And it's me you're harassing?

437
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,800
Let's go, Eddie.

438
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,000
This waiver is a joke.

439
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,800
I mean, look
at Judy's signature.

440
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,100
She could barely
hold a pen.

441
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,600
Well, Florida Bureau's
gonna scoop up this bouncer and call me back.

442
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,700
We need to get back in that bus.

443
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,300
We need cause
for a warrant.

444
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You tell Mario that
he is still an artist.

445
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,100
What is that?

446
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,700
Mm.

447
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,200
Only the finest sausage
and peppers on Earth.

448
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,899
Someday, I'm gonna turn it
into a franchise.

449
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,599
You want a bite?

450
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,500
I, I thought you
were buying a boat.

451
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,900
I am.

452
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,699
Maybe I'll start
a charter service.

453
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,600
I can serve these
to the passengers.

454
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,000
You know? In Jamaica.

455
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,700
Good.
Mm, the word is great.

456
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,599
Or maybe I'll manage a band,
you know?

457
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,899
They could play
on the boat, too.

458
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,200
So you don't, you don't
like being an FBI agent?

459
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,499
Oh, sure, I-I do.

460
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,099
I just don't want it
to be the only thing I ever was.

461
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
You're telling me you're
just going to be a bone lady your whole life?

462
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,700
I've spent years studying
anthropology.

463
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, I got a degree,

464
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,300
but I'm not going
to let it ruin <i>my</i> life.

465
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,600
I'm going back to the lab.

466
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Mm, here.

467
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,500
Take one of these with you
back to that spaceship.

468
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
I'll call you when, uh,
we get our bouncer.

469
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,900
Ah, Jamaica.

470
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,100
I can dig it, mon.

471
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,399
Oh.
Hi.

472
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,099
Um, do we have
a scheduled...

473
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,800
Uh, listen, I really need
to get back to work,

474
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,100
so why don't you give me one of
those clown restraining orders

475
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,000
and just sign my paper.

476
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,999
Have you had an insight, then,

477
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
as to why you shot
at that clown?
Yeah.

478
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
You know,
I have something to say.

479
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,700
It's right here.
That's my...

480
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,500
Bones calling, huh, my partner.

481
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Right? Yeah, Bones.

482
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
So when are you
coming back again?

483
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,600
What, aren't you playing nice
with Sully?

484
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,999
I'm just not sure
how serious he is about his job.

485
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,699
Oh, look, he's one
of the best, all right?

486
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,600
He just likes
to keep his options open.

487
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
I've noticed.

488
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,199
Listen, Bones, Sully,

489
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,900
he, uh, lost his partner about,
uh, a year ago, all right?

490
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,599
Something like that happens,
you just,

491
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,299
you hear that clock
on the inside

492
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,400
ticking just
a little bit louder.

493
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,099
So, uh, you know,
you're in good hands.

494
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Here he comes, so I gotta
go, gotta go, gotta go.

495
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,200
All right, so maybe
I am a little irritable.

496
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,200
Why do you think
that might be?

497
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Come on, look, don't they give
you, like, papers and files and reports?

498
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,100
All right, um...

499
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,699
Me and my partner caught
up to this serial killer

500
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
by the name of Howard
Epps, and he died.

501
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,600
And whose fault was that Yours or your partner's?

502
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,400
He jumped over that
balcony because of her.

503
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,400
Sometimes I think he
had the right idea.

504
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,500
And where were you
when Mr. Epps fell?

505
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,700
Holding his arm.

506
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
No, that was before
he fell, surely.

507
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,100
What?

508
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,600
Well, Mr. Epps was dangling
from your arm before he fell,

509
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,000
at which point he was no
longer dangling but falling.Attached to you,

510
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
he was alive;
no longer attached, dead.

511
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,300
I don't feel guilty about that.

512
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,200
I mean,
Epps was a serial killer.

513
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,400
He tried to kill my partner

514
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,700
and he threatened
my son-- I was glad when he hit that pavement.

515
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,300
Do you think
about suicide often?

516
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,100
Suicide?

517
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,000
Me?

518
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,099
No, no, never.

519
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,299
And yet you
sometimes feel that Howard Epps
had the right idea

520
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,800
about jumping off that balcony?

521
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,699
It was a joke, okay?

522
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
It was a joke.

523
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,300
Yes... you do that a lot,
don't you?

524
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,200
And it makes me feel
such a bully for prying.

525
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,500
We'll pick up
on that next time.

526
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,700
Increase magnification.

527
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,100
Please.

528
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,500
If you're ready.

529
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,300
I don't mean to appear
dictatorial,

530
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,500
I just...
I get it, Zack.

531
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,300
Hey.
So what are we looking at?

532
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,100
Bits of gold foil
imbedded deep within bite marks along
the T-11 and T-12 vertebrae.

533
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,499
Jewelry?

534
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,100
More likely
scenario has the gator's teeth piercing
Judy's stomach.

535
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,799
Embedding whatever
she last ingested into her bone?

536
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,000
How would someone eat gold?

537
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Not eat.

538
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,100
Drink.

539
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,000
Goldenrod.

540
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,499
Goldenrod?

541
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,300
It's this hundred-proof cinnamon
schnapps we drank in college.

542
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,300
It's infused with real gold flakes,
purely for decadence sake.

543
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,499
How did it taste?

544
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,800
Uh, it's way worse coming up,
I can tell you that.

545
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,499
She could've wandered
into bars we don't know about.

546
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,099
If we can find the every place
that carries that stuff...

547
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,399
I don't think
we'll need to, Doc.

548
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,700
We've got our bouncer.

549
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,900
Of course, he denies all, but
his alibi just about buries him.

550
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,599
Buries him how?

551
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,599
Well, he said he left work early that night to get
to his other job:

552
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,000
Giving Midnight Swamp Tours
on his boat.

553
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,800
Sounds like a good job actually.

554
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,200
So he's admitted to knowing
the Everglades like the back of his hand?

555
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,100
Which would not be smart if he were in fact the killer.

556
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,600
Well, most of the killers
I know aren't all that smart.

557
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,599
The gold flakes
are definitely from the liquor we found
in her system.

558
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,700
And I remembered
something.

559
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,300
Monte and his harem, so what?

560
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,499
Check out the caption:

561
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,600
"All the girls love
Monte's Gold."

562
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,100
Now granted,
there's plenty of bars

563
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,500
that carry this stuff
but...

564
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,900
But this could be
the probable cause we need to search Monte's bus.

565
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
I'll get the warrant.

566
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,700
The bouncer's alibi checked out.

567
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,700
So Monte's minions were likely
just trying to throw us off.

568
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,200
Unbelievable, you people.

569
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,399
What is it now?
Hey, hey.

570
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,599
Cool your jets, Hef.

571
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,100
We just wanna
search your bus.

572
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
This is you, isn't it?

573
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,800
Please don't point
your finger at me.

574
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,699
I knew the first time I saw you.

575
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Here comes another
feminist crusader out to spoil some good all-American fun!

576
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,199
Ow, get off, get off!

577
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,899
Self-defense,
he assaulted me.

578
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,000
Yes, he did.

579
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,199
Crazy bitch,
I'm calling my lawyer.

580
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,100
Here, you can read him this.

581
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,800
Now I just hope
we find something.

582
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,600
There.

583
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
That's not exactly
a smoking gun.

584
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,600
Can you prove
she drank it here?

585
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I can try.

586
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,999
Okay, you can only admit
evidence that's in plain view.

587
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,199
Although, on this bus,
that could be DNA.

588
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,700
On virtually any surface.

589
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
That's an image.

590
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,500
Keep your eyes open for a metal
screw-threaded thingy.

591
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
A what now?

592
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,900
Judy's stab wound was probably

593
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,399
from a bolt of some kind
right through here.

594
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,300
Oh, just inside
her scapula.

595
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,700
Yes, but...

596
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,800
most laymen refer to it
as a shoulder blade.

597
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,600
Well, I told you
I went to college.

598
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,799
I minored in kinesiology.

599
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,700
Although this is the first time
I've used it to impress a lady.

600
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,599
What was your major?

601
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,200
Art History.

602
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,700
Um, I also got a Master's
certificate in sailing,
a pilot's license,

603
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,999
and I'm a certified EMT.

604
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,900
There's more,
but I don't wanna brag.

605
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,500
Hold on.

606
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,899
Hi, Hodgins.

607
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,199
Judy Dowd wasn't killed at
the swamp where she was found.

608
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,800
Cryptosporidium on her clothes
came from saw grass,

609
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,900
a plant that doesn't even grow
in Eugene's swamp.

610
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,900
Where does it grow?

611
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,699
Pretty much everywhere else in the Everglades,

612
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,200
but in terms of gator distance,

613
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,999
there's a saw grass marsh
two miles south,

614
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,399
where Alligator Alley meets
State Road 29.

615
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
All that from cryptosporidium?

616
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,499
Did I not mention the fresh
asphalt in Judy's shoe?

617
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,699
That intersection was
just repaved about a month ago.

618
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,800
Very Interesting.

619
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,000
Thanks, Hodgins.

620
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,700
Hmm, what's interesting?

621
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,800
Ms. Montenegro?

622
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,500
I'm Bill Dowd,
Judy's father.

623
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,900
Oh.

624
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,700
Hi.

625
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,000
Um, I'm sorry.

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,200
How do you know me?

627
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,100
The FBI told me that the Jeffersonian was
investigating Judy's murder.

628
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,699
I read your team's
biographies online,

629
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,799
saw your picture.

630
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,300
And followed me here?

631
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,300
I'm sorry, I know
how that must look,

632
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
but I just...

633
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,400
need answers.

634
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,600
I need to know who
killed my daughter.

635
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,900
I'm sorry, Mr. Dowd,
there's nothing I can tell you.

636
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I already know
about the website.

637
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,700
And this Monte Gold
son of a bitch.

638
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,800
The FBI told you about that?

639
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Buddy from my job
found the video.

640
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,400
He thought I'd be embarrassed,

641
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,300
but all I care about
is what happened next.

642
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,900
Did this guy kill her?

643
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,300
I really can't discuss the case.

644
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,499
The way he was pawing
at my girl on that video,

645
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,800
he's gotta be a suspect.

646
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,000
At, at this point, Mr. Dowd,

647
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,900
there are a lot of suspects.

648
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,500
But not many like him.

649
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I mean, do you
trust him?

650
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,200
Do you think he's a good man?

651
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,300
No.

652
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,300
Of course not.

653
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,600
I find him repulsive.

654
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,900
Please, I just gotta know.

655
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,400
Was it him?

656
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,800
I'm very sorry
about your daughter, Mr. Dowd.

657
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,000
There's nothing I can say.

658
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,400
I understand.

659
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,900
I shouldn't have put you
on the spot.

660
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,100
I'm sorry.

661
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,900
You lied about
the bouncer, Eddie.

662
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,799
What?

663
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,500
The bouncer
in Lauderdale? You never saw
him kissing

664
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,100
Judy Dowd the night
she went missing.

665
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,700
Really?

666
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,000
I was sure
it was them.

667
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,500
Hey, you drive the bus,
too, don't you?

668
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, so?

669
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,000
So you drove out of Lauderdale,

670
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,900
straight up the 95
to Daytona?

671
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,100
Is that what Monte said?

672
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,600
Yeah, straight up 95.

673
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,500
You sure about that?

674
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,700
Oh, no, uh, that's right
there was, uh, construction.

675
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,800
We got detoured
cross state on 75.

676
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,300
Right, 75.

677
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,899
Isn't that Alligator Alley?

678
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,700
Yeah.

679
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,700
Come on, Eddie,
a girl is dead.

680
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,600
We didn't kill her.

681
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,900
But she was on your bus.

682
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,500
She had a few drinks.

683
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,300
You have sex with her?

684
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,400
No.

685
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,700
No way. I was driving.

686
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,600
While Monte had
sex with her?

687
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,400
I guess.

688
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,900
You guess?
Was... was it consensual?

689
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,600
All I know is
she was drunk.

690
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,300
All right, really drunk.

691
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,000
And when Monte got done
with her,

692
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,199
she came up by me,
wanted to get off the bus.

693
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,400
Eddie, don't say anything!

694
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,600
Where were you in all this?

695
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,100
Lloyd drives in
front of us.

696
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,400
It was just me and
Monte on the bus.
Shut up, Eddie.

697
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Monte's lawyer says
we don't have to talk to anybody until he gets here.

698
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,199
He has nothing to worry about.

699
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,499
No one's under arrest.

700
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,700
Why'd you let her
off the bus, Eddie?

701
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,900
I didn't want to.

702
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,299
It was really dark.

703
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,399
She could barely stand up.

704
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,599
Then Monte wanted her off.

705
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,699
He was pissed off,
she was crying...

706
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,800
Eddie.
He was gonna
fire me if I didn't.

707
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,499
We owe Monte
a lot, okay?

708
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,699
The guy's been
really good to us.

709
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,999
And we knew that none
of us killed her.

710
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,199
Well, if you
let her off

711
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,200
the bus in the middle of nowhere in that condition,
you may as well have.

712
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,399
Look, when Eddie told me
where she got off the bus,

713
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,499
I went back there
and looked for her.

714
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,100
I must have driven
that road for an hour.

715
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,999
I figured she hitched a ride back.

716
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,800
You figured. He figured.

717
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,199
Maybe Monte made
a bad call in letting the girl off,

718
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
but she wanted off.

719
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,100
So he was just doing
what she asked.

720
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,000
Except for the sex part.

721
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,500
You know what?
You you can't prove that.

722
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,100
I wouldn't bet against her.

723
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,600
So, is Monte still in his office?

724
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,300
No.

725
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,500
He had an appointment
back at the Iguana Club up in Maryland.

726
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,900
Okay.

727
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,300
You know what?

728
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,400
I'm in America,
we're men,

729
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,900
let's drink coffee,
not tea, hey?

730
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,300
Oh, I say,

731
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
doing a marvelous job.

732
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,100
Thank you.

733
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,099
That's not coffee.

734
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,900
Ah. What is it?
I don't know

735
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,300
what the hell it is but it
sure as hell isn't coffee, doc.

736
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
You tend to do things well,
don't you?

737
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,400
Make coffee. Build barbecue machines.

738
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,200
It's not really a "machine."

739
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,300
Solve crimes, raise a son,
love women. Leave women.

740
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,900
Whatever you
aim at, you hit.

741
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,200
Is that bad?

742
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,499
By no means, no,of course not,
except...

743
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,000
Oh, okay,
here we go.

744
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Let me have it, doc.

745
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,100
Except it is indicative of a need to control
your environment.

746
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,300
Again I ask, uh, is that bad?

747
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,799
No, of course not, no.

748
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,600
Except...
Except?

749
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,300
Except when you shoot a clown.

750
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,700
You know, you make it sound like he was walking around
making balloon animals.

751
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,100
For the most part,
your rebellions are small.

752
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
rebellions?

753
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,800
The colorful socks,
the funky belt buckles.

754
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,100
They're a mechanism.

755
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,700
Quiet rebellions.

756
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Your way of asserting
your personal control over a homogenizing
organization

757
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,100
like the FBI.

758
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,800
But shooting a clown is not
a quiet rebellion.

759
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,100
Shooting a clown is
literally quite deafening.

760
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,500
Booth.
- Hey, it's me.

761
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,100
Yeah, hold on for a second,
wait why is it, doc,

762
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
every time I answer
the phone you walk away?

763
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,900
Why do you answer the phone
knowing it'll make me walk away?

764
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,400
Yeah, you know what, Bones,
I gotta call you back.

765
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,600
Is Sully for real?

766
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,000
What?

767
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I just can't decide
whether or not
to take him seriously.

768
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,299
Why was he acting
unprofessional?

769
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,400
No, he's, he's very
professional, it's just...

770
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,900
can he really do
all he says he can do?

771
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,800
Oh, you mean that whole
master C=carpentry thing?

772
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,900
Yeah, well, you know what,
he, uh, made me a dining room set last year.

773
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,200
He's a carpenter, as well?

774
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,400
As well as what?

775
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,700
That's...Sully calling right now.

776
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,600
We're, um,...

777
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,199
we're doing, you know,

778
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,900
what we did.

779
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,600
Oh, you know, I'll be back soon.

780
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,500
Okay.

781
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
I'll talk to you later.

782
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,099
So maybe Monte can tell us

783
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,300
why he left the girl
on the side of the road.

784
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,000
Hey, there's
a store for rent.

785
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,000
Sausage and
pepper shop?

786
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,000
That's funny.

787
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,199
Take my lead.

788
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,100
I know what I'm doing,
didn't Booth tell you?

789
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,900
Yeah.

790
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
Take my lead.

791
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,600
Wait, wait, wait.

792
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,700
That's his car.

793
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,300
??

794
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,700
??ood outside his club.

795
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,200
It's the last thing
you said to Monte, Isaac.

796
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,700
"His judgment cometh
and that right soon."

797
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,599
It's not even a Bible verse,
the judgment thing.

798
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,800
It's a line from <i>Shawshank.</i>

799
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
Who's that?

800
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,600
Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the Lord.

801
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Look, if Monte's wicked deeds cost him his life, it
was the work of a hand

802
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,800
far mightier than my own.

803
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,800
And where exactly have your hands been
the last five hours?

804
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,699
Working on my truck-- I got
garage receipts to prove it.

805
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,800
Hey, Angela, what's up?

806
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,300
Hey, I, uh...

807
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
I think that you might
have the wrong man.

808
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,900
What do you mean?

809
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,800
I made a mistake, Brennan.

810
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,700
I only wanted
to scare him.

811
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,600
I didn't go there to kill him.

812
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,900
But what he said...

813
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,000
three words.

814
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,900
He only said three words
in his defense.

815
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,500
"She wanted it."

816
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,900
She didn't, Mr. Dowd.

817
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,200
That much we do know.

818
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,500
Is there anyone
you want to call, sir?

819
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,400
No.

820
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,100
There isn't anybody.

821
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,400
There was Judy.

822
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,600
Just Judy.

823
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,400
So this is the
culprit, huh?

824
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,400
Result of your metal
screw-headed thingy?

825
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,500
Zack managed to identify this bone bruise.

826
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Across posteriors six thru eight.

827
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,100
Show off.

828
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,299
Okay, I've got my weapons
list and visual aids,

829
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,700
courtesy of Angela.

830
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,400
Now, we know
the wound was caused

831
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
by a blunt steel dowel with
screw threads at the top.

832
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,600
Bruising around her is the rough
size and shape of a harmonica.

833
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,299
Now theoretically, the
head of the weapon struck,

834
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,500
leaving the bruising,
but then broke.

835
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,699
Allowing the steel dowel beneath to be driven into Judy's back.

836
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,200
So possible weapons include...

837
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,900
a shovel handle
with steel shaft.

838
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,099
A golfer's wooden putter
with aluminum shaft.

839
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,800
Okay, a gear shifter?

840
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,300
That's an alloy gear shifter
with a grip-shaped handle.

841
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,500
This doesn't look like
it could cause the injury.

842
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,599
Unless it didn't
have a handle.

843
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,500
Yeah, though she'd probably not
have been killed standing up.

844
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,600
She'd have to be thrown down,
and then impaled.

845
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,700
Preacher man had one
of these in his truck.

846
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,700
With a tennis ball where
the handle should have been.

847
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,499
Hiding the exposed
threads underneath.

848
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,400
And he follows Monte everywhere.

849
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,199
Don't let us
interrupt you, Isaac.

850
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,900
I was praying
for His guidance

851
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,000
in bringing an end
to this harassment.

852
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,099
Yeah, well he can't
answer them all, can He?

853
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,300
Where were you headed?

854
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,800
Home, if that's any
of your business.

855
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,300
Back to your church, huh?

856
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,700
I gotta tell you, I wish I'd
called them sooner about you.

857
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
You did this? You called them?

858
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
Yeah, are you sure you weren't
headed back to Florida?

859
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,000
Stop along
Alligator Alley? Make sure you left
nothing behind.

860
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I don't even know
what are you talking about.

861
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Well, apparently
your church kicked your hypocritical
ass out last year.

862
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,600
Something about you hitting on
young female parishioners.

863
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,000
Who-- who told
you this, huh?

864
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,500
Hey, you can't get in there!

865
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,299
A tennis ball
for a gear shifter.

866
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,200
Huh.

867
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,900
Turn around, Isaac.
All right.

868
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,900
Forgive them, Lord, for they know
not what they do.

869
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,300
Yeah, well
what we do know is that Judy Dowd was left
drunk and stumbling on Route 75.

870
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,400
And you, following
Monte's bus,pulled over to give her a ride.

871
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,700
Not a free one apparently.

872
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,199
No, no, that's a lie.
I never even saw her.

873
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,100
Oh, so this isn't
her blood here?

874
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,500
It's someone's blood.

875
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,899
How many of Monte's cast-offs
have you been with, Isaac?

876
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,299
Huh? Girl's too
drunk to know. Before you picked up Judy.

877
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,999
You went for it.
She rejected you.

878
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,500
Next thing you know she's
impaled on the shifter.

879
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,500
I may have picked her up,

880
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,400
but if I laid a hand,
it was to heal,

881
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,600
and to ask His
redemption upon her.

882
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,099
Man, you are shameless.

883
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,999
She was drunk.
She went crazy.

884
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,900
Pushed me away
and fell back.

885
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,200
It was an accident.

886
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,499
You know, the Devil's work.

887
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,400
No, not, that was the part where
you fed her to an alligator.

888
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,900
There should be a sense
of satisfaction after solving a case, but...

889
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,700
most of the time I just...

890
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,200
I feel drained.

891
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,500
Yeah, that's why you can
only do this job for so long.

892
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,000
Murders, death, corpses...

893
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,700
you do that your whole life...

894
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
There's gotta be more, you know?

895
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,799
The sausage and
pepper sandwich.

896
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,700
You gotta admit
it was good.

897
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,000
So what do you and Booth
usually do now?

898
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Is there a bar you
go to? A restaurant?Pilates class?

899
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
There's a diner.

900
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,900
Booth says the pie is the best.

901
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,300
Can I buy you a slice?

902
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,300
Sure.

903
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,300
I guess we're not working
together anymore.

904
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,100
Yes.

905
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,200
And since we have
no professional obligations to each other,
I can ask you out.

906
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,400
Theoretically.

907
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,400
Theoretically

908
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,100
Perhaps after a 24 hour
waiting period.

909
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,300
Why?

910
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,900
So the brain can adjust to alternate perceptions
of each other.

911
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,500
I don't actually need it.

912
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,800
My brain adjusts
quite quickly.

913
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Oh, my good Lord.

914
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,300
How many bricks did
you use in the end?

915
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,799
Yep, you know, 180.

916
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,500
Right, so you can
go sign away.

917
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,599
What are those?

918
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,400
Oh, those are two beautiful
prime rib eye steaks.

919
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,200
All right, being the barbeque
master that I am,

920
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,800
I thought I'd show you
how to barbeque, doc.

921
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,100
Oh, I don't want
to be shown.

922
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,399
I want to learn
by trial and error.

923
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,299
No, no, no, doc.
Come on, listen,

924
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,800
it's better learn off
hamburger or sausages.

925
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,400
Those puppies cost
50 bucks a pop.

926
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,300
You know, according
to the FBI reports,

927
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,600
there was no way you
could save Epps' life.

928
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,100
Your partner's report
says the same thing.

929
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,699
An FBI sniper on
the opposite roof saw everything
through his scope.

930
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,599
According to all witnesses,

931
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,800
you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

932
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,100
Yeah, so?

933
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,100
So why in a fit of pique
did you endanger innocent people
in a public thoroughfare

934
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,000
by discharging your firearm?

935
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,100
I'm a good shot.

936
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,800
I didn't put anybody in danger.

937
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,700
How many people have you killed?

938
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I lost count.

939
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,699
Oh, you can remember 180 bricks,

940
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,100
but not how many lives
you've taken?

941
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,500
Epps makes 50.

942
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,000
50 what?

943
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,700
50 kills.

944
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,100
But, Agent Booth,
you didn't kill Epps.

945
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,100
You tried to save him, remember?

946
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,299
Or perhaps I'd better
put it as a question?

947
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,600
Did Howard Epps slip
from your grasp

948
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,100
or did you release him?

949
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,600
Oh, come now, man, it's
a simple enough question.

950
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,100
Was he indeed
your 50th kill

951
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,300
or did you just happen
to be there when he died?

952
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,600
I...

953
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
I don't know.

954
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,700
A man like you in control
of every situation

955
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,700
and you don't know?

956
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,700
I don't know.

957
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,700
I had him and then
I lost him and...

958
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,500
something happened in between.

959
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,700
I don't know.

960
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,600
I believe you.

961
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,600
Because for a man
like you to admit

962
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,900
you don't know,
to relinquish control,

963
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,900
that could argue a disruption

964
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,300
in your self-view
that was large enough

965
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,900
to motivate you
to shoot a clown.

966
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,799
You know, I think we made
marvelous progress.

967
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,500
This is a place for which
we can certainly begin.

968
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,700
You know what?

969
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,500
I've changed my mind.

970
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,600
I would love you
to cook those steaks.

971
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,400
I can do that.

972
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,800
Medium rare please, Mr. G-Man.

973
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,800
I can do that.

974
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:12,400
