2
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,600
Temperance.

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,700
Oh!

4
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
I startled you?

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,900
Yeah, I was just chatting with a friend online.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,200
Sorry.

7
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,000
But we have a new delivery. Top priority.

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,800
Sounds like a good friend?

9
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, it's fascinating

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,700
how interest and intimacy can be cultivated online.

11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,900
So you've never met this friend?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,600
I have done enough googling to schedule dinner.

13
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,900
You said there is a... delivery?

14
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,800
The bones washed ashore on Chesapeake Bay.

15
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,300
Judging from the algae,

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,600
he's been fish food for quite a while.

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,400
They ate her both tibiae.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,300
Remains show evidence of bullet wounds

19
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,600
Which would explain 

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
why he has all those holes in him.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,900
Looks as though they weren't made by a .32.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,700
Maybe a .38.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,600
Heard you might need a face?

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,700
The FBI's pretty certain this is James Cugini.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,100
They're looking for evidence

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
that could lead them to the killer.

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,900
Wow, Jimmy Cugini!

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,700
I don't know who that is.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,700
It's a mob boss.

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,600
He disappeared 6 years ago after his daughter's dance recital.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,100
Cement shoes! Pretty trite.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Why mess with the classics?

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
Did they find any of the bullets?

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,600
No.

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, the mafia are quite good at this.

36
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,800
Should we really be involved in mob stuff?

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,700
I mean, they're really into the whole killing thing.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
I can provide you with the job description,

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,500
if you've forgotten what we do here,

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Dr. Hodgins.

41
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,500
After you clean them up, Zach,

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,100
I want you to X-ray the bones for any bullet fragments.

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
Be very careful cleaning the exit and entrance wounds.

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,100
I want to recover any markings the bullet left

45
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,800
as it passed through the bone.

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
Yeah, I could have them ready about 8 tonight.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
I -- can't work tonight.

48
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Somewhere around early morning's fine.

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
You have a date tonight?

50
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
It's not a date. It's a meal.

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
With a man?

52
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,900
Did you meet him on the website I told you about?

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
You're dating online?

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, it's a practical way of

55
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,800
objectively examining a potential partner

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,100
without all the game-playing.

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,600
That comes later if it works out.

58
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,200
Hi, I'm Angela.

59
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,600
Special Agent Jamie Kenton.

60
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,400
Dr Brennan?

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,400
Hey.

62
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,900
You two know each other?

63
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,100
I was at the Bureau

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,800
when Booth took his coffee ***.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,100
Apparently, they're both the world's greatest FBI agents.

66
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
That's right.

67
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
Kenton's worked in the Cugini case.

68
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,900
He's one of the original investigators.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,900
This is Brennan's brain trust.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
The victim is over here.

71
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,000
So what if your computer date's a psycho?

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,100
Only about a billion people date online.

73
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,900
I have.

74
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,100
Whatever happened to seeing someone across a crowded room, 

75
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,100
eyes meeting, that old black magic gets you in its spell?

76
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,300
There is no such thing as magic.

77
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,700
Oh, it is magic.

78
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,700
Are you here for a reason? Because Agent Kenton is handling this.

79
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,800
You have some remains to look at.

80
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,100
Yeah, I'm already looking at them.

81
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,400
No, not the Cugini case, Kenton will babysit him.

82
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
These are fresh.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,900
But I was told that our friend in the cement shoes has precedence.

84
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,800
That was before we found someone tortured and ripped apart by dogs.

85
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,700
90% of flesh is missing because of mutilation

86
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,500
and post-mortem ?anthropo?phagy caused by canine scavenging.

87
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,900
They have to stay here?

88
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,300
Wait and see if you need them.

89
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
No, not now.

90
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,700
Ask them to save the excrement for Hodgins.

91
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,800
Throw these dogs out of here!

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Lucky Hodgins.

93
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,400
Where are the eyes?

94
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,700
Gone.

95
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,800
Gouged out?

96
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,600
Yes.

97
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,700
You can see the scrapings in the orbital cavities.

98
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,900
Much rougher than the knife scarring.

99
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,600
It was done with a different weapon.

100
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Son of a bitch.

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
You seen this before.00:04:18.8:Yeah.

102
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,400
3 years ago, we found a 17 year old girl

103
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,000
in a tool shed, bound, slashed, eyes gouged out.

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
Nothing for her parents to identify.

105
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
Suspect was Kevin Hollings.

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,400
Everything pointed to him,

107
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
but we couldn't get the hard evidence,

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,700
so the DA refused to prosecute.

109
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,800
It's twisted, Bones.

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,200
It's like a game to him.

111
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
He used dogs before?

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,200
No.

113
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
He's making the killings more elaborate.

114
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
I think he's testing us.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Until he goes too far and gets caught,

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
isn't that the expected pathology?

117
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,500
Yeah.

118
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,600
Well, I can determine the kind of weapons, time of death,

119
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Hodgins might find something useful on the dogs.

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
Brennan.

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,100
Just working.

122
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,300
Bag that.

123
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,700
Yeah, of course. I'm starving.

124
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,400
7:30? OK. Yess. I'll meet you there.

125
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,700
OK. Bye.

126
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,300
My reservation just got pushed, so I have a few extra minutes.

127
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,800
Oh, few extra minutes. Great.

128
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,700
What?

129
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,100
Nothing.

130
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,800
You disapprove.

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,600
I said "Great".

132
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
With attitude.

133
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Don't go overboard with psychology. It's not your thing.

134
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Look, I am an adult, Booth.

135
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,300
I see men, I go out with them, on occasion I sleep with them.

136
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,300
Hey, that's cool.

137
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,500
But you don't even know who this guy is that you're meeting.

138
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,800
I have trekked through Tibet avoiding the Chinese army.

139
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,100
I think I can handle meeting someone for dinner.

140
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,000
Fine. You know what?

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,100
You have fun with Dick431 or whatever his handle is.

142
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,200
Yeah. I will.

143
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,800
Good.

144
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,400
Thanks.

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,800
Fine.

146
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Good.

147
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,700
Victim is female, late teens -- mid twenties.

148
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,300
Knife marks on the bone.

149
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,900
Evidence of deep cuts,

150
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,700
probably to open up the flesh, make it...

151
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,700
more appetizing for the dogs.

152
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,200
David! Hi!

153
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, I'm here.

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, I guess I'm two doors down.

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,400
No, I know. The traffic on the Beltway can be brutal.

156
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,400
OK. Bye.

157
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,000
I need enlargements of the supraorbital notch.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,700
Have you examined the dogs' excrement?

159
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,900
I'm doing the fecal flotation now.

160
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,000
Never get to say that a lot.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,300
Check for fibres the FBI might have missed, as well as...

162
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,100
You've already told him. Twice.

163
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,700
Are you sure you don't want a drink?

164
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,400
You know, it won't be difficult for someone

165
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,700
to encode a secure data strip

166
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,000
and plant it on an ID card 

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
with a cracked digitally encoded authentication data

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,500
and sneak in here.

169
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,700
That is possible.

170
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,600
Are you two going to help or not?

171
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,900
You know, Booth's pissed that you came here.

172
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,400
He had more questions for you at the scene.

173
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,300
He just doesn't want to come here
because he has to park in the structure.

174
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,800
I need her face as quickly as you can.

175
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Zack, these bullet wounds haven't been cleaned!

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I worked on them for hours, Dr Brennan.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,500
Then that wasn't long enough, was it?

178
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,800
I'm sorry, but...

179
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,300
You take a sinus probe, 

180
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,800
you put a little cotton swab on the end of it,

181
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,900
you dip it in water

182
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,700
and you dab it inside the wound until it's clean.

183
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,300
The Sixtine Chapel took 13 years to clean properly.

184
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,100
I didn't think we had that kind of time.

185
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,400
Bones, what the hell are you doing?

186
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,200
Working. Why does everyone find that so odd?

187
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
Why? I don't know why. 

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,700
Because maybe an hour ago someone tried to kill you?

189
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,600
I don't think it's a good idea for you to continue to work these cases.

190
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,400
This is what I do, Booth.

191
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Look, whoever killed these victims wants to make sure

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,900
you don't finish your investigation.

193
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,300
Hundreds of criminals would like me to stop what I do.

194
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you suggesting that I just give up my career?

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,300
Just be reasonable!

196
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,800
Fine.

197
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,100
Logic suggests that the shooter is involved in one of these cases.

198
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
So I should find out who killed them

199
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,800
before he tries to shoot me again.

200
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,000
Did forensics recover the bullets that were meant for me?

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,900
Ballistics is running tests on them right now.

202
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,600
And have you picked up the suspect in the young woman's murder?

203
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,100
Hollings.

204
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,800
I don't want to spook him until we have got enough evidence.

205
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,100
But I got guys watching him.

206
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,200
Did you get a list of women missing age...

207
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,300
18-25, yes, they're on your server.

208
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,400
Bones, everyone is doing their job.

209
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,600
OK, I'll see if any of them match the victim.

210
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
What about the Romano family?

211
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,600
Hodgins said they were feuding with the Cuginis.

212
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,700
Kenton is pulling all the files on the case

213
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,000
and all mob activity 6 years ago.

214
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Bones, there is one other person we have to look at. Your date.

215
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,200
I spoke with him, Booth. He was in his car in traffic.

216
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
And why would he want to kill me?

217
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,800
Why would somebody want to kill your victim over there?

218
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,600
Look, Bones, I know it's hard for you to admit that you might be wrong about something.

219
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
But I really don't care about your feelings right now.

220
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,700
I'm more concerned with your life.

221
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,900
So, to bring your date in for interrogation, grab your coat.

222
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm working.

223
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,400
Bones, I'm not letting you out of my sight

224
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,400
until I find out who is trying to kill you.

225
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,000
Temperance!

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
David!

227
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Someone shot at you?

228
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,300
Yeah.

229
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh my god.

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,700
I know.

231
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,600
What can I do?

232
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,300
Excuse me, I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth. I'll be asking the questions.

233
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,400
Wanna sit down?

234
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,100
Sure. I mean, I didn't see anything.

235
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,900
When I got to the restaurant I saw all the cops,

236
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,000
but I had no idea that it had to do with you.

237
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
You're an investment banker, good-looking guy,

238
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,700
but you have to find your women online.

239
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,500
Excuse me?

240
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,100
Don't you find any women at work?

241
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,700
Well, she was online too, and she's a great-looking doctor.

242
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Your picture doesn't do you justice, by the way.

243
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,300
Thank you. Yours either. I--

244
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,700
The resolution must not be really good online.

245
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,900
Bones--

246
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,700
Oh, he's a Luddite.

247
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,800
Hey!

248
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,300
That's someone who is afraid of technology.

249
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,800
I know what a Luddite is.

250
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,900
So, you're saying that you were stuck in traffic.´

251
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,500
What, you think that I shot at her?

252
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,800
I'm a fundraiser for the Brady campaign against gun violence.

253
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,600
Do you think I tried to kill you?

254
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,900
He has to do this.

255
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,800
Yeah, I have to do this.

256
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,200
So what time did you leave work?

257
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
About 6:45.

258
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,900
Any witnesses?

259
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,300
Yeah. My assistant Margaret Jensen, the client that I was with,

260
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,100
the valet that saw me pull out of the parking garage.

261
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,700
I mean, unless they're all suspects too.

262
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,200
We'll be talking to everyone.

263
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
Check traffic report. It was a mess.

264
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,200
He did.

265
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,900
You did.

266
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,000
What?

267
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,900
Do I have to get an attorney?

268
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,300
Just stay close, in case we need you for anything else.

269
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Yeah, sure. Anything I can do to help.

270
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,500
So, this whole... you know, online thing.

271
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,600
How long does it last?

272
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
'Cause if it's just the way that, you know--

273
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,800
****** that's pretty low.

274
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,700
You know, one of my partners met his wife online.

275
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,400
You're kidding.

276
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,900
No. They've been married for five years.

277
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,100
That doesn't mean it's not creepy.

278
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,200
OK. I'm sorry. Did I miss something?

279
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,900
'Cause I don't want to get in the way of anything between you.

280
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,200
What? Oh, no.
- No.

281
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,400
No.

282
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,000
Well then, maybe we could reschedule that?
- No.

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,900
Sure.

284
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,400
Great.

285
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
I think someone who needs this room. Let's go.

286
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,300
Uh, yeah, sure.

287
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,700
I'll email you.

288
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,100
Stay safe.
- She will.

289
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,900
He's nice, don't you think?

290
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,100
Yeah, he's nice.

291
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,100
As a suspect! What... Hello?

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,200
Hey.

293
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,700
The victim is Penny Hamilton, 19.

294
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,700
She was a student at American who disappeared walking back to her dorm.

295
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,200
She was about to go to Haiti to work at a medical clinic.

296
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,100
Booth is going to think this is his fault.

297
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,000
He knew her?

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,200
The killer has done this before.

299
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,400
Booth couldn't get the evidence he needed.

300
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,600
The guy promised Booth he never would.

301
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,500
Where is Booth, anyway?

302
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,400
I thought he wasn't going to let you out of his sight.

303
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,100
I gave him the positive ID on Cugini.

304
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,700
He's calling it in to Kenton.

305
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,700
So how do you like David?

306
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,400
It's not often you can interrogate a guy on the first date.

307
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,900
I like him.

308
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,000
Booth still doesn't approve, but I told him to mind his own business.

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,900
Hey.

310
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,600
Booth is a big, strong, hot guy who wants to save your life.

311
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,800
I mean, you actually have a knight in shining FBI standard-issue body armour.

312
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,300
So cut him some slack.

313
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,900
Kenton heard the Romanos were pissed that they reopened the investigation.

314
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,400
When they get pissed, they shoot.

315
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,600
I've cleaned the bones, Dr Brennan. You could eat off them.

316
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,700
Is this her?

317
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,700
Yeah.

318
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,500
Nice work, Zack.

319
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,400
You can see some of the markings left on the bone where the bullet passed through.

320
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,100
I can?

321
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes.

322
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,300
Here and here on the outer compact bone.

323
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,900
Do you think you could use a computer to recreate the complete imprint the bullet left?

324
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,700
I don't know if I have enough here to work with.

325
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,700
What are you getting at?

326
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,600
After it's discharged, every bullet has a distinct pattern 

327
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,200
etched into it from the barrel of the gun, right?

328
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,500
That same pattern would be etched into the bone, as it passes through.

329
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,000
If we can recover that pattern, we can reverse-engineer the bullet.

330
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Then you will be able to tell which weapon was used.

331
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Make, model, the whole shitbag.

332
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
I've never heard of that technique.

333
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a theory I've been working on. 

334
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,100
I thought this would be a good time to test it.

335
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Great. Knock yourself out.

336
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,600
All right, anything more about the girl?

337
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,500
The knife marks were made by a non-serrated blade,

338
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,400
consistent with a pocket knife, like this one.

339
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,200
I found additional knife marks on C5,

340
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
indicating that the throat was slashed.

341
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,000
And about her eyes?

342
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,500
The groove in the eye sockets doesn't match anything on the knife.

343
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,800
And Hodges is playing with dog poop, so everyone's got something to do.

344
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Let's go.

345
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,400
What?

346
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Kenton is putting together everything he's got on Cugini's disappearance.

347
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm probably more valuable here.

348
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,900
No, your definitely more valuable alive. Right?

349
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm not leaving you alone. Come on!

350
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,500
If it's so dangerous here, why are you leaving us?

351
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Big strong guy like you, huh? You'll be able to take care of yourself.

352
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,700
Worked undercover with the Romanos for 2 years.

353
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Never got very high in the organization.

354
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,900
I left when I thought my cover was being blown.

355
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,000
Do you think someone from the Romanos did this?

356
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,400
They have to be. Hard to tell who, though.

357
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,400
They use a lot of different guys for a job like this.

358
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
This is Frank Lombardi. He's been seen in the area.

359
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,600
Suspected of killing more than 25 people.

360
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,200
Shooting mostly, though he likes the occasional garroting.

361
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,400
So you think they tried to do away with the good Doctor here?

362
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,100
You know, they're trying to look more legit.

363
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,400
They don't want any ancient history re-surfacing. Bad for business.

364
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,700
But you don't know it's them.

365
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,300
I still have my sources.

366
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,700
They tell me the Romanos know you work in this case,

367
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,000
and they know you're the best.

368
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,300
I recommend you walk away.

369
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,000
Is that why you brought me here?

370
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,700
To scare me into giving up?

371
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,200
I want you to get real.

372
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,500
These people you're dealing with...

373
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,900
We don't know who we're dealing with.

374
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,100
It could be them, it could be Hollings...

375
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,900
No, no. Serial killers, they follow a pattern.

376
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,600
They don't bind and torture and this,

377
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,500
they're picking people off with a high-powered rifle.

378
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,700
You said Hollings promised no one would ever find enough to get him.

379
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,100
Maybe he knows that I can.

380
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,300
Either way, too dangerous.

381
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
You almost caught a bullet in the skull.

382
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,700
I can give you answers, Booth.

383
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,100
I can help you get Hollings.

384
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,500
You really want me to walk away because it's dangerous?

385
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,400
Sorry, man, I tried.

386
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Any more back from Ballistics on the bullets that were meant for me?

387
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Yeah, it's a military issue. ***Colt*** DR-15.

388
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,100
Brennan.

389
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,500
<i>Fasciola hepatica</i>. It's a parasite found in beef liver.

390
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,300
I found their eggs in the dog excrement.

391
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,400
The dogs were strays. They were starving.

392
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,700
Someone must have lured them to the scene with liver scraps,

393
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,400
because there was no evidence of any liver found at the scene.

394
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,400
So if we find any traces of the parasite, we can tie them to the dogs.

395
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,200
It's possible.

396
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,300
I also found out that the cut marks on her bones showed

397
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,800
that the pocket knife hat a nick in the blade.

398
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,800
OK. Thanks.

399
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,200
Agent Booth? Long time no see.

400
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,000
Hollings.

401
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,700
Wondering if we could take a look around your place.

402
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,300
Do you have a warrant?

403
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,400
No, but you enjoy being cooperative, if I remember.

404
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,600
Come in. Please.

405
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,400
It must be Dr Brennan?

406
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,800
I heard about the incident the other night.

407
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
You must have had quite a fright.

408
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,200
Don't play with her, Hollings.

409
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,900
I hope you don't think I was being insensitive.

410
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,800
Maybe you tell me what you're looking for, and I could help?

411
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,300
We just want to look around, that's all.

412
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,100
Be my guest.

413
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,700
Could I open this?

414
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Of course.

415
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,700
Is this about the girl they found the other night?

416
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,100
Terrible thing.

417
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,600
You don't think I'm involved in this one too, do you, Agent Booth?

418
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,800
Blades are clean. No nicks.

419
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I guarantee you that whatever you're looking for, you're not going to find it here.

420
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,100
What we need might be locked up someplace.

421
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,800
Wow. Dozens of keys here.

422
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,200
Tens of thousands.

423
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
Maybe we'll just take them down to the Bureau, look through them.

424
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
That's a private collection.

425
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm afraid without cause or a warrant...

426
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,900
Oh, you see, I do have cause.

427
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,700
See this key here?

428
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,000
It's from a federal building. It says, "Do not duplicate".

429
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And the other one looks like it was used in a burglary just around the corner.

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,800
And-- oh, since you did allow us in your home...

431
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,800
This is very rude, Agent Booth. I open my home to you and let this...

432
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,200
Before anything is removed, we should photograph everything.

433
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,700
How he's arranged the items in the room could be very important.

434
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
If you'll excuse me, I'd like to call my attorney.

435
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Game's not so fun though, is it, Hollings?

436
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,400
I have a court date tomorrow morning at 10.

437
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
You had no right to confiscate his collection.

438
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,600
Oh, there were burglaries in the area.

439
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,300
Those keys, they could give us some answers.

440
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,600
My client can't be tied to any of those burglaries.

441
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,700
You're probably right, you see, but I have a job to do, man.

442
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,600
Mr Hollings here has always been so understanding with that in the past.

443
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,500
Oh, I do understand.

444
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,900
I've given you a statement, explained where I got the keys...

445
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,800
And since you haven't charged him with anything...

446
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,600
Yeah.

447
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,600
But I'm really looking forward to charging him with this. Look at that.

448
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,500
I imagine it must be very frustrating when you can't solve a crime.

449
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,900
My client is a respected researcher with Whitley Chemical.

450
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,100
He hasn't missed a day of work in the past two weeks.

451
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Unless you have evidence to hold him...

452
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,200
Can't stop looking at it, can you, Hollings.

453
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,600
What does it do to you?

454
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Does it make you hot?

455
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
That the psycho?

456
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,400
He's brilliant.

457
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,200
He knew we were looking for a pocket knife, so he left one in plain sight.

458
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,600
The wrong one.

459
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,700
If you don't find anything concrete, he walks again, right?

460
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,200
I don't know if Booth could live with that.

461
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,300
Those keys have to lead somewhere.

462
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,000
Here are the files we had on all those suspects.

463
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,400
People we knew worked for the Romanos 6 years ago.

464
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,300
You got physical descriptions, blood types, everything we had.

465
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,800
Might come in handy to find any more evidence on the body.

466
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,400
Thanks.

467
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,500
After we recreate the bullet,

468
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,000
we can track the angle of entry based on height and ...

469
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,100
I don't get it.

470
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,700
You don't have the physical round that was shot.

471
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm trying to make one, based on the wounds.

472
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
Could give us the murder weapon.

473
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,600
Sweet!

474
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,300
If it works.

475
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,700
<i>You can't hold him.

476
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,900
You let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.

477
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,300
Sure.

478
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,800
<i>I can and I will.

479
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,500
<i>You're fishing.

480
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,300
<i>No judge is going to let you keep that collection, Agent Booth.

481
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,700
You have to know that.

482
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,700
We'll have it back by tomorrow.

483
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,900
Nice try.

484
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,300
We got the keys on pretty shaky ground.

485
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,400
The judges can release them in less than 18 hours,

486
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,700
unless we can find something tangible.

487
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,500
So Bones thought maybe you could help.

488
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,100
I don't see how. I'm an archaeologist.

489
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,200
She told me you could look at it as though it was some kind of historical site.

490
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,500
I suppose that's a reasonable assumption.

491
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,800
A person's environment as a reflection of who he is.

492
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,500
***, very smart, enjoys the game,

493
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,600
feels like he's untouchable...

494
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
The room is centered around this chair.

495
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,600
You can see how he's surrounded back and sides by the bulk of the keys.

496
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,700
If this were an innocent collection, he'd be facing it.

497
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,300
But in this configuration, he's displaying it.

498
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,600
A guy like this, you know, his kill surprises.

499
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
We are searching through these keys now,

500
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,000
to see if we can match them to a storage locker or another apartment,

501
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
but there's just too many of them.

502
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,700
Mayan rulers kept souvenirs of their kills.

503
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,200
They called the display a <i>tzompantli</i>.

504
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,000
It was believed that it showed their strength and power

505
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,200
and would strike fear into anyone who saw it.

506
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,900
He's a loner.

507
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,600
Yes. But this gave him enough power and security

508
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
that he let you into his home.

509
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,700
He's right-handed, correct?

510
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,100
Yeah, right.

511
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,100
Well, the bulk of the keys are on his right side.

512
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,900
Those with the greatest value to him would be in reach.

513
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,500
They hold his power.

514
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,500
I would look at any of the keys in the containers on his right side, over here.

515
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,800
I thought it could be a saw blade of some kind.

516
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,200
I compared the damage with these.

517
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,500
But the crenulations form a regular pattern.

518
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,200
They don't match what we see in the orbital cavities.

519
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,400
What if she was struggling?

520
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,100
Lack of haemorrhage in the surrounding eye tissues

521
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,200
suggests she was already dead before the eyes were removed.

522
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,600
We need to look for something smaller, maybe a surgical instrument.

523
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,000
The concrete used to sink Cugini is composed of class F fly ash

524
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,200
instead of Portland cement,

525
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,400
which is very exciting.

526
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,700
Not yet.

527
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,100
Each concrete company has its own unique mixture.

528
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,400
Certain building codes have to be met,

529
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
but after that it's up to each company.

530
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,300
These people were cutting corners by using fly ash, which is much cheaper.

531
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,900
Tapford Construction.

532
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,500
6 years ago, it was owned by Carlo Romano.

533
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,300
Romano doesn't seem very worried.

534
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,700
Yeah, that's hubris.

535
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,500
Good word!

536
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,400
Thank you.

537
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,000
He won't seem so smug after we talk to him.

538
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,400
I got the names of everyone of his employees 

539
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,700
from his construction companies 6 years ago,

540
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,000
pulling sales invoices. Can be a lot of stuff to sort through.

541
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,800
Hodgins is going to try and see if there is any ***scan*** or fingernail

542
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
in the concrete to pull DNA from.

543
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,800
That's another remote possibility.

544
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,900
Booth.

545
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,700
Yeah.

546
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,400
Judge ordered release of Hollings' possesions.

547
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
There's no grounds to hold him.

548
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,900
How many keys have they made it through?

549
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,300
Well, the lab had to match key types,

550
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,000
*** numbers, cross-reference to logs,

551
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,700
compare to crenulations...

552
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,700
To crenulations?

553
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,200
They've even been through the first 500, Bones, so I don't think...

554
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,600
There is no lock. Those keys don't open anything.

555
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,500
What are you talking about?

556
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,100
The crenulations, the grooves, 

557
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,100
carved into the bone around the victim's eyes--

558
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,000
they were irregular, like--

559
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
like the grooves of a key.

560
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,600
Bones, how many keys do you need?

561
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Well, car, house, lab, morgue -- I need a lot of keys.

562
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Grooves?

563
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,200
He must have used a key to gouge out the eyes.

564
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,000
And he kept it near him, in his apartment.

565
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,900
That was his souvenir.

566
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,400
How much longer can you keep the keys here confiscated?

567
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,800
He's on his way to reclaim them right now.

568
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,200
So you have at least a half an hour, maybe more?

569
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,000
At least.

570
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
OK, so tell Forensics to forget about matching them to any locks.

571
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,900
Have them image each key and send this to Zack

572
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,700
so he can find the key that matches the grooves on the bone.

573
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
That shouldn't take long.

574
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,200
Image keys, send to Zack. Right.

575
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
She's good, huh?

576
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,500
Told ya.

577
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,700
Romano didn't give us anything, so I should probably be back at the lab.

578
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,000
No, your squints can handle that.

579
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,100
You haven't slept in over a day.

580
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,400
You need to get some rest.

581
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,100
I'll sleep on the couch.

582
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
You-- think you're staying here with me?

583
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,300
Yeah!

584
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,800
Nice place by the way, Bones.

585
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,400
No, I'm locked in here, Booth, I'll be fine!

586
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,800
Hey, look.

587
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,500
I want you to stay away from your windows, too.

588
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,600
A sniper has a clear shot from any of the surrounding buildings.

589
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,800
I could've just stayed at the lab. The security's tight there.

590
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,900
And you would've worked, you would've gotten tired,

591
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
you would've been more vulnerable when you did go out.

592
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,400
Trust me, this is the best.

593
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,800
So--

594
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,500
Where's the TV?

595
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,700
I had one, but it broke. I'm--

596
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,700
I mostly just read and listen to music...

597
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,400
So let's listen to some music, ah?

598
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,200
Music! What do we got? Bones?

599
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,300
Uh, world music.

600
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,900
*** ***shock***

601
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,100
Tibetan throat singers! Rock on.

602
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,000
That's-- mostly for work.

603
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,400
*** ***, ***cat powell***...

604
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,500
Oh oh, all right, look at this!

605
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,300
Man, that's a lot of jazz! Wow!

606
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,900
I'd think all that free-form stuff would be a little bit too unpredictable for you.

607
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
No, I love it!

608
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,900
The artist has to live within a set tonal structure

609
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,100
and trust his own instincts

610
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,500
to find his way out of an infinite maze of musical possibilities,

611
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,500
and the great ones do.

612
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
What?

613
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,100
No, nothing.

614
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,200
I-- I just never expected that you would-- you know.

615
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
That I would love music?

616
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,700
Well, I don't usually get to talk about it, 

617
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,500
but since you brought it up, I thought...

618
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,400
Nah, I didn't mean to make you self-conscious.

619
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,000
Whoa, what's this?

620
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,300
Ha!

621
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,900
What is it?

622
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,400
Nice.

623
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Booth!

624
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,600
How did that get there?

625
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,400
Oh, please! Everybody loves Foreigner.

626
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,400
<i>Hot blooded</i>! Talk about a guilty pleasure.

627
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,400
Brennan!

628
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,700
David, hi!

629
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
I'm fine, thanks.

630
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,500
Booth, yeah.

631
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I'm still under lockdown until we solve these crimes.

632
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,400
Yes. Foreigner.

633
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,400
OK, sure, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

634
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,600
OK, thanks for calling. Bye.

635
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,700
I hope you didn't think...

636
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
No.

637
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,300
No, 'cause I-- I wouldn't want to ruin the thing for you.

638
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Not a problem.

639
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Hey, you got a soda? Juice?

640
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,400
Yeah, in my fridge. I'll get it.

641
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
No, no.

642
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,800
You know what, I'm not your guest. You don't have to wait on me.

643
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,000
I'll get it. You want anything?

644
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,500
That's OK.

645
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Oh, there are some glasses in the cupboard to the right of the fridge.

646
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,300
Kenton is on his way over.

647
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
You have to promise me that you're going to stay with him.

648
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
I will.

649
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
Did they gather all the evidence from the explosion?

650
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,200
Yes.

651
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,300
You sure?

652
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,000
Yes. Booth, I was there. They were very thorough.

653
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,100
And I was very annoying.

654
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,200
Sorry, Booth. It should be me lying in that bed.

655
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,800
I'm fine, you know.

656
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,400
I don't even know if I have to stay here.

657
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,700
You got blown up.

658
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,800
I've been through worse.

659
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,600
You have burns, lacerations, 

660
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,000
2 broken ribs, greenstick fracture of the clavicle...

661
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
OK, I got blown up.

662
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Can you-- can you hand me one of the puddings?

663
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,400
Oh, man.

664
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Thanks, Bones. Look at that.

665
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,500
You know--

666
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,500
On your X-rays, there's a history of multiple fractures on your feet

667
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,600
consistent with beating.

668
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,800
It's a common method of torture in the Middle East.

669
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Beating the soles of the feet with pipes or hoses...

670
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,400
I know.

671
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,400
And there are indications of injuries sustained while you were shielding someone.

672
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,200
How the hell can you tell something like that?

673
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,700
The scarring shows that the ribcage spread in such a way that...

674
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Yeah. OK.

675
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,900
That buddy of mine--

676
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,900
he lost his weapon, and I...

677
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,200
I tried.

678
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,100
He didn't make it.

679
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,700
You know, you shouldn't be looking at my X-rays.

680
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm sorry.

681
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,700
Hey.

682
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,600
Yeah.

683
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,100
You look like crap.

684
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
A little bit more of this pudding and I'll be just fine.

685
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,800
Stick with her.

686
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
If you want me to.

687
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,300
Don't you think I should be consulted?

688
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,200
No.

689
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
And keep her close.

690
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,600
Don't worry.

691
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,400
Could have been you.

692
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,500
Yes, Zack, I know.

693
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,800
The only reason he survived was that he was reaching for the glass.

694
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,500
I know.

695
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,600
Can we change the subject?

696
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,800
Let's talk revenge.

697
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,400
Bloodlust.

698
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,800
The cathartic release we're looking for can only be achieved

699
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
when we successfully gather enough evidence

700
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,300
to neutralize the person or persons responsible

701
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,200
for putting Booth in the hospital.

702
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,400
Neutralize can mean either kill or arrest.

703
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,800
Yes, it can mean either.

704
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
I don't get it. What exactly are you doing?

705
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,600
I'm using a digital enhancement program 

706
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,800
to fill in the missing markings made by the bullet

707
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,000
while it passed through the bone.

708
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Impressed?

709
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,600
I have so many more tricks.

710
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,400
There's no ring. Single or gay?

711
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,100
Gay? Why would you say gay?

712
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,700
Brokeback, baby. Gotta ask.

713
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,900
Not gay.

714
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,600
Angela...

715
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,900
We'll talk later.

716
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,900
So you'd match a digital replica of the bullet with any recovered bullets the FBI has?

717
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Yes, so we can cross-reference crimes, suspects, weapons...

718
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,200
Amazing.

719
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,000
I just finished working with forensics at the FBI,

720
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,500
analyzing the chemical composition of the explosives.

721
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,000
The isotopes in the sulphure are like a fingerprint.

722
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It is a perfect match 

723
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,600
to the sulphure manufactured by the chemical company Hollings works for.

724
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
FBI!

725
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
Go! Go!

726
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,600
Show yourself!

727
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Clear!

728
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,500
He took off.

729
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,100
He marked the same part of town we found the other victim.

730
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Gone after someone else. I want all this back.

731
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,500
Brennan.

732
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,600
We found the key.

733
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,400
FBI said Hollings never returned to claim them.

734
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,900
It matches the bone damage exactly.

735
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,800
And it's definitely one of Hollings' keys.

736
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,700
Yes. Hodgins tried to retrieve DNA from it,

737
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,600
but he says it was dipped in some kind of chemical bath

738
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,300
to remove anything organic.

739
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,700
Good work.

740
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,900
Maybe you should come in now, Dr Brennan.

741
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,800
I'll be fine, Zack.

742
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,100
Any luck with the bullet?

743
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,700
You want to go back to the lab till we get any other news?

744
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,600
You're safer there.

745
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,300
Actually, Zack, I'll see you in a few minutes.

746
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,300
<i>He's got the ball again...

747
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,000
Hey.

748
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,300
Why are you here? Is Brennan all right?

749
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,400
Sure. Yeah, no, she's with your compadre.

750
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,800
I just came by to see how you are.

751
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,300
Oh.

752
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,700
Pudding!

753
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,600
I still remember this stuff from when I got my appendix out.

754
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,500
Yeah. It's as good as you remember.

755
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,300
The key fit?

756
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,500
Yeah.

757
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,800
And they found a map of the neighborhood where the other body was found,

758
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,200
and some more keys.

759
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,000
A map?

760
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,500
We didn't catch that before?

761
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,400
I guess not.

762
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,300
Or maybe your killer is getting sloppy.

763
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,000
That's not like him.

764
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,800
It isn't like him to use explosives either. People change.

765
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
That's a wonderful thing about life.

766
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,400
I hope we get him before he gets Brennan.

767
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,900
Can I have this one?

768
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
You OK?

769
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,000
Uh? Yeah.

770
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,300
Yeah, I'm just thinking.

771
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,000
People don't really change. 

772
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,300
We like to believe they do, but they don't.

773
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
You think he knew that it's the mob guys were after?

774
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,300
I'm just thinking, the things--

775
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,900
they don't make sense.

776
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,800
You're feeling something a little more devious.

777
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,300
Like a frame-up?

778
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,400
I like it. Very conspiratorial.

779
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,100
Things are just too neat.

780
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,700
Hollings would never leave a map there.

781
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Go with me on this:

782
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,000
Mob guys know you're closing in

783
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,500
and want to throw you off by making it look like the psycho.

784
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,700
These guys have been involved in conspiracies a lot more complicated than this.

785
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,100
They set up Lee Harvey Oswald,

786
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,600
worked with the CIA to kill Castro,

787
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,100
forget about what they did to Marilyn Monroe!

788
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,800
Someone planted that evidence so that we'd find it.

789
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,900
Someone who knew what we were up to.

790
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,300
Someone at the lab works for the mob!

791
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,400
I can see it.

792
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,800
There's not much difference between a corrupt corporate government and organized crime.

793
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,500
You're right.

794
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,700
Excuse me?

795
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,800
The only way that this could unfold

796
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,800
is if someone on the inside was orchestrating things.

797
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,400
People never tell me I'm right.

798
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
They only say I'm crazy.

799
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,100
Love you, man.

800
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,600
What the hell are you doing?

801
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
You're driving.

802
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,500
Cool.

803
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,800
Yeah.

804
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,700
OK, make sure there's backup.

805
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,200
Spotted someone taking a woman into those old abandoned buildings off Hunter Blvd.

806
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,100
I'll drop you off at the...

807
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,700
No, I'm coming.

808
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,600
Booth said it was pointless to argue.

809
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
He's a smart man, Booth.

810
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,500
I'll just call Zack.

811
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,300
I think I know how to complete the bullet.

812
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Even if we have only one side, if we can approximate the spin as it was fired...

813
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,400
You really are the best.

814
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,400
It's too bad.

815
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,000
He worked for the FBI *** *** get information.

816
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,600
Kenton was working organized crime at the same time that Cugini was killed.

817
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,600
He was the only one who knew the details of both investigations,

818
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,300
so he takes what he knows about Hollings

819
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,200
to throw suspicions off himself.

820
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,900
Maybe that nurse was right to be pissed that you were leaving.

821
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,000
You don't seem good, Booth.

822
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,800
Not if it weren't a toy car.

823
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,600
Yeah.

824
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,900
Listen to me, Bobby.

825
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,800
Let's get some units out there now.

826
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,800
I want to know about any activity in the abandoned buildings on that map.

827
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,900
Brennan's not picking up her cellphone.

828
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Kenton, he never call for backup or surveillance or anything.

829
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,600
Jesus. How could I be so stupid. 

830
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,900
I mean, everything pointed to him.

831
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,400
Hey, it is not your fault.

832
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,000
How could it not be my fault?

833
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,600
It was my job to protect her.

834
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Instead, I handed her over to him.

835
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,100
This sort crime you just gotta let slide.

836
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,800
A death like Cugini is just something that's an internal issue.

837
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,500
Doesn't affect anyone else.

838
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,200
You killed Cugini?

839
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,500
You don't get rich working for the FBI.

840
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,300
When I was undercover, the Romanos were very good to me.

841
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,700
And you accept their generosity,

842
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,300
you have no choice but to do what they ask.

843
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,200
Is that how you live with yourself, you take choice out of the equation?

844
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,600
It's no different than Booth taking out someone from the other side

845
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,000
when he was a sniper in the Gulf.

846
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,400
That was a war. His actions saved lives.

847
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,400
You don't think hitting *** Cugini ended a street war?

848
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,600
So my death, how do you justify it now?

849
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,000
The Bureau keeps a shell from every weapon it issues.

850
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,700
You match that slug, it points to my weapon and I go down.

851
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,500
The Romanos make sure I don't talk.

852
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Uh, at least I'm dying for a good reason.

853
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
You know, maybe you're wrong.

854
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,200
I mean, Hollings is missing, right?

855
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,700
Convenient, huh?

856
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,100
Kenton'd plant the lead so that we'd find her and go after Hollings,

857
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,500
who we would never find.

858
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,100
Because he's dead?

859
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Because he's dead.

860
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,600
That conspiracy thing is a lot more intense when you're in the middle of it.

861
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,400
Yeah.

862
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,100
Yeah. OK.

863
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:51,000
OK, an agent talked to a witness who saw a couple go into a building off the North 23rd.

864
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,900
Just "a" building? Oh yeah, that's really specific.

865
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,100
Crackheads aren't that detail-oriented.

866
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Step on it, come on.

867
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,500
They are not gonna find Hollings.

868
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,900
You know, he used to slit their throat like they were cattle.

869
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,900
Told me he used the key to unlock the soul behind their eyes.

870
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,900
That was one sick bastard the world ain't gonna miss.

871
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,700
We used thermal imagery to *** activity that was inside the buildings.

872
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,000
A crack house, a couple squatters. ***squads*** moving here next

873
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,300
He hears noise, he could freak out and kill her.

874
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,100
We gotta be careful.

875
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,000
There's no "we", Booth.

876
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,800
I'm going with you.

877
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,600
You can barely stand.

878
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,600
I said I'm going with you! Give me my gun.

879
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,200
Give me that vest for Booth!

880
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,700
Wear this.

881
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,700
Yeah.

882
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,000
You know what? You can come too.

883
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,900
Put that on and stay back.

884
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,900
I can do that.

885
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm sorry.

886
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Really am.

887
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,300
Maybe you shouldn't *** 

888
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm not like him, though.

889
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
The things I have to do to you...

890
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,000
You'll be gone first.

891
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,400
You'll never know a thing.

892
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,400
I never expected anyone to find out.

893
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,500
It's OK. I'm here. It's all over.

894
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,600
I'm right here. All right. It's all over.

895
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,100
How'd you get out of the hospital?

896
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,100
Hodgins gave me--

897
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Maybe you can give me a ride back there, huh?

898
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,100
Kenton has told us everything.

899
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,600
I guess he figures there's nothing to hide.

900
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Now he's finished anyway.

901
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,800
Better late than never, huh?

902
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,900
Yeah, I guess.

903
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,700
You know--

904
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,000
I let you down, Bones. I'm sorry.

905
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,500
You saved my life.

906
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Yeah, but you know, I shouldn't have gone down like that.

907
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,500
What a pair.

908
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,400
Brennan.

909
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Um-- I'm leaving right now.

910
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,500
David.

911
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,300
We're finally having our dinner.

912
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,300
Yeah, I figured you didn't dress up for me.

913
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
You sure you don't want anything?

914
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,900
Nah, I'll be fine. I was gonna--

915
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,900
slip around TV here.

916
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,600
OK.

917
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,000
See you tomorrow.

918
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yeah. Have a good night.

919
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Thanks.

920
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:43,100
<i>[from The Fly] 
We'll finish a delightful evening with reintegrated champagne.

921
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,100
I have rescheduled.
<i>- Finish?      - No, not quite.

922
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,500
I--

923
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,400
My head starts.

924
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,300
<i>[from The Grapes of Wrath] 
the one big soul that belongs to everybody.

925
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,100
We'll watch TV if you like.
<i>- Then...

926
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Sure.
<i>- Then what, Tom?

927
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,600
<i>Then it don't matter.

928
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,200
<i>I'll be all around in the dark.

929
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,200
<i>I'll be everywhere, wherever you can look.</i>
- Bones -- arm -- thanks.

930
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,100
<i>Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat...

931
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,400
<i>I'll be there.

932
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,600
<i>Wherever there's a cop
beatin' up a guy...

933
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,600
<i>I'll be there.
