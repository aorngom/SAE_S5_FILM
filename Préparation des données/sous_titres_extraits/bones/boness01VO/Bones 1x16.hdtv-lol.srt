1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,400
Where are we?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,500
Apparently, this was
an access shaft

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,400
to an underwater aqueduct

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,300
which has never
been activated.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,300
No, no, I mean where
are we geographically?

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,800
Oh, somehwere

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,200
beneath Wisconsin
and Massachusetts Avenue

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,500
near the National Cathedral.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,400
How far down?

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,200
We seem very far down.

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,600
Oh, about 60 feet
so far.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,900
Is there any other way?

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,300
It's a giant maze
down here,

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,400
but this was
the fastest way

15
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,100
to get to the body.

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,300
I've done plenty
of climbing.

17
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,500
These lines have low tolerances

18
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
that are more
than adequate.

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,300
What about shock tolerance?

20
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,400
The rope jerks,

21
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,900
pounds-feet of
kinetic energy increases

22
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,000
and snap- we fall
to our deaths.

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,400
Oh... Okay.

24
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,600
I say we just stop the chatter.

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,900
Two city workers
found it.

26
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,100
D.C. public works are under
federal jurisdiction,

27
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,900
so this is
your party.

28
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh...

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,700
Any idea what's at
the top of that shaft?

30
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,800
Utility tunnel for accessing
steam pipes.

31
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,900
May I borrow your gun?

32
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,200
Why do you want my gun?

33
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
I'm not going to shoot
anyone. I promise.

34
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not a hammer
or anything.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,800
We've been working together
for months, Booth.

36
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,500
A little trust

37
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,800
would be nice.

38
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,700
Careful.

39
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,800
Here. Hold this.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,900
Now they'll eat each other
and leave our remains alone.

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,900
You know, you do know

42
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
I have to file a report

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,700
with the review board
each time I discharge

44
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,100
a round from
my weapon.

45
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,100
Pictures, Zack.

46
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,500
The rats scattered
the remains,

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,000
so give me a five-meter radius.

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,500
The velocity
of the fall

49
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
shattered her body on impact.

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,500
Tibias and fibulas broken

51
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,000
below the knees,

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,100
vertebrae compressed

53
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,200
and shattered...

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,100
Her?

55
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,300
Yeah. I just hope that
she was dead

56
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,200
before the rats got to her.

57
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,300
Oh, God.

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,400
Any idea how long
she's been down here?

59
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,600
We should have some answers
when Hodgins

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,800
analyzes the bugs,

61
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,000
but rats can strip a body
in days.

62
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,700
Shirt, pants, but no jacket
or shoes.

63
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,000
No way rats

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,800
can carry that off.

65
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,700
Excuse me!

66
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,600
Sir?

67
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,700
Sir!

68
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Hey, what the hell?
Bones! Easy!

69
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
Bones, what the hell
are you doing?

70
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,000
Bones!

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
You don't just go running
after guys into the dark.

72
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,600
He didn't need any light.

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,900
He knew exactly where

74
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,800
he was going.

75
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Yeah, that's creepy.

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:03:06,600
He lives down here.

77
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,500
The victim had a pin
in her knee

78
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,100
from a skiing injury, so we
matched the serial numbers.

79
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,900
Her name
is Marni Hunter, 24.

80
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,600
1.7 meters tall,

81
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,800
left-handed.

82
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,300
Documentary filmmaker.

83
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Fiance reported her missing
ten days ago.

84
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,200
The police find the guy?

85
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,300
Your mole man? No.

86
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,900
I've heard of those people.

87
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
They patch into electrical
grids down there.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,100
Some can even tap cable.

89
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,200
I'd set time of death

90
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,700
at about ten days,

91
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,500
when the Missing Persons
Report was filed.

92
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
You sure?

93
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,800
See the ratio of fly larvae

94
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,600
to Silphidae beetles?

95
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,500
Yeah. Ten days.
I believe you.

96
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,900
She fell approximately
40 feet

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,700
and landed feet first,

98
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,000
which explained
the crushed tibias.

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,600
That what killed her?

100
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Not necessarily. Her skull
sustained traumatic injuries

101
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,900
that are inconsistent
with a feet-first fall.

102
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,100
We found blood traces
and bone chips

103
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
on pieces of exposed pipe
and rebar

104
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,800
jutting from the side

105
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
of the ventilation shaft.

106
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
So that's what killed her?

107
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
No, not necessarily.

108
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,900
The fingernails
are totally clean.

109
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,600
If she were falling,
she would claw at the wall

110
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,900
to slow her descent.

111
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,200
It's an instinctual response.

112
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
So she was dead before the fall.

113
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,100
No. Not necessarily.

114
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,000
Bones.

115
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,000
Please.

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
Just tell me.

117
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,400
She may have simply
been unconscious.

118
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,000
Mr. Garfield, why did
you wait two days

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,100
to file the Missing Persons
Report on your fiancee?

120
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,400
Marni is
a documentary filmmaker...

121
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,700
or was.

122
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,100
She was very dedicated
to work.

123
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,000
She immersed herself
in each project.

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
It's not odd for her
to stay out in the field

125
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,800
without coming home.

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
You get invested

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,100
in your work, time has a way
of getting away from you.

128
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,300
That's what Marni...
always said.

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
You didn't worry about her
down there?

130
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,300
She's been all
over the world.

131
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,000
Rwanda, Latin America,

132
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,400
the Balkans,

133
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,500
the Middle East.

134
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,900
I was just glad
to have her home.

135
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,000
You two were engaged.

136
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,900
And we'd finally set a date.

137
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,700
I'm very sorry for your loss.

138
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,200
Was it her work

139
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,100
that took her down
into the tunnels?

140
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
Her latest project

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,700
the last couple of months
is about the maze of tunnels

142
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,600
beneath the city.

143
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
That's what she'd cut together
so far.

144
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,500
I told her to be careful.

145
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,800
You know, a lot of those guys
are pretty nuts.

146
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,800
That's fascinating.

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,100
A fully functional
shadow society.

148
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,200
Did you ever go down there

149
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
with her?

150
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,100
Who did she work with?

151
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,600
Marni worked alone.

152
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,700
She did her own camerawork
and sound.

153
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
It was very raw.
That's her style.

154
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,100
She never appeared on camera
in her own work.

155
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,700
She thought the documentary
should be about the subject,

156
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,200
not the filmmaker.

157
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
That's true.

158
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,000
As an anthropologist,

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you try to immerse yourself
in a culture

160
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,400
without distorting it

161
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,700
with your own presence.

162
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,500
It's another reason
to work alone.

163
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,500
So you found her

164
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,800
at the bottom
of an air shaft?

165
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,300
You think that

166
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,600
one of these people...

167
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,600
Her skull has
some unexplained damage.

168
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,100
The shattering
on the right...

169
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,100
We're still

170
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,800
investigating,
Mr. Garfield.

171
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,900
Wait a minute.

172
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,200
Wait! Freeze.

173
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
That's the man I saw

174
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,000
in the tunnel.

175
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,000
Marni ever mention

176
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
this particular guy to you?

177
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,600
No.

178
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
The blonde woman
is Helen something.

179
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,400
She's a social worker,

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,500
I think

181
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,400
in the shelter over on 26th.

182
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,100
Marni came to the shelter.

183
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,000
She heard I worked with what
she called "the mole people."

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,900
She asked me to introduce
her to them.

185
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,900
Spend a lot of time
down here?

186
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Mmm. It's kind of
my beat,

187
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,800
I guess you'd say.

188
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,000
Did you resent
Marni's intrusion?

189
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,200
Why do you ask?

190
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,500
It's an ordered society.

191
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,700
Marni and her cameras might have
been disruptive in some way.

192
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,100
Well, these people
are here for a reason.

193
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
And in my opinion, they have
a right to their privacy.

194
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,700
I respect that.

195
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,300
I'm not sure a documentary
filmmaker does.

196
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,900
She disruptive enough
to make any enemies?

197
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,000
Perhaps.

198
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,300
It's tough to know
these people.

199
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,300
Well, isn't that what
Marni was trying to do?

200
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,200
Get to know these people?

201
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,200
Explain them to the rest
of the world?

202
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,900
Well, no offense,
Doctor Brennan,

203
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,300
but I find that
a bit naive.

204
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,800
Her job was to sell
her films.

205
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,100
What she was doing
was exploitive.

206
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
Maybe one of these people
agreed with you.

207
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,200
There's the man
you're looking for.

208
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
Harold Overmeyer.

209
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Marni called him
"the mayor of Mole Town."

210
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
I imagine she thought
that was clever.

211
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
He's mediating a dispute.

212
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,900
He has
alpha male status.

213
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,600
How did Harold
respond to her?

214
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,200
My impression was
he liked her.

215
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,500
But again, nobody really
knows these people.

216
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,600
I brought you
some food, Harold.

217
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,500
Eh... I have enough food.

218
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,300
What do you want?

219
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,000
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

220
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,100
Well, I'm not required
to answer any questions.

221
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
I'm not required...

222
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
That's correct.

223
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,400
Harold has rights.

224
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Ms. Bronson, you want to please
take a step back?

225
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
You're interfering
with a criminal investigation.

226
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Did you know Marni Hunter?

227
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,900
You saw what happened
to Marni, didn't you?

228
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,500
You guys are trespassing.

229
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,300
Go away.

230
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay, buddy, that's it.
Let's go.

231
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,900
Whoa... Booth.

232
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,000
This man is obviously

233
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
someone important
down here.

234
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Important?

235
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,900
He lives in a cardboard
box underground.

236
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,400
In this society

237
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
he has status.

238
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,200
Give him his due.
Treat him with respect.

239
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,100
Okay, Mr. Overmeyer.

240
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,800
We got off on the wrong foot.

241
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,300
I'm Special Agent
Seeley Booth

242
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,000
from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

243
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
and I would appreciate it
very, very much

244
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,500
if you would grant us
the advantage

245
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,000
of your expertise
as we investigate

246
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,100
Marni Hunter's death.

247
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Fair enough.

248
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,800
Oh.

249
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,700
Mr. Overmeyer,
I saw you in the tunnel

250
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,100
over near where we found

251
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Marni Hunter's remains.

252
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Checking the tunnels.

253
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,100
Checking the tunnels,

254
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,300
or checking
on Marni?

255
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,300
I warned her.

256
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
So... you two were friends

257
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
beyond being observer
and observed?

258
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,400
You talk like her. Are you
making a documentary, too?

259
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,800
No, but there are things
I need to understand.

260
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,400
That's my stuff.

261
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,900
Bones.

262
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,700
Harold, is this, uh,
Marni's video camera?

263
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
You'd better go now.

264
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,900
You can go now!

265
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,900
Booth, this clothing

266
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,300
has blood all over it.

267
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,300
Give him his due, huh?

268
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
I think it belonged
to Marni Hunter.

269
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
You know what?
Afraid you're going

270
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
to have
to come with us, pal.

271
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
What?! No!

272
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
I- I can't leave!

273
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,400
Bone fragments.

274
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,800
I can't leave!

275
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Let's get this back to the lab.

276
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,500
No! You don't understand!

277
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,000
She would have wanted me

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,500
to have
that stuff.

279
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,300
She would have wanted
me to have that.

280
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,500
You know, I find scrap
metal. That's all.

281
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,700
That's why
I go deep.

282
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,300
You don't have to say

283
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,700
anything you don't want to,
Mr. Overmeyer.

284
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're not here
because you scavenge.

285
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
You know that.

286
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
I- It's too bright in here!

287
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,500
Too- too bright in here!

288
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,900
I know you have a distinguished
military record, Harold.

289
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,900
10th Special Forces Group.

290
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,500
You know,
I was with the Rangers.

291
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,900
What, so, you...
you gonna tell me, uh,

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
"Harold, I know what
you been through.

293
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,700
"I been there, too,
you know?

294
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,700
I know how you ended up
how you ended up."

295
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,500
You telling me that?

296
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,900
Yeah. I'm telling you that.

297
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,000
I killed people.

298
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,700
You saved five of your men.

299
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,000
By shooting a pregnant woman.

300
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,200
She had a grenade
in her hand.

301
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
She had a child in her arms.

302
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,200
I shot her and...
the grenade went off.

303
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,600
She died right away.

304
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,200
That kid...

305
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
took awhile.

306
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,300
He kept looking at me, but I...

307
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,300
You did what a soldier
had to do.

308
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,100
Yeah. You know...
I was a good soldier-

309
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,900
I was a very good soldier-

310
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,700
but a pretty bad human being.

311
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Pretty bad
human being.

312
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,600
What happened to Marni?

313
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,400
I... I hadn't seen
her in days, you know?

314
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,900
That's why I went
to go take a look.

315
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,700
Rats were all
over her, man.

316
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,200
All over her.

317
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,900
How did you end up
with her things?

318
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,200
Oh, you know,
I was going to sell them.

319
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,000
I mean, she would have wanted me
to have those.

320
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,300
So you had nothing
to do with her death?

321
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,500
I, um... I...
I gave her something.

322
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,000
And that's
why she died.

323
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,800
What did you give her?

324
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,200
Mr. Overmeyer, I'm advising you
not to say anything else.

325
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,300
You know what? I think
it's best, um...

326
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,700
I not talk about
this anymore.

327
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
Not cause
any more trouble.

328
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,700
I... I got to go.

329
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,600
No, Harold, you can't,
all right? Not yet. You got...

330
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Too bright in here!
I got to go! Harold...

331
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,600
I never wanted her to die.

332
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,600
She wouldn't listen! I wanted to...

333
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,500
I finished the skull.

334
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,700
We still have
some pieces missing,

335
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,500
but we should be able to
determine cause of death.

336
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,100
You haven't eaten
anything all day.

337
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,800
Now, I have some
killer yellowtail here

338
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,400
and spicy tuna rolls.

339
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,300
Time gets away
from me sometimes.

340
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,100
What?

341
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
The victim used
to say that.

342
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,400
You think that homeless
mole-guy killed her?

343
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,900
Booth does.

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,500
Well, he had her camera

345
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,400
and her bloody clothes.

346
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,400
Plus, he's killed
people before.

347
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
As a soldier.
Socially sanctioned.

348
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,100
Booth has killed people
as a law enforcer.

349
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
What if, from mole-man's

350
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,800
point of view,
Marni was a criminal?

351
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
Marni Hunter
was an observer-

352
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,200
by definition, passive.

353
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,100
Like you?

354
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,300
Yes. Exactly.

355
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,900
Are you getting at something?

356
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,500
Just that I wish you were
a little more scared, Brennan.

357
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,300
I'm careful.

358
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,800
Running after a murderer
in the dark

359
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,500
is not being an observer.

360
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,300
Booth told you about that?

361
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,100
More and more
of your work

362
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,700
is outside of this lab,
running after bad guys.

363
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,200
Just promise me
you'll be careful.

364
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,500
Every society
has its fringe dwellers,

365
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,600
and every society
fears its fringe dwellers.

366
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,400
Usually because
they are the example

367
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,900
of what happens when you fail

368
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,400
in that society.
But they are

369
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,700
seldom dangerous in reality.

370
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,900
Brennan, I understand
that this is what you do

371
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,400
when things get too close
to home.

372
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,600
You get all analytical
and academic.

373
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,300
I just want you to know

374
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,700
that maybe Marni Hunter
did the same thing.

375
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
And now she's dead.

376
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,500
We got most of the skull.

377
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,300
There's just a piece missing
about the size of a quarter.

378
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,100
Why are missing pieces

379
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,300
always the size
of quarters?

380
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,700
Why are tumors always
the size of grapefruits?

381
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,900
Those are rhetorical

382
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,400
questions I'm not supposed
to answer, right?

383
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,900
These are
not simply

384
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,100
random abrasions.

385
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,000
What are they?
Marni's skull

386
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,900
was fractured by a midair impact
during her fall.

387
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,700
That's evidenced
by the radiating

388
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,600
fractures centered
above her right temporal bone,

389
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,800
but this damage is isolated
on the left side of her skull.

390
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,000
A girl can't bang both sides
of her head

391
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,500
as she falls down a shaft?

392
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,100
From the fracture pattern,

393
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,200
it appears to be a sharp,
pointed weapon.

394
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,900
Brennan mentioned
that Harold said

395
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
he had given the victim
something he wished he hadn't.

396
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Could this have been it?

397
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,400
Fragments of Latin.

398
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,900
Roman numerals.

399
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,000
You know who knows
about that kind of stuff?

400
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,800
You show it to him.

401
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,000
No. I am not taking possession
of that piece of evidence.

402
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,700
You show it to him.

403
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,300
Armor- a Roman cuirass.

404
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,400
Doric columns common to Rome
around the first century BC.

405
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
Crazy mole-guy gave
something to the victim

406
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
he thinks could
have gotten her killed.

407
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,500
Of course, he's crazy.

408
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,500
This could be valuable.

409
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,400
Let's have
Ms. Montenegro X-ray it.

410
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,500
Stress from the
initial pressing

411
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,400
should provide
a clear picture

412
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,700
of what's been
worn away.

413
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,100
I was hoping
you'd take possession

414
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,900
of this piece
of evidence.

415
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,500
And the paperwork that
goes along with it.

416
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,900
I wasn't born yesterday,
Dr. Hodgins.

417
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,800
Well, you don't really
need me for this.

418
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,100
Yes, I do.
Why?

419
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,400
Because I have not
taken official possession

420
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,100
of this piece
of evidence.

421
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,700
Fascinating.

422
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,400
1778.

423
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,000
It appears to be
an official seal

424
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,900
of some kind.

425
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh, my God!

426
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,200
Aren't you going
to go after him?

427
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Nope.

428
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,000
Why not?

429
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500
Because he is now officially
in charge of that medallion.

430
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,600
Treasure?

431
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,100
It's an official
vault seal,

432
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,500
manufactured
by the War Office.

433
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,400
It was established
in 1778.

434
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,100
<i>The Latin sigal and thesaur
tie it to the treasury.</i>

435
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,800
A bank vault kind of a vault.

436
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,900
Much better.

437
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,600
The War Office
established several vaults

438
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,700
under the city to safe keep
cultural treasures.

439
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,200
They must all be empty by now.

440
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,800
No, no. Several were
unaccounted for

441
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,300
after a series of cave-ins
and mudslides

442
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,300
in the early 1900s.

443
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
So you're saying
this seal came off

444
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,200
a vault full of treasure
buried beneath the city?

445
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
It could contain currency,
gold ingots,

446
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,200
paintings and engravings.

447
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,400
The original draft
of Lincoln's inaugural address

448
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,900
was never recovered.

449
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,400
This could be
an extraordinary find.

450
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,300
We have to find
these artifacts

451
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
before they're stolen

452
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,600
or sold off.

453
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,100
What's the monetary value
of this thing?

454
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,200
Priceless.

455
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,400
You can't put

456
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,300
a value on our cultural heritage.

457
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,700
I think someone did.

458
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,300
That's why Marni's dead.

459
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,600
Harold, was this what
you gave Marni Hunter?

460
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
Yeah. She liked it.

461
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Where did you get it?

462
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,000
Beyond the perimeter.

463
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,000
Harold? Harold, you
have to trust us.

464
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,000
We just want to find
who killed Marni.

465
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,600
And you can help.

466
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,200
You killed people.

467
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Maybe this is your chance
to put that right.

468
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,200
You said you

469
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,800
wish you hadn't given it
to her. Why?

470
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Did you take it
from someone?

471
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,100
The blonde.

472
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,300
It was hers.

473
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,300
And I shouldn't
have taken it.

474
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,600
A blonde killed Marni?

475
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,900
Marni went too deep.

476
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,900
That's the blonde's territory.

477
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,500
Does the blonde woman
have a name?

478
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,400
People around me die.

479
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,400
Marni died.

480
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,900
There's always going to
be casualties, Harold.

481
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,300
The important thing is
to recognize the enemy,

482
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,500
and take him out so more
people don't get hurt.

483
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,400
Can you take us down there,
Harold?

484
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
No. It's beyond the perimeter.

485
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,400
I took Marni
beyond the perimeter.

486
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,500
I'm not going to make
that same mistake again.

487
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,600
Won't make
that mistake again.

488
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,300
The social worker.

489
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,000
Why? Because she's a blonde?

490
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,300
Yeah. I mean, come...

491
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,000
Why didn't she want
Marni poking around?

492
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,500
Because she thought
the documentary

493
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
was exploiting the homeless.

494
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,900
You buy that?

495
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,300
Well, obviously, you don't.
You know what?

496
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
You want to know
what a better reason

497
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
for not wanting somebody
poking around is?

498
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,800
A mythical treasure?

499
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,700
All right, look. You ever see
<i>Treasure of the Sierra Madre?</i>

500
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,300
It doesn't matter
if the treasure

501
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,800
is mythical or not.

502
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,300
People will still kill
if they think it exists.

503
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,300
It did exist.

504
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,500
What?
In the movie,

505
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,800
it's gold dust.

506
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,100
People think it didn't exist,

507
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,500
so it blew away,
but it did exist.

508
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,900
But no one got it,
is the point.

509
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,300
Huh! All of a sudden,
you know a movie.

510
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,100
Everybody knows that movie.

511
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,200
Brennan.

512
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
It's Hodgins. Your victim
was in some other tunnel system

513
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
before she died.

514
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,500
Facts before conclusions,
please.

515
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Her clothing shows traces
of diamond dust.

516
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,200
That suggests a much older
system of tunnels than the one

517
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,700
in which you found her.

518
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,500
Industrial diamonds were used

519
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,400
in blast-hole drilling
in the 19th century.

520
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,800
It's near a vault.
It makes sense.

521
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,500
Good job, Hodgins.

522
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,400
What would we do without you?

523
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,100
So Marni was killed
near a vault,

524
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,100
and then dragged to the shaft.

525
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,600
Harold will know
where that vault is.

526
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,700
Okay, maybe you could try

527
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,600
the "Hey, we're brothers
in arms" thing on him.

528
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,600
Okay, that, what you just said
right there, Bones-

529
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,700
that was cynical.

530
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,500
It was glib and cynical.

531
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,600
Really?

532
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,800
Yes, really.

533
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,900
I know what
that guy has been through.

534
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,300
You killed a pregnant woman
who was holding a child?

535
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,600
Look, if you really
want to know

536
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,100
what I've done, I'll tell you,

537
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,900
but you better be ready
for the truth.

538
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,000
Good choice, Bones.

539
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,800
Harold is afraid of me?

540
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Does he have any reason
to fear you?

541
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,100
Oh, Harold is afraid
of the world.

542
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
Why do you think
he lives underground?

543
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,900
Because he's
paying penance.

544
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,000
What?

545
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,100
You catch murderers
to pay off your penance.

546
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,500
Harold lives
underground.

547
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Did you ever tell Marni that you
found her documentary exploitive?

548
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,900
Of course I did.
I'm an honest person.

549
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,700
I told her I wouldn't help her.

550
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,000
Which is when she turned
to Harold as a guide.

551
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,300
Yes, and those two other guys.

552
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,200
What... what
two other guys?

553
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,500
She took climbing lessons-

554
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
how to use ropes-
all that stuff.

555
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,400
When you told Marni that you
thought she was exploitive,

556
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
how did she react?

557
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Well, she said
that showing the truth

558
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,700
couldn't possibly be exploitive.

559
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,500
I agree with her.

560
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,000
Truth doesn't mean the same
thing to everyone, Dr. Brennan.

561
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
Harold said he was afraid of me?

562
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,700
Said he was afraid
of a blonde.

563
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,800
How do you know
it wasn't Charlize Theron?

564
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,100
Who's that?

565
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,400
An actress.
She's being sarcastic.

566
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
Thank you for your help.

567
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,900
Appreciate it.

568
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,200
You know, you amaze me,
you know?

569
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,300
You know <i>Treasure
of the Sierra Madre</i>

570
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,900
but you don't
know Charlize Theron.

571
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,200
You know who you are?

572
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,600
You're my grandmother.

573
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,700
Here's
the recreation.

574
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,300
Here are the wounds.

575
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
Those skull fractures
are centered

576
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,400
above the left
parietal lobe.

577
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,800
Okay, the lasers
can measure the angle

578
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,300
of the attack
and the amount of damage

579
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,100
that was done to the living bone

580
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,300
of the skull;
3.3 millimeters indentation

581
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,200
into the bone
at the deepest point

582
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,200
which trailed off
to .04 millimeters.

583
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,700
A glancing blow.

584
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,200
Yeah, she saw it coming.

585
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,000
The angle of the attack

586
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,200
was between 50
and 53 degrees.

587
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,100
Meaning the attacker
struck from above.

588
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,700
And from the
victim's right.

589
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,000
So the attacker was left-handed.

590
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,500
She was only struck once.

591
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,200
Sometimes that's all it takes.

592
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,000
Good job, bro.

593
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,700
Take care.

594
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,400
Kyle Montrose and
Duke Diallel?

595
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,700
Yeah.

596
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
We're from the FBI.

597
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,600
We have credit card
receipts

598
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,300
showing that you gave Marni
Hunter climbing lessons.

599
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,900
If anyone could talk
the FBI

600
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,800
into getting a refund,
it's Marni.

601
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,000
She's dead.

602
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,400
What?

603
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Oh, my God.

604
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,600
What happened?

605
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,400
She was found in a ventilation
shaft beneath the city.

606
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,300
Did she fall?

607
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,900
We told her
not to go down there.

608
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,200
It's way too dangerous.

609
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,400
Marni's dead? That's... God.

610
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
We gave her
some climbing lessons

611
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,300
and rappelling,

612
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,300
but definitely not enough

613
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,700
for her to go spelunking
on her own.

614
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,200
Did you ever go into the tunnels
with her?

615
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
No, no way.

616
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
The whole point of rock climbing

617
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,600
is to head for the sky, right?

618
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
She ever ask you to?

619
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,000
Yes, yes, she did.

620
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,500
She was doing some sort

621
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
of documentary and...

622
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,800
God, she fell?

623
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,200
That's what we're investigating.

624
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,100
You seem pretty shook up.

625
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,800
Well, yeah, somebody you know
dies, that's...

626
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,700
I'm sorry, sir,
but I got to ask.

627
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,300
Were you and Marni intimate?

628
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,900
Yeah, we-we had a thing,
but we broke up.

629
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,100
She had a fiancé

630
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,700
and I was always
very clear that I didn't

631
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,300
want to marry anyone.

632
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,000
But... I liked her.

633
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
God, this is terrible.

634
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,800
Did her fiancé know about you?

635
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,700
I don't know.

636
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,500
I can't believe this.

637
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,600
Yes, I was aware
there was another guy.

638
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,500
Marni was never sneaky.

639
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Did you know
who it was?

640
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,600
No.

641
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,000
She told me it was over.

642
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,900
Romantic triangle-

643
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,500
it makes for a pretty
compelling motive.

644
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,500
You mean for me?

645
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,200
I didn't kill Marni.

646
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,100
She was sleeping
with another man.

647
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,800
Why didn't you tell us that
your wedding was called off?

648
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Because it's humiliating.

649
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Make you angry?

650
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,200
Of course it made me angry

651
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,600
and depressed,

652
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,400
made me question my manhood, all that.

653
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,200
What do you want
from me?

654
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,900
I didn't kill Marni.

655
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,100
She always came back to me.

656
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,600
But this wasn't the first time
she found someone else.

657
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,800
No.

658
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,100
Okay, Bones, the fact
that she was sleeping around,

659
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,200
that's going
to make it tougher.

660
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,000
Why?

661
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,700
Mythical treasure
versus actual jealous men?

662
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,700
That's stupid.

663
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,900
No, it's not
stupid, Bones, okay?

664
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Jealousy is probably
the oldest motive for murder

665
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,300
in the world.

666
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Any man getting involved
with a woman like Marni

667
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,200
should know that she's
adventurous and independent.

668
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,700
Man, that's horrible
coffee.

669
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah, with
a cheating heart?

670
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,600
Well, if she didn't
hide anything.

671
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,900
She was direct
and honest.

672
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
Bones, I mean
you do realize

673
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,100
that you are discussing
motive right now?

674
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,500
Psychology,
not hard evidence.

675
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,700
It won't happen again.

676
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,800
We really need you

677
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
to show us where you
got this, Harold.

678
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,900
It's only safe on this side
of the perimeter.

679
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Then just take us there.

680
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,800
Take us to the perimeter

681
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,200
and you point the rest
of the way.

682
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
No.

683
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,700
Harold,

684
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,700
those people
you live with,

685
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,200
they depend on you.

686
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,200
What about them?

687
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
It's up to you
to keep them safe.

688
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,700
You know, you don't
have to live down here.

689
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,300
There are alternatives.

690
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,700
No, not for me.

691
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
You're hiding.

692
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,900
You have to face
your demons.

693
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,100
Living here, this
is the only way I can pay

694
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,800
so I won't have to go to
hell for what I've done.

695
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,900
Harold, there are programs
that help people like you.

696
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,200
And what are
people like me?

697
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
Mentally ill.

698
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Whoa, Bones, simmer down,
all right?

699
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
You might want to just,
you know,

700
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
sidle up to the issue
a little easier.

701
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
I like it.

702
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
Someone's honest,
says the truth.

703
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,600
You don't lie,
I guess.

704
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,800
No, I don't lie.

705
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,600
Agent Booth and I
would be glad to help you.

706
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
This is as far
as I go.

707
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,800
It doesn't have
to be that way.

708
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,100
No, Bones, he means
this is the perimeter.

709
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,800
This is as far
as he agreed to take us.

710
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,900
Beyond this
it's not safe.

711
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,700
How much farther to where
you found the medallion?

712
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,600
You'll see.
It's down there.

713
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,500
You stay here,
all right?

714
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,200
Between one soldier
to another?

715
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,100
You got my back.

716
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,000
I never left my men.

717
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,400
Hmm, cave-in.

718
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,200
Dead end.

719
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,800
We came all the way
down here for nothing.

720
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,300
This is a very old skeleton.

721
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,500
Male, mid-30s.

722
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,600
There's no clothing because
it simply rotted away.

723
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,500
Buttons. Bone for the shirt,
pewter for the pants.

724
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
Brass eyelets
for the boots.

725
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,700
Belt buckle also pewter.

726
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,100
This is a half-inch button

727
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,000
from the Union Army
Corps of Engineers.

728
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,800
By Union Army you mean...

729
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,300
Civil War.

730
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,200
<i>That plus the fact</i>

731
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,500
that Hodgins found diamond dust
on this skeleton, too?

732
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,000
I think Marni Hunter was killed
in a Civil War era tunnel.

733
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,400
These pellets
are commonly known

734
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,800
as birdshot.

735
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,900
Pellet size 12, 0.73 inches
in diameter, made of lead.

736
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,500
Also Civil War vintage.

737
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,500
The spread pattern suggests
not a shotgun,

738
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
but a muzzle-loaded
pistol like a LeMat.

739
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,500
If you don't mind
some conjecture.

740
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,100
You're the boss.

741
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
This fellow knew

742
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
something of value
was being stored.

743
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,000
Came down with an accomplice.

744
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,600
I apologize. I've been hanging
around Booth way too much.

745
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,200
It's a valid hypothesis.

746
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,800
No doubt one of many.

747
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,500
They argued.

748
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,000
One killed the other
for the treasure.

749
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,500
Doesn't that mean the vault
will be empty

750
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,200
when we find it?

751
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Oh, my God, they got me, too.

752
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,300
If the vault had
been looted years ago,

753
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,100
the artifacts would have
surfaced, been sold off.

754
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,300
It must have
still been down there.

755
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,300
I'll pull all the city plans
from the mid-19th century

756
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,100
to the present.

757
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,200
We have to save
what we can.

758
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,700
Is there any way to discover
who these bastards are?

759
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,500
Zack,

760
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,400
take a cast of
Marni Hunter's skull.

761
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,000
See if we can be specific
about the murder weapon.

762
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,700
Booth thought Harold
could give you

763
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,300
enough for a sketch
of the blonde woman.

764
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,300
You said
he was suspicious.

765
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,500
What if I can't get him
to trust me.

766
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,800
You nervous?

767
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,200
I'm not nervous.
I'm scared.

768
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,200
I don't know how
to talk to crazy people

769
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,700
unless I'm dating them.

770
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm not sure he's
actually clinically insane.

771
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,900
Okay. I don't know how
to talk to people

772
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,900
who live underground
and who might have tossed

773
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,400
a documentary filmmaker
down a hole.

774
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,100
Just be honest
with him, Ang.

775
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,600
Treat him with respect.

776
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,200
You're good at that.

777
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,500
You're scared of me.

778
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,700
Yes.

779
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,200
Why?

780
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,400
You live underground.

781
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,700
Yes, I find it
very bright up here.

782
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,900
How does this work?

783
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,400
Um, you tell me what
the blonde looks like

784
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,800
and I draw her.

785
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,200
You mean, like height,
weight, hair color?

786
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,500
Yeah. Yeah, but more.

787
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,700
More?

788
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Yes, you know,
how she seemed to you.

789
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,800
You know, your, uh,

790
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,200
your impressions.

791
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,800
Her eyes are dead.

792
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,000
Like she sees you and doesn't
at the same time.

793
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You mean like that?

794
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Yeah.

795
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,500
Her mouth was small.

796
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,500
Stern. Little...

797
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,600
The mold filled in

798
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,000
the missing sections
of the skull.

799
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,100
It shows the entry point
of the injury

800
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,300
has a very distinctive
shape.

801
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,600
Enlarge the image.

802
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,900
It's a "T."

803
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,700
It's not a knife or a hammer
that I've seen before.

804
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,000
Okay, make a list
of possible implements

805
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,500
using the size
and force of the damage.

806
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,000
Marni Hunter's fiancee
found some raw footage

807
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,900
of her documentary.

808
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,000
A dark labyrinth, a warren
of tunnels and fissures,

809
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,900
forgotten coal cellars,
sewer lines, storm drains,

810
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,600
sub-basements, access shafts,
easements and crawlspaces,

811
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,400
some as old as the city itself.

812
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,600
Why would anyone
venture down here?

813
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,100
Bones, I thought
she worked alone.

814
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,500
Who's running
the camera?

815
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,600
...shelter for a place to hide
from the evils of the world.

816
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,700
Others are looking
for treasure.

817
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,600
Look, she might have started
out to make a documentary

818
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,000
about the homeless,
but she wound up

819
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,400
using Harold
so that she could

820
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,000
loot the treasure.

821
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,100
Doesn't mean
she deserves to die.

822
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
And who are these
treasure hunters?

823
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,600
Not the homeless who scrounge
for bits of metal.

824
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,200
Some are Civil War enthusiasts.

825
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,700
And some are remarkably
handsome adventurers.

826
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,000
I am so sorry.

827
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,300
They said they never
went underground.

828
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,600
This son of a bitch, he's lied to us, huh?

829
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
The murder weapon is a kind

830
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,700
of
sharp-edged instrument

831
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,200
with a handle, not a hatchet.

832
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,200
Those climbers haven't been
back to their apartment

833
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,500
since we talked
to them last.

834
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,900
I think the murder weapon
was a climbing axe.

835
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,800
How about this:

836
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,900
while exploring those tunnels
with Marni Hunter,

837
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
those climbers, they find
something valuable.

838
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,800
Marni wants to
put it in her film,

839
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,700
those climbers, they want
to take it for themselves.

840
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,300
Wham on the head,
smack down the shaft.

841
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,100
Logical to think
they're down there now

842
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
emptying out that vault.

843
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
That was a total bust.

844
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Harold couldn't provide you
with a description?

845
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Yeah, he provided me with
a description all right.

846
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,300
That's the blonde
that Harold

847
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,800
keeps seeing in the tunnel?
See, this is what happens

848
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,500
when you ask for information
from the mentally ill.

849
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,900
Where did you get that?

850
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,300
I drew it.

851
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,600
That, Ms. Montenegro,
is a Raeburn.

852
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,600
Sir Henry Raeburn

853
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
painted a number of
these studies,

854
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
extremely rare now.

855
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,000
Very valuable.

856
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,900
There.

857
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,200
Hmph. Damn, I'm good.

858
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,700
<i>Miss Eleanor Urquhart</i> painted
in 1793 by Sir Henry Raeburn.

859
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,100
Missing since 1862.

860
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,500
Worth over $200,000.

861
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,800
If Harold saw that
underground,

862
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,700
he's seen the inside
of the vault.

863
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,800
Let's go.

864
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,300
Booth.

865
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,400
It's a labyrinth down there.

866
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,300
You can't blunder around
in the dark looking for them.

867
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,300
Maybe you won't have to.

868
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,300
I entered all the modern
and historical city plans,

869
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,300
including ventilation shafts
and tunnels,

870
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,100
plus the newer schematics.

871
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,200
There's also oral accounts
of tunnel construction

872
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,000
and underground passages.

873
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,300
Wow.

874
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
All that exists
under the city?

875
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,900
Yes. What we can corroborate.

876
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,500
Good point, Bones,

877
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,300
you know, not rushing off
to find those guys.

878
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,100
How accurate is this?

879
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,900
Blue is modern,
near 100% accurate.

880
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,500
Yellow is historical.

881
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,900
Estimate 80%.

882
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,700
Red represents less exact

883
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,100
renderings from stories,
memoirs,

884
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,600
accounts from city workers...

885
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,600
Unfortunately,
if this treasure exists,

886
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,300
it probably exists in one of
the red tunnels.

887
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,500
Well, we found that Civil War
victim near a cave-in.

888
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,700
Maybe the treasure's
on the other side?

889
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,700
Inductive,
reductive or deductive?

890
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Deductive.

891
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,500
As you wish.

892
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,700
Ms. Montenegro, please

893
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,500
remove all tunnels
containing power, cable

894
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,100
or utility lines.

895
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,700
And fiber optics.
Yes...

896
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,700
also steam tunnels
and transit access?

897
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,300
Oh, what about diamond dust?

898
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,800
You said that there
was diamond dust

899
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,300
in the old tunnels.

900
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,600
There was also diamond dust
on the Civil War guy...

901
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
So... what?

902
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,700
I'm not allowed to help now?

903
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,000
That's inductive logic.

904
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,200
We agreed on deductive.

905
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,900
I'm sorry, I'm just, you know,

906
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,900
trying to think outside
your box.

907
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,700
Can you indicate where we found
Marni Hunter's body

908
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,900
and the Civil War victim?

909
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,600
'Cause, you know,
if Marni was killed

910
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,000
near the treasure
and moved,

911
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,200
and the Civil War guy

912
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,500
was murdered
by his accomplice...

913
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,000
Mm, gotcha.

914
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
Can you connect
the two bodies?

915
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,600
This one's the closest.

916
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,900
There's no way to get there.

917
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,800
Wait, can you put
some more blue lines

918
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,500
back in that area?

919
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,200
It's just a guess.

920
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,700
Throwing it
out there.

921
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,600
Sue me.

922
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,000
And connect where Marni Hunter's
body was found.

923
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,500
Somewhere along that line
is where the treasure is.

924
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,200
What's that blue line?

925
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,000
Storm sewer.

926
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,100
H-15B.

927
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,200
The weapon was a Hanks

928
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,000
climbing axe.

929
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,500
This is one of the situations
where I need a gun.

930
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,000
No, you don't, okay.
We're going to have six

931
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,700
highly-trained FBI Tac Team
members do the dirty work.

932
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,300
We're just going to watch.

933
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,900
What's your 20,
Tac Team Three?

934
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,600
According to this map,
we're with you?

935
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,200
They aren't with us.

936
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,300
I realize that, Bones.

937
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,600
Re-orient,
Tac Team Three.

938
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,400
Suggest you wait
for rendezvous, Booth.

939
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,600
Ten-four,
Tac Team Three.

940
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,200
Okay, I bet tick-tock team
is here,

941
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,100
two levels above us.

942
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,700
Don't call them
tick-tock team, okay?

943
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,600
They're Tac Team.

944
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,700
It's short for tactical.

945
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Can I just have a gun
at least until they get here?

946
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,600
It's not for shooting rats.

947
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
It's for psychos
with climbing axes.

948
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,600
So what do
we do, just wait?

949
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,900
We just, uh,
we reconnoiter.

950
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,700
In.

951
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,300
Tic-Tac.

952
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Easy.

953
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,000
Watch yourself.

954
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,900
Wow.

955
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
What do we got here?

956
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,400
Tac Team Three,
this is Booth.

957
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
What's your six?

958
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,100
Stand by, Booth.

959
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,000
They're lost.

960
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,100
They're not lost.

961
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,700
What's that,
lucky quarter?

962
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,400
This could be
the missing piece

963
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,800
from Marni Hunter's skull.

964
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,400
Okay.

965
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,500
Think she was killed here?

966
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,700
That's a plausible
conclusion.

967
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,500
Don't get all gushy on me.

968
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
Tick Tock Three.

969
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,500
Did you just call us
Tick Tock?

970
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,400
Tac Team Three, standby.

971
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,300
Do you hear that?

972
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,300
Yeah.

973
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,900
That's the blonde woman.

974
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
This is locked.

975
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,600
You know what,
we got to get in there.

976
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,000
Are we waiting for
Tick Tock Three?

977
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,100
They might not
find us for a week.

978
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,500
If we go after them,
these guys will take off.

979
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,900
I want to catch them
in the act of stealing.

980
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,600
All right, we can
go in through here.

981
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
Bones, we go in there,
you are responsible

982
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,600
for whoever is on your left.

983
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,900
Okay, you put your gun on him.

984
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,700
Okay. How will I know
whether or not to shoot?

985
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,500
Wondering whether or not
to shoot, you shoot.

986
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,000
And let you do the talking.

987
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,500
Yeah,
well, I took that one for granted.

988
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,900
We should've brought
bigger bags.

989
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
FBI. Hands in the air.

990
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,200
Yeah, hands in the air.

991
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,200
We're not armed.
Everybody relax.

992
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
They don't shoot people
for trespassing.

993
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,700
They do for murder.
Put your hands on your head.

994
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,700
Do it.

995
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,100
Murder?! What murder?

996
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,000
Kyle, I'm throwing you
these restraints.

997
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,900
Put them on Duke.

998
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,600
Now.

999
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,100
How are we supposed to climb
out of here in handcuffs?

1000
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,500
Would you rather
go out in body bags?

1001
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,700
Put on the damn
restraints.

1002
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,400
Let you do the talking.
Got it.

1003
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,800
You think
we killed Marni?

1004
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,700
She was killed
with a climbing axe.

1005
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,800
Duke, sit down.

1006
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,800
Bones, give me your gun.

1007
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,600
Take the restraints
out of my belt,

1008
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,100
and put them on Kyle.

1009
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,500
That's not cocked, is it?
Because where that's pointed...

1010
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
You're safe.

1011
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,100
Marni was killed
with a climbing axe?

1012
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,900
She knew about this treasure,
she was going to put it

1013
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,800
in her documentary, would've
cost you guys a fortune.

1014
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,700
So one of you
killed her.

1015
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,100
Who's left handed?
Bones, you know,

1016
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,500
it's best to have this
sort of explanation

1017
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,300
after the bad guys
are incapacitated.

1018
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Why?

1019
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,200
You killed her for this?

1020
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,300
That's why.

1021
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,700
Yeah, well, I'll try to remember
that for next time.

1022
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,000
You single-handedly regained

1023
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,700
one of the great cultural finds
of the century.

1024
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,100
A glimpse of Civil War life.

1025
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,800
Marni Hunter wanted to document
the treasure, not steal it.

1026
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,700
So Duke killed her

1027
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,200
and threw her down
a bottomless pit.

1028
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,100
Kyle wasn't so innocent himself.

1029
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
He hit Duke in the crypt
with a candlestick.

1030
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,800
Kyle hit the Duke
with a candlestick in the crypt.

1031
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,200
That's very good.

1032
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,500
Very good.

1033
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,700
Right?

1034
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,800
What?

1035
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,000
What's the joke?

1036
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,200
Wha...?

1037
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Clue?

1038
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,200
What clue?

1039
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,800
What clue?

1040
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,000
Unbelievable, Bones.

1041
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,800
What's funny?

1042
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,600
I have no idea.

1043
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,400
Harold's being released.

1044
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,000
You found a place for him?

1045
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,300
Yes.
