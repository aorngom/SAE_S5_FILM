00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:42,837
<i>Mr. Addy,</i>
<i>your dissertation is entitled...</i>

5
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,503
"Analysis of Bone Trauma."

6
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,173
When viewed in cross section,
the pressure and force...

7
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,513
<i>exerted by the weapon can be assessed.</i>

8
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,815
Obtaining the cross section
will compromise the original bone.

9
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,652
My technique preserves
bone surface morphology...

10
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,954
through the use
of polyvinyl replication.

11
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,325
<i>A transparent positive is made</i>
<i>by covering the impression...</i>

12
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,330
<i>with an aqueous solution</i>
<i>of synthetic polymer.</i>

13
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,663
Hey, Bones. Come on. We got a body.
Went up like a Roman candle.

14
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,034
- Hey, Zack. How's it going?
- So far, they don't like me.

15
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,266
- Shocker. Let's go.
- <i>[Brennan] I'm in the middle of something.</i>

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,674
<i>You know, real-life murder and mutilation</i>
<i>versus academic claptrap, no contest.</i>

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,647
- Sorry. No offense.
- This committee can carry on
without you, Dr. Brennan.

18
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,946
- Zack, just answer the questions.
- [Booth] Yeah.

19
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,816
[Booth]
Okay, come on.

20
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,192
Next question?

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,922
How do you expect anyone
to take you seriously...

22
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,362
as a working forensic anthropologist...

23
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,833
when you look the way you do?

24
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,836
What?

25
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,240
- <i>[Brennan] Male, middle-aged.</i>
- <i>What was with Zack back there?</i>

26
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,836
Defending his dissertation.
Last step before he gets his doctorate.

27
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,813
I think these are what's left
of his intestines.

28
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,340
- Is he gonna make it?
- No. He's very dead. [Chuckles]

29
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,388
- I mean Zack.
- Ah, 50-50.

30
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,616
- He's a stoolie.
- Zack?

31
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,784
Our victim.
No, he's a rat, a snitch.

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,226
- What makes you say that?
- His guts got spilled.

33
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,729
- <i>You know, spill your guts.</i>
- <i>Very literal.</i>

34
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:16,497
Hung up there like a scarecrow on a rooftop of
a hotel used to house witnesses. It's a warning.

35
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,902
There's something jammed
down his trachea.

36
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,875
<i>[Zack] I rectified their erroneous assumptions</i>
<i>concerning polyvinyl replication.</i>

37
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,343
You corrected them?

38
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,346
- Only when they were wrong.
- [Chuckles]

39
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,348
Are the remains
ready for X-ray?

40
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,782
Yes. Maybe we'll get lucky and I.D.
the poor bastard that way.

41
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:37,084
<i>Oh, wejust got lucky.</i>

42
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,285
"My name is Garrett Delaney."

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,954
<i>There's something metallic here.</i>

44
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:49,299
<i>This is gonna turn out to be some</i>
<i>freaky, weird ritualistic thing, isn't it?</i>

45
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,303
Oh, man, I hope so.

46
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,534
Christopher Columbus.

47
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,405
- Where's Dr. Brennan?
- Her brother came for a visit.

48
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,605
Dad called you?
You're sure it was him?

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,410
He said, " You and your sister
are in danger," and he hung up.

50
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,886
I spend half my time with a sniper-trained
F.B.I. agent. I feel safe.

51
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,979
Tempe, I know someone
is watching me.

52
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,820
- What's your evidence?
- I can feel it on the back of my neck.

53
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,952
You spend some time in jail,
you develop a sixth sense.

54
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,658
- Maybe you should stay with me for a few days.
- Tempe, I have work.

55
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:26,432
- I have Amy and the girls.
- What about your sixth sense?

56
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,167
- Hey!
- What?

57
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,402
You can't not believe
in something one second...

58
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,944
- <i>and then use it against me in the next.</i>
- It's a long drive.

59
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,674
<i>You could start fresh tomorrow.</i>
<i>And I've got...</i>

60
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,478
cold beer in the fridge.

61
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,849
Don't drink the Moroccan beer.
Tastes like ear wax. How you doing, Russell?

62
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,684
- Okay, Booth. You? Good?
- Yeah. Good.

63
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,650
I still make him nervous, don't I?
Come on. Let's go.

64
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,923
Why do I always feel
like you're abducting me?

65
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,296
<i>[Booth] Yeah. It turns out our corpse</i>
<i>is a former F.B.I. agent.</i>

66
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,359
<i>Garrett Delaney, he left the F.B.I.</i>
<i>about 15 years ago.</i>

67
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,895
He's now head of security of
some big K Street lobbyist.

68
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,839
So why'd he end up
a human torch?

69
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,309
That's what we're here
to find out.

70
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:09,678
His place is much better than yours.
Ten times better.

71
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,717
<i>I told you he left public service.</i>

72
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,948
He makes, uh, more money than I.

73
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,286
<i>So that's all your dad said, huh?</i>

74
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,849
- <i>Is you're in danger?</i>
- Yes.

75
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,657
- And Russ's sixth sense agrees.
- What are you doing?

76
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,689
I've been practicing some
of the black ops stuff you taught me.

77
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,701
Let me show you.

78
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,135
<i>Every F.B.I. agent in the country</i>
<i>is looking for my father.</i>

79
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,797
Maybe he's trying
to scare us off.

80
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,569
Six months without a break
in the case, he ain't gonna be nervous.

81
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,907
- Now let me show you.
- My dad's a career criminal.

82
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,912
Just because he says that Russ
is in danger doesn't mean it's the truth.

83
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,881
Let me show you how it's done, okay?
[Kicks Door]

84
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,820
Oh. He might've
gotten it right this time.

85
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,022
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Russ.</i>

86
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,931
<i>These are all pictures of Russ.</i>

87
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,497
<i>Me at work, me and Amy.</i>
<i>This was the day before yesterday.</i>

88
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,633
Dad was right.
Somebody's watching.

89
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,905
- This is worse than watching.
- What do you mean?

90
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,605
- This is hunting.
- Hunting?

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,649
As in kill. You see these?

92
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,881
Right here. These are ranges. He's picking out
a spot from which to shoot at you.

93
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,720
- So what do I do now?
- The hunter's dead. The hunt is over, right?

94
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,021
- Anyone else know you're here?
- Only Amy.

95
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,585
Great. Call Amy and tell her
if anyone calls looking for you...

96
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,494
<i>she doesn't know where you're at.</i>

97
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:10,434
<i>You should stay with me until we find out</i>
<i>why Delaney intended to kill you.</i>

98
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,802
- How are you gonna do that?
- By figuring out who killed him.

99
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,709
<i>[Angela] This is the paper that was</i>
<i>pulled from Delaney's throat.</i>

100
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,946
<i>It was dated, signed, and initialed</i>
<i>at the bottom ofboth sides of the page.</i>

101
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,045
February 1978.

102
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,182
It looks like a cop's notebook.

103
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,125
- That makes sense except...
- <i>[Typing]</i>

104
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:39,927
<i>"I will not put an innocent man in prison</i>
<i>just because he is a political threat.</i>

105
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,934
Marvin Beckett hasn't
broken any law."

106
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,130
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Marvin Beckett?

107
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,935
Back in the '60s, Marvin
Beckett was a civil rights activist.

108
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,942
He made his bones protesting...

109
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,308
African American overrepresentation
in the Vietnam War.

110
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,281
- In '78, he was sent to prison for life.
- Why?

111
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,375
He killed an F.B.I. agent
named Gus Harper.

112
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:03,821
- Wait. Augustus Harper?
- Yeah. You know the case?

113
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,621
<i>"A ugust Harp."</i>
<i>Look. Augustus Harper.</i>

114
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,388
Oh, wow.

115
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,760
<i>This means Delaney's murder</i>
<i>has something to do...</i>

116
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,822
<i>with Marvin Beckett</i>
<i>going to prison.</i>

117
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,795
Oh, when you're good,
you are very, very good.

118
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,839
1970s, Ohio.

119
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,172
There is a task force made up
of F.B.I., state police, and local cops.

120
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,043
It goes bad. Starts taking a cut from the same
bank robbers they're supposed to be catching.

121
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,050
Then they conspire to plan a stack
of stolen money on Marvin Beckett.

122
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,450
Well, then this young agent,
right, Harper, okay?

123
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,580
He decides he can't live with that
and decides to blow the whistle.

124
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,626
- I can read.
- The same guy who's gonna blow
the whistle on them...

125
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,389
for framing Marvin Beckett
then gets murdered by Marvin Beckett?

126
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,454
Come on. Talk about
killing two birds with one stone.

127
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,125
- Who else knows about this?
- Us and you. That's it.

128
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,829
- Let's keep it that way.
- Hey, I've seen this movie.

129
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,736
- I get killed on the way home.
- Then don't go home.

130
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,036
[Chuckles]
You serious?

131
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:00,269
Thirty years ago, I was married
to Gus Harper for exactly eight months.

132
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,439
I'm not sure I can help you.

133
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,915
What about the contents of the note?

134
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,680
What do you people want?

135
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,687
The truth.

136
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,849
The last time the F.B.I.
came to talk to me...

137
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,257
they told me to keep
my mouth shut...

138
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,126
<i>or you won't get</i>
<i>your husband's death benefits.</i>

139
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,791
Your husband is a good man.
And he tried to do the right thing.

140
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,860
And he ended up dead.
I can't let that stand.

141
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,113
The F.B.I. murdered Gus.

142
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,945
Then they had
a state funeral for him...

143
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,453
complete with
the grieving widow as a centerpiece.

144
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,817
Is this your husband's handwriting?

145
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,795
Yes. He was compiling evidence.

146
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,388
- And there was more?
- <i>There was a diary...</i>

147
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,798
a dozen audiotapes, field notes.

148
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,065
- And where did Gus keep it?
- Safety-deposit box.

149
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,834
Can you tell us where
that safety-deposit box was?

150
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,468
Ohio First Savings and Loan in Dayton.

151
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,011
Excuse me one moment.

152
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,014
My parents robbed
that exact bank...

153
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:24,461
just days after
Gus Harper was killed.

154
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,657
They were looking
for that evidence.

155
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,361
That has to be why Delaney
was stalking Russ.

156
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,803
Go home. I have a few more questions
for Barbara Harper, okay?

157
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,808
You go home and you be
with your brother, all right?

158
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,468
Okay.

159
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,812
Okay.

160
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,783
- You think it's Delaney?
- <i>[Zack] Definitely.</i>

161
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,547
I hope to keep working here
when I receive my doctorate.

162
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,555
We'd all like that.

163
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,024
What did she mean when she said, " How do
you expect anyone to take you seriously?"

164
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,722
It's a comment on...

165
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,731
your deportment.

166
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,393
Dr. Brennan doesn't
care about deportment.

167
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,595
That's true.

168
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,004
But if you work here, you won't be
Brennan's grad student anymore.

169
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,703
<i>You'll be a full-blown</i>
<i>forensic anthropologist.</i>

170
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,540
Cam will be your boss.

171
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,480
In your opinion, does
deportment matter to Cam?

172
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,882
Let's just say that Cam's not
the kind of woman you catch...

173
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,386
<i>with crusties</i>
<i>in the corner ofher eye.</i>

174
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,586
Haley's six, and Emma's eight.

175
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,062
Tempe?

176
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,068
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,070
Preoccupied.

178
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,072
Tempe, if I play my cards right...

179
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,109
these little girls are gonna be your nieces
in the next couple months.

180
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,508
<i>The least you can do</i>
<i>is memorize their names.</i>

181
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,974
- They're cute.
- Haley has lung trouble.

182
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,111
They're trying to figure it out.
You ever deal with an H.M. O?

183
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,247
- If it's money, Russ, I can help.
- <i>No, forget it.</i>

184
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,691
If I'm gonna become these little girls' daddy,
I gotta man up for the job.

185
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,628
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- That's not rational.

186
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,961
<i>I'm a good mechanic.</i>
<i>I'll take care of my own.</i>

187
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,294
Gus Harper's service history.
Okay?

188
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,668
Graduated top half of his class
in Quantico.

189
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:18,642
He was assigned to theJoint State-Federal
Bank Robbery Task Force. Right there.

190
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,909
- The victim.
- Back when he was Special Agent
Delaney supervising Gus Harper.

191
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,109
- The guy that was hunting me?
- <i>That's right.</i>

192
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,551
Okay, here's a list of the bank robbers
with their F.B.I. code names.

193
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,613
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Dad's code name was Columbus.</i>

194
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,319
Yeah. Lewis, Clark...

195
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,988
Magellan, Cook, Columbus.

196
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,964
All named after explorers.

197
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,432
That's Mom and Dad.

198
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,595
- Every one of these people are deceased.
- Except for Dad.

199
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,799
Delaney was killed to send
a message to the F.B.I.

200
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,072
This Columbus coin was found
in the victim's mouth.

201
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,841
Columbus shot a man
in the head...

202
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,179
hung him from a pole...

203
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,912
gutted him,
and set him on fire.

204
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,987
And Columbus is our father.

205
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,672
<i>[Russ]</i>
<i>Dad had it under control.</i>

206
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,040
- I mean, for 15 years everything was fine until...
- Until what?

207
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,103
Dad left you a message.
He said, "Stop looking." You didn't.

208
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,341
So this is my fault?

209
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,112
Well, consequences
aren't the same as fault.

210
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,710
My parole officer
is very philosophical.

211
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,986
Well, all we have is a voice tape
of Dad saying, "Back off"...

212
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,257
and a little silver dolphin
that I found at Mom's grave.

213
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,798
That's as far as
the investigation has gone.

214
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,494
- According to Booth.
- What? Booth and I are partners.

215
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,559
Tempe, he's F.B.I.
You aren't.

216
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:55,767
You're the daughter of a career criminal
and the sister of a loser on parole.

217
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,832
What?

218
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,401
I wouldn't let anyone else
call you a loser, Russ.

219
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,743
What makes you think
you're allowed?

220
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,749
I love you too.

221
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,752
What you're asking is the kind
of thing that destroys careers.

222
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,690
From the time I was a little girl,
I dreamed of putting bad men in jail.

223
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,490
Put that back. Which is why I became
an Assistant United States Attorney.

224
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,088
- You don't have to help me.
- Of course I have to help you!

225
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,101
Marvin Beckett is still a hero
to a lot of African Americans.

226
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,603
Some of us never believed
he killed this F.B.I. boy.

227
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:29,004
Now you buy me breakfast, tell me you
found a way to clear his name...

228
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,907
release him out of wrongful incarceration
after 30 years?

229
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,104
I cannot walk away,
which you already know!

230
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,546
- Maybe you should have some more coffee.
- Of course I want more coffee.

231
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,379
- We have to come up with our plan of attack.
- I was thinking Judge Moran...

232
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:43,353
We should exhume Gus Harper.
See if your genius scientist partner...

233
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:47,290
can ascertain whether he died in the manner
the F.B.I. said he died 30 years ago.

234
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,953
- Moran's got a long...
- No. We want Kemper.

235
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:55,057
- "Hang 'em High" Kemper?
- I'm ruining my career,
I'm doing it my way, understand?

236
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,729
<i>Now, take a doughnut hole.</i>
<i>I'm offering.</i>

237
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,569
Thanks.

238
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,668
This was lodged in Garrett
Delaney's sinus cavity.

239
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,043
.22 caliber.

240
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:13,983
These dimples indicate that the bullet
ricocheted around inside the cranium.

241
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,146
Are you worried
about your doctorate?

242
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:20,818
No. Dr. Grayson touched me
with an open hand on the shoulder.

243
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,827
You mean inappropriately?

244
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,988
No. I read a book
on body language.

245
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,227
<i>Apparently in our culture, when an older male</i>
<i>lays an open hand on a younger male...</i>

246
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,234
it conveys approval.

247
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:34,739
But if he bumps younger male
with a closed fist, it conveys doubt.

248
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:39,574
Dr. Grayson went like this,
not like this.

249
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,448
Like this.

250
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,417
Not like this.

251
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,488
Dr. Grayson is elderly and arthritic.

252
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,855
Perhaps he simply needed help
getting to his feet like this.

253
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:58,363
<i>Dr. Brennan, visitors in your office.</i>

254
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,600
Tempe, this is a friend of Dad's.

255
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:11,336
<i>Father Coulter is Toby Coulter,</i>
<i>train trestle guy.</i>

256
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,810
Oh, yeah.
I remember that story.

257
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,212
When Dad and his friend accidentally
blew up a train trestle.

258
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,615
Come on. How do you accidentally
blow up a train trestle?

259
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:24,019
<i>Well, we were hired by a farmer</i>
<i>to dynamite the ice offhis stock pond.</i>

260
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,523
<i>We get this competition going</i>
<i>who's gonna slide the dynamite...</i>

261
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,685
farther across the ice
before it blows.

262
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,628
<i>You know it's a federal offense</i>
<i>to blow up a train trestle, Father.</i>

263
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,756
I mean, even if it is accidental.

264
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,563
Father Toby Coulter,
meet my partner, Seeley Booth.

265
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,571
- Careful. He's F.B.I.
- Ooh. Well, I'm innocent.

266
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,164
It was Max's toss that brought
the trestle down.

267
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,302
<i>Max Keenan's best friend</i>
<i>grows up to be a priest.</i>

268
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,074
I'm sure your people have
that fact on file somewhere.

269
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,640
Tempe, Father Coulter
has a message from Dad.

270
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,583
It's a private message.

271
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,053
Come to my office.

272
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:05,229
She's just gonna tell Agent Booth anyway.
Might as well let him listen.

273
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,061
"Back off."
That's the message.

274
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,933
- <i>He said you'd understand.</i>
- <i>[Booth] Where'd you see him?</i>

275
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,406
- In confession.
- We're not Catholic.

276
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,605
Oh, the sanctity of the confessional
is extended to all.

277
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,772
Um, did he ever call you
on your cell phone, Father?

278
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,873
Two days ago.

279
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,078
- <i>Can I see your phone?</i>
- You want to trace the call?

280
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,747
Yeah.

281
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,884
<i>So, uh, Max Keenan,</i>
<i>he come to you for absolution?</i>

282
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,019
Well, I'm sure you know
the requirements for confession.

283
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,530
Contrition and intent
not to repeat the sin.

284
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,762
<i>And Max doesn't have either.</i>
<i>And as a priest, I failed him.</i>

285
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,532
I never was able to get him
to walk the straight and narrow.

286
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,698
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

287
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,971
Well, he was angry.
He felt his hand had been forced.

288
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,978
<i>Where can we reach you, Father?</i>

289
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,037
Father Coulter's staying
at St. Augustine Seminary...

290
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,049
for the next few days
before heading back to Ohio.

291
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,551
Here, Father.

292
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,917
Your father loves you.

293
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,081
Is that part of Dad's message?

294
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,058
That's a personal observation.

295
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,969
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Delaney's murder, the threats on Russ's life...</i>

296
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,908
<i>this is all happening now</i>
<i>because of a little metal dolphin...</i>

297
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,445
we found on your mother's grave.

298
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,313
F.B.I. field unit in Denver traced it
to a local artist in Mead, Colorado.

299
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,647
Who identified Dad as the buyer.

300
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,153
But Delaney left the F.B.I.
15 years ago.

301
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,917
- And somebody told him about your dad.
- And didn't tell you?

302
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,289
- They're part of the conspiracy.
- You must be annoyed.

303
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,521
You know what? I am.
And I don't like finding out...

304
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,723
there's a dirty F.B.I. agent
in this building.

305
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,659
Here's what I think happened.
Delaney goes to your father.

306
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,898
He asks him to hand over
the evidence.

307
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,372
He doesn't do it,
he kills you or Russ.

308
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,002
Dad calls Russ to warn him.

309
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,012
And then kills Delaney.

310
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,049
Guts him, burns him,
leaves a calling card.

311
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,107
Don't mess with
Max Keenan's kids.

312
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,779
Am I supposed to like that?

313
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:13,917
No, Bones. I'll take a stand-up crook over
a crooked cop any day of the week.

314
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,825
<i>Booth, I got us a meet</i>
<i>with thejudge. Let's go.</i>

315
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,058
And you better get back to your lab
in case we're successful.

316
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,193
- I just find it best to do what she says.
- Okay.

317
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:28,305
<i>You want to exhume the young F.B.I. agent</i>
<i>that Marvin Beckett murdered?</i>

318
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,307
That's correct, Your Honor.

319
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,402

<i>arguing against this writ, Judge Kemper.</i>

322
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,187
- On behalf of...
- The F.B.I.

323
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,818
- I thought you were F.B. I?
- I am, Your Honor.

324
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,727
I told you.
A big, noisy mess.

325
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,164
<i>All right. Let's hear your argument,</i>
<i>Mr. Burridge.</i>

326
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,260
This is a precipitant exhumation
in a highly inflammatory case.

327
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,397
The evidence to which Miss Julian
alludes has not been authenticated.

328
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,340
It has been authenticated
by theJeffersonian Institution.

329
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,378
The F.B.I. would like to do their own
in-house analysis before proceeding.

330
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,438
Of course they would. They're the ones
who did the framing 30 years ago.

331
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,349
- I take exception to that.
- <i>Why? You weren't even born 30 years ago.</i>

332
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,682
- Judge...
- Not like me and Judge Kemper...

333
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,882
<i>who got to see firsthand</i>
<i>what Marvin Beckett was really like.</i>

334
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:24,020
Miss Julian, did you bring this to me
because I knew Marvin Beckett personally?

335
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,190
Did you? I wasn't aware
of that, Your Honor.

336
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,962
Were you aware of that,
Agent Booth?

337
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,869
<i>We'd like to do this slowly</i>
<i>and carefully, Judge. That's all.</i>

338
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,908
And we want to exhume Gus Harper
so we can make sure...

339
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,967
<i>he was murdered in exactly</i>
<i>the way the damn F.B. I...</i>

340
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,809
said he was murdered, Your Honor.

341
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,784

<i>Also present at the post-exhumation</i>
<i>autopsy is Dr. Temperance Brennan.</i>

350
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,577
<i>The original autopsy in 1978</i>
<i>found that Agent Harper...</i>

351
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,914
<i>was killed when he was shot</i>
<i>three times at close range...</i>

352
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,978
<i>by a.38 Colt Detective</i>
<i>Special revolver.</i>

353
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,116
<i>Two shots to the chest,</i>
<i>one piercing the heart.</i>

354
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,251
The other, the left lung.

355
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:33,662
The third,
a shot to the frontal bone.

356
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,863
- What?
- That bullet hole in the head, that's from a.38.

357
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:43,339
- Just like the coroner said.
- I can already tell these two holes...

358
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,172
are from something a whole lot bigger
than a snub-nosed revolver.

359
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,305
<i>Something more like a rifle</i>
<i>that a sniper would use.</i>

360
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,681
Zack, you'd better get a full set of X-rays
before Dr. Saroyan reopens.

361
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,620
We're gonna conduct this one
like the whole world is watching.

362
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,861
- Hey, Russ.
- Okay, I'm here. What's up?

363
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,059
<i>You know, you're an idiot, Russ.</i>

364
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:12,069
I like you,
but you're a real idiot.

365
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,799
- <i>What'd I do?</i>
- I got a call from your parole officer today.

366
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,704
Why?

367
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,869
Why? Because you crossed
state lines without informing him.

368
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,005
I just told him you were aiding
in an F.B.I. investigation.

369
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,072
Thanks.

370
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,852
You're slipping, aren't ya?

371
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,979
Look, I want to marry Amy
and raise her kids.

372
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,320
One of them is sick.
That costs money.

373
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,759
I'm a felon on parole.
I work part-time as a mechanic.

374
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:41,026
You tell me what job am I gonna get that lets me
be the man I need to be to raise a family?

375
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,502
You got this sick little girl
depending on you. I get that.

376
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,529
But you go back inside and you cross
that line, you're not helping anyone out.

377
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,270
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- <i>[Woman Screams]</i>

378

[Woman On TV] Civil rights activist

00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,220

00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,288
on his alleged victim,
F.B.I. Agent Gus Harper...

383
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:19,963
revealed inconsistencies with details
of Mr. Beckett's trial back in 1979.

384
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,972
<i>[Coulter]</i>
<i>What kind of inconsistencies?</i>

385
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,804
You have your confidences
to keep, Father. I have mine.

386
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,810
<i>Well, it's over, right?</i>

387
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,813
I mean, now that it's out,
there's no reason to kill Russ.

388
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,543
You know, the men behind this,
they don't care about Marvin Beckett.

389
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,916
- <i>They care about being exposed.</i>
- Lucky you were together.

390
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,753
- <i>Why were you together?</i>
- Oh, you know, a man's gotta eat.

391
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:44,990
<i>To think that some people still refuse</i>
<i>to believe in guardian angels.</i>

392
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,826
Booth!

393
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,728
- Who's that?
- <i>[Booth] Deputy Director Kirby.</i>

394
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,567
My boss's boss's boss.

395
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:02,273
- You're what's known as a real
pain in the ass, Agent Booth.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,009
I just had my testicles
handed to me...

397
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,520
by the attorney general of
the United States of America.

398
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,421
He wanted to know why
this Marvin Beckett issue...

399
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,619
wasn't done slowly and carefully
with greater forethought and tact.

400
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,093
- <i>You know what I told him?</i>
- No, sir.

401
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,528
I told him I did not know.

402
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,089
Sir, I had to do it the way
I did it because the F.B. I...

403
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,658
Not your decision, Booth.

404
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,802
You're suspended without pay.

405
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,843
Gun, I.D., security card, please.

406
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,470
Sir, I'm entitled to the reading
of the charges against me.

407
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:38,038
The charges against you...

408
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,449
are that I was pissed upon
from a very great height!

409
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,216
You're out of here in 10 minutes.

410
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,655
<i>Can they do that? Just kick you out</i>
<i>without any warning?</i>

411
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,790
The two guys standing behind me
with the guns seemed to think so.

412
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:58,233
As you can see, Harper's ribs and sternum
were practically obliterated...

413
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,294
<i>by the two shots</i>
<i>to his torso.</i>

414
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,499
Zack, Booth got fired.

415
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:06,533
- Suspended, not fired.
- Suspended's F.B.I. speak for fired.

416
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,637
Do you know what hurts the most?
They took the car. I got no wheels.

417
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,148
<i>The bullets themselves</i>
<i>were removed from the body.</i>

418
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,846
- But Hodgins found some very small fragments.
- Copper, lead, polymer.

419
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,855
I mean,
this is a conspiracy, baby.

420
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,359
Guys, what we're dealing with here is that Booth
won't be working with us anymore.

421
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:26,693
<i>Well, I got my own gun. It's just, God,</i>
<i>why did they have to take the company car?</i>

422
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,756
I assume that the only way
Booth can get his car back...

423
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,098
would be to solve the case
on his own and that we'd help.

424
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,899
Oh, no. No, no.
I can't let you guys do that.

425
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,373
Anyone who wants to help Booth,
raise their hands.

426
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:47,118
<i>All right, I reverse engineered to find the</i>
<i>most likely design of the bullets.</i>

427
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:51,053
After the bullet spread, lead pellets
were released like buckshot.

428
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,182
Wait a second. That's a homemade round
invented back in the '70s.

429
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,751
- We're talking a military-issue
M-40 A-1 sniper rifle.
- Nice.

430
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:02,266
Dude, what you call being a conspiracy theorist,
I call being well-informed.

431
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,633
Wait. Gus Harper was murdered
by a military sniper?

432
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,606
- Who makes his own rounds.
- Maybe we could compare it
to the bullet that grazed Russ.

433
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,801
I'm a civilian.
We don't have access to that round.

434
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,937
<i>Maybe Caroline can help us.</i>

435
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,476
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>You still have a job?</i>

436
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,280
Not for long.
I'm on performance review.

437
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,289
None of the F.B.I. members of the Bank Robbery
Task Force had sniper training in the '70s.

438
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,985
I need to know who else
was on that task force. Local...

439
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,152
- Booth! Booth! I got it figured out.
- State cops, A.T.F.

440
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,425
And if any of'em had sniper training.
Once you find out, you keep your head down.

441
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:37,434
Task force, sniper training,
'70s, duck. Got it.

442
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:41,165
- I figured out a way to solve
the case and get your job back.
- Wow. That'd be great.

443
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:45,141
We need my father to give us the rest of the
evidence he stole from that safety-deposit box.

444
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,677
- Great.
- I'll drive.

445
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:52,115
Dr. Saroyan, when I get my doctorate,
I'd like to work here.

446
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,811
Zack, you are
an excellent scientist.

447
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,415
<i>But an important part of thejob</i>
<i>is appearing as an expert witness in court.</i>

448
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,926
- Ooh.
- "Ooh," what?

449
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,519
<i>Jurors have to take you seriously.</i>
<i>And frankly...</i>

450
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:10,625
you look like a weekend fill-in
at a college radio station.

451
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:16,273
Truth hurts, dude. Learn from it and grow.
[Chuckles]

452
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,075
You weren't able to find Max by tracing him
through the cell phone call he made to me?

453
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,207
Call came over the Internet.
It was untraceable.

454
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,912
Well, Max always
did things his way.

455
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,455
Guess your being a priest didn't
have much of an affect on him.

456
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:35,983
Son, I spent my whole life
trying to turn Max's life toJesus.

457
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,325
He knows exactly one Bible verse.

458
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,297
<i>Numbers 35: 19.</i>

459
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,069
"The revenger of blood himself
shall slay the murderer.

460
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,662
When he meeteth him,
he shall slay him."

461
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,834
- What's that mean?
- That's the law of the jungle.

462
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,971
Father Coulter, if my father
makes contact with you again...

463
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,311
please tell him
he needs to trust me.

464
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,250
His way got my mother murdered
and almost got Russ killed.

465
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,220
- It's time he tried my way.
- He won't contact me again.

466
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,656
- Well, how do you know?
- Ask him.

467
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,694
<i>He put me under surveillance.</i>

468
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,232
If a parish priest can figure out
the F.B.I. is watching him...

469
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,566
so can an experienced
fugitive like your father.

470
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,847
I need a makeover.

471
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,720
[Sighs] Zack, I am a big believer
in people being themselves.

472
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,055
<i>You're actually</i>
<i>kind of cute.</i>

473
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,220
Yes. I've been told that many times.

474
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,627
Usually followed by the word "but."

475
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,633
In this case,
"But no one takes you seriously."

476
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,396
I need help, Angela.

477
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,642
So, what do I do first?

478
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,113
Lose the floppy hair.

479
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,421
[Groans]

480
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,925
- Why are you mad at me?
- [Sighs] I need a gun.

481
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,624
No, you don't. You got me.
I'm your gun. You want equipment?

482
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:25,068
Here. Have these. All right? New division of labor.
I shoot 'em, you cuff'em.

483
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,434
Why didn't you tell me
you had Father Coulter under surveillance?

484
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,167
It is my job to find your dad
and put him in prison.

485
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,641
- And you don't think I'll help.
- <i>He's your father.</i>

486
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,077
I really don't think I should
have to ask you to help.

487
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,513
He abandoned me, Booth. And that's
the best thing you can say about him.

488
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,517
Your father lives by a certain code.

489
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:44,180
And part of that code is defending
his family by whatever means necessary.

490
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,621
You mean killing people
and setting their corpses on fire?

491
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,455
- "Any means necessary" sort of covers that.
- You respect him?

492
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,586
I'm just saying in his world,
he's a very honorable man.

493
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,632
That's ridiculous.
There's only one world. It's this one.

494
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,860
Would that be the one world where you're mad
at me for trying to catch your father?

495
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,130
- Or the other world where you
actually want him caught?
- Neither.

496
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,764
- You have to pick one.
- Either. Both.

497
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,331
<i>Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth...</i>

498
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:09,108
I thought you'd like to meet the reason
we're all losing our jobs and getting shot at.

499
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,978
This is Mr. Marvin Beckett.

500
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,814
- I wanted to thank you personally.
- You're welcome, Mr. Beckett.

501
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:19,721
<i>Thirty years ago, crooked agents put me</i>
<i>in jail for something I did not do.</i>

502
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:24,125
I did not kill the young F.B.I. agent.
I did not steal the money.

503
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,026
<i>And I thank you for proving it</i>
<i>to the world.</i>

504
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:30,693
That's why I'm here to tell you
to your face, to assure you...

505
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,737
I did not do those things.

506
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,738
<i>You freed an innocent man.</i>

507
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:39,004
And in return,
I must warn you...

508
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:42,376
the people that did this to me
aren't just a bunch of corrupt cops.

509
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:46,383
<i>They serve masters</i>
<i>of much greater influence.</i>

510
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,477
You're looking to bring
their world down around their ears.

511
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,488
They will strike at you.

512
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,286
Watch yourselves.

513
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,188
Here's your list of snipers
from the decade of disco.

514
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:03,030
This time I'm advising you.
Duck.

515
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,999
- Anyone you know?
- Yeah.

516
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:12,236
The A.T.F. rep on the task force
was a marine sniper, Robert Kirby.

517
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,608
F.B.I. Deputy Director
Robert Kirby?

518
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,705
That just suspended you?

519
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,114
Call your brother,
tell him to get out of the house.

520
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:23,086
- <i>Tell him to get out now.</i>
- Why? What's going on?

521
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,622
Seconds after Caroline got this list,
Kirby knew about it.

522
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,853
He's not answering.
I don't understand, Booth.

523
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,896
It's not us that Kirby is afraid of.
It's your father.

524
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,932
The only way to strike at him
is to go through you or Russ.

525
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,799
- <i>Kirby was the one that took a shot at Russ.</i>
- No answer.

526
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,736
- Russ?
- Hello?

527
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,297
- All right, just stay back.
- Russ?

528
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:48,334
- There's no sign of a break-in.
I'll check the back. Russ?
- <i>Russ?</i>

529
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,309
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

530
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,648
- Booth?
- <i>What?</i>

531
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,918
- <i>Russ.</i>
- Just take it easy, all right?
We don't know that for sure.

532
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:04,951
That's too much blood. Nobody could
survive that... that much blood loss.

533
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,020
Nobody.

534
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,826
All right. Okay.
It's all right.

535
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,894
Oh, my God.

536
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,944
It's against the law
us not calling in a murder.

537
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,984
It wasn't a murder.
It was a bloodstain.

538
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:31,147
That much blood,
it's mur... it's murder.

539
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:36,455
We call it in, the next thing
is we find ourselves under arrest.

540
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,461
That had to be Russ's blood.

541
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:42,795
You got a sample, right?
We'll check the D.N.A. at the lab.

542
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:46,701
Until then, who's the one who always says,
"Don't jump to conclusions"? Right?

543
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:50,138
Yeah, you're right.

544
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,699
Thanks.

545
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:55,940
I wish you wouldn't keep letting
me hug you when I get scared.

546
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,381
Hey, when I get scared,
I'll hug you.

547
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,112
<i>We'll call it even.</i>

548
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,885
- <i>Results?</i>
- The blood's not Russ's.

549
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,689
- Even you can't do a D.N.A. test that fast.
- Didn't have to.

550
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,027
Both Brennan and her brother
are "O" type blood, as was the mother.

551
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,692
The blood sample
you brought me was "AB."

552
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,861
- Therefore...
- Okay, let's go tell Bones.

553
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,337
I just saw her.
She's on her way to see the priest.

554
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,374
- Why?
- He said he had something for her.

555
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,501
She can't be going places without me.
Not when it's open season on Brennans.

556
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,977
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- Bones?

557
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,311
[Caroline]
Not even close, <i>chéri.</i> We need to talk.

558
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,146
Well, first, I want to tell you
that your brother...

559
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:38,245
is, uh, with his father.

560
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,315
You mean... with God?

561
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:45,453
No, his earthly father...
your father.

562
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,159
- Are you certain?
- Saw it with my own eyes.

563
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,167
Oh, thank God.

564
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,671
Which I use only
as a figure of speech.

565
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,867
Well, you have
to start somewhere.

566
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,640
You know, you're...
you're very much like him.

567
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,444
I'm... I'm nothing
like my father.

568
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,314
Black and white. The two of you,
you always saw the world in black and white.

569
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,844
Your mother wasn't like that.
Either is Russell.

570
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,864
All right, go.

571
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,765
I was clearing out my desk
when my phone rings.

572
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,769
And it's this F.B.I.
agent named Carlson.

573
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,532
Yeah. He heads up
a surveillance unit.

574
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,971
He tells me you and Booth are wasting
my time with this damn priest.

575
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,975
I tell him, " You better mind
your mushy mouth."

576
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,705
I gotta find Bones,
keep her from getting killed.

577
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,111
Father Coulter
is 90 years old...

578
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:41,311
confined to bed with Alzheimer's in a
convalescent home out there at the seminary.

579
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,650
Which does not much sound like
the priest you told me about.

580
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:47,350
Your father,
he talked about, uh...

581
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:51,327
when you were four
and your brother was nine.

582
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,126
And... And he hid behind this door
and he jumped out at you.

583
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,929
- You know what? Just give me the keys to your car.
- My car?

584
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:01,961
Boo! He hollers, "Boo!"
And you... you had this doll.

585
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,770
- Had this string in the back for talking.
- Chatty Cathy.

586
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,345
Wham! You took that doll.

587
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:12,179
And you wound up. And you hit your brother
so hard you knocked him flat as a pancake.

588
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,846
I said to your mother, " No one will ever
jump out at that girl again."

589
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:20,880
And your mother said,
"Just like you, Max.

590
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,153
She's just like you."

591
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,631
Hair color, plastic surgery...

592
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,494
colored contact lenses,
chin and cheek implants...

- [Line Ringing]
- Come on, Bones. Pick up. Pick up!

597
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,325
- This is Dr. Temperance Brennan. Leave a message.
- Damn it.

598
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,126
Russ knew it was you all along?

599
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,190
Yeah.

600
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,133
You talk to Russ,
but not to me?

601
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,145
You know, to tell you the truth...

602
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,705
you do better without me
and Russ does worse.

603
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,513
- Take this.
- I'm not religious.

604
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:25,716
No. We're gonna play
this your way. Please.

605
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,162

<i>There's a key there</i>
<i>that's to a safety-deposit box.</i>

607

In that safety-deposit box
is all the evidence.

608
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:41,999
Why didn't you give it
to them back in 1978?

609
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,405
Because your mother took
one look at it and said...

610
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:48,741
"If you turn this over to them,
they will kill us and our kids."

611
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,747
They got Mom anyway.

00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,563
I'd like to recommend him
for a job.

636
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,462
I can't put him in front of a jury.
I'm sorry.

637
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,299
<i>I'll put in a good word in Pure Research.</i>
<i>That way, he can come visit once in a while.</i>

638
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,967
- Visit?
- <i>Dr. Saroyan, Dr. Brennan, Dr. Hodgins...</i>

639
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,307
I'd like to present your colleague.

640
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,906
Dr. Zachary Uriah Addy.

641
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,913
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>Look at you.</i>

642
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,979
- All grown up.
- <i>[Saroyan] Wow.</i>

643
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,491
Very impressive.

644
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,925
I can learn how to be effective
in front of juries.

645
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,463
Zack can learn anything.

646
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,799
All right, he's hired.

647
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,867
<i>Who am I to break up this team?</i>

648
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,538
- Lunch is on me, Dr. Addy.
Anywhere you want to go.
- The diner.

649
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,310
- Anywhere, I said.
- I like the diner.

650
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,511
Hey, do me a favor, Uriah.

651
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,555
Need a little time to adjust
to your fascist haircut.

652
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,749
Let's go.

653
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,598
Congratulations, Dr. Addy.

654
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,131
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

655
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,675
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>Zack, congratulations.</i>

656
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,540
- <i>[Hodgins] Congratulations.</i>
- <i>Hear, hear!</i>

657
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,012
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>It's about time, man. Congratulations.</i>

658
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,907
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>You should be proud of yourself.</i>

659
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,689
What happened?

660
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:03,591
<i>Well, the attorney general took one look at</i>
<i>the, uh, evidence your father provided.</i>

661
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,630
And, you know,
he reinstated me.

662
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,999
I'm glad.

663
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,730
Listen. We, uh, found
another burned body.

664
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,967
Same place, same setup.

665
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,373
- Kirby?
- I'm pretty sure.

666
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,741
It was Kirby's blood in your apartment.

667
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,179
Dad's still trying to warn people.
Leave me and Russ alone.

668
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,717
Uh, Russ, he's safe with your father.

669
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:31,448
They're warning people
to stay away from you.

670
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,787
You know what? I'm sorry that
you had to go through it again.

671
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,260
Watching your family drive off,
you know, leaving you behind.

672
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,855
- I'm sorry.
- My father is... is...

673
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,595
He's your dad.
And he loves you.

674
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,669
You know, I'm just...

675
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,147
I'm just one of those people
who doesn't get to be in a family.

676
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,241
That's...

677
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:05,277
Listen, Bones. Hey, there's more
than one kind of family.

678
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,260
- Well, Zack got the job, right?
- Come in and congratulate him.

679
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,667
Nah. He's your squints.
Not my squints.

680
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:24,469
No. Booth, we are all
of us your squints.

681
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:29,070
Do me a favor and pat Zack
on the shoulder with an open hand.

682
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,637
What? Why?
Does that mean something?

683
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,047
[Chuckles]

684
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,384
What's that mean?
