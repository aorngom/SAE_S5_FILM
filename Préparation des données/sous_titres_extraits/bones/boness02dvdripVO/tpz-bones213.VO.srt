[Booth]
Florida? Today?

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:05,070
- Is that work?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,072
Hot, fun, Miami, Florida...

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,200
or sticky, you know,
swampy Florida?

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,210
- <i>[Man] Really.</i>
- You're welcome. God.

6
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,678
- What's going on in Florida?
- Wait a sec. What flight?

7
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,739
- # [Calliope]
- Hold on for a second. I can't hear you.

8
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,750
Enough with the song already,
all right?

9
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,945
I'm doing business here.
Deal with it!

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,546
Hold on for a second.
Now my pen's out of ink.

11
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,717
- Here.
- Oh, hold on. I can't hear anything!

12
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,126
- The kids love the music.
- Well, I don't see any kids.

13
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,460
The music attracts them!

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,969
Did you say the Everglades? Look, I can't
hear anything because of this insane music!

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,005
- <i>[Gunshots]</i>
- # [Stops]

16
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,506
- <i>[People Screaming]</i>
- You shot my clown!

17
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,405
Great. Flight number?

18
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,671
- <i>[Man] Move out of the way!</i>
- <i>Hey! He shot my clown!</i>

19
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,645
- [Electricity Crackles]
- <i>[Booth] Okay. Thanks.</i>

20
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:52,651
- Okay. We're all set.
- That was not good.

21
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,230
<i>I thought you said you'd be down</i>
<i>on the next flight.</i>

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,860
- <i>[Booth On Phone]</i>
<i>Well, I haven't met with the shrink yet.</i>
- What shrink?

23
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,736
<i>Well, the department psychiatrist has to</i>
<i>sign a piece of paper saying, you know...</i>

24
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,173
that I'm not nuts
before I get my gun back.

25
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,709
So, I got
an appointment tomorrow.

26
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:22,009
Great. Now I have to break in
this... Agent Sullivan?

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,016
<i>Wait. Sully's a great guy.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,053
- And for your information, you never broke me in.
- Oh, I think that's him.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,611
- Okay, I'll talk to you later.
- <i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>

[Sighs]

31
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,095
Dr. Brennan?

32
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,358
- Agent Sullivan?
- Uh-huh.

33
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,265
- Name's Eugene.
- Okay, Eugene.

34
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,532
No, not me. I'm Sully.
Short for Sullivan.

35
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,041
- Well, then, who's Eugene?
- [Man] Right here.

36
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,044
<i>Eugene's been king of this swamp</i>
<i>for as long as I can remember.</i>

37
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,909
Broke my heart to
have to shoot him.

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,845
Is there an actual human victim?

39
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,316
- Inside Eugene.
- He ate somebody?

40
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,580
Damn spring breakers
think it's a real kick...

41
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,519
to come here
and drink beer with the big fella.

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,024
I just chased off a bunch of'em.

43
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,528
And there was Eugene in the middle
of the swamp gulping down somebody's arm.

44
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,064
Someone from the group of kids
you chased off?

45
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,692
No. No, gators
don't eat fresh kills.

46
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,701
They drown their prey.

47
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,261
They stuff it down underwater to tenderize
for a few weeks before they can eat 'em.

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,867
<i>Okay. Why don't you drag the rest</i>
<i>of the swamp for any additional remains?</i>

49
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,537
I'll check Fort Lauderdale missing persons.
<i>You</i> start cutting.

50
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,604
No.

51
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,675
Wh... Isn't that what you do?

52
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,278
Any potential remains
are far too sensitive to be retrieved here.

53
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,222
[Sighs]
Okay. Well, where... where do you suggest?

54
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,783
- My lab at theJeffersonian.
- The whole gator?

55
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,386
I'll handle transport.

56
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,922
- You're gonna need a big crate.
- [Scoffs] And a lot of ice.

57
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,762
Okeydoke. Well, if you're doing this...

58
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,568
then there's a boat for sale
that I'd like to check out.

59
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,201
<i>A boat? Booth helps.</i>

60
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,111
- 'Cause Booth can't relax.
- There's something metal in here.

61
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,413
[Grunts]
Uh-huh.

62
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,546
- <i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>
- Don't you have a boat to buy?

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,628
I knew it was a gator.
Brennan told me it was a gator.

64
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,104
- And yet... wow.
- Definitely confirms one thing.

65
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:04,007
- We have the coolest jobs ever.
- Look at all these teeth.

66
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,308
<i>Step away, please.</i>
<i>There are 80 in total.</i>

67
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,348
Note the conical shape.

68
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,849
"Step away, please?"
Just because you have a doctorate now...

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,285
does not mean I won't
use you as a swizzle stick.

70
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,155
Animal foot.
Possibly a rabbit.

71
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,625
Not so lucky
for either of them.

72
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,685
- Frog.
- Yummy.

73
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:28,291
- Do I hear music?
- <i># [Latin, Muffled]</i>

What do you think, Zack?

77
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,153
Definitely a human foot.

78
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,382
Lovely.

79
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,353
Dr. Wyatt.

Ah, Agent Booth, is it?
Yes. Gordon. Gordon Wyatt.

81
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:03,094
- Right. You're the shrink?
- Uh, shrink, yes, meaning psychiatrist.

82
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,002
That's great, Doc. How's about
you just sign my piece of paper here...

83
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,007
- and I'll get back to work.
- Uh, certainly. No, no. I have a pen.

84
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,340
- Okay.
- Do you mind if I ask what
exactly it was that you did?

85
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,607
- Yeah, I shot a truck.
- Ah.

86
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,344
Full of terrorists, no doubt,
or plutonium or fleeing felons, was it?

87
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,081
- No. It was an ice cream truck.
- Do you have a good reason for firing on it?

88
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,555
- Yeah. The music, it was bothering me.
- Ah.

89
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,717
Yeah. There was a speaker
in the clown's mouth.

90
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,057
- Oh.
- Yeah, I just pulled out my gun, you know, and...

91
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,358
[Imitates Gunshots]
It was gone.

92
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,229
So the F.B.I. sent you to me
because you shot a clown?

93
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,632
Not a real clown.

94
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:41,197
I suggest you cogitate on the underlying reasons
you shot that clown while I make us some tea.

95
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,902
What? Cogitate?

96
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,910
Tea?

97
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,479
The depth of these bite marks...
very impressive.

98
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:54,543
One torn pair of jeans.
One red linen blouse, size two.

99
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,645
And one platform wedge.

100
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,157
Made it all the way
to the lower intestine.

101
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,558
Florida F.B.I. just beamed over
names of recent missing persons.

102
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,061
We'll need dental records.

And you're still a G-man.

106
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,273
What happened to that restaurant you were
gonna open? Or was it a petting zoo?

107
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,437
Well, I am keeping myself open
for the perfect opportunity.

Her name's Judy Dowd.

116
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,439
Shouldn't you at least look at the X-rays
before deciding that?

<i>It says right here she had surgery</i>

The bone graft is here.

119
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,047
She was a freshman
at Virginia State.

121
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,622

Oh, my God.

When did you last
see your daughter, Mr. Dowd?

<i>Her friend, uh, Abigail Sims?</i>

Abby. A good kid.

<i>Did you get any calls from her</i>
<i>while she was there?</i>

131

00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,339
Any sign that she was in trouble?

No. She...

134
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,703

She sounded happy.

135
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,582
So happy.

But tea?

Tea is, uh, sacrosanct,
thank you very much.

142
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,804
Me? I'm a coffee drinker.
Hey, listen, pal.

143
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,712
You know, in an effort to
understand your culture better...

144
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:41,083
I've been trying to embrace this very American
practice of preparing meat in the garden.

145
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:45,419
- Barbecue.
- <i>Mmm, it's a delightful word, isn't it? Barbecue.</i>

146
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,924
I think it's from the Caribbean, <i>barabicu...</i>

147
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,757
which means
a sort of sacred fire pit.

148
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,232
Did you know that the Latin for hearth,
though, is "focus?" Isn't that revealing?

149
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,428
It's quite literally
the focal point of every household.

150
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,904
The hearth, the heart.
Hmm? Interesting.

151

I told the ice cream guy
I was sorry, all right?

152
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,769
l-l-I even bought him a new clown head.
So just sign the paper.

I must apologize.

some ingredients for my mortar.

- Um, why don't we reschedule?
- We can't <i>reschedule,</i> all right?

156
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,785
I gotta get back to work.

157
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,155
Oh. Well, in that case...

00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,253
um, why not finish off
preparing this area here?

159
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,356
Could you do that?
All the specifications are on the plans.

You are fit for physical labor,
aren't you?

161
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,637
I mean, the, uh, the clown
didn't return fire, did it?

162
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,640
Oh, what if I said that
the plastic clown <i>did</i> fire back, huh?

163
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,438
Brilliant.
[Chuckles]

164
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,538
Now while I'm gone, what I want you to do
is to consider what you were really aiming at...

165
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,606
when you drew a bead
on that unfortunate clown.

166
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,120
Hey, buddy, when I aim at something,
I hit it.

167
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,314
Precisely.

168
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,825
Anyway, I shan't be long, Agent.
It's all on the plans here.

169
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,088
I'll be back before long, Agent.
See you then.

170
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,460
Do help yourself to more tea
by the way.

171
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,969
Like I told the police, me and Judy were
just doing the usual spring break stuff.

172
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,368
<i>The whole night was</i>
<i>kind of a blur...</i>

173
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,068
until I woke up the next morning
at the hotel, and Judy wasn't there.

174
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,373
- She hadn't come back with you?
- I can't remember.

175
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,971
So why didn't you report it to someone
till later that night?

176
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,881
- I thought maybe she'd hooked up.
- Hooked up?

177
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,920
Hooked up.

178
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,014
Uh, with anyone in particular?

179
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,424
We met so many guys.
You know how it is.

180
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,554
<i>I'm guessing that she doesn't.</i>

181
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,361
Do you have any pictures
from that night, Abby?

182
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,526
No. The police
took most of them.

183
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,593
Wait. Most of them?

184
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,299
<i>There's a couple</i>
<i>on my personal Web page.</i>

185
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,342
I didn't want them
showing poor Mr. Dowd.

186
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,276
Judy would never want him
seeing her like that.

187
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,871
Like what?

188
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:57,519
<i>Here's the spectrophotometric evaluation</i>
<i>on Judy Dowd. Any results on her tox screen?</i>

189
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,751
No drugs, but her blood-alcohol
was sky high.

190
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,554
Point 11. And...

191
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,720
- <i>Oh, dear.</i>
- <i>[Angela] What?</i>

192
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,130
S.P.M. reveals hidden hematomas
in decomp tissue.

193
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,758
<i>See this shaded area here?</i>

194
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,303
It indicates bruising
to her vaginal wall.

195
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,032
Meaning Judy was raped.

196
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,872
<i>Or at the very least, subjected to</i>
<i>some extremely unpleasant college sex.</i>

197
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,604
With one of these fine lads?

198
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,546
<i>[Saroyan] Without D.N.A.,</i>
<i>it's the proverbial needle in a haystack.</i>

199
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,914
Wait. Our victim was an H.S. B?

200
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,045
- Excuse me?
- HottyStudentBody. com.

201
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,248
<i>It's this Web site that</i>
<i>gets drunk college girls...</i>

202
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,257
from all over the East Coast
to take their clothes off.

203
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,156
I clicked on a pop-up,
got caught in a "pornado."

204
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,829
What?

205
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:49,804
<i>Oh, splendid. So it was your father</i>
<i>who taught you to read plans, was it?</i>

206
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,934
Wrong tree, Doc, okay?
Dad and I were tight.

207
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,744
Only, it's just that earlier you said that
you weren't used to drinking tea with men...

208
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:01,810
which suggests to me that you're usually
pretty rigid in your assignment of gender roles.

209
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,617
What? No, no.
My-My partner's a woman, okay?

210
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,817
A woman who needs my help.

211
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,453
Hmm. But are you
currently involved with anyone?

212
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,862
I just broke up with someone, okay?
Me. And I ended it.

213
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,460
And how long had you been
involved with her? O-Or him?

214
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,800
Her. Let's get that straight, okay?
Her.

215
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,103
- Couple months this time.
- This time?

216
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:28,806
We'd gone out...
We'd gone out before a-a f-few years ago.

217
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,815
And you know, we, uh...

218
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,819
I broke it up when, uh, you know,
my ex wanted to give it another go.

219
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,650
[Winces]
Complicated.

220
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,452
Ah! That's it!

221
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,825
I shot the clown because
I can't let go of the women in my life.

222
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,491
Ha! Thanks, Doc. All right.
Now, I can go back to work.

223
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,626
And you can sign the paper!

224
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,695
Excellent theory,
but quite wrong.

225
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,174
And we're out of time.

226
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,541
Tomorrow all right for you?

227
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,673
Just right. Yes.
[Sighs]

228
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,653
- We found a stab wound.
- Let's see it.

229
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,247
It's more of a puncture, really.

230
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,225
Hidden here among the bite marks
just below her scapula.

231
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,692
Angela doesn't like me
being her superior.

232
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,598
- Because you're acting superior.
- Which is what a superior is.

233
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,865
Don't be a horse's ass. She's your friend.
That's all that matters.

234
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,430
These ridge marks inside the wound
look like the threads of a screw.

235
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,170
We're trying to I.D. the weapon.

236
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,543
At the least, it proves Judy didn't stumble
into the swamp and feed herself to Eugene.

237
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:40,415
- That was my conclusion as well.
- Okay.

238
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,081
And the hits keep coming.
It seems Judy Dowd was raped and murdered.

239
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,090
No more rough college sex?

240
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,025
<i>Now that we know it's a murder,</i>

- <i>[Brennan] She's on your Web site.</i>

We found her in Florida raped,
murdered, and fed to an alligator.

00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,807
and you made a joke about
the bouncer swapping spit with that girl?

318
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,005
- That was this girl?
- Pretty sure.

319
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,606
<i>Oh, she was hot.</i>

320
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,618
<i>Passed the two of them</i>
<i>playing tonsil hockey in the doorway.</i>

321
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,382
<i>That bouncer was a big dude too.</i>

322
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,947
- And it's <i>me</i> you're harassing?
- <i>[Lloyd] Let's go, Eddie.</i>

323
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,831
This waiver is a joke.
I mean, look atJudy's signature.

324
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,834
She could barely hold a pen.

325
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,735
Well, Florida Bureau's gonna
scoop up this bouncer and call me back.

326
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:31,174
- We need to get back in that bus.
- Well, we need cause for a warrant.

327
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,009
You tell Mario
that he is still an artist.

328
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,138
- <i>Sure thing.</i>
- What is that?

329
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,149
Mmm!

330
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,481
Only the finest
sausage and peppers on earth.

331
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,749
Someday, I'm gonna turn it
into a franchise. You want a bite?

332
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,585
I thought you were buying a boat.

333
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,990
I am. Well, maybe
I'll start a charter service.

334
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,394
I can serve these to the passengers,
you know? In Jamaica.

335
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,661
- Good.
- Mmm, the word is great.

336
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,500
Or maybe I'll manage a band, you know?
They could play on the boat too.

337
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,335
So you don't...
You don't like being an F.B.I. agent?

338
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:06,070
Oh, sure. l-I do. I just don't want it
to be the only thing I ever was.

339
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,079
[Chuckles]

340
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,515
You're telling me you're just gonna be
a bone lady your whole life?

341
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,713
I spent years
studying anthropology.

342
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,849
Well, I got a degree.
But I'm not gonna let it ruin my life.

343
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,356
- I'm going back to the lab.
- Mmm, here!

344
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,455
Take one of these with you
back to that spaceship.

345
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,093
I'll call you when
we get our bouncer.

<i>Mmm, mmm.</i>
<i>Mmm, Jamaica.</i>

347
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,837
I can dig it, man.

348
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,212
- Oh.
- Hi.

349
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,214
Um, do we have a schedule?

350
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,443
Uh, listen.
I really need to get back to work.

351
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,146
So why don't you give me one of those clown
restraining orders and just sign my paper?

352
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:53,715
- Have you had an insight then as
to why you shot at that clown?
- Yeah.

353
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,727
- You know what?
I have some insight. It's right here.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]

354
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,822
That's my Bones calling, huh?
My partner. Right? Yeah. Bones.

355
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,799
So when are you
coming back again?

356
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,597
What? Aren't you
playing nice with Sully?

357
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,070
- I'm not sure how serious he is about his job.
- Look.

358
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,664
He's one of the best.
He just likes to keep his options open.

359
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,471
- I've noticed.
- Listen, Bones.

360
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,241
Sully, he, uh, lost his partner
about, uh, a year ago. All right?

361
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,249
Something like that happens,
you just...

362
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,514
You hear that clock on the inside
ticking just a little bit louder.

363
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,782
So, uh, you know what?
You're in good hands.

364
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,652
Here he comes.
So I gotta go. Gotta go.

365
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,126
Hey. All right, so maybe
I am a little irritable.

366
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,825
Why do you think
that might be?

367
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,666
Come on. Look, don't they give you,
like, papers and files and reports and...

368
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,437
All right. Um...
[Exhales]

369
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:50,645
Me and my partner caught up to this serial killer
by the name of Howard Epps, and he died.

370
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,014
And whose fault was that?
Yours or your partner's?

371
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,486
Oh, no. He jumped over that balcony
because of her.

372
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,785
[Chuckles] Sometimes
I think he had the right idea.

373
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,118
And where were you when Mr. Epps fell?

374
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,163
Holding his arm.

375
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,529
- No, that was <i>before</i> he fell, surely.
- What?

376
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,400
Well, Mr. Epps was dangling
from your arm before he fell.

377
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,872
At which point, he was
no longer dangling, but falling.

378
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,001
Attached to you, he was alive.
No longer attached, dead.

379
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,478
Well, I don't feel guilty about that.
I mean, Epps is a serial killer.

380
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,845
He tried to kill my partner,
and he threatened my son.

381
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,043
<i>I was glad</i>
<i>when he hit that pavement.</i>

382
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,019
Do you think about suicide
often?

383
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,545
Suicide? Me?

384
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,024
No, no. Never.

385
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,756
And yet, you sometimes feel that Howard Epps
had the right idea about jumping off that balcony?

386
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,594
It was a joke. Okay?
It was a joke.

387
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,159
Yes. You do that a lot,
don't you?

388
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,530
Makes me feel such a bully
for prying.

389
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,735
Well, we'll pick up on this
next time.

390
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,175
[Scoffs]

391
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:04,415
Increase magnification,
<i>please,</i> if you're ready.

- I don't mean to appear dictatorial...
- I get it, Zack.

393
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,062
- Hey.
- So what are we looking at?

394
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,191
Bits of gold foil embedded deep within
bite marks along the T11 and T12 vertebrae.

395
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,701
Jewelry?

396
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,966
More likely scenario has the gator's teeth
piercing Judy's stomach.

397
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,974
<i>Embedding whatever</i>
<i>she last ingested into her bone.</i>

398
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,272
How would someone eat gold?

399
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,280
Not eat. Drink.

400
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,784
- Goldenrod.
- Goldenrod?

401
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,116
It's this hundred-proof cinnamon schnapps
that we drank in college.

402
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,887
It's infused with real gold flakes,
purely for decadence' sake.

403
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,824
How did it taste?

404
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,954
Oh. It's way worse coming up,
I can tell you that.

405
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,732
<i>She could've wandered into</i>
<i>bars we don't know about.</i>

406
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,203
If we can find every place
that carries that stuff...

407
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:58,140
I don't think we'll need to, Doc.
We've got our bouncer.

408
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,838
Of course, he denies all.
But his alibi just about buries him.

409
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,780
- Buries him how?
- He left work early that night
to get to his other job...

410
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,148
<i>giving midnight</i>
<i>swamp tours on his boat.</i>

411
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,744
Sounds like a good job actually.

412
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,517
So, he's admitted to knowing the Everglades
like the back of his hand.

413
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,492
<i>Which would not be smart</i>
<i>ifhe were, in fact, the killer.</i>

414
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,653
Most of the killers I know
aren't all that smart.

415
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,096
The gold flakes are definitely from
the liquor we found in her system.

416
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:25,262
- And I remembered something.
- Monte and his harem. So what?

417
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,773
Check out the caption.
"All the girls love Monte's gold!"

418
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,934
Now, granted, there are plenty of bars
that carry this stuff. But...

419
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,945
But this could be the probable cause
we need to search Monte's bus.

420
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,776
- I'll get the warrant.
- [Phone Beeps]

421
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,153
Bouncer's alibi checked out.

422
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,131
So Monte's minions were likely
just trying to throw us off.

423
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,725
Unbelievable, you people.
What is it now?

424
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,465
Hey, hey, cool your jets, Hef.
We just want to search your bus.

- This is you, isn't it?
- Please don't point your finger at me.

426
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,300

00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:09,336
here comes another feminist crusader
out to spoil some good, all-American fun.

Ow. Get off! Get off.

00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,511

- Yes, he did.

- Well, it's not exactly a smoking gun.

435
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:33,103
- Can you prove she drank it here?
- I can try.

436
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,607
Okay. You can only admit evidence
that's in plain view.

437
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:41,078

D.N.A. on virtually any surface.

- Judy's stab wound was probably
from a bolt of some kind...

441
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,790
right through... here.

442
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,725
Oh, just inside her scapula.

Yes. But most laymen
refer to it as a shoulder blade.

Well, I told you I went to college.

- Judy Dowd wasn't killed at
the swamp where she was found.

453
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,991
Cryptosporidium on her clothes
came from saw grass...

454
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,496
a plant that doesn't even
grow in Eugene's swamp.

455
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,591
- Where does it grow?
- Well, pretty much everywhere
else in the Everglades.

456
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,398
<i>But in terms of gator distance,</i>
<i>there's a saw grass marsh two miles south...</i>

meets State Road 29.

All that from cryptosporidium?

A buddy from my job
found the video.

475
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,676
He thought I'd be embarrassed,
but all I care about is what happened next.

476
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,709
Did this guy kill her?

477
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,807
I really can't discuss the case.

478
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:03,183
The way he's pawing at my girl
on that video, he's gotta be a suspect.

479
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:07,315
At-At this point, Mr. Dowd,
there are a lot of suspects.

480
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,328
But not many like him.
I mean, do you trust him?

481
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,489
Do you think he's a good man?

482
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,992
No. Of course not.

483
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,902
I find him repulsive.

484
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,109
Please. I just gotta know.

485
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,111
Was it him?

486
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,385
I'm very sorry about
your daughter, Mr. Dowd.

487
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,893
There's nothing I can say.

488
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:48,558
I understand.
I shouldn't have put you on the spot.

489
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,028
I'm sorry.

490
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,413
<i>You lied about the bouncer, Eddie.</i>

491
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,418
- What?
- The bouncer in Lauderdale.

492
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,614
<i>You never saw him kissing Judy Dowd</i>
<i>the night she went missing.</i>

493
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,682
Really? I was sure it was them.

494
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,695
- Uh, you drive the bus, too, don't you?
- Yeah, so?

495
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:23,257
So you drove out of Lauderdale,
straight up the 95 to Daytona?

496
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,427
Is that what Monte said?

497
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,839
- Yeah, straight up 95.
- You sure about that?

498
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,710
Oh. No, uh, that's right.
There was, uh, construction.

499
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,340
We got detoured
cross state on 75.

500
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:42,216
- Right, 75. Isn't that Alligator Alley?
- Mmm.

501
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,982
Come on, Eddie.
A girl is dead.

502
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,550
- We didn't kill her.
- But she was on your bus.

503
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,620
She had a few drinks.
You have sex with her?

504
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:57,259
No. No way.
I... was driving.

505
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,793
- While Monte had sex with her?
- I guess.

506
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,306
You guess?
Was-Was it consensual?

507
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:07,003
All I know is she was drunk,
all right? Really drunk.

508
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,741
And when Monte got done with her,
she came up by me wanting to get off the bus.

509
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,010
- Eddie, don't say anything!
- Where were you in all this?

510
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,453
- Lloyd drives in front of us.
It was me and Monte on the bus.
- Shut up, Eddie.

511
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,650
<i>Monte's lawyer says that we don't have to</i>
<i>talk to anybody until he gets here.</i>

512
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,285
He has nothing to worry about.
No one's under arrest.

513
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,885
Why'd you let her off the bus?

514
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,865
I didn't want to. It was really dark.
She could barely stand up.

515
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,164
- Then Monte wanted her off?
- He was pissed off. She was crying.

516
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,137
- Eddie!
- He was gonna fire me if I didn't.

517
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,799
<i>We owe Monte a lot, okay?</i>
<i>The guy's been really good to us.</i>

518
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,809
And we knew that
none of us killed her.

519
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,574
If you let her off the bus in the middle of nowhere
in that condition, you may as well have.

520
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:46,048
When Eddie told me where she got off
the bus, I went back and looked for her.

521
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,553
<i>I must have driven that road for an hour.</i>
<i>I figured she hitched a ride back.</i>

522
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,350
You figured? He figured.

523
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,788
<i>Maybe Monte made a bad call</i>
<i>in letting the girl off.</i>

524
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,520
But she wanted off.
So he was just doing what she asked.

525
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:00,758
- Except for the sex part.
- You know what? You can't prove that.

526
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,266
I wouldn't bet against her.

527
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:08,061
- So, is Monte still in his office?
- No.

528
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,233
He, uh, had an appointment
back at the Iguana Club up in Maryland.

529
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,243
Okay.

530
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,876
[Sighs]
You know what? I'm in America. We're men.

531
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,888
Let's drink coffee, not tea, eh?

532
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,890
Oh, I say.

533
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,358
- You're doing a marvelous job.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

534
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,689
[Exhales]
That's not coffee.

535
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:37,758
- Oh. What is it?
- I don't know what the hell it is,
but it sure isn't coffee.

536
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,304
You tend to do things well,
don't you?

537
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:44,899
- Make coffee, build barbecue machines.
- It's not really a machine.

538
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:48,742
Solve crimes, raise a son,
love women, leave women.

539
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,907
Whatever you aim at,
you hit.

540
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,214
- Is that bad?
- By no means. No, of course not.

541
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,346
- Except...
- Oh, yeah, okay. Here we go.

542
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,357
Let me have it, Doc.

543
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,724
Except it is indicative of a need
to control your environment.

544
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,729
Again, I ask, uh, is that bad?

545
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,061
No, of course not.
No. Except...

546
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,623
- Except?
- Except when you shoot a clown.

547
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,103
You know, you make it sound like he was
walking around making balloon animals.

548
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,436
For the most part,
your rebellions are small.

549
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:21,604
- Rebellions?
- Mmm, the colorful socks, the funky belt buckle.

550
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,079
They're a mechanism.
Quiet rebellions.

551
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,241
<i>A way of asserting</i>
<i>your personal control...</i>

552
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,980
<i>over a homogenizing organization</i>
<i>like the F.B.I.</i>

553
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,079
But shooting a clown
is not a quiet rebellion.

554
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:36,388
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Shooting a clown is, quite literally, deafening.

555
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,486
- Booth.
- [Brennan] Hey, it's me.

556
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,498
Hold on. Why is it every time
I answer the phone, you walk away?

557
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,332
Why do you answer the phone
knowing it'll make me walk away?

558
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,598
Yeah, you know what?
Bones, I gotta call you back.

559
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,300
Well, I... Is...
Is Sully for real?

560
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,367
- What?
- I just can't decide whether or not
to take him seriously.

561
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:57,642
- Is he acting unprofessional?
- No. He's... He's very professional.

562
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,445
It's just... Can he really do
all he says he can do?

563
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,645
Oh, you mean that whole
master carpentry thing, yeah.

564
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,348
- What?
- Well, he made me a dining room set last year.

565
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,654
- He's a carpenter as well?
- As well as what?

566
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,160
- <i>[Beeping]</i>
- That's Sully calling right now.

567
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:15,529
We're, um... We're doing,
you know, what we did.

568
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,228
- You know, I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

569
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,966
- I'll talk to you later.
- [Beeps]

570
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,044
So maybe Monte can tell us why
he left the girl on the side of the road.

571
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:35,108
Hey, there's a storefront.
Sausage and pepper shop?

572
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,746
That's funny. Take my lead.

573
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:42,054
- I know what I'm doing. Didn't Booth tell you?
- Yeah. Take my lead.

574
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,094
Wait, wait, wait.
That's his car.

575
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,393
Monte Gold?

576
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,216
<i>[Sully] We found him in a pool of</i>
<i>his own blood outside his club.</i>

577
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,025
It's the last thing
you said to Monte, Isaac.

578
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,898
"His judgment cometh
and that right soon."

579
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,902
That's not even a Bible verse,
the judgment thing.

580
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,565
- It's a line from <i>Shawshank.</i>
- Who's that?

581
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,268
<i>"Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord.</i>

582
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,642
Look, if Monte's wicked deeds
cost him his life...

583
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,978
<i>it was the work of a hand</i>
<i>far mightier than my own.</i>

584
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,952
<i>And where exactly have your hands been</i>
<i>the last five hours?</i>

585
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,546
Working on my truck.
I got garage receipts to prove it.

586
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,081
- [Phone Rings]
- [Beeps]

587
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,891
- Hey, Angela, what's up?
- Hey. I, uh...

588
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,728
- I think that you might have the wrong man.
- What do you mean?

589
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,066
I made a mistake, Brennan.

590
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,974
<i>I only wanted to scare him.</i>

591
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,640
I didn't go there to kill him.

592
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,974
But what he said.

593
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:21,856
Three words.
He only said three words in his defense.

594
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,790
"She wanted it."

595
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,698
She didn't, Mr. Dowd.

596
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,202
<i>That much we do know.</i>

597
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,263
Is there anyone
you want to call, sir?

598
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,905
No. There isn't anybody.

599
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:46,081
[Sighs]
There was Judy.

600
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,152
JustJudy.

601
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:02,295
<i>So this is the culprit, huh? The result</i>
<i>of your metal screw-headed thingy?</i>

602
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,835
Zack managed to <i>identify</i>
this bone bruise.

603
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,700
<i>Across posterior</i>
<i>six through eight.</i>

604
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,366
- Show off.
- Okay.

605
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:14,571
I've got my weapons list and visual aids,
courtesy of Angela.

606
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:18,877
Now, we know the wound was caused by a blunt
steel dowel with screw threads at the top.

607
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,317
The bruising around it is the rough
size and shape of a harmonica.

608
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,913
<i>Theoretically, the head of the wound struck,</i>
<i>leaving the bruising, but then broke.</i>

609
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,824
Allowing the steel dowel beneath
to be driven intoJudy's back.

610
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,192
So possible weapons include...

611
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,629
shovel handle with a steel shaft...

612
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:39,500
- a golfer's wooden putter with aluminum shaft.
- Okay. A gear shifter?

613
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,198
It's an alloy gear shifter
with a grip-shaped handle.

614
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,298
This doesn't look like
it could cause the injury.

615
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,536
Unless it didn't have a handle.

616
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,171
<i>Yeah. Though she probably would not</i>
<i>have been killed standing up.</i>

617
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,876
She'd have to have been
thrown down and then impaled.

618
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,181
Preacher man had one of these
in his truck.

619
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,485
With a tennis ball
where the handle should've been...

620
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,961
hiding the exposed threads
underneath.

621
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,362
And he follows Monte everywhere.

00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,167
<i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>

623
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,645
Don't let us interrupt you, Isaac.

00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,617
<i>I was praying for his guidance</i>
<i>in bringing an end to this harassment.</i>

- I'm tired of...

626
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:33,990

- Home. If that's any of your business.

<i>Back to your church, huh?</i>
<i>I gotta tell ya.</i>

628

I wish I'd have called them
a little sooner.

629
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,564
- You did this? You called them?
- Yeah. You sure you weren't

what you're talking about.

632
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,931
Well, apparently your church kicked
your hypocritical ass out last year.

633
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,773
<i>Something about you hitting on</i>
<i>young female parishioners.</i>

634
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,838
<i>Who-Who-Who... Who told you this, huh?</i>
<i>Hey, you can't get in there.</i>

635
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,010
- Tennis ball for a gear shifter.
- Huh.

636
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,755
- <i>Turn around, Isaac.</i>
- All right.

637
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,324
Forgive them, Lord,
for they know not what they do.

638
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,098
Oh, yeah?
Well, what we do know...

639
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,972
is thatJudy Dowd was left
drunk and stumbling on Route 75.

640
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,943
And you, following Monte's bus,
pulled over to give her a ride.

641
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,639
Not a free one apparently.

642
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,944
No, no. That's a lie.
I never even saw her.

643
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,474
Oh, so this isn't her blood here?
It's someone's blood.

644
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,612
How many of Monte's castoffs
have you been with?

645
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,553
Huh? Girls too drunk to know?

646
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,616
- Before you picked upJudy?
- <i>You went for it. She rejected you.</i>

647
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,786
Next thing you know,
she's impaled on the shifter.

648
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,225
I may have picked her up.

649
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:54,169
But if I laid a hand, it was to heal
and to ask his redemption upon her.

650
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:57,730
Oh, man. You are shameless.

651
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:02,643
She was drunk. She went crazy.
Pushed me away and fell back.

652
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,910
It was an accident.
You know, the devil's work.

653
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:09,180
No. No. That was the part
where you fed her to an alligator.

654
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,996
There should be a sense of satisfaction
after solving a case.

655
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:27,026
But... most of the time,
I just... I feel drained.

656
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:31,473
Yeah. That's why you can only
do this job for so long.

657
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,737
Murders, death, corpses.

658
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,802
You do that
your whole life and...

659
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,544
There's gotta be more,
you know?

660
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,551
The sausage and pepper sandwich.

661
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,416
You gotta admit,
it was good.

662
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,012
[Both Chuckle]

663
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,786
So what do you and Booth
usually do now?

664
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:53,125
Is there a bar you go to?
A restaurant? Pilates class?

665
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,893
- There's a diner.
- Ah.

666
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,366
Booth says the pie is the best.

667
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:03,100
- Can I buy you a slice?
- Sure.

668
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,975
- I guess we're not working together anymore.
- Yes.

669
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,639
And since we have no professional
obligations to each other...

670
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,649
I can ask you out...

671
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,642
theoretically.

672
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,086
Theoretically.

673
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:22,888
- Perhaps after a 24-hour waiting period.
- Why?

674
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,589
So the brain can adjust
to alternate perceptions of each other.

675
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:31,560
I don't actually need it.
My brain adjusts quite quickly.

676
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,209
[Sighs]

677
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,270
[Chuckles]

678
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:46,510
- Oh, my good Lord.
- That's right.

679
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,109
How many bricks
did you use in the end?

680
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,654
Yep. You know, 180.

681
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,282
Right? So you can go sign away.

682
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,488
- What are those?
- Oh, those are two beautiful prime rib-eye steaks.

683
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,692
All right, being the barbecue master that I am,
I thought I'd show you how to barbecue, Doc.

684
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,998
Oh, but I don't want to be shown.
I want to learn by trial and error.

685
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,004
No, no, no, Doc. Come on, listen.

686
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,506
It's better to learn off of
hamburgers or sausages.

687
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,065
You know, those puppies
cost 50 bucks a pop.

688
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:17,979
Hmm. You know,
according to the F.B.I. reports...

689
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,643
there was no way you
could save Epps's life.

690
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,710
Your partner's report
says the same thing.

691
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:27,155
An F.B.I. sniper on the opposite roof
saw everything through his scope.

692
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:31,456
According to all witnesses,
you have nothing to feel guilty about.

693
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,394
Yeah, so?

694
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,024
So, why, in a fit of pique...

695
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,968
did you endanger innocent people in a public
thoroughfare by discharging your firearm?

696
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,562
[Lid Closes]

697
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,507
I'm a good shot.
I didn't put anybody in danger.

698
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,408
How many people have you killed?

699
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,414
Lost count.

700
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,747
Oh, you can remember 180 bricks,
but not how many lives you've taken?

701
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,819
- Epps makes 50.
- Fifty what?

702
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,088
- Fifty kills.
- But, Agent Booth, you didn't kill Epps.

703
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:09,030
You tried to save him, remember?

704
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,693
<i>Or perhaps I'd better</i>
<i>put it as a question.</i>

705
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,932
Did Howard Epps slip from your grasp,
or did you release him?

706
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,272
<i>Oh, come now, man.</i>
<i>It's a simple-enough question.</i>

707
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,782
Was he indeed
your 50th kill?

708
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,285
Or did you just happen
to be there when he died?

709
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,532
I don't know.

710
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,537
A man like you, in control
of every situation, and you don't know?

711
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,973
I don't know. I...

712
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,840
I had him,
and then I lost him.

713
00:41:56,914 --> 00:42:00,315
And-And... something happened
in between.

714
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,719
I don't know.

715
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,626
I believe you.

716
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:15,324
<i>Because for a man like you to admit</i>
<i>you don't know, to relinquish control...</i>

717
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:18,800
that could indeed argue
a disruption in your self-view...

718
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,771
<i>that was large enough</i>
<i>to motivate you to shoot a clown.</i>

719
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,679
[Inhales] Do you know?
I think we made marvelous progress.

720
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,443
This is a place from which
we can certainly begin.

721
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:38,444
You know what?
I've changed my mind.

722
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,187
I would love you
to cook those steaks.

723
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,923
[Exhales]

724
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,368
I can do that.

725
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,702
Medium rare,
please, Mr. G-man.

726
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,338
I can do that.

727
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,157
What's that mean?
