1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,230
- <i>[Booth] So, you ever been here before?</i>
- <i>[Brennan] No.</i>

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,670
No, I don't mean <i>here</i> here.
I mean Baltimore.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,437
[Brennan] Yeah, I've given several lectures
to the Baltimore Homicide Division.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,808
- [Groans] God.
- What's wrong with your mouth?

5
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,938
- I got a tooth situation.
- Well, go to a dentist.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,984
l-I will, if it doesn't get
any better. Ow. Man.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,986
- Are you afraid of the dentist?
- I'm not afraid of the...
- Welcome to Baltimore.

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,716
This is a federal flood abatement project,
which is why we called you.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,886
K-9 unit was usin' it for an exercise,
and one of the cadaver dogs went berserk.

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,930
- We dug up the cement...
- <i>[Brennan] No, that's concrete.</i>

11
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,160
<i>Cement is an ingredient in concrete.</i>

12
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,226
Yeah, that's a real important distinction
to make at this juncture.

13
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,897
<i>So, what do we got, Bones, huh?</i>
<i>Do your thing.</i>

14
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,066
- Nothing.
- Nothin'. Nothin'?

15
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:46,408
No, I can't see enough of the skull,
the tibia, the pubis...

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,346
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Wait a second. Nothing... Sorry.

17
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,079
Now we drove all the way here
so you could just tell me, "Nothing"?

18
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,782
All right, so what do you want me to do?
Uh, get the whole slab of cement...

19
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,689
- Concrete.
- Concrete. Whatever...
shipped back to theJeffersonian?

20
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,693
Yes. Yes.

21
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,693
- Sex?
- The mandible suggests male...

22
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,132
and the tibia suggests
he was between 5'6" and six feet tall.

23
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,432
Waffle-soled training shoes
and a tracksuit.

24
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,665
- You know who wears tracksuits?
- Athletes?

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,642
- No. Huge tubs of lard or retired people.
- [Chuckles] And rap stars.

26
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,373
- The teeth suggest early middle age.
- So, not a retiree.

27
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,111
Uh, calcified holes with radial fractures
in the left clavicle and scapula...

28
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,450
are consistent
with ballistic damage.

29
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:33,049
- He was shot to death?
- And stabbed, but neither killed him.
The wounds healed.

30
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:37,119
Shot, stabbed, but lived to die another day?
Rap star.

31
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,859
There's a small hole
in the back of the cranium.

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,198
<i>Dig the skull out first</i>
<i>to establish cause of death...</i>

33
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,499
then give Angela something
to work with to I.D. the guy.

34
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,506
Where is Angela?

35
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:57,078
I'm really not good at this kind of thing,
you know? I don't...

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,414
[Sighs]
I don't get the significance.

37
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:04,423
One year ago today,
you buried your mother.

38
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,827
You laid her to rest... here.

39
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,392
You're marking the anniversary.

40
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,970
- [Sighs]
- Angela, I...

41
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:23,737
simply don't believe my mother
retained sentience beyond death.

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,509
- Well, part of you is made up
of your mother, right?
- In a manner of speaking.

43
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,141
So honor that part of yourself.

44
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:37,452
Visualize a memory of her.
See what it brings up.

45
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,392
I have very few distinct memories
of my mother.

46
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,432
I'll wait in the car.

47
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,307
[Exhales]

48
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,410
<i>Hiya, honey.</i>

49
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,285
<i>I was hopin' you might show up.</i>

50
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,517
- [Beeping]
- I don't...

51
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,787
I don't want to talk to you.

52
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:20,561
You're standing here
in front of your mother's grave.

53
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,500
Obviously you've come
for some kind of answer.

54
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,773
Maybe I can provide 'em.

55
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,005
You're a killer.
You burn people.

56
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,775
Yeah. I'd like to report a sighting
of Max Keenan...

57
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,681
at Eternal Spring Memorial Gardens.

58
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,744
- He's a wanted fugitive.
- <i>[Quietly] I love you.</i>

59
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,694
Yes, I'm sure.

60
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,825
Because he's my father.

61
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:37,131
- Did you talk to your dad at all
before you called the cops?
- No. Why would I?

62
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,440
Well, I haven't seen my dad
in a long time, and...

63
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,276
if I had the opportunity to talk...
Ow. God.

64
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,613
- Go to a dentist.
- Well, I will if it doesn't get any better.

65
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,619
[Zack]
Based on decomposition of the tracksuit...

66
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,145
Hodgins is estimating
a postmortem interval of two years.

67
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:55,524
- Based on bone deterioration, I like three years.
- Well, what killed him?

68
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,031
The victim was dead shortly after this hole
was punched into his skull.

69
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,999
<i>Hmm. Too small for a projectile.</i>

70
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:06,528
- No radiating stress lines.
- A slow entry. A piercing wound.

71
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,406
Like a... a screwdriver?
Nail gun? Ice pick?

72
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,001
- Yeah, something along those lines.
- [Beeping]

73
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,480
- Cold steel in the brain... Would that kill him?
- Depending how far it penetrated.

74
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,813
Yeah, it's Booth.
I need, um, all murders in which...

75
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,251
a penetrating wound
to the back of the head figured.

76
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,052

- <i>[Beeps, Closes]</i>

77
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,524

- Oh!

78
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:40,129
<i>You broke into my house?</i>
<i>That is not acceptable.</i>

79
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,640
- This, uh, little device here...
- <i>[Phone Beeping]</i>

80
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,645
- It jams cell phone frequencies.
- [Static]

81
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,649
- That is illegal.
- Unfortunately, illegal is what I do best.

82
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,845
I'm not staying.
I just want you to do something for me.

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,583
- I want you to take a look at my rap sheet.
- Why?

84
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,558
Why? Because I want a chance
to talk to you...

85
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,493
actually talk to you...
without you calling in the 82nd Airborne.

86
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,327
How is reading your police record
going to change my mind?

87
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,799
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- <i>Just do it.</i>

88
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,334
I think our victim
was killed by Ice Pick.

89
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,397
Angela did a facial reconstruction
of Cement Head.

90
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,808
- "Concrete Head," you mean.
- No, "Cement Head." It's got a nicer ring.

91
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,779
So I ran it through Interplus,
and I got a match.

92

West Virginia.

95
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,793
This here is, uh, Hugh Kennedy.

96
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,353
- Uh, I think he killed Cement Head.
- Why?

97
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,525
Well, West Virginia,
likes to use an ice pick on his victims...

98
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,831
plus Ice Pick and Cement Head
were both employed...

99
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,167
by a regional crime boss
from West Virginia...

100
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,639
named Gallagher.

101
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,636
- Well, what are we gonna call him?
- "Gallagher."

102
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:57,308
<i>What, he runs most of the, uh,</i>
<i>prostitutes, strippers...</i>

103
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,511
gambling, bootlegging, meth, extortion
in West Virginia.

104
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,248
Five years ago,
the West Virginia state police...

105
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:08,521
began pressuring Gallagher's criminal operation,
making a lot of arrests.

106
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,290
Including Ice Pick and Cement Head.
Cement Head goes to jail.

107
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:16,233
- Ice Pick? Out on bail, babe.
- You say that like it means something.

108
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,328
I talked to the officer in charge,
and he said that Ice Pick wouldn't say anything...

109
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,033
so they punished him
by lettin' him out on bail.

110
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,668
- How is bail punishment?
- 'Cause it makes Gallagher think...

111
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,042
that Ice Pick cooperated
with the cops.

112
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,412
<i>Ah, it's criminal psychology,</i>
<i>Bones, you know?</i>

113
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,078
You wouldn't get it. Just... read.
Just continue reading there, will ya?

00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:40,184

Kennedy jumped bail.

115
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,196
Hmm. Killed in a car accident while fleeing
a"bail fugitive recovery agent."

116
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,824
- Bounty hunter.
- Car burned the remains to ashes.

117
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,028
All they got was a severed leg.
They didn't actually get Ice Pick's body.

118
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,731
So, we gonna talk
to the bounty hunter?

119
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,674
No, I am. You're gonna make sure that
that severed leg actually belonged to Ice Pick.

120
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,235
- Someone kept the leg?
- The severed leg was frozen as evidence.

121
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,442

might still be alive.

124
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:14,120
But if the facts are in, then it's not jumping
to conclusions. So I never said that.

No. My interest lies only in the femur.

from the vehicle.

00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,828
Yeah... Ah.
Listen, I got the, uh, bounty hunter here.

162
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:40,360
She was an eyewitness to the crash,
saw him incinerated.

163
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:45,035
Tell Booth that Ice Pick's femur
is sliced cleanly at 90 degrees.

164
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,875
I can hear you, Bones, okay?
It's a speakerphone.

165
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,212
<i>Look, amputation like that</i>
<i>could happen in a bad wreck. Right, Cam?</i>

166
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,116
- [Saroyan] Yes.
- [Brennan] Well, there are kerf marks.

167
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:59,021
- [Saroyan] She's seeing evidence of a saw, Booth.
- I know what kerf marks are.

168
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,150
Booth should arrest
the bounty hunter.

169
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,094
<i>I can hear you, Bones.</i>
<i>What am I gonna arrest her for, huh?</i>

170
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,791
For lying. For perjury.
For aiding in a cover-up.

171
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,528
[Saroyan]
If she's there with you, just detain her.

172
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,768
- [Honks Horn]
- Okay.

173
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,698
I'll let you know how that works out.

174
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,044
Hey, huh? Look at that, huh?
D.N.A. is a match.

175
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:30,555
<i>West Virginia state troopers</i>
<i>got a D.N.A. sample at Ice Pick's arrest.</i>

176
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,387
<i>This is definitely his leg.</i>
<i>Was she pretty?</i>

177
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,984
Ice Pick is a male.

178
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,656
I mean, the bounty hunter
who gave Booth the slip.

179
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,928
- You know, she didn't get away
'cause she was pretty.
- She was a she?

180
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,095
- No, she was a... Oh, God.
- What's wrong with your mouth?

181
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:49,267
I'm guessing the anterior molar
on the left side is infected.

182
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,275
The leg was surgically amputated.

183
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,937
- Go to a dentist.
- <i>He's afraid of the dentist.</i>

184
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:59,713
<i>These kerf marks are consistent with a type</i>
<i>of wire saw used to remove horns from heifers.</i>

185
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,982
Ah, so Ice Pick and his bounty hunter
set up a car accident...

186
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,319
with a dummy victim
so everyone stops lookin' for him.

187
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,020
Two years later, he kills Conc...
Cement head.

188
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,655
She hoodwinked you
'cause she was hot.

189
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,632
Look, you know what? She wasn't hot.
In fact, she looked like a man.

190
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,500
The amputation was probably performed
by a livestock veterinarian.

191
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,871
- Hey, Bones, I got that other thing
you want to discuss.
- Oh. Let's...

192
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,207
go to my office so...
we don't disturb Cam.

193
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,375
Booth... livestock amputation? That is one tough,
determined old criminal. Be careful.

194
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,885
- You know, I was goin' through your father's crim...
- [Brennan] Shh!

195
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,117
[Quietly] criminal record,
and he was right about one thing.

196
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,183
- He never ended anyone's life
who didn't have it comin' to 'em.
- He's a sociopath.

197
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,456
Well, maybe, but at least he aimed
in the right direction.

198
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,124
- Ow! God!
- Let me take a look at your tooth.

199
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,192
All right. Just... go easy.
You promise?

200
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,760
- Okay.
- All right?

201
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,807
- Open up.
- [Mumbling]

202
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,811
- What?
- In the Old West,
he would have been considered a hero.

203
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,712
- Yeah, well, the Old West was a time of chaos...
- Ow!

204
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,342
- Uh!
- and violence that, anthropologically speaking...

205
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,352
- our country is still trying to recover from.
- [Groaning]

206
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,322
Yeah. I was right.
Anterior molar on the left side... It's infected.

207
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:17,021
Your father never killed any hardworkin',
tax-paying citizens or honest cops.

208
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,497
- Ow.
- You still think that society should forgive him?

209
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,194
I'm saying, if I have an opportunity
to arrest him, I will.

210
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,035
But you know who maybe
<i>should</i> forgive him?

211
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,132
- His daughter.
- <i>[Cell Phone Beeping]</i>

212
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:35,203
Oh. Look at that.
Our small-town crime boss is here.

213
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,613
Let's go have a little chat with him,
shall we?

214
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:43,244
Billy Ray McKenna
shortly before he became "Cement Head."

215
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:48,453
- I like nicknames.
They're universal mnemonic devices.
- Why are we doing this?

216
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,690
Don't we know that cause of death
was brain scrambling due to an ice pick?

217
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,857
The technical term is "pithing."

218
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,424
And it's not how he died.

219
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,266
<i>It entered the medullary pyramids...</i>

220
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,104
and bevelling on the entry site
suggests it was...

221
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,633
I don't believe there's an English word
that adequately describes...

222
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,875
- "Wiggling." Up and down is "wiggling."
- <i>Okay...</i>

223
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,511
wiggled, thus paralyzing the victim
and causing some difficulty breathing.

224
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,455
- But he would live for upwards of several hours.
- Smart.

225
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,652
<i>Very little blood spilled.</i>
<i>How did the victim die?</i>

226
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,890
Ugh, this is the bad part.

227
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,730
It appears that the concrete
was poured over him while he was still alive.

228
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,792
Oh, God.

229
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,772
These chunks of concrete
are in the shape of...

230
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,331
a sinus cavity...

231
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,343
bronchial tubes...

232
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:43,643
plus a kind of a hollow
around the middle finger.

233
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,650
You said he was paralyzed.

234
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,119
<i>Well, if the ice pick was inserted</i>
<i>and then</i> waggled...

235
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,655
it would affect the median nerve
and the T1 nerve roots.

236
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,129
Which control the flexor carpi radialis.

237
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,167
Anterior palm, thumb, index
and middle fingers.

238
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,533
- But if it was...
- Wiggled...

239
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,665
the victim would lose the ability to move
the ring and pinkie fingers.

240
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,677
We think he wiggled
instead of waggled.

241
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,975
Because he could still move
his middle finger.

242
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,174
It's a terrible way to die.

243
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,650
<i>Our conclusion is that he was trying</i>
<i>to swim to the surface...</i>

244
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,779
using only his middle finger.

245
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,049
The last time I saw Billy Ray McKenna,
he was "So long, suckering" me...

246
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,357
from his F-150 and headin' off
on a well-earned vacation.

247
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,523
Well-earned by torturing a journalist
who was talkin' too much.

248
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,829
Well, I resent your inference.

249
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,995
Get 'em my, uh... what-you-call-it...
tax papers, employment records.

250
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,005
- Did I get that right?
- Not quite.

251
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,167
You resent his implication.
He is implying that you're a criminal.

252
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:48,202
You're taking the inference
from his implication.

253
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:55,417
Uh, according to this,
Mr. Lightner is your flight instructor.

254
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,650
That is correct.
I have, uh, wide-rangin' enterprises.

255
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,693
Clark here is helpful
in gettin' me where I gotta get.

256
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,595
And William Raymond McKenna
is down as a media liaison.

257
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,530
Yep, by breakin'journalists' fingers.

258
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,559
You know, you never asked me
about, uh, Billy Ray McKenna there, big dog.

259
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:17,268
[Chuckles] Well, I assume, big dog,
that Billy Ray is deceased.

260
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:21,143
- Why?
- He was a valued employee.

261
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,943
Disappears for three years,
I gotta assume the worst.

262
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,450
His body was found
encased in concrete.

263
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,091
[Sighs] Tell you what. We're gonna claim
his remains. We'll bury him proper.

264
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,389
- Where'd you send him on vacation?
- Canada.

265
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:40,694
- Canada.
- Was it the mounties that found Billy Ray
encased in cement?

266
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,256
- Concrete.
- Hmm?

267
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,098
Not cement.
It's a common error.

268
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,071
- Baltimore police.
- Is Baltimore on the way to Canada?

269
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,132
Well, the most efficient route
is up through Detroit...

270
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,371
but Billy Ray...
how he loved Vermont so.

271
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,312
Do you have any idea
who might want to kill Mr. McKenna?

272
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,316
[Chuckles]

273
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:03,083
- Oh, well, yeah. He, uh...
Well, how would you put it?
- Aggressive...

274
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,090
both socially and sexually.

275
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,252
How about Hugh Kennedy?

276
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,058
- Hugh Kennedy.
- Yeah... handy with the ice pick.

277
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,032
According to this,
you hired him as...

278
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,968
<i>a "liquor license consultant"</i>
<i>on a per-case basis.</i>

279
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,769
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I remember.
Taciturn type, very dour.

280
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:27,335
Right. In jail for murder once,
manslaughter twice...

281
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:32,817
and suspect in four unsolved murders
all involving ice picks.

282
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,155
You know, good old Hugh
did not put none of that on his résumé.

283
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:43,923
<i>If I recall, Mr. Kennedy was killed in a car accident</i>
<i>fleeing a bail enforcement officer.</i>

284
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,521
Guess he got burned up.

285
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:51,763
<i>Well...[Sighs] you guys look us up</i>
<i>if you're ever in western West Virginia.</i>

286
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:56,774
- We're at Snackie's Roadhouse and Grill.
- Where the 119 hits the 64.

287
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,437
I'll make a note of that.

288
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,707
119 hits the...

289
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,373
- 64.
- <i>64.</i>

293
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,798
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>You used to love 'em...</i>

294
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,130
<i>when you were a little girl.</i>

295
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,534
<i>I got a message for you</i>
<i>from your brother.</i>

296
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,538
What message?

297
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,234
Uh, he says, um...
He says hi.

298
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,071
<i>Have you turned Russ</i>
<i>into a criminal too?</i>

299
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:42,246
Hey, I haven't committed a crime
in over 15 years. I'm straight.

300
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:46,485
Except for killing, gutting and burning
the deputy director of the F.B.I.

301
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,356
He was tryin' to kill Russ,
and then he was going after you.

302
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,896
<i>It is not a crime</i>
<i>to protect your family.</i>

303
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,432
Well, some fathers do it
without killing.

304
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:03,374
- Did, uh, you and Booth
take a look at my, uh, rap sheet?
- Yes.

305
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,707
- And?
- He'll arrest you if he has the chance.

306
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,110
What else?

307
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,317
<i>[Paper Bag Crinkles]</i>

308
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:19,721
<i>So, these snickerdoodles...</i>
<i>Come on. You don't remember?</i>
<i>You loved them as a little girl.</i>

309
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,225
I don't remember.

310
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,627
I'd come home, and then you'd be jumpin' around.
You were five or six years old.

311
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,825
You'd say, " Why don't you put on the 'trying song'?
Put on the 'trying song."'

312
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,369
- The "trying song"?
- It was my favorite song.

313
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:35,304
I used to sing it.
It was, uh, by Poco? The band?

314
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,074
# I've been thinkin' about all

<i>have any, like, official I.D. or anything?</i>

- Dad, he told us.

Wh... What's that all about?

494
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:14,897
If her name's Veleska, she's the same

495

How'd you find him?

496
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:20,274
It's not that hard to find
a one-legged, old white hit man in Baltimore.

497

- Why is she after him?
- She has to make sure that Kennedy stays gone.

498

I'm not going to jail.

499

- What do you got?
- It's a left anterior molar.

500
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,481
It's Booth's tooth.
Now, where's Booth?

501
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,587
- Temperance, honey.
- Kennedy has Booth, Dad. He's got Booth!

502
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,598
Okay.

503
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,828
Perhaps he didn't see Kennedy.

504
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,840
Yeah? Now how'd you come
to that thought?

505
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,173
Well, Kennedy would've left him
with an ice pick protruding from his head.

506
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,839
Just one simple question, big dog.

507
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,315
Did you see Kennedy?

508
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:04,287
<i>We could get our own ice pick,</i>
<i>make it look like Kennedy killed him.</i>

509

You know we can't let you live, right?

510
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,121
<i>You've been struck and restrained.</i>

511
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:14,290
Technically, kidnapping a federal agent
is as bad as murdering him these days.

512
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,357
How would you like to kill him?

513
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,633
First I gotta know for sure...
if Kennedy's dead or alive.

514
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,038
Good luck with that one, big dog.

515
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:29,603
- Big dog.
- Oh, I suppose we could do that thing
that McKenna used to do.

516
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:34,141
- But I'd need a blowtorch
and a sharpened screwdriver.
- Just tell us.

00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:36,049
[Quietly]
Woof.

Huh.

- Can we just go with this please?
- Of course not.

who is a wanted fugitive.
- Ange!

what do I... do?

633
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,869
Do I call you? Do I knock him on the head?
What's my obligation?

634
00:41:54,945 --> 00:42:00,679
If I were you, Bones, I'd wanna know what he has
to tell you about your mother, but, uh...

635
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,810
that's just me.

636
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:13,054
There's, uh, this old song.

637
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,260
- It's called "Keep on Trying."
- Yeah. Poco.

638
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,800
You know it?

639
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,135
# I've been drinkin' now #

640
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:27,166
- #Just a little too much #
- # Much #

641
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,304
- #And I don't know how#
- # Don't know how #

642
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,475
# I can get in touch with you #

643
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,485
- #You #
- [Both Chuckle]

644
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,317
[Together]
#And there's only one thing for me to do #

645
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,586
- <i># It's to keep on tryin'</i> #
- #Tryin' #

646
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,958
- [Together] #To get home to you #
- [Chuckles]

647
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,122
Yeah, what about it?

648
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,168
It's a good old song, right?

649
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,563
Right.

650
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:02,335
<i># [Soft Rock Resumes]</i>

651
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,955
<i># [Ends]</i>

652
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,555
What's that mean?
