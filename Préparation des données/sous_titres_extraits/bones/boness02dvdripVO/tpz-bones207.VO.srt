00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,965
<i>[Woman On Radio]</i>
<i>Coroner Van 3, what's your E. T. A?</i>

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,971
<i>[Radio Chatter]</i>

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,701
<i>[Booth] They found the victim</i>
<i>in the filtration system.</i>

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,744
<i>Just, you know, some bones,</i>
<i>and nobody knows what to make of them.</i>

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,745
I mean, look at this.

6
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,611
Millions of tax dollars
are spent to clean and treat tap water...

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,413
and yet people spend billions
on bottled water.

8
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,148
Well, it's cleaner.
Look, it comes from a clean mountain stream.

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,089
Yeah, which contains
fecal matter from animals.

10
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,719
There's no bones in it, though, is there?
Don't want that in your water.

11
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,958
Excuse me. Um, do you know
how long this is gonna take?

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,128
- Department wants to know
when I can get back on line.
- <i>[Man] Bag that and mark it.</i>

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,636
Any way to determine
where the body originated?

14
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,903
Water comes here through pipelines
that travel through five different states.

15
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,342
<i>That's why I called the feds in.</i>

16
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,279
Great. How many miles of pipe?

17
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,339
About 1,800.

18
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,250
I'm gonna need a schematic
of the entire system as soon as you can.

19
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,913
- Sure.
- Yeah. Bones?

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,358
Swirl treatment sped the rate of decomp.
Death was most likely less than three months ago.

21
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,862
The sacrum is small, still developing.

22
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,025
A kid.

23
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,535
A little girl...

24
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,094
about eight to 10 years old.

25
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,271
[Chattering]

26
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,868
[Booth]
Hey, any luck with the cause of death?

27
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,813
[Zack] Eh, postmortem trauma
makes assignation of cause difficult.

28
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,282
Great. "No" would've been just fine.

29
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:30,311
There are bands of discoloration on the ribs.
Cam might find out why with a tox screen.

30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,689
I'd like those clothes as soon as I can get 'em.
Lots of crusty bugs and slime.

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,719
All yours.
Zack, spend some time with the teeth.

32
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,698
- They should be more discolored.
- Everything okay here?

33
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,497
Yeah, sure. Hey. You know?

34
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,038
- How's things?
- You know, murder and stuff.

35
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,199
Just another day at the office.
How about you?

36
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,242
Same old same old.

37
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,337
<i>Listen, the Bureau's running location checks</i>
<i>for registered pedophiles in the area...</i>

38
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,882
but we can't do much until we,
you know, I.D. the girl.

39
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,010
<i>I'm running D.N.A. on the hairs</i>
<i>I pulled from the skull.</i>

40
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,987
There's something funky about it.
The roots confirm brown hair.

41
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,492
<i>The blonde is from oxidized thiols</i>
<i>evident in the hair shaft.</i>

42
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,858
- Her hair was bleached?
- Wait, come on. I mean,
what nine-year-old dyes her hair?

43
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,693
Well, that might explain why my sketch...

44
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,427
isn't getting any hits from
the missing children's database.

45
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,096
<i>Zack, look at the remains again</i>
<i>with a focus...</i>

46
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:22,164
<i>on any physical anomalies that</i>
<i>could hamper identification.</i>

47
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,733
- I've got results cooking, so...
- Sure. Yeah. See you later.

48
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,081
- <i>Don't you have work to do?</i>
- Don't you?

49
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,140
[Chuckles]

50
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,412
Right. Right.

51
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:39,884
<i>I should be able to run a tox screen</i>
<i>with the tissue left on her clavicle.</i>

52
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,451
The scrapings that I took from the cheek
and eye socket contain propylene glycol...

53
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,227
- fragrance, dyes and lanolin.
- She was wearing makeup?

54
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,600
I was going to use dentition
to narrow down the age range, but look.

55
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,375
<i>She has false teeth?</i>

56
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,434
What the hell happened to this kid?

57
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,278
- The false teeth replace
the missing deciduous teeth.
- Baby teeth.

58
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,613
<i>And the other teeth were veneered.</i>

59
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,553
What is she?
A midget stripper?

60
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,785
[Angela] Okay, this is the color
she would've had from the bleaching.

61
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,884
[Hodgins] I think the alkaloids
would make the color brighter.

62
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:19,591
<i>Okay, so some twisted psycho killer gives</i>
<i>this little girl a makeover before he kills her?</i>

63
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,796
I hate working with kids.
Childhood should be all about swings.

64
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,431
- Swings?
- Yeah. You know, how high can I go?

65
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,839
If I twist the chains,
how fast will I spin?

66
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,309
What if I try to jump off
before the swing stops?

67
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,642
- Exactly.
- <i>[Hodgins] I miss that feeling.</i>

68
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,673
- Yeah. Me too.
- I miss organic chemistry class.

69
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,515
- Those were good times.
- I miss my first microscope.

70
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,284
Great. Yeah.
And I miss normal people. Can we go on?

71
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,224
- Factor in the teeth.
- [Beeping]

72
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,421
<i>Yeah, you know? Because, uh,</i>
<i>this isn't weird enough.</i>

73
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,523
Hodgins supplied the types of makeup.

74
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,331
<i>And that's what we've got.</i>

75
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,339
- She looks 30.
- Okay, run the image against the database now.

76
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,001
[Beeping]

77
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,278
Oh, my God.
That's Brianna Swanson.

78
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,285
- Who?
- The little beauty queen
who disappeared a few months ago.

79
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,481
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>In the middle of the Little</i>
<i>Miss Junior Patriot Pageant.</i>

80
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,047
Just nine years old.

81
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,830
What do you mean...

82
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,838
there isn't even
enough of her for me to see?

83
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,897
The body traveled
through miles of piping.

84
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,705
And then after three months...

85
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,078
[Crying]
She was so beautiful, wasn't she?

86
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,175
I always thought someday she'd come back.

87
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,120
I even filled out her application
to theJunior Miss Starlite competition.

88
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,783
She would've won her division.

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,292
We're very sorry for your loss.

90
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:37,933
<i>Ms. Swanson, I discovered dental work</i>
<i>on Brianna one doesn't usually see on a child.</i>

91
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,206
The veneers and the caps? Yeah.
A lot of the girls had them.

92
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,403
Statistically, that's... that's not true.

93
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,641
<i>Well, Brianna took some antibiotics</i>
<i>when she was a baby that stained her teeth.</i>

94
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:53,778
<i>She was very self-conscious about that,</i>
<i>so I wanted her to feel good about herself.</i>

95
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:58,222
A nine-year-old is hardly mature enough
to make an informed decision about...

96
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,886
You were at the competition in Delaware
when Brianna went missing, correct?

97
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,555
Yeah. I never missed a pageant.
I never would.

98
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,327
But you weren't... you weren't with her
when, uh, she disappeared?

99
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,734
No. I left her alone
in our room for a minute.

100
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,738
When I came back, she was gone.

101
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,508
There's not a day that goes by
that I don't hate myself for that.

102
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,574
According to initial reports, you suspected
your ex-husband of kidnapping Brianna?

103
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,620
Well, he was trying to get custody of her
for over a year. Yeah.

104
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,454
<i>David was not fit to be a father.</i>
<i>He wanted Brianna out of spite.</i>

105
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,459
And he tried to drown me
in lawyer fees.

106
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,257
Was your ex-husband violent
with you or Brianna?

107
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,891
<i>Not physically, no.</i>
<i>But once when we were fighting...</i>

108
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:45,666
he said that he would rather have Brianna
end up in a ditch somewhere than turn out like me.

109
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,005
It's the "evening wear" category
that gets me.

110
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,945
My evening wear's a ratty
T-shirt and a mud mask.

111
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,347
There's bleeding evident
under the mental foramen.

112
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,750
There was complete disruption
of all ventral ligaments...

113
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,653
between the victim's skull
and the first and second vertebrae.

114
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,782
Her neck was broken.

115
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,883
Dislocated fracture of the mandible
suggests her death was caused...

116
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,428
by a strong blow to the chin
by an object heavy enough...

117
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:14,227
to leave markings
on her mental foramen.

118
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,326
I found fragments of steel
in the victim's jacket.

119
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,806
There was also an excessive amount
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

120
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,808
<i>I assume that means something.</i>

121
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,367
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
are found in soot...

122
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,904
<i>pesticides, creosotes, roofing tar.</i>

123
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,179
The original police report said
Brianna's father was a roofer.

124
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,482
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Interesting coincidence, huh?</i>

125
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,013
- I'll call Booth.
- About this?

126
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:45,219
- You have a roofing business?
- Uh, yeah.

127
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,029
I... I... I went out on my own
when Brianna was born.

128
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,036
<i>Thought I could make</i>
<i>some more money, you know?</i>

129
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,595
<i>Do you use mastic asphalt</i>
<i>in your work?</i>

130
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,869
Uh, yeah, for waterproofing.

131
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,605
- <i>Why?</i>
- Were you working
the day your daughter disappeared?

132
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,739
No. It was the weekend.
What are you guys getting at?

133
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,784
We're just trying to piece things together.
That's all.

134
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,015
Damn it! I answered all these questions
when Brianna first went missing.

135
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,017
- This is Jackie's doing, right?
- You wanted your daughter back.

136
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,585
Sometimes in a divorce, the emotions get
a little high, you don't know what you're doing.

137
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,030
No. I know exactly what happened.

138
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,400
Jackie wasted so much time having the cops
check me out, the case went cold.

139
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,530
<i>This is all Jackie's fault.</i>

140
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,371
Look.

141
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,969
This was my little girl.

142
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,071
Not whatJackie turned her into.

143
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,584
This is who I wanted back.

144
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,813
You, uh...

145
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,950
You didn't give her
the remains, did you?

146
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,222
No. We can't release them.

147
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,628
Not before the investigation
is completed.

148
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,531
I want her buried right.

149
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,503
I don't want her funeral to be some
disgusting show Jackie puts on.

150
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:06,304
I want to bury her
with some love, you know?

151
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,650
[Beeping]

152
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,057
How's it going?

153
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:23,721
F.B.I. sent over the security tapes from
the hotel where Brianna's pageant was held.

154
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,026
<i>I'm running them through</i>
<i>the body mass recognition program.</i>

155
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,929
Maybe we'll find a shot of her
leaving with somebody.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,833
- <i>[Hodgins] Could you ever do this to your kid?</i>
- <i>[Angela] You know me.</i>

157
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,031
I'm all about the swings.

158
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,131
- Did you bring me something?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

159
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,006
This was in the zippered pocket
of what was left of Brianna's jacket.

160
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,536
It's treated cellulose.
Can you get any details from it?

161
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,243
I'll give it a shot.

162
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,954
Listen, Angela.

163
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,927
We've been dancing around this
for months now...

164
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,328
like two pieces of neodymium
caught in a magnetic field.

165
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,231
- [Chuckles] Is that good?
- Yeah.

166
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,792
But if the field weakens, they fly apart.

167
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,737
Which is why I thought
they should go on a date.

168
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,700
- Hodgins...
- You can't say that you don't feel it.

169
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,640
Come on.
We owe it to ourselves to give it a try.

170
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,483
I... I just don't think
it would be a good idea.

171
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,320
I mean, we work together, Jack.

172
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,192
- Angela...
- I'm sorry.

173
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,897
You're making a mistake.

174
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,339
I'll examine the paper
after I go through the videos.

175
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,900
Sure.

176
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,877
<i>This is the rib cage</i>
<i>of a healthy 10-year-old girl.</i>

177
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,751
And this... is our victim's rib cage.

178
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,789
Ouch.

179
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,224
<i>This is an X-ray of a teenage</i>
<i>girl who died in 1872.</i>

180
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,751
- What caused the deformity? Was it genetic?
- It was a corset...

181
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,798
<i>tightened a little more each day.</i>

182
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,266
Based on the degree of misshaping...

183
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,530
I'd say Brianna slept in one every night.

184
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,630
- That's torture.
- <i>[Brennan] I imagine it was to give her...</i>

185
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:18,268
an hourglass figure, which wouldn't be
possible naturally until well into puberty.

186
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,812
You gotta be... You're telling me
her mom did this to her?

187
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,873
<i>People have done much worse for beauty...</i>
<i>neck stretching, foot binding...</i>

188
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,942
- Okay. And you're saying that makes it okay?
- Well, of course not.

189
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,116
Any major alteration of our underlying
architecture demeans us.

190
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,456
You know, we all have aspects of ourselves
we might wish were different.

191
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,726
Yes. I wanted larger biceps before I became
comfortable with my mental acuity.

192
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,927
- [Grunts]
- Here, you can see...

193
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:47,302
<i>cribra orbitalia, suggesting Brianna</i>
<i>suffered from long-term malnourishment.</i>

194
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,307
There's no enamel erosion
to indicate bulimia...

195
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,937
so it's more likely she's been
on a calorie-controlled diet for at least two years.

196
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,982
- Oh, it gets better.
- Oh, how can it not?

<i>What you have to understand</i>
<i>is that this was Brianna's dream, not mine.</i>

216
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,054
You put your nine-year-old
daughter in a corset, Ms. Swanson.

217
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,454
- A corset.
- Yeah. Brianna ordered that
off the Internet herself.

218
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,516
And I didn't tighten it up very much.

219
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,527
Did you ever think to tell Brianna...

220
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,530
that she didn't need to alter
her physical appearance in order to be loved?

221
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:23,056
- Did Brianna disappoint you somehow?
- No. She was a perfect angel.

222
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,231
She won every competition, even her first one.
And after that, it was music and dance classes.

223
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,434
- She was a real competitor.
- And when she won, it reflected well on you.

224
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,273
That way you wouldn't have to deal
with your own physical identity.

225
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,041
- I don't like her.
- Whoa.

226
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,414
Let's... play a little
show-and-tell, shall we, hmm?

227
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,216
How about this?
Can you explain these? This there.

228
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,383
And then that one... my favorite one.

229
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,359
Okay, these...

230
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,226
these are right before
she disappeared.

231
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,859
- We had a... disagreement.
- About the pageant?

232
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,426
No. About her piano piece.
I suggested she use her elbow...

233
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,065
to hit the last note with her head in her hands,
give the audience a little smile.

234
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,473
- It's called dazzle.
- And she didn't want to do that?

235
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,205
No. She didn't want dazzle.
She wanted to finish it perfectly.

236
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,542
But it seems very silly now.

237
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,883
- Only now?
- What happened immediately following this?

238
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:22,888
I sent her up to our room, and I sent myself
to the hotel bar for a very large glass of rosé.

239
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,329
And believe me, I was not the only mother
doing the exact same thing.

240
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:31,768
Great. I'm sure you can provide me
with a list of the other mothers. Hmm?

241
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,407
Blood would've rushed to the injured areas
that are evident on her X-rays...

242
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,468
but there's no evidence of blood flow
here or here or here.

243
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,480
So she was beaten after she died.

244
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,516
The blows appear to be
consistent with kicking...

245
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,575
but the dispersal pattern
is abnormal.

246
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,985
Can you tell anything about the shoes?
Size? Make?

247
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,855
Only that they are quite rigid,
possibly steel-toed.

248
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:58,420
And Hodgins said he found
fragments of steel in the jacket.

249
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,488
[Exhales]

250
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,702
- Hodgins asked me out.
- [Gasps]

251
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,370
Is that why you're hiding in here?

252
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,875
I'm not hiding.
I need advice.

253
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,606
What?
On a personal matter?

254
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,875
- Yes.
- From me?

255
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,350
- Yes.
- But romance is sort of...

256
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,956
This is like me asking you
advice on phylogenetic systematics.

257
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,151
Phylogenetic systematics.

258
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,022
I have no idea what that is.

259
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,691
- Exactly.
- Well, I can't ask Cam.

260
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,225
- Can't ask Cam what?
- Oh, Hodgins asked Angela out on a date.

261
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,171
- Brennan!
- What? Was it a secret?

262
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,299
<i>It was a secret.</i>

263
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,401
<i>I just came to ask if you'd made</i>
<i>any progress on the cellulose.</i>

264
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,447
- No.
- Okay.

265
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,814
Wait. You can't pretend
you didn't hear about this.

266
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,548
- Fine. What'd you tell him?
- No.

267
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,147
- Why?
- Because it would be a disaster.

268
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,250
All of a sudden,
you have an opinion on this?

269
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,092
You should never indulge in a romantic
relationship with someone you work with.

270
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,860
- Why not?
- Well, anthropologically?

271
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,265
There's an anthropological answer?

272
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,499
An efficient workplace
is predicated upon a simple hierarchy.

273
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,040
<i>Romance undermines that hierarchy.</i>

274
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:21,273
This is like when I had an affair
with my thesis supervisor in college.

275
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,838
Don't think we have time for that.
I say go.

276
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,612
- What about this hierarchical-sexual?
- Won't be an issue.

277
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,051
<i>It's always fun to flirt</i>
<i>in the workplace.</i>

278
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,919
But out there, when fantasy
becomes a reality, it's a drag.

279
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,856
What? The date will be bad?

280
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,123
It will be awful.
You'll both realize it's not meant to be.

281
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:41,064
<i>There'll be a couple days of awkwardness,</i>
<i>and then everything goes back to normal.</i>

282
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,624
<i>If I were you,</i>
<i>I'd go with Cam on this one.</i>

283
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:48,401
- Why?
- Phylogenetic systematics.

284
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,643
I have to go to dance class.

285
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,282
[Sighs]

286
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,418
- <i># [Background: Disco]</i>
- <i>[Booth] Becky Swanson's alibi checks out.</i>

287
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,477
She was in the bar
when Brianna disappeared.

288
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,648
Can't we just prosecute her
for being horrible?

289
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,715
That the dance teacher?

290
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,489
- <i>[Booth] Yeah. That's Charlotte Craft.</i>
- Good.

291
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,122
She owns the studio.
She also runs theJunior Miss Patriot Pageant.

292
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,462
I mean, she's gotta be able
to give us something, right?

293
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,468
I always wanted to take dance...

294
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,801
- but I was so gawky and uncoordinated.
- What? You?

295
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,206
Later I understood that
the gawkiness was caused...

296
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,301
by an asymmetrical development
of the iliac crest.

297
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,744
Oh, yeah. Because you know what?
That's what I would've guessed.

298
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,580
- The old, uh, iliac crest.
- Hi. Which one's yours?

299
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,017
- Hmm?
- Which what is what? What? Mine? Ours?

300
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,248
Ours? Oh, no, no.

301
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,485
Whoa. We're not...
[Chuckles] No. No, no. That's not...

302
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,618

We're... F.B.I.

303
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,992

- Mm-hmm.

304
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,795
Oh, are you here
about Brianna Swanson?

305
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,665
- Did you know Brianna?
- Yeah. Very well.

306
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,705
I'm Kristen Mitchell.

307
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,606
That's my daughter Ariel by the bar,
with the gray leg warmers.

308
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:02,773
They... They took classes together,
were in the same pageants.

309
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,306
Sometimes I can't help but wonder,
what if it had been Ariel who got kidnapped?

310
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,218
Why do you assume she was kidnapped?

311
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,155
Well, I can't imagine Brianna
just running away.

312
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,990
Well, these pageants are very competitive.
There was a lot of pressure probably on her.

313
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:19,827
[Scoffs]
To Brianna? Uh, no. No way.

314
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,389
I mean, she had the face of an angel,
but underneath...

315
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,564
<i>let's just say she had her sights set</i>
<i>on winning that pageant.</i>

316
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,663
Why?

317
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,800
- I don't understand the question.
- What's the draw here?

318
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,869
Oh, my God.
The girls, they love it.

319
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:39,884
They get to dress up all glamorous,
all the attention, the lights and the music.

320
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,819
<i>All right, girls. That's enough for today.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

321
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,982
<i>There's enough pressure</i>
<i>on young females...</i>

322
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,083
without making them
prematurely sexualized.

323
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,652
[Scoffs] I am sorry, but that is just
narrow-minded prejudice.

324
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,099
I was in pageants my entire childhood.
I loved 'em.

325
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,898
And they sent me to college
on a full scholarship.

326
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:04,066
- <i>Hey, Mommy, I'm finished.</i>
- Hey, hon.

327
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,077
Nice job.

328
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,375
And good focus.

329
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,711
- Thanks.
- [Chuckles]

330
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:14,445
Well, I hope you find
the man responsible.

331
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,581
Agent Booth?
I've got about 20 minutes till my next class.

332
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,682
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

333
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,785
- Oh, you know, why don't, uh...
why don't you go mingle?
- What? Why me?

334
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,092
- Because you're a girl.
- What?

335
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,124
Listen, because it's illegal for me to question
any of these kids without their parents, okay?

336
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,365
Look, you're a civilian.
Okay? So take your pick.

337
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,497
Good point.

338
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,905
Behold the keepers of mystery...

339
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,972
the <i>Sphecius speciosus</i>
and his trusty sidekick, the <i>Tibicen lyricen.</i>

340
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,645
Ooh. Aah.

341
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,711
What mystery?

342
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,383
If Brianna Swanson was kidnapped,
they didn't take her far.

343
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,722
The presence of these two species
together suggests that...

344
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:59,093
she died within a one-mile radius
of the hotel where she disappeared.

345
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,327
That whole area was thoroughly searched
within hours of her disappearance.

346
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,804
Yeah. I think her body was jammed
into a storm culvert for over a month...

347
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,500
until those thunderstorms
two weeks ago...

348
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,009
Washed the remains
down to the treatment plant.

349
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,204
F.B.I. forensics should check out
the culverts and drains...

350
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,306
- large enough for a nine-year-old girl
around the hotel.
- I'll tell Booth.

351
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,055
[Chuckling]
Hey.

352
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,318
Don't come around again
looking for a second chance.

353
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,792
That was a one-time offer, baby.

354
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,421
Really? Hmm.

355
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,524
No. What? No.

356
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,536
No, no.
Not... Not really.

357
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,437
I mean, it never occurred to me
that you would...

358
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,208
Okay, now you talk.

359
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:51,375
I accept going on a date
with you soon.

360
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,318
- Tonight?
- [Chuckling]

361
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,787
Wow. That is soon.

362
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,949
I don't wanna give you time
to change your mind.

363
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,785
What do you wanna do?

364
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,853
You asked me.

365
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,024
Figure it out.

366
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,404
Thank you.

367
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,307
- [Beeps]
- I took this at the pageant...

368
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,370
about a half an hour
before Brianna disappeared.

369
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,711
- Did you show it to the police?
- No.

370
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,980
- Why not?
- Because he's not some murderous pedophile.

371
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,784
- He's the 17-year-old brother
of one of the contestants.
- Then why'd you take his picture?

372
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,849
Well, to show his parents how
creepy he seems hanging around.

373
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,326
He could be such a good-looking boy.

374
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,387
What's his name?

375
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,591
Jeremy Ferrell.

376
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,933
Look, I know he dresses in black and mopes
around, but he's totally harmless.

377
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:50,600
- Hmm. I'm gonna need a copy of this picture.
- Certainly.

378
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,576
<i>[Girl]</i>
<i>Is that a real skeleton?</i>

379
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,044
Yes, of a 12-year-old
from the Bronze Age.

380
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,547
These bones show
she'd already had children.

381
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,846
- What killed her?
- Having the children.

382
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:04,048
She should've waited to be
married before she had sex.

383
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,181
You said "sex."

384
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,091
Were you girls in theJunior
Miss Patriot Pageant?

385
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,756
- I came in fourth.
- If Brianna was there, you'd have been fifth.

386
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,425
<i>It must have been hard</i>
<i>to lose your friend like that.</i>

387
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,561
Brianna was kind of mean.
She said Liza had cankles.

388
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:23,472
- What are cankles?
- Where your calves and your ankles
are the same thing.

389
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:28,479
She took my birthday watch too.
She'd take anything she liked.

390
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,141
- So you weren't friends?
- You had to be friends with her.

391
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:35,550
- Why?
- Because Brianna was the queen.

392
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,986
So yours was a cultural structure...

393
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,548
predicated on the equation
of beauty with power.

394
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,821
You instinctively align
yourselves with someone...

395
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,921
<i>who holds the greatest potential</i>
<i>for societal supremacy.</i>

396
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:51,594
It's a Darwinian pressure
you're too young to bear.

397
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,104
<i>Okay. Come on, Bones.</i>
<i>Up you go.</i>

398
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,163
[Grunts]
There you go.

399
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,607
- You have huge muscles.
- <i>[Booth] Thanks.</i>

400
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,645
Learn anything?

401
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,476
- <i>Yeah, I learned about cankles. How about you?</i>
- I found a possible suspect.

402
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,119
<i>Well, Cam and Zack said that Brianna</i>
<i>was kicked with a steel-toed boot.</i>

403
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:14,921
<i>Looks like my possible suspect</i>
<i>just became our primary suspect.</i>

404
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:26,068
Of course.
I'm at every pageant.

405
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,197
Okay, you see what happens?

406
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,207
Look, I make him come...

407
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:34,507
to carry Haley's changes
and the props for her talent competition.

408
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:38,777
Well, you know, a lot of kids his age,
they'd... they'd just refuse.

409
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,115
Okay, so what? So then
I'm a... I'm a bad kid because I'm a good kid?

410
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,849
Mmm.
What do you call this look?

411
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,154
- It's not a look.
- Emo. It's called emo.

412
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,024
- No, it's not.
- It's short for overly emotive.

413
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,463
No, Mom. No, it's not. Okay?
I like these clothes. I like this hair.

414
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,661
It's not emo.
It's not anything.

415
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,302
- You have a girlfriend?
- He does.

416
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,898
She looks exactly like him.

417
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,000
Are you guys, like,
real boyfriend and girlfriend?

418
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,341
What do you mean?
What? Do we have sex?

419
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,211
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Why? Because if we don't...

420
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,911
then I'm just... I'm some pervert
who's got a thing for little girls?

421
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,716
The day that this, uh, picture was taken,
did you speak with Brianna Swanson?

422
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,724
- Yeah.
- Jeremy?

423
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:25,820
- She was picking on my little sister.
- Oh. And did you argue?

424
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,923
<i>You don't argue with a nine-year-old.</i>
<i>You call each other names.</i>

425
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,833
Are you wearing the same shoes
that you wore that day?

426
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:36,067
- No.
- Yes. He's worn the same thing
every day for a year.

427
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,735
- <i>Would you be willing to give us those shoes?</i>
- No.

428
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,038
- Yes.
- Mom!

429
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:44,377
Just this once, Jeremy,
do what I tell you, okay?

430
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,384
I... I know you didn't do this, honey.

431
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,580
I know who you are under all this.

432
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,448
Give the F.B.I. your shoes.

433
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,498
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>Not the shoes.</i>

434
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,433
- How do you know?
- First, the caps are plasticized chrome,
not stainless steel.

435
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,199
<i>And they're too broad and rounded</i>
<i>to have caused the damage...</i>

436
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,571
- to Brianna Swanson's bones.
- Tell Cam and Booth.

437
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,545
- You do it.
- Why?

438
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,808
Because I have a date.

439
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,720
<i>Here's the thing, Angela.</i>
<i>I know you've been out with a lot of guys.</i>

440
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,018
Hey, you have a different
girlfriend twice a month.

441
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,389
Yeah. So imagine the pressure
to come up with a date...

442
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,553
that neither one of us
has ever been on before.

443
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,563
So what's up?

444
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,964
We here to walk a dog or something?

445
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:40,437
I remember what you said
about how you used to feel on a swing.

446
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,208
[Whirring]

447
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,681
It looks like colored dots,
but it's so faded.

448
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,184
<i>Could this be a candy bar wrapper?</i>

449
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,016
I don't think Brianna
was supposed to eat candy.

450
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,285
There were a lot of things I wasn't
supposed to do as a kid. I still did them.

451
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:04,226
- I haven't changed much.
- Bones, anything on the emo shoes?

452
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,424
- Not a match. Sorry.
- What's with the, uh, Milk Blast Bar wrapper?

453
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,933
Milk Blast Bar?

454
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,299
- Yeah.
- What's a Milk Blast Bar?

455
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,362
It's about the cheapest,
worst ice cream bar you can get.

456
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,273
[Imitating TVAnnouncer]
Available only at Red Shed convenience stores.

457
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,470
- [Chuckles]
- [Together] # Red Shed #

458
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,480
- #What you need now, and how #
- Yeah!

459
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,539
I thought they stopped making them.

460
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,881
Yeah. I thought I just ate 'em all.
[Chuckles, Snorts]

461
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,786
Well, maybe we should determine
how Brianna Swanson got ahold of one.

462
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,050
Brianna Swanson?

463
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,285
- Hodgins found the wrapper with her remains.
- <i>[Dialing]</i>

464
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,453
Yeah, it's Booth.
Listen, I need a search...

465
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,463
for any Red Shed
convenience store...

466
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,125
within a one-mile radius of
the Hyperion Hotel off of 171.

467
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,997
Thanks.

468
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,334
Look, I wouldn't have laughed so hard
if I knew it was Brianna Swanson.

469
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:53,544
- <i>Oh, my God. I'm gonna puke.</i>
- <i>Put your head back. Head back! Head back!</i>

470
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,080
Oh! I'm gonna puke.
I'm gonna puke.

471
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,672
- No, don't. You all right?
- [Laughing]

472
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,047
- Yes.
- Yeah?

473
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,052
Not... Don't do it again.

474
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,645
It was fun.

475
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,691
I never thought
I'd be doing this again.

476
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,726
- Really?
- Really.

477
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,557
You know, I had a little dream
about it last night.

- Yeah. It ended well too.

- I'm sure it did.
- But you know what? You look much better here.

So the F.B.I. forensic units
are sweeping the culverts near the hotel.

490
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,287
So I figured, you know, while we were waiting,
we'd just go have a look around.

491
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:30,170
- Right there. There it is.
- <i>[Brennan] Well hidden.</i>

00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:38,341

494
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:42,512
Oh, what do we got there?

495
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,256
It's a pageant medal.

into a culvert this size
in a prone position.

500
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,937
The kicks to the back
were the attacker's attempt...

501
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,948
to force the body farther into the culvert
where it couldn't be seen.

- Kristen Mitchell.
- Oh, my God.

Yes. My daughter did win the pageant
after Brianna disappeared.

516
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,331
That's not a secret. The winner, Ariel,
went on to the national competition.

517
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,898
And how did Ariel do in the nationals?

518
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,878
- Very well. Finished in the top 10.
- <i>Top 10? Wow.</i>

Brianna Swanson was a thief,

I mean, ask anybody.
She probably took it out of my bag.

527

Did you report it missing?

three, four.

531
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,754
And she was kicked twice in the
same place here, twice as deep.

532
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,158
So five, six.

533
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:08,529
There's an asymmetry
both of force and distance to these kicks.

534

<i>The fracture pattern suggests</i>
<i>a slight rotation to the blows.</i>

- Okay, I need to know if her hips are even.

541

- It's from the parking lot
at the Red Shed convenience store.

The F.B.I. forensics team found
minute traces of blood on it.

00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:17,527
We brought it in here to compare the edging
with the marks on the victim's chin.

- <i>[Brennan] And we can see here...</i>
- It's a match.

00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:25,501
The angle and force of the blow
suggest Brianna fell forward...

and caught her chin here.

00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:39,716
- Why didn't you tell me?
- [Crying] The pageant was starting.

639
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,157
I wanted to win.

640
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,220
Oh. Oh, God.

641
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,550
Hi.

642
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,555
Hi.

643
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,251
We didn't really
get a chance to talk today.

644
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:19,023
Yeah.
I was avoiding you.

645
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:24,329
That whole swing thing wasn't good enough, right?
'Cause I can do better.

646
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,404
- It was perfect.
- It was?

647
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:33,603
- Maybe the best date I've ever had.
- Really?

648
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,175
Great. That's great.

649
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,844
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- Yeah.

650
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,444
That's not great.

651
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,421
How can a great date be not great?

652
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,586
Because it was
supposed to fall flat.

653
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:55,029
That way, we'd both know
that this wasn't meant to be...

654
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,294
and we'd go back
to the way we were before.

655
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,802
I don't like the way it was before.

656
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,239
Look, Brennan
is my best friend...

657
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,277
and... Zack is...

658
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,279
whatever the hell he is.

659
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,680
And when this goes wrong, it...

660
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,776
it pulls everybody else into it.

661
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,755
And what the great date tells us...

662
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,089
is that when it goes wrong...

663
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,993
It'll go really, really wrong.

664
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,657
Yeah.

665
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,493
So...

666
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,506
we go back, right?

667
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,938
Friends.

668
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:46,005
Sure, friends.

669
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,146
Just one question.

670
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,388
What if it doesn't end that way?

671
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,790
What if it doesn't go wrong?

672
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,756
Friends.

673
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,786
This is what happened
when Rome fell.

674
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,852
What? Uh, people ate
stale doughnuts?

675
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,457
Objectification of women,
beauty as self-esteem.

676
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,059
Well, I think, um...

677
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,570
you know, some of those kids
actually had a good time.

678
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,630
The girl in the pink
could really dance.

679
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:46,505
But then again, Nero could
really play the fiddle.

680
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,670
You know, Bones,
I like to think that, um...

681
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,978
someplace deep inside,
people really know what's important.

682
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,384
It's hard to believe when you see women
trying to disguise or change themselves.

683
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,389
- Mmm.
- I never understood that.

684
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,188
- Well, I mean, no, of course you wouldn't.
- Why?

685
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,163
Well, it's just, you know,
someone who looks like you...

686
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,768
well, wouldn't...

687
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,736
Just because of the way you look.

688
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,535
I don't understand.
What... way do I look?

689
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:21,738
Well, you know, you're...
you're structured...

690
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,578
very well.

691
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,675
As are you.

692
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,254
[Sighs]

693
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,460
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

694
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,401
It's just... Whew.

695
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,597
I just... I remembered
that I had an appointment.

696
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:55,211
Oh. So, um, I'll see you tomorrow?

697
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:07,289
No. You know, you have all the
paperwork for the case, right?

698
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,885
No. I was...
I was gonna stay and do it anyway, so...

699
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:14,727
- No. You know, it's our case. I wanna help.
- You don't have to, Booth.

700
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,323
- Bones, just drop it, okay? I'm here to help.

00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:21,667
Well, what about your appointment?

702
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:25,175
Uh, it's... You know, it's no big deal.
I'll tell you what.

703
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:30,441
How about I order some takeout
and I ditch these doughnuts?

704
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,005
Sure.

705
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,649

Thai food?

708
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,090
This time, I'm ordering extra mee krob
because you ate it last time.

709
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,290
- All of it.
- What? I thought you were done.

710
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,299
- Oh, right. I was done?
- Yeah.

711
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:54,599
- You finished all of it.
- I did not. You were pretty focused
on the fried rice.

712
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,937
- Can we just order? Okay?
- Fine.
