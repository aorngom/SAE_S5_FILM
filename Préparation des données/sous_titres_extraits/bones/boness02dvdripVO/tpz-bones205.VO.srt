- Yeah, that was...
- Amazing.

<i>Is there any chance that</i>
<i>he was put in there alive?</i>

94
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,901
If we find any rope or duct tape on the body,
I'd say there's a good chance.

95
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,307
<i>Okay, people. Let's start with the who.</i>
<i>We'll worry about the why and the how later.</i>

96
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,074
But if we find the why
and the how first, we'll gladly take it.

97
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,876
Though "who" is
clearly the priority.

98
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,974
The who is not going to change.

99
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,952
<i>But the clues might</i>
<i>if we don't hurry.</i>

100
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,321
- What's our starting weight, Zack?
- Starting weight is 542.13.

101
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,054
The tub itself weighs
about 200 pounds.

102
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,062
Capacity is 34 gallons.

103
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,590
Which at about 8.3 pounds
a gallon comes to 270, 275.

104
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,034
And two-thirds full
makes it about 180...

105
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,005
putting this guy somewhere
in the 160-pound weight class.

106
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:18,407
The cream always rises.
Or in this case, melted body fat.

107
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,572
I'll measure its volume
to determine body type.

108
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,343
I'll start separating all things
chemical from organic.

109
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,147
<i>And I know you requested</i>
<i>a strainer of some sort, Dr. Brennan...</i>

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,154
but I thought this could be of use.

111
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,156
For the big pieces maybe.

112
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,988
After that, old MacZacky,
get on the horn with the coroner's office...

113
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,518
<i>and tell them I want two field unit</i>
<i>water sifters sent here A.S.A.P.</i>

114
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,498
- They get mad when I drop your name.
- Then drop it twice.

115
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,135
Talk about the proof in the pudding.

116
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,501
Oh, even for me, this is disgusting.

117
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,130
Was this too much even for Booth?

118
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,472
He's still questioning
the workers at the site.

119
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:56,208
Hopefully, there's enough
skull here for a partial reconstruction.

120
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,807
Hmm. I've worked with less.

121
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,020
Right femur's pitted and brittle.

122
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,353
<i>Marrow's practically gelatinized.</i>

123
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,985
- Our victim's elderly.
- Well, that's a bit of a leap.

124
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,893
Well, not really.
Zack, hold still.

125
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,834
It's a hip replacement.

126
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,963
Don't these things usually come
engraved with serial numbers?

127
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,939
Uh, not this one.

128
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,875
It looks like the chemicals
burned those off too.

129
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,254
Hey, so where is Mr. Tub o' Lard?

130
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,256
<i>I figured they'd bring him here.</i>

131
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:42,055
Lard I've got plenty of. The rest of him's
in the "ookey" room where he belongs.

132
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,063
Oh! Wow, so then that
nasty yellow goop is...

133
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,827
<i>Fat. 9.3 liters so far.</i>

134
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,528
Oh, good. Booth, I'm sure
you'll want to see this too.

135
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,668
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Guess?

136
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,368
- Maybe not, Zack.
- It's our victim's wallet.

137
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,502
Can you believe it?
Leather, cash, cards...

138
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,707
every shred of identification
completely emulsified.

139
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,741
Mmm, wow. You know what, Zack?
I'd like to go back to the old arrangement...

140
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,878
where you don't talk
to me directly, okay?

141
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,253
<i>Have my water sifters arrived yet?</i>

142
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,384
- Yes. That's how I found the wallet.
- Okay, so the point of this is?

143
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,726
Doing what that wallet can't.
Right now, I'd say our victim's an ectomorph.

144
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,266
Thin, linear, narrow features.

145
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,234
And I hear you're back with your ex.

146
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,701
- I'm sorry?
- Rebecca, right?

147
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,037
- Reliving old times?
- [Chuckles]

148
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,213
Uh, I'll just keep sifting.

149
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,478
- Yeah. Dr. Brennan told you?
- Oh, relax.

150
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,815
- She did, didn't she?
- We all have our weak moments.

151
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,721
No. Mm-mmm.
We don't, okay?

152
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,724
- I don't.
- Please, Seeley.

153
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,818
Like we haven't shared enough
of them for me to know better.

154
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,391
- <i>[Brennan] I was not gossiping.</i>
- Oh, really?

155
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,401
So then what would you call it?

156
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,131
- Merely sharing a point of interest.
- Great. So now what am I, huh?

157
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,765
- The world's largest ball of string?
- Not you, your behavior.

158
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,002
It was a textbook example
of just how helpless...

159
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,442
we higher primates can be
to our biological urges.

160
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:10,073
- I am not helpless.
- [Sighs]

161
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,811
- He's not elderly.
- I can control my, uh...

162
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,819
- Who?
- Our victim.

163
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,855
You see these marrow cells?

164
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,654
The lack of collagen indicates
osteogenesis imperfecta.

165
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,660
Brittle bone disease.

166
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,322
And that's supposed to
tell me that he's not... old?

167
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,492
Not necessarily. And if you're not helpless,
then why did you sleep with her?

168
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,627
Oh, I really don't
recall saying that I did.

169
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,694
You didn't have to.
I could hear it in your voice.

170
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,706
I may as well have walked
in on you having sex.

171
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,005
- You didn't and we weren't.
- Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of, Booth.

172
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,478
<i>Humans act upon a hierarchy of needs,</i>
<i>and sex is very highly ranked.</i>

173
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,845
- It's an anthropological inevitability.
- <i>Thank you, Bones.</i>

174
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,875
I really appreciate you boiling me down
to your anthropological inevitabilities.

175
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,683
- Sure.
- Anytime.

176
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,282
You know, if our victim had brittle bone,
there could be a Web site of some kind.

177
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,293
He might have been listed.

178
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,853
[Angela]
Afraid not, honey.
There's no official database.

179
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,059
But I did track down eight cases
of brittle bone in the area.

180
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,068
<i>How many of them are adult males?</i>

181
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,070
<i>Give me a second.</i>
<i>[Typing]</i>

182
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,301
What's wrong?

183
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,345
With what?

184
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:17,178
This is usually where I type and you talk.
You two are never not talking.

185
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,149
Well, we're not not talking.

186
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,210
Or maybe we're not not... not.

187
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,256
Okeydoke.

188
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,314
Number of adult males with brittle bone...

189
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,417
in the metropolitan area is...

190
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,691
<i>zero... same with adult females.</i>

191
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,392
- These are all kids.
- Why is that? High mortality rate?

192
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,903
No. When O.I. is fatal,
it's mainly to infants.

193
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,235
- And only in severe cases.
- So our guy has a mild case.

194
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,332
Type I.
Near normal stature...

195
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,173
<i>fragile bones andjoints,</i>
<i>off-white sclera.</i>

196
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,510
- Is this disease hereditary?
- Mild cases can be.

197
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,278
The more severe forms,
types II and III...

198
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,581
are often the result
of a genetic mutation.

199
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,112
But if our guy is type I and these kids
got it passed on from a parent...

200
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,886
Then all we have to do is
contact these kids' families...

201
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
and find out which one
is missing a dad.

202
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,956
- Well, let me print you the list.
- Print two.

203
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,967
We'll split up.

204
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,866
Hmm.

205
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,532
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

206
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,270
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

207
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,744
- <i>Mrs. Seaver?</i>
- Yes?

208
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,646
I'm Dr. Brennan with
theJeffersonian Institute...

209
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,843
working in collaboration
with the F.B.I.

210
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,716
The F.B. I?
Is this to do with Larry?

211
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,450
That would be your husband,
Lawrence Seaver?

212
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,858
- Raymond's father?
- He hasn't answered his cell phone in days.

213
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,988
I've left so many messages.
Please come in.

214
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,897
- <i>[Woman On TV] Meerkats form...</i>
- Ray, honey.

215
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,903
- We have company.
- Who's she?

216
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,963
- Did they find Daddy?
- My name is Temperance, Ray.

217
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,441
And I'm just here
to ask a few questions.

218
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,311
- Your husband's been missing since...
- <i>Thursday.</i>

219
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,341
We didn't think of him as missing. He left
on his business trip like he does every week.

220
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,819
But he never fails
to at least call us back.

221
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,847
- That must've hurt.
- Not so much. I'm used to it.

222
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,794
Ray has brittle bone.
It's just a mild form, though, like Larry's.

223
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,923
- You think I could sign your cast?
- Sure. I'll get a pen.

224
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,503
Mrs. Seaver, I need
to borrow this photo.

225
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,441
Okay. Why?

226
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,707
Well, we found a body.

227
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,681
Oh, God.

228
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,311
Sorry I couldn't do more.

229
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,413
Skullcap was falling apart
faster than I could put a face on it.

230
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,619
I'm not sure we'd have a match
either way with so little to work with.

231
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,992
Okay, here we go.
Got our guy.

232
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,997
- What?
- Mother and her daughter up in Maryland.

233
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,999
Dad missing since Thursday.

234
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:54,136
- Who's that?
- Mother and son down in Virginia.

235
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,572
<i>Father missing since Thursday.</i>

236
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:00,874
<i>Whoa. Mine's Lawrence Turner, 35,</i>
<i>commercial electrician.</i>

237
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,915
- Oh...
- And I've got Lawrence Seaver, 35.

238
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,474
- my...
- Commercial electrician.

239
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,851
- God.
- I think old Larry's got two wives.

240
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,823
More like two lives.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,764
Just make sureJenny takes her meds.

242
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,327
And tell her Mommy
will see her in the morning.

243
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,497
<i>Thanks, Betty.</i>

244
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,146
- How old's your daughter?
- Six and a half.

245
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,512
She and Larry,
they have a special bond.

246
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,950
- Brittle bone.
- You know about that?

247
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,715
She's type I
like your husband?

248
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,224
He's always felt
so guilty about that.

249
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,817
He really dotes on her,
on both of us.

250
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,557
<i>Mrs. Turner, your husband</i>
<i>ever talk about any conflicts at work?</i>

251
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,725
Never.
Everyone loves Larry.

252
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,770
He's fun, smart, hardworking.

253
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,102
<i>That's what keeps him</i>
<i>out of town so much.</i>

254
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,107
Yeah, about that...

255
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,077
I didn't realize electricians were called upon
to be away from home so much.

256
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:11,105
There's just so much underbidding.
And it's not like we can get by on what I make.

257
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,710
- As?
- I teach. Eighth-grade science.

258
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,915
- Got it.
- So he has to travel.

259
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,086
- <i>Go where the money is.</i>
<i>Not that he ever complains.</i>
- [Clears Throat]

260
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,291
<i>It makes coming home to us</i>
<i>all the more sweeter, he says.</i>

261
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,459
<i>Oh, God!</i>
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

262
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,834
Will you just excuse me
for one moment.

263
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,100
I'm so sorry.
[Clears Throat]

264
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,307
These women have to know
the truth about their husbands.

265
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,179
- They could be in cahoots.
- Cahoots?

266
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,743
If they somehow found out that Larry was
two-timing them, they could both want him dead.

267
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,346
- Okay, so what now? We ask them?
- No, no, no, no, no.

268
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,414
It's all taken care of.

269
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,327
Mrs. Turner, could you please
come with me?

270
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,264
Right this way. Just wait here
in the visitors' lounge.

271
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,427
We won't be long. Help yourself
to a cup of coffee.

272
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,097
Thank you.

273
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,663
- That's the interrogation room.
- Not tonight.

274
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,013
Hmm, nice touch
with the kitty posters.

275
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,109
- Who are you talking to?
- That couple in there.

276
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,552
<i>Agent Curry and Moran.</i>
<i>They set up the room.</i>

277
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,954
I'll never drink
F.B.I. coffee again.

278
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,153
- <i>[Phone Beeps]</i>
- Whenever you're ready, Charlie.

279
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,733
You know, I almost
married her, you know?

280
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,527
- Agent Curry?
- Rebecca. My ex.

281
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,870
Oh. You can talk about her now.

282
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,967
Yeah, she got pregnant.

283
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,877
I wanted to do the right thing,
but, you know, she said no.

284
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,178
You've told me this before.
Not that you've ever said why.

285
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,309
Well, issues with my job.

286
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,877
She wanted to start her own career.
She wanted to finish graduate school.

287
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,651
Alone with a baby?

288
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,750
Logic. Right?
You're applying logic?

289
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,763
- Do you still love her?
- Not... like I did. Not like that.

290
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,389
Then why can't it just be sex?

291
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,264
There's nothing "just"
about sex, Bones.

292
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,270
But all mammals need it.

293
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,830
That release of serotonin.
The rush of endorphins.

294
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,844
Naturally, you seek it with
someone with whom you share a sexual rapport.

295
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,903
Rapport, right.
That's the word.

296
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,915
I know when I'm in need
of a release...

297
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,851
there's a former partner or two
I'm... sure I could call.

298
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,514
Okay, Bones. Thanks so much.
I feel so much better now, huh?

299
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,580
Here we go.

300
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,626
[Over Speaker]
Help yourself to coffee, Mrs. Seaver.

301
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,600
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>
<i>Very smart.</i>

302
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,437
Well, it's my job, Bones.
It's, you know, what I do for a living.

303
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,972
They don't seem like...
Wait.

304
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,620
<i>Hmm, they may as well be</i>
<i>in separate rooms.</i>

305
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,490
Making them either great actresses
who are in cahoots...

306
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,758
Or... they have no idea
what's going on.

307
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,396
How could these women not know?

308
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,440
Brennan was pretty sure
that they didn't.

309
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,272
And still don't apparently.
Booth wants to wait to tell them.

310
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:29,007
- Wait for what? To summon the nerve?
- <i>Maybe.</i>

311
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,311
I just wouldn't want these women
finding out at the funeral.

312
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,647
I'll take a front row seat for that.

313
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,451
Sorry. Did I say that out loud?

314
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,356
Have you found anything resembling
a weapon in the tub yet?

315
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,360
Not yet. Why?

316
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,259
<i>These skull fragments may feel</i>
<i>like wet cardboard...</i>

317
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,422
but I'm pretty sure we're
looking at blunt force trauma.

318
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,126
<i>I'll second that.</i>
<i>Roughly "V"-shaped.</i>

319
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,862
Corner of a 2-by-4 maybe?

320
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,702
Specks of blood at the point of impact.
Could've been the lethal blow.

321
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,607
Making him dead before
he was doused with lye. Oh, happy day.

322
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,872
<i>I've isolated</i>
<i>our corrosive culprits.</i>

323
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:05,007
Sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite,
and hydrochloric acid.

324
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,212
- Available at your local market.
- Lucky the whole tub didn't explode.

325
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,221
It practically did.
Along with teeth...

326
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,850
I keep finding these
tiny shards of copper from the fixtures.

327
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,656
Is that what this is?

328
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,458
<i>No. That would be a wedding band.</i>

329
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,726
Braided gold and platinum.

330
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,734
Preserved by true love, no doubt.

331
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,396
- One metal for each desperate housewife.
- <i>People...</i>

332
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,303
can we at least fake
some sense of decorum?

333
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,967
<i>I can't help it.</i>
<i>It's so</i> Jerry Springer.

334
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,444
<i>First of all, how does</i>
<i>anyonejuggle two spouses?</i>

335
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,607
<i>I can think of ways. Of course,</i>
<i>byjuggle, I mean quite literally...</i>

336
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,651
I have a scalpel.

337
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,687
Maybe he dissolved himself so there'd
be more of him to go around.

338
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,018
I'm going to hell, aren't I?

339
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,081
I'll save you a seat.

340
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,227
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>Not sweet Mr. Seaver!</i>

341
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,232
- It can't be him.
- Yeah.

342
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,427
Well, um, is that
your boss in there?

343
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,336
I mean, who would do something like that?
Everybody loves the man.

344
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,202
Well, you know, not everyone.

345
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,265
Hey, what's goin' on?

346
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,436
- Mr. Valero, you won't believe it.
- Agent Booth. We met yesterday.

347
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,878
<i>It was Mr. Seaver.</i>
<i>That's who was in the bathtub.</i>

348
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,347
Wait. Larry?
The electrician?

349
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,681
- Yeah. Larry the electrician. Now...
- Son of a bitch!

350
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,778
Now I'm never gonna see my money.

351
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,017
You know, I must say, uh, Pete...

352
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,462
<i>you're the first person I've come across</i>
<i>who's ever had a bad word to say about Larry.</i>

353
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,558
Well, the guy does have
a way with people. Or he did.

354
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,934
- I mean, I liked him too before he got all slippery.
- Slippery?

355
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,532
I fronted the guy 85 grand
to cover electrical supplies.

356
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:40,772
Last week, I got the inspector walking around,
and she cites me for cheap materials.

357
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,747
Substandard circuit breakers,
insufficient G.F.I.'s.

358
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,477
- Where'd the 85 grand go?
- Exactly what I asked Larry.

359
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,385
"Show me receipts," I said.
What do I get?

360
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,116
<i>Sob stories ofbad bookkeeping...</i>

361
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,125
his son's health,
problems with the wife.

362
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,956
His wife?

363
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,327
Yeah. Like I don't got a wife of my own, right?
[Chuckles]

364
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,265
<i>You know, you realize, Pete,</i>
<i>that everything that you're telling me...</i>

365
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,826
- sounds a lot like motive.
- [Scoffs]

366
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,895
Great.
Do I need a lawyer?

367
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,100
I don't know.
You tell me.

368
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,177
All right, look.

369
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,839
I can't say that I wasn't angry enough
to want the guy dead.

370
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,577
<i>But like always, I fell back on</i>
<i>the old builders' code.</i>

371
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,245
- "Can't squeeze money from the dead man?"
- You know it.

372
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,347
Well, you know, as codes go,
it's hardly limited to builders.

373
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,450
No, no, no. It's our code.
You can look it up.

374
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,119
No, no.
Maybe later.

375
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,858
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
any of Larry's old paperwork on file?

376
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,162
- <i>Accounts? Receipts?</i>
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

377
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,897
<i>[Chattering]</i>

378
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,005
<i>I think I've stumbled</i>
<i>upon an anomaly, Dr. Saroyan.</i>

379
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,447
It looks like
a splintered ulna bone.

380
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:55,384
- <i>But it's not. It's ivory.</i>
- From the tusk of a small elephant?

381
00:20:55,454 --> 00:21:00,551
I was hoping you'd know.
If you notice these indentations here.

382
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,722
Like teeth marks on a pencil.
See what Angela can make of it.

383
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:08,994
<i>And after that, I'll need you to go back to</i>
<i>the crime scene with the photos I'm taking.</i>

384
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,161
See what you can find with the approximate
shape and dimension of this blunt force wound.

385
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,138
- Like a murder weapon?
- It needn't look like one.

386
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,038
Anything that replicates
this pattern.

387
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,071
- I'm going on police business.
- So proud.

388
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,137
Wait, does he mean out?
In the world?

389
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,082
We'll pin our phone number on his shirt.
What's that you got there?

390
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,551
Well, having finally hit
the very bottom of the tub...

391
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,353
I found it plugged with a ceramic stopper,
which I lifted and voilà.

392
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,791
What do you make of this?

393
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,088
<i>Bones...[Laughs]</i>
<i>are you ready for this?</i>

394
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,223
- Did you tell the wives yet?
- No, not yet.

395
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,064
But I did some checking into
two-time Larry's finances.

396
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,628
Under the last name Seaver, he's got
a half-a-million-dollar life insurance policy.

397
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,504
- Assigning motive to Gayle Seaver.
- Under the last name Turner...

398
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,510
he's got a living will leaving everything
to Lila and their daughter.

399
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,512
- Giving both women motive.
- Right.

400
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,016
Which is just a matter of which one needed
the money more than they needed their Larry.

401
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,552
- I might be able to help.
- With what?

402
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,554
A very small used condom?

403
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,817
It's the finger from a rubber glove.

404
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,553
Hodgins just found it wedged
under the tub's drain stopper.

405
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,187
Oh, it was spared
the corrosive effects of the lye.

406
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,289
<i>Meaning, we may be able</i>
<i>to pull a fingerprint from the inside.</i>

407
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,698
No maybes about it.
If there's a print, I'll pull it.

408
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,965
- And <i>when</i> I pull it...
- We'll have our killer.

409
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,910
It's just standard procedure, Lila.

410
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,970
<i>Just press four fingers</i>
<i>firmly and hold.</i>

411
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,812
Our investigation turned up
a print at the crime scene.

412
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,548
<i>And wejust need yours, Gayle,</i>
<i>to avoid any possible confusion.</i>

413
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,349
<i>This isn't gonna take long, is it?</i>

414
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,690
- Our tech has the print you pulled?
- Ring finger, left hand.

415
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,821
Then this shouldn't take long at all.
Just wait here.

416
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,331
Wait. Are you sure
this is the best time to tell them?

417
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,834
What does that mean? After two days
of nagging me, you're just...

418
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,961
- Now you're getting cold feet?
- What? I do not nag.

419
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,338
Well, you know, it's an anthropological
inevitability for women to gossip and nag.

420
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,434
Can I get anyone a soda?

421
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:03,072
No, thank you.
Are you on my husband's case too?

422
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,082
No. I don't work here.

423
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,948
You're the lady
from the waiting room.

424
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,580
- <i>You gave me a tissue?</i>
- Oh, yeah.

425
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,590
- <i>That was you?</i>
- Yeah.

426
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,957
- Sorry. I'm a little out of it.
- Yeah. I know how that feels.

427
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,962
Actually, ladies, let me make
some introductions.

428
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,126
Uh, Gayle Seaver,
Lila Turner. Lila, Gayle.

429
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,362
Hi. Lila, that was
very sweet of you. I...

430
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,701
- I'd just lost my husband.
- You did?

431
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,139
<i>So did I.</i>

432
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,268
Actually, that's... why
you're both here really.

433
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:37,281
Um, for the same reason,
for the same husband.

434
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,784
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah. Me too.

435
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:45,414
What Agent Booth's trying to say
is that your husbands, Larry...

436
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,890
are the same Larry.

437
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:51,326
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Uh, this will help.</i>

438
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,921
A little show-and-tell. Um...

439
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,197
Well, this is wrong.

440
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,535
It's a joke.
A sick joke.

441
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,131
- Actually, it's not...
- My Larry would never...

442
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,143
- Your Larry? This is my Larry!
- My Larry!

443
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,237
- He's my husband. What are you talking about?
- Just go ahead and lie like that?

444
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:14,308
- Bones?
- Okay. Let's sit! Everyone just sit down.

445
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,411
<i>[Lila] This is ridiculous.</i>

446
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,251
Fine.

447
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,053
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>

448
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:25,324
Booth. Yeah? Yeah, I'm meeting
with them right now.

449
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,491
- <i>Right. The one from the glove.</i>
- I'm sorry. I can't imagine...

450
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,092
- Whose kid is this?
- Whose little girl is that?

451
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,228
Are you sure? Thanks.

452
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,236
- What?
- Um...

453
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,868
<i>The print we found on</i>
<i>the rubber glove at the crime scene...</i>

454
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,344
it doesn't match either wife.

455
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,246
Oh, so it's back to square one.

456
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,716
Are you sure I can't get
anyone a soda?

457
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,756
Hey. Dr. Brennan, right?

458
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,292
- Rebecca, hi.
- Is he in there?

459
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,625
He is.
But it's not a good time.

460
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:02,428
Not that my powers of discernment
have ever been particularly sharp...

461
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,435
vis-à-vis good times from bad...

462
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,097
but in this instance, it's bad.

463
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,266
And I thought Seeley
was exaggerating about you.

464
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,776
- With regard to...
- Just tell him to give me a call.

465
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,978
Hey.

466
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,040
Can I ask you something?

467
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,084
- Why did you say no?
- Excuse me?

468
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,989
When he asked you to marry him?
I mean, he seems an ideal candidate.

469
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,755
Strong, alpha male,
good protective instincts.

470
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,797
And I should discuss
this with you why?

471
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,298
It's just...

472
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,064
I'm not sure he knows.
And... I think it bothers him.

473
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,038
I've always taken care of myself.

474
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,478
To a fault sometimes.

475
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,381
And when we got pregnant,
Seeley proposed.

476
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,580
But I didn't want to be one of those
women who gets married out of need.

477
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,453
So I said no.

478
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,925
- I can see that.
- By the time that I realized I'd made a mistake...

479
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,395
that I'd still
be the same person...

480
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,490
I think there's a moment
for two people.

481
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:14,301
A single moment where they
can either catch fire or...

482
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:19,199
Seeley and I, we missed our moment.

483
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,575
- Do you understand?
- I'm trying.

484
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,843
But the "single moment" thesis
doesn't explain...

485
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,214
Why we still get together.

486
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,776
Fall together really.

487
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:35,486
Because I think that we just
feel what used to be there.

488
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,494
And we miss it.

489
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,087
I think Booth thinks
you didn't marry him...

490
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,156
because he wouldn't make
a good father.

491
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,293
- What?
- He worries about it himself.

492
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,999
What he does for a living.
His past as a sniper.

493
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,065
Oh, God.

494
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,846
Uh, do me a favor?
Don't tell him that I came by, okay?

495
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,884
Please.

496
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:13,354
<i>Man, what I would've given to have been</i>
<i>a fly on the wall when you told those wives.</i>

497
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,524
You would've been swatted, trust me.

498
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,058
No match on the prints from
our nationwide database either.

499
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,731
At least we can assume our killer
was a first-time offender.

500
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,865
Great. Thanks, Bones.
That narrows it down.

501
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,342
So I hear you're back with your ex.

502
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,743
- Don't look at me.
- <i>Your son must be thrilled.</i>

503
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,681
I know I may thumb my nose at
the hypocrisy of marriage as a sacred institution.

504
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:36,778
- <i>But I think a boy truly benefits...</i>
- I am not back with my ex.

505
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,050
Let me finish.
A boy truly benefits...

506
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,092
from knowing where
his parents stand, together or not.

507
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,289
<i>Like I once had this dancer down in Miami</i>
<i>whose stage name was Abbey Road.</i>

508
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,025
- Anyway, she had a kid too, right?
- That'll do, Ringo.

509
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,364
- I think I scored, Dr. Brennan.
- Somebody just kill me right now.

510
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,461
Dr. Saroyan sent me
back to the crime scene.

511
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,701
That's a junction box with
a single brown hair embedded.

512
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:00,108
- This is at floor level?
- Across from where the bathtub had been.

513
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,976
You'll find its contours
match our trauma wound.

514
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,141
Then let's see if this hair
is a match for Larry.

515
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,050
Before you go, are we sure
these copper bits are from the tub?

516
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,054
I assumed they'd come off
the fixtures.

517
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,283
Yeah, but... but the drain,
the faucet and the spigots...

518
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,623
- <i>they're all pristine outside a scratch or two.</i>
- Wait. Let me see that.

519
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,391
It's bird shot.
Or it was.

520
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,331
It's compressed copper that's frangible
so it breaks apart on impact.

521
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,496
- Could they kill a man?
- I think our vice president
disproved that possibility.

522
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,267
Look, any ammo at
close range will do the job.

523
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,774
But at the very least, a gunshot
would've sent Larry flying...

524
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,902
causing his head to hit
this junction box.

525
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,469
- Which given his condition...
- Would be fatal.

526
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,615
Okay. What you thought
were teeth marks, Dr. Saroyan...

527
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,682
<i>turned out to be Chinese characters</i>
<i>engraved along the side.</i>

528
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,285
- What do they say?
- They say...

529
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,490
"What make foolish man
think I speak Chinese?"

530
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,534
I thought you were half Chinese?

531
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,434
And I think you're half Swedish.
Let's hear some Swedish.

532
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,166
What is it, Angela, please?

533
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,868
It's a chopstick.
Only it's not the kind you eat with.

534
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,344
- There's another kind?
- Well, you wouldn't comb your hair
with a fork, would you?

535
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,847
- My hair?
- All right, look.

536
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,214
The one character that
I was able to translate off the Internet...

537
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,152
is the word "beauty,"
and I realized it's meant for hair.

538
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,885
<i>Where you twist it in a bun</i>
<i>and stick this through to hold it in place?</i>

539
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:24,986
But if that's what this is,
we can be pretty sure it wasn't Larry's.

540
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,961
<i>Thanks. Roommate says she went to go meet</i>
<i>some friends at the Beltway Burger.</i>

541
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,299
And you think
it's this Chloe girl because...

542
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,363
Of the chopsticks, right?
As soon as Cam said it, I knew it.

543
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,467
Because when I went to go see Pete,
she had chopsticks in the back of her hair.

544
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,012
- And how did Hodgins find out?
- I'm sorry?

545
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,708
- "Yeah, I hear you're back with your ex."
- I don't know.

546
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,082
I assume it was Cam. I was only trying
to engage her in social intercourse.

547
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,519
- Excuse me?
- Just trying to be normal.

548
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,216
Congenial exchange with a coworker.

549
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,418
And if that's what gossip is,
I don't like it at all.

550
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,859
Yeah, you think you don't like it?
I can't stand...

551
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,693
There it is. Beltway Burger.

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,850
Hey, Chloe.
Meetin' some friends?

555
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,717
Oh, hi!
You're that F.B.I. guy!

556
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,958
Yes, I'm the F.B.I. guy.

557
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,927
So you worship at the temple
of Beltway Burger too, huh?

558
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,192
- Yeah, on occasion.
- Yeah, I may be 90% vegetarian...

559
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,790
but their burgers...
can't get enough of'em lately.

560
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:40,235
- How many weeks are you?
- Excuse me?

561
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,103
Pregnant. I could tell by your gait.

562
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:47,076
<i>Your ilia... they've already started</i>
<i>shifting to widen the birth canal.</i>

563
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,477
- You can tell that?
- So you are pregnant?

564
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,447
Fourteen weeks.

00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,609
- Booth...

<i>Chloe's friends. Taking the kids</i>
<i>out for a little late night snack, ladies?</i>

568
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,385
<i>Don't tell me.</i>
<i>Larry's the father.</i>

[Sighs]

570
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,737
There's a playground about
halfway between Gayle and me...

571
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,743
designed for kids
with special needs.

572
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,575
Rubber surfacing, high-back swings.

573
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,878
I took Ray there last week,
and Lila was there with Jenny.

574
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,043
The kids started playing.
We started talking.

575
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,350
- And one topic led to another.
- And... small world.

576
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,755
- Yeah, too small.
- What about Chloe?

577
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:39,661
Well, after we got over the initial shock,
like yesterday but real...

578
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,928
we decided to follow Larry
to work the next morning...

579
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,798
straight to a motel
where Chloe was waiting.

580
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,565
<i>And if that wasn't enough to</i>
<i>make our heads explode...</i>

581
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,870
we then had to find out
about Chloe's... condition.

582
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,775
At which point, you knew it was
time to confront Larry.

583
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:57,337
- I had no idea that Larry was married.
- Let alone twice.

584
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,282
But since your prints match the one
left in the rubber glove...

585
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,478
we assume it wasn't long
before you found out.

586
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,851
We checked your
phone records, Gayle, and, uh...

587
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,290
<i>you didn't leave Larry any</i>
<i>messages after Friday night.</i>

588
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,554
The night you, Lila, and Chloe...

589
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,688
told him you were going to
see him together to get answers.

590
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,030
So you found Larry at his job.
You shot him point-blank.

591
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,831
<i>And you dragged his sorry ass</i>
<i>back to the bathtub.</i>

592
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:23,533
Where you doused him in
sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite.

593
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,738
Or as you and I like to call 'em,
bleach and Quickie Plumber.

594
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,042
Which, as an eighth-grade teacher,
you knew would do the trick.

595
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,811
- Simple earth science.
- Look, all that's true. But we didn't kill him.

596
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,376
- Really? Then who did?
- He killed himself.

597
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,388
- He killed himself.
- He killed himself.

598
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,258
Larry was dead when you got there?

599
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,522
- On the bathroom floor.
- The gun was still in his mouth.

600
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,257
The coward must've freaked at the thought
of facing us together.

601
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,095
If we'd surprised him,
maybe he'd still be alive.

602
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:53,263
<i>Back up. You're saying</i>
<i>that the gun was still in his mouth?</i>

603
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,863
His finger was on the trigger.
It was awful.

604
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,704
And where's the gun now?

605
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,210
I buried it in my backyard.

606
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,372
That's a good place for it.

607
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,010
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, you got that right.

608
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,748
- You know what? They're lying.
- How do you know?

609
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,551
Oh, come on. They've been
lying since day one.

610
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,057
Between all of them, they should have
a dozen Oscars by now.

611
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,356
- I know what those are.
- I mean, come on. Suicide? Mm-mmm.

612
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,658
Bird shot or not, okay,
every self-inflicted I've seen...

613
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,665
the guy shoots himself,
and he drops the gun.

614
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,826
Right? It's an automatic reaction.
Bang, drop.

615
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,960
There's no way the gun
ends up in his mouth.

616
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,130
Then we'd better go dig up that gun.

617
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:31,334
- Seeley?
- I'll get the ball rolling.

618
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,709
- Was that Dr. Brennan?
- Uh-huh.

619
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,714
Why are you here?

620
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,910
I needed to know if you were gonna
coach Parker's T-ball team this year.

621
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,920
- You know I always coach Parker's T-ball team.
- I didn't wanna assume...

622
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,786
Okay, whoa. What is going
on here, Rebecca? Okay?

623
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,792
Because, look,
I thought we agreed here.

624
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,829
We cannot end up groping each other
in the F.B.I. closet.

625
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,490
We can't do that.
We're done.

626
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:58,092
- I know.
- Really?

627
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:02,299
Seeley, all the excuses
I gave you for not wanting to get married...

628
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,069
- my independence, your work...
- I know.

629
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,134
No, you don't.

630
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,908
You are a wonderful father.

631
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,354
And Parker is a lucky kid.

632
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,856
Such a lucky kid.

633
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,859
And obviously, we still have
feelings for each other.

634
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,667
Do you still wanna marry me?

635
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,971
Rebecca...

636
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,174
No, I don't.

637
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,180
I don't wanna marry you either.

638
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,854
Here are the forms for T-ball.

639
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,956
- I'll miss you.
- Yeah.

640
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,120
And I'm gonna miss you too.

641
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:01,063
You know what I'm gonna
miss the most?

642
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,129
Yeah. But let's not go there.

643
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,644
<i>Okay. DNA on the barrel...</i>

644
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
confirms it was in
Larry's mouth at some point.

645
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,290
Yeah. Well, I still don't buy it.

646
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,485
You know, the kickback alone
would've forced it out.

647
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,926
Unless he was dead before the shot.

648
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,760
Well, yeah, that's true.
But, uh...

649
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:38,495
- Wait, what?
- The inside of Larry's skull is pitted...

650
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,231
which I had always attributed
to the effects of the lye.

651
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,741
But each tiny hole matches
perfectly with the bird shot...

652
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,674
right down to these
specks of copper.

653
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,439
Are you saying that it was suicide?

654
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:52,176
I would, except these holes
are void of blood...

655
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,380
which would suggest they were inflicted after
blood stopped pumping trough Larry's head.

656
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,388
No, keep talking.
I'll catch up.

657
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,290
Well, unlike this blunt force trauma...
no shortage of blood here.

658
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,591
Proving he was dead
before he was shot.

659
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:10,896
So now we're talking about
a faked homicide to cover up a faked suicide?

660
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:14,734
A faked suicide meant to cover up
an actual, original murder.

661
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,706
Now, just when you think things
couldn't get any more twisted...

662
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,209
- How's this for a curveball?
- In walks Cam.

663
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,237
After retrieving and reassembling
every tooth from that tub...

664
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,146
<i>I now discover I had one extra.</i>

665
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,048
Well, this is not a tooth.
It's a crown.

666
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,247
Exactly. Any of your women
happen to be missing one?

667
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,485
- Not that I could see.
- Well, it wouldn't be theirs anyway.

668
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,221
- It's sized for a man.
- I knew that.

669
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,456
A man's tooth, and it's not Larry's.

670
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,464
It's not a tooth.
It's a crown...

671
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,830
whereby a dentist files down
an existing tooth...

672
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,734
I know what a crown is, Bones.

673
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,232
Except Pete called it a root canal.

674
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,504
Pete.

675
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,774
[Man]
Yeah, right there.

676
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,318
Well, look who's here.
Returning to the scene of the crime.

677
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,081
Funny. I was gonna say that to you.

678
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,146
- Okay, boys, that's lunch. Let's go.
- All right.

679
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,590
Why? No, no.
I'm talking about that.

680
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,457
- <i>Look at my wall there. Who's gonna pay for that?</i>
- Let's find out.

681
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,157
- Smile for me, Pete.
- Whoa! Back off! What's this about?

682
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,826
Temporary crown,
maxillary central incisor.

683
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,132
- Turn around, Pete.
- Like I have the slightest idea
how Larry got in that tub?

684
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,468
Actually, on that detail,
we're quite sure you don't.

685
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,340
Making that look on your face
when you saw it all the more priceless.

686
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,037
That's because I didn't
know what happened...

687
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,444
Well, let me tell you
what I know, Pete. Okay?

688
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,641
<i>I know Larry owed you 85 grand.</i>
<i>So Friday night...</i>

689
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,185
<i>you come here to have</i>
<i>a little talk to him about it.</i>

690
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,984
And about the same time, he gets a phone call
from his very unhappy wives.

691
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,219
- Wives?
- Yeah. Which puts Larry in a really bad place.

692
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,784
<i>So when you asked him,</i>
<i>"Hey, you know, where's my money?"</i>

693
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:48,354
- He pretty much blows you off.
- Like he has more important things
to worry about.

694
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,698
<i>Bad enough that Larry rips you off,</i>
<i>but he disrespects you on top of it?</i>

695
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,637
- <i>That's not gonna happen in this lifetime.</i>
- <i>So it got physical.</i>

696
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:59,403
Larry knocked your crown loose.
And you shoved him down here...

697
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,378
<i>where he hit his head</i>
<i>on the socket casing.</i>

698
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:06,007
I... I... I swear he didn't land hard.

699
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:10,144
With his O.I. condition, it didn't matter.
Wouldn't take much.

700
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,849
It was an accident.
I'm sorry.

701
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,016
So sorry you had to cover it up?

702
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,356
Stick a cheap shotgun in
his mouth, pull the trigger...

703
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,089
and make manslaughter
look like suicide.

704
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,758
The guy had ripped me off for enough.
I couldn't let him ruin me too.

705
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,824
And you can live with that?

706
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,427
A person can live with anything
if they don't think too hard.

707
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,838
<i>Let's try this again, Pete.</i>
<i>Turn around.</i>

708
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:34,036
How did he get in the tub?
It's been driving me nuts.

709
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,045
You know what?

710
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,445
- Try not to think about it.
- [Booth] Come on.

711
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,711
<i>The irony is that I cannot</i>
<i>think of a single woman...</i>

712
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,017
who would want three husbands.

713
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,456
<i>[Hodgins] Good thing. A guy would never</i>
<i>be stupid enough to let it happen.</i>

714
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,518
Excuse me.
These women were not stupid.

715
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,063
And that is completely gross.

716
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,065
But <i>comfy.</i>

717
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,601
- Welcome back by the way.
- What?

718
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,694
<i>Well, after two days of</i>
<i>inappropriate comments...</i>

719
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,399
you're back to judging me
for gross behavior.

720
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,500
- When am I ever appropriate?
- Good point.

721
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,375
Maybe it was just
the judging me I missed.

722
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,312
Ah, the woman
I know and love...

723
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,444
in a purely nonromantic,
happy-to-be-judged way.

724
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,887
Well...

725
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,481
- Anyway.
- These women.

726
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,754
Right. Not stupid.

727
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:27,355
And frankly, that they allowed
themselves to be duped...

728
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,899
is a sad statement on how
lean the market is out there.

729
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,798
I resent that.
I'm out there.

730
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,632
You certainly are.

731
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,831
Well, how not stupid could
these women have been...

732
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,306
to think that they could
get away with faking a murder?

733
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,005
Or how compassionate were they to recognize
that they were all in the same boat.

734
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,513
So why let Larry take his
insurance money with him?

735
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,642
Yeah. A lot a good
it'll do 'em in jail.

736
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,853
So you never said how
it ended up with Rebecca.

737
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,485
Well, yeah, it ended. The only time
we'll ever spend together is with Parker.

738
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,756
- You sure that's what you want?
- You know what, Bones?

739
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,128
It might be all
anthropology to you...

740
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,827
but there are certain people
that you just can't sleep with.

741
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,029
<i>I mean, you can pretend</i>
<i>that it's just sex.</i>

742
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,834
<i>You can lie to yourself,</i>
<i>and you can say that it's all good.</i>

743
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,741
But, um, there's just...
There's too many strings and...

744
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,803
and too much at stake, you know?

745
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,543
Too much too lose.

746
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,779
Yeah.
I can see that.

747
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,520
It's over, you know?

748
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,651
I appreciate, you know,
your support in that.

749
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,088
I will.
And if you should slip...

750
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,897
I will... keep my mouth
shut about it.

751
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,496
Thank you.
But, I mean, it's not like I'm gonna...

752
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,507
No, I mean with anybody.

753
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:49,638
I'm sure Rebecca's not your only option
for satisfying biological urges.

754
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,353
<i>Please tell me these women</i>
<i>are not going tojail.</i>

755
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:02,415
<i>Trying to bilk the insurance system,</i>
<i>they'll get nothing less than a firing squad.</i>

756
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,190

- Because our friends here caught them.

Well, you're both kinda right.
Given their kids and the circumstances...

758
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,566
the D.A. is gonna offer
probation provided that...

759
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,537
<i>all three women show remorse</i>
<i>and attend mandatory counseling.</i>

- Cam tells me you're back with your ex.
- Cam?

764
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,843
Mmm.

765
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,684
Cam in her office?

766
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,987
[Inhales]
I said something wrong.

767
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,654
