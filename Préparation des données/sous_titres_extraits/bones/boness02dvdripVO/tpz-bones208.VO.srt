- <i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>

3
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,830
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>So who do they think the body is?</i>

4
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,332
[Booth] A federal prosecutor
who disappeared five years ago...

5
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,336
the day before he was
starting a mob trial.

6
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,339
- Five years? So there's not much left of him.
- Yep.

7
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,342
That's why they flew you
to Sin City, Bones.

8
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,810
They call <i>this</i> America's playground?

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,816
We're 15 miles outside Vegas, Bones.

10
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,909
This is America's frying pan.

11
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,444
No kidding. A person can melt
before finding a body anywhere near here.

12
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,617
Once the mob makes
a federal prosecutor disappear...

13
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,557
they kinda want him staying that way.

14
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,528
- Agent Booth.
- Agent Zhang.

15
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,587
<i>Dr. Brennan, thanks for coming.</i>

16
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,601
May 20, 2001. Mason Roberts was supposed
to deliver a keynote address at U.N.L.V.

17
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,832
<i>But he never showed. Found his car three</i>
<i>blocks from his office, engine still running.</i>

18
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,704
- Right this way.
- What? No leads until now?

19
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,709
Leads don't mean much without a body.

20
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,712
Then yesterday we get this tip from
this call girl working at the Tangiers Hotel.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,183
Oh, so I dragged out one of the top forensic
anthropologists across the country, huh...

22
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,185
on the word of a prostitute?

23
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,188
- But what difference does her profession make?
- I'm backing you up.

24
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,190
- You were judging.
- I wasn't judging.

25
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,692
- Yeah. Your voice was judging.
- I had your back.

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,026
Anyway, the body's right where
she said it'd be... mile marker 15.

27
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,192
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Confirm victim is male, late 30s.</i>

28
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,792
No clothing, no personal artifacts.

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,737
Hey, this informant of yours,
any chance I can talk to her?

30
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,866
As long as you don't expect her to talk back.
She died this morning. Cancer.

31
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,571
It was a deathbed confession.
She was still scared as hell.

32
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,840
<i>Multiple fractures to the skull</i>
<i>and upper extremities...</i>

33
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:58,042
caused by something cylindrical,
like a pipe or a bat.

34
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,643
Straight out of Capone's playbook.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,156
- I'll know more once I compare
dental records, but...
- <i>[Bird Squawking]</i>

36
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,318
What, Bones?

37
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:12,089
<i>It's a vulture. Dead body here.</i>
<i>Kinda how it works.</i>

38
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,328
They don't circle skeletal remains.
Get my bag.

39
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:25,678
<i>Oh, right. It's the sun-baked,</i>
<i>rotting corpses they're into.</i>

40
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,804
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>It's a female, mid-20s.</i>

41
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,577
<i>Similar injuries to the male victim...</i>

42
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,676
but this is a fresh kill...
a week to 10 days.

43
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,687
Popular dumping ground for these guys.

44
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,848
You don't mean the same guys
five years later?

45
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:41,291
Well, if they're not connected,
it'd be one hell of a coincidence.

46
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,057
I'd have to compare them
side by side...

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,861
but, from what I see here, whoever
buried that victim buried this one too.

48
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:52,132
- So, two dead for the price of one.
- Viva Las Vegas.

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,134
- [Chattering]
- <i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>

50
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,481
Yep.
Dental records confirm.

51
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,280
The male victim is Mason Roberts,
bludgeoned to death.

52
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,287
Presumably with a baseball bat.

53
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,414
This guy here looks like
a long-ball hitter.

54
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,357
That's Sweet Pete Arno.
He's the gaming exec at the Tangiers.

55
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,794
He and the other two there,
they were on Roberts's immediate
to-do list when he disappeared.

56
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,455
Any specs on the female victim yet?

57
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,466
Mmm, only preliminary.

58
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,162
Blows to the cranium, torso,
and upper extremities.

59
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,171
All similar injuries to Roberts.

60
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,367
- But the likely result of domestic abuse.
- <i>Likely result?</i>

61
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,501
There's nothing domestic about a mob hit.

62
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,511
But the shape of her injuries...

63
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,843
the pattern of healing and re-breaking...

64
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,544
There's a long history of assault here, Booth,
and not from any baseball bat.

65
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,554
Plus, I found this embedded in her skull.

66
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,058
- Is that a hearing aid?
- <i>They're common with abuse victims.</i>

67
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,652
Repeated blows to the head
can damage the bones of the inner ear.

68
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,495
Sorry to butt in, Brennan,
but I got a name off the serial number.

69
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:31,162
<i>Hearing aid is registered to a Wilhelmina</i>
<i>Morgan of Mount Charleston, Nevada.</i>

70
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,705
Oh, that's not too far from here.

71
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,709
She goes by the name Billie.
Listed here as Billie Morgan, 26.

72
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,712
Reported missing two weeks ago
by her husband, Donald.

73
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,578
- Her abusive husband covering his tracks?
- Possible.

74
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,414
Okay, he might know how his wife
and Roberts ended up here.

75
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,977
- He may even know your friends here.
- <i>You get on that.</i>

76
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:52,491
- I'll fly these remains back to theJeffersonian.
- Whoa.

77
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,753
- You can't leave.
- I can't?

78
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:59,196
No. We came for one body, and suddenly
there's two. What if there's more?

79
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,132
Just ship both sets of remains here,
along with bugs, dirt... the works.

80
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,034
If there's a forensic link to these murders,
we'll find it.

81
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,904
- As long as you keep me in the loop.
- As if we could keep you out.

82
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,068
Okay.
So that's the deal.

83
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,671
Box them up, and we go
break the news to big Don.

84
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,549
And here I thought she left me.

85
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,057
- Why would she do that, Don?
- I got laid off a couple months ago.

86
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:29,356
Poor Billie. She hated seeing me sitting
around the house all day, depressed.

87
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,262
- Drinking?
- Punching walls?

88
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,892
No. I just... I fell off a ladder.

89
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,697
Breaking a fall like that
would fracture distal radius...

90
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,795
<i>not proximal phalanges.</i>

91
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,363
So I got a police report
that says that your neighbors heard you...

92
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,376
screaming at your wife
three weeks ago.

93
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,572
Screaming?
No. Just arguing.

94
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,649
Billie wanted to help out. She thought
she could bring in some money dancing.

95
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,051
You know, the exotic kind?

96
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,215
- I kind of flipped out.
- And broke your thumb against your wife's face?

97
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,089
No! Look, I could never
hurt Billie, okay?

98
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,151
Then how'd she lose her hearing?

99
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,097
I don't know! She was a kid playing sports.
One too many soccer balls to the head.

100
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,101
- Oh, please.
- Listen, Don, you're my number one suspect.

101
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,468
<i>So it would be wise</i>
<i>if you were straight with us.</i>

102
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,666
Implants.

103
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,306
<i>Breast implants?</i>

104
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,780
She thought they'd help her chances
of landing a job as a dancer.

105
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,808
<i>As much as I hated the idea,</i>
<i>I borrowed eight grand from a loan shark.</i>

106
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,320
Gave the money to Billie.

107
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,415
That's the last time I ever saw her.

108
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,427
- So that's how you broke your thumb.
- Huh?

109
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,487
The loan shark comes to collect his eight grand.
Don here, he can't pay him.

110
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,498
- <i>So...</i>
- Yeah. Now I owe him 10.

111
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,467
I need the loan shark's name.
Just give me a name.

112
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,638
Mackey.
Yeah, that's right. Lewis Mackey.

113
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:58,616
Yeah. Send his information to my
cell phone as soon as you can. Thanks.

114
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,881
- We had the shark in our system.
- Proving at least that he exists.

115
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,515
You know, Don's story might seem
a little, I don't know, hinky.

116
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,789
- But just keep an open mind.
- To what? All those soccer balls to the head?

117
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:13,798
I'm just not sold on the whole
domestic abuse thing. A scrawny guy like that?

118
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,391
- Rage has nothing to do with size.
- <i>I know that, Bones.</i>

119
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,403
You know that I know that.

120
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,531
It's just, I looked into the guy's eyes,
and I... I just didn't see it.

121
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,541
What about the breast implants?

122
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,873
If she'd gotten them,
they would've been part of her remains.

123
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,880
Yeah. Well, then the money
had to be for something else.

124
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,475
And hopefully, this guy will be
able to tell us what it was.

131
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,701
You can't be here, Booth.
You're a degenerate gambler.

132
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,237
Former gambler, okay?

133
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,934
Not degenerate. I've been through

<i>Well, what if you get a sudden urge</i>
<i>to gamble while you're here?</i>

- Do you need to sit down?
- No, I'm fine.

00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,517
It's just the sound of the winning.
It'll pass.

138
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,680
<i>What?</i>
<i>The sound or the winning?</i>

139
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,689
<i>Just kinda reminds me</i>
<i>of the first time.</i>

140
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:16,421
I walked into the Desert Inn
with 35 bucks in my pocket
and walked out with a cool 10 grand.

141
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,430
Next night, I lost everything.

142
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,728
Tapped out my A.T.M.

- What's the matter now?
- No, it's the game. It's called craps.

145
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:30,201
This used to be my game, Bones.
Roll dem bones. Chuck the dice, you know?

146
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,268

I don't think I do.

159
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,608
My buddy, Don Morgan,
he introduced us...

160
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,654
30, scrawny guy, broken thumb.

161
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,416
Do I need to call Security?

162
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,288
Yeah.
You know, that's a great idea.

163
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:25,456
Then maybe you can tell all of us what you did
to Don and how his wife ended up dead.

164
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,659
- I don't know anything about any wife.
- Come on, Lou.

165
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,702
Don't make me work so hard here.

166
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,136
Look, the guy owed me money.
He neglected to pay.

167
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,834
Then he fell off of a ladder.
It's instant karma.

168
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,776
Instant karma.
That's gonna get you every time, isn't it?

169
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,871
What about, uh, Billie Morgan?

170
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,883
<i>She have instant karma, too?</i>

171
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,443
She's attractive.
I didn't even know he was married.

172
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,888
How about the name Mason Roberts?
I'm sure that rings a bell.

173
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,122
Whispers on the strip is that
you finally found him. Congratulations.

174
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,789
Now leave me alone.

175
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:03,062
If you know more than what you're saying,
I'm gonna find out eventually.

176
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,569
- Do I look worried?
- [Chuckles]

177
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,233
I'm a businessman.
What are you harassing me for?

178
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,833
Ah, it's just something
I have about bullies.

179
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,403
Thanks for the drink.

180
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,210
- Nineteen's a winner.
- Yes! Yes.

181
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,313
- Uh, hey, Bones.
- Booth! Have you ever played this game before?

182
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,087
It's basic math. You just count the cards,
and then you know what the dealer has left.

183
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,652
- Yeah. lxnay.
- The most common card is a 10
because of the face cards.

184
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,495
So if you just always assume
that the down card's a 10...

185
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,434
- I'm afraid you're gonna have to...
- We were just about to leave.

186
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,437
- I was just getting good.
- Good at cheating.

187
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,666
- That's what counting cards is.
- It's not cheating. It's strategy.

188
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,404
- Not to them it's not.
- <i>Well, what is the fun in that?</i>

189
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,413
- The odds are completely skewed
in the dealer's favor.
- Now do you see the attraction?

190
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,713
<i>Now, the man on my right, he's going</i>
<i>to win ifhe doesn't hit on an eight.</i>

191
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,353
Aegialia concinna.

192
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,297
- Gesundheit.
- Also known as scarab beetles.

193
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,301
They came from the soil
around Billie Morgan.

194
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:15,238
These adults feed on putrefied
organic matter, or in this case, Billie.

195
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:19,539
- As a result, they suffered
unusually short life spans.
- From ingesting Billie's flesh?

196
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,080
More likely,
the powerful glucocorticoid in her system.

197
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,309
I have yet to isolate
which one specifically.

198
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,317
Be sure to <i>notify</i>
Dr. Brennan when you do.

199
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,115
Any specifics on the bat
used to kill Roberts yet, Zack?

200
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:34,626
Here's a replica. Cincinnati Slugger with
a three-inch diameter weighing about 27 ounces.

201
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,289
You'd think the mob would come up
with less clichéd ways to whack people.

202
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,059
<i>But there's something else.</i>

203
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:44,068
Staining in Roberts's cranium
indicates seepage to the cervical spine.

204
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,594
So somehow, blood from his head
got down to his neck.

205
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,664
Vertebrae C-7.

206
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,972
- Are those cut marks?
- So his throat was cut too.

207
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,013
<i>Per my scarab beetles, did you find a
<i>specific cause of death on Billie Morgan yet?</i>

208
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,015
She displays a hemothorax
on her left lung.

209
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,983
Caused by a left-sided rib fracture.

210
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,077
A broken rib punctures a lung
causing massive internal bleeding.

211
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,782
And between her pre-existing injuries
and the new ones...

212
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,291
the poor girl
never had a chance to heal.

213
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,691
Oh, won't Dr. Brennan
love to hear that.

214
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,463
<i>[Brennan] Take a closer look</i>
<i>at the stress markers to her sternum, Zack.</i>

215
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,593
They strike you as unusual?

216
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,470
Well, they do seem more the result
of repetitive medium-impact manual blows...

217
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,531
than the single high impact from a bat.

218
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,474
This husband could really dish it out.

219
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:29,002
Maybe she dished it back.
These hairline fractures on her knuckles...

220
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,380
<i>Defensive wounds.</i>
<i>Wait a minute. Let me zoom in.</i>

221
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,511
<i>Repetitive manual blows,</i>
<i>fractured knuckles...</i>

222
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,524
the glucocorticoid
that killed your bugs, Hodgins...

223
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,083
<i>Could it have been simple cortisone</i>
<i>to treat an injury?</i>

224
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,492
Yeah. It's certainly possible.

225
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,962
What are you thinking, Dr. Brennan?

226
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:50,161
- I'm thinking Billie Morgan
could've been a boxer.
- Like a real boxer in a ring?

227
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,069
But wouldn't boxing gloves
prevent injuries like these?

228
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,073
Unless she wasn't wearing gloves.

229
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,666
- Well, what boxer does that?
- Ultimate fighters.

230
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,370
Ultimate fighters!

231
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,073
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>You're into that crap too, huh, Hodgins?</i>

232
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,311
<i>Dude, it's barbaric. When it shows up</i>
<i>on cable, I can't turn it off.</i>

233
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,682
- And it's actually legal?
- Completely sanctioned.

234
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,721
They do wear
some protective gear...

235
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,724
<i>which would fly in the face</i>
<i>of our girl's injuries.</i>

236
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,726
- Unless it was underground.
- Underground where?

237
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,024
Come on. Haven't you guys
ever seen <i>Fight Club?</i>

238
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,759
Illegal, no-holds-barred slugfests.
Modern day <i>panem et circenses.</i>

239
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,324
But generally there's no free bread.

240
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,200
- What?
- So Don Morgan didn't beat his wife.

241
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,173
Hate to say I told you so.

242
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,011
Why didn't you tell us, Don?

243
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,173
Because I didn't know.
All right? She never told me.

244
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:41,515
- Your own wife didn't tell you
that she was fighting?
- Because I'd never let her.

245
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,112
<i>Billie hadn't boxed in a year.</i>

246
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,125
Commission took her license away
when they found out about her hearing.

247
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,684
It about broke her heart,
but she was done.

248
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,889
- Apparently not.
- <i>You know what I think?</i>

249
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,263
I think somebody offered Billie an illegal fight
and you jumped at the chance for a payday.

250
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,826
- Are you out of your mind?
- You borrowed money from Mackey
and you put it all on Billie.

251
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,872
And she ended up paying the price.

252
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,465
- No! That's not true!
- Who are you protecting, Don?

253
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,739
Nobody!
Look, I swear I didn't know.

254
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,043
Don, we can protect you if you let us.

255
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:14,848
If I knew who killed Billie, I'd tell ya.
Believe me. Please.

256
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,955
- Why would anyone fight illegally
in the first place?
- There's limited options.

257
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,256
Not everybody
can be Oscar De La Hoya.

258
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,263
Who?

259
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,267
Injuries, criminal past, failed drug tests...
leaves them with no other skills.

260
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,498
- So they take on a fight
wherever they can find one.
- Even if it kills them?

261
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,438
- Mmm.
- [Phone Rings, Beeps]

262
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,940
<i>Brennan.</i>

263
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,944
I found something in the particulates
from Billie's shoes.

264
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,946
Traces of hexavalent chromium.

265
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,313
It's a chemical used in high-end
automotive shops specializing in chroming.

266
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,581
Mechanics who use them have to
file reports with the E.P.A.

267
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,588
Ow! What?

268
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,489
- [Brennan] Hey! No gambling!
- Am I interrupting something?

269
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,493
[Booth]
It's just keno, all right?

270
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,258
I'm sorry if Hodgins
lost me at hexavalium chromo...

271
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,664
Hexavalent chromium.
And we need to find some.

272
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,670
How can we contact
the Environmental Protection Agency?

273
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,206
Yeah, I'm on it.

274
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,240
- Whew.
- This was an auto shop?

275
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:18,147
Yeah. E.P.A., they shut it down months ago
for hazardous waste material.

276
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,152
It was the only shop authorized
to use that chromium stuff.

277
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,154
See it anywhere?

278
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,714
Could be absorbed into
the dust particles on the floor.

279
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,783
Along with flash paper.

280
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,556
- What's that?
- Betting slips.

281
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,189
Burn fast in case there's a raid.

282
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,327
Look at this.

283
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,997
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>They painted a ring for the fights.</i>

284
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,099
- <i>So this was the fight club.</i>
- If there's blood, I'd say it is.

285
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,167
Where's your, uh, light thingie?

286
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,516
<i>Blood.</i>

287
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,417
The whole place is covered in blood.

288
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,223
Of the 30 blood samples
found in the body shop...

289
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,854
six were A-positive,
same as Billie Morgan.

290
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,693
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>Still waiting on DNA.</i>

291
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,393
30 fighters translates to five two-person
fights per hour over a three-hour period.

292
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,561
Or three fights over five hours,
six fights over...

293
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,231
We get the idea, Zack.
Lots of fights.

294
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,072
I ran thermal imaging on Billie's remaining
soft tissue to reconstruct her injuries.

295
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,442
<i>This is what she might've</i>
<i>looked like after the fight.</i>

296
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,504
Ah, the sweet science.

297
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:28,042
Just when I get to a place where I can almost
stomach seeing maggots eating intestines, this.

298
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,884
<i>How could anybody</i>
<i>do this to themselves?</i>

299
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,083
In 900 B.C., the Greek ruler Theseus
entertained himself...

300
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,127
watching two men in chairs
beat each other to death.

301
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,323
Just saying, it's nothing new.

302
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,731
<i>I can work up force and velocity readings</i>
<i>for each blow.</i>

303
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:47,431
Zack can help me I.D. her opponent from
the circumference and diameter of the fists.

304
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,066
I'd rather Zack focus
on our second weapon for Roberts.

305
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,110
None of these blades
are narrow enough.

306
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:56,136
- It's as if his vertebrae
was cut with a razor blade.
- <i>[Hodgins] Or a razor wire.</i>

307
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,115
Luca Brasi.

308
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,776
<i>The Godfather?</i>

309

Please, someone buy a DVD player.

310
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,684
- You mean a garrote?
- Yes. A garrote pulled so tightly around Luca's...

311
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,318
Or rather Roberts's neck...

312
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,296
It sliced through his throat
and severed his carotid artery.

313
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,992
Okay, the whole
"maggots eating intestines" thing...

314
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,559
<i>is not nearly as gross to me now.</i>

315
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,571
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Thanks a lot.

316
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,574
Agent Zhang said he found the owner
of the old body shop.

317
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:27,078
He said some guy paid him $3,000 cash
just to use the place for one night.

318
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,080
No names, no questions asked.

319
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,582
- Seems like a theme in this town.
- [Chuckles] Yeah.

320
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,586
Why is he hitting on a 16? I mean, look at him.
He's completely distracted.

321
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,090
Well, you know what? Actually, Bones, you can.
If the face card is show...

322
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,921
All right.

323
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,860
- I don't want to hear it.
- <i>There he is.</i>

324
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:49,265
- Look at this. It's my buddy, Lou Mackey.
- Great. We're friends now.

325
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,928
I need you to tell me where a fight fan
can get a little, uh...

326
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,472
- Seeley?
- Frankie?

327
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,134
What are you doing
back in Vegas, huh?

328
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,541
- Man's got a lot of friends.
- So it would seem.

329
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,671
- I'll catch up with you later, Frankie.
- Hey, Lou.

330
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,978
- See you, friend.
- Is he a problem?

331
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,951
No, no. That's all good.
Hey, look at you.

332
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,954
Yeah.
Frankie Daniels.

333
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,115
Hey, Temperance Brennan,
Frank Daniels.

334
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,285
- We served in the Gulf together.
- That's right. Hit the Strip
the minute we got back.

335
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,727
- And you never left?
- I bounce around.

336
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:22,198
You know, here, Chicago, L.A. You know me,
huh, Seel. Always chasing rainbows.

337
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,292
Good ol' Frankie boy, huh?
How's Karen?

338
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,635
No, no. That's over. You know?
She ran off with some loser stockbroker.

339
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,074
- You know, it's just as well. I don't need that.
- Frankie, you all right?

340
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,875
Don't start with that, huh? It's been
too many years. I'm getting by, all right?

341
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,473
- Yeah. Guys like Lou Mackey?
- Yeah, well, you know, minor...

342
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,541
minor occupational hazard.

343
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,985
- Have you considered medication?
- Oh, Bones!

344
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,752
An antidepressant might raise
your norepinephrine level.

345
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,157
It could help control the impulsivity.

346
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:53,460
- What are you, a drug rep now or something?
- Excuse us, Bones, okay?

347
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,759
Wondering if you know anything
about these underground fight clubs.

348
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,170
Yeah. Actually, I do know one.
Bare knuckles. No rules.

349
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,175
All right, I need to know where.

350
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,406
It moves around. This guy, Joe Nolan,
he sells 800 numbers.

351
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,381
- You call, you find out the time,
the place, code to get in.
- The old boxerJoe Nolan?

352
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,386
The welterweight champ in '92.
He owns a gym here on Federal.

353
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,547
- Thanks, man.
- Hey, uh...

354
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,957
Think you could spot me a couple of bucks?
Forgot my wallet at the house.

355
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,723
- Yeah.
- Just something, you know? I'll get you back.

356
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,787
Yeah.

357
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,367
Frankie's a better guy
than he seems.

358
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,369
And yet he knows this Nolan guy.

359
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,871
Anybody who knows the fight game
knows Joe Nolan.

360
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,137
The guy he was, you know,
set to be the next Sugar Ray...

361
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,145
until he was accused of
throwing a couple fights.

362
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,478
What? You mean losing on purpose?
Why would anyone do that?

363
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,452
- I should talk toJoe alone.
- What's with this sudden impulse
to leave me behind?

364
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,455
I'll tell you, Bones, the usual rules,
they don't apply here.

365
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,822
The deeper we get, I don't want anyone
knowing that we're F.B.I.

366
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:58,260
- Well, that's easy for me. I'm not.
- Okay, fine.

With a fist size
of approximately 90 millimeters.

393
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,245

That was amazing.
What got into you?

438
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:56,659
It's from when I used to watch old movies
with my dad. He really liked Clara Bow.

439
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,703
Clara Bow was a silent film star.

440
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,864
Yeah, but I... I guess that's how
I always imagined she sounded.

441
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,909
Just like you imagined
she carried around a wad of cash?

442
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:09,242
Oh, that. I couldn't sleep last night,
so I snuck off to play a little crap.

443
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,249
Craps, Bones. Plural.
And I can't believe your beginner's luck.

- Don't say that. You'll jinx it.
- Since when do you believe in jinxes?

445
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,747
I don't. But after hearing
the crap dealer say it...

446
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,656
Crap dealer's right. No jinxes.
We got a big night ahead of us.

447
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,655
<i>All right.</i>
<i>The federal prosecutor here and Billie here.</i>

cross-reference with the dead beetles...

safely.

451
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:36,330
Not that she was safe, letting herself
get drawn into a fight like that.

452
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:40,344
- We've all been in a fight or two
we wish we hadn't.
- Not me.

453
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,575
You've never fought?
Never thrown a punch?

454
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,582
Never saw the logic of it.

455
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,584
It's not about logic.

456
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,779
It's... It's emotional.
It's anger.

457
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,449
I don't get angry.
It's not rational.

458
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,424
What if you were on the beach
and someone kicked sand in your face?

459
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,860
- I don't go to the beach.
- All right, work with me here, Zack.

460
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,056
There has to be something
that would piss you off.

461
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:04,033
What if I call you a scrawny twit
who can't hold a normal conversation
with a 10-year-old?

462
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,536
I don't have much in common
with a 10-year-old.

463
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,539
And although I don't know
what a twit is...

464
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,075
objectively, I am thin
and lack muscular definition.

465
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,942
- Dude, you're a Vulcan.
And a dull Vulcan at that.
- Can we please work?

466
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:19,211
Now you're pissing me off. You're a freak, man.
Anger is a part of being human.

00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,811
- Grow a set.
- I would really like to work, Hodgins.

00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,427
Monroe has calcium deposits
on his left medial epicondyle.

627
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,562
And that helps me how?

628
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,503
Excuse me.

629
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,800
Excuse me.

630
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:10,337
He can't extend his arm, and he lacks
range of motion in his quadratus lumborum.

631
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,280
<i>Hit him there.</i>

632
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,514
- Hit him where?
- In his lower back above his right kidney.

633
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,680
The tide has turned, my friends.

634
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:23,625
- <i>I told you she could fight.</i>
- She doesn't fight. She dominates.

635
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,366
<i>Give him your Nolan move!</i>

636
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,436
[Groans]

637
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,520
Wow.

638
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,495
You can say that again.

639
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,727
- How could I miss that?
- We all missed it, Zack.

640
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,893
Missed what? What is it?

641
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,836
- Your winner! The last man standing!
- [Crowd Groaning, Booing]

642
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,102
<i>Tony the Man-eating Tiger!</i>

643
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,166
Tony the Tiger!

644
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,405
- I did it.
- Your winner!

645
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,812
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

646
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,543
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

647
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,915
- Hey, Cam.
- We missed it.

648
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,921
The fatal blow was obscured
by all her other injuries.

649
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,254
Marisol cracked Billie's ribs,
but not hard enough to puncture the lung.

650
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:32,228
It was a bat. The same baseball bat
that killed the federal prosecutor.

651
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,230
- What is it?
- [Beeps]

652
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,860
It was a baseball bat that killed Billie,
just like the one used on Roberts.

653
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:51,915
<i>So when you're dressed, um, the agent</i>
<i>will take you back to the airport.</i>

654
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,909
Marisol...

655
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,917
why do you fight?

656
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:05,292
Where else am I gonna make a thousand
in one night without selling myself?

657
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,765
And I can make even more betting on myself,
long as I ain't greedy.

658
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,430
- What do you mean, greedy?
- Bookies don't mind us
making a few bucks on the side.

659
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,939
- But just a few.
- Had you bet on your fight with Billie?

660
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,205
- Girl cost me 200 dollars.
- Had Billie bet on herself?

661
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,008
Marisol.

662
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:29,314
From what I heard,
some guys picked Billie up after the fight.

663
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:33,050
- They didn't look happy.
- Why didn't you tell the police? Or tell us?

664
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,719
Look, I might not have much,
but what I got I aim to keep.

665
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:40,890
What could be so important to you that you
could let somebody get away with murder?

666
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,899
My daughter.

667
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,731
She's two.
She lives with my mom, okay?

668
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,569
- And if they found out I was brought here...
- Who's they?

669
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,135
Look, I don't know.

670
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,509
And I don't want to know.

671
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,741
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

672
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,155
- [Brennan] Thanks, Angela.
- [Beeps]

673
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,853
So we were right. Billie bet on herself,
which is why I bet on you.

674
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:13,454
- You bet on me?
- Yeah, with Nick, the guy from Nolan's gym.

675
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,965
It was one of two reasons.
But when I heard the odds, I couldn't...

676
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,968
- My odds? What were they?
- You were a 20-to-1 underdog.

677
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,630
- So I bet with Nick figuring that...
- 20-to-1 against?

678
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,640
Really?
Did I look that bad?

679
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,506
If Nick pays me, he's not our guy.

680
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,843
If he doesn't, it may not prove he killed Billie,
but it'll put him in strong contention.

681
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,782
At the very least.
Very smart, Bones.

682
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,944
What was the other reason?

683
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,181
Come on.
I have winnings to collect.

684
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,454
<i>Hey, Nick!</i>
<i>Thought you ran out on us.</i>

685
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,460
Nick Arno don't run
from anybody, sweetheart.

686
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:47,019
Arno? Sweet Pete's kid?

687
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,033
That was quite a show
you put on tonight, army boy.

688
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,070
- Well, I had my lucky charm here.
- And you owe us some money.

689
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,071
I suppose.

690
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:59,906
But the gentleman I answer to, there's an
unwritten rule about fighters getting greedy.

691
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,842
<i>Plus their spouses, too, I'm afraid.</i>

692
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,279
- No, we're not married.
We're not even engaged.
- What's the rule?

693
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,079
<i>Enjoy a taste,</i>
<i>but never expect a meal...</i>

694
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,143
least of all with a ringer involved.

695
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,621
- <i>Wait. I ain't no ringer.</i>
- What's a ringer?

696
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,022
- They think I cheated.
- <i>She's good, army boy.</i>

697
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,026
Real good.

698
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:20,257
- But I seen Monroe take out whole biker gangs.
- Then I want my thousand back.

699
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,561
- Consider it a fine.
- Fine? Are you serious?

700
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,726
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear here.

701
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,033
As our new top seed,
he works for us now.

702
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,539
You don't just punch out
our best guy and walk away...

703
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,042
not when there's
more money to be made.

704
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,773
- You think you can make me fight for you?
- You only find out if you don't.

705
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,509
I want to talk to this gentleman
that you answer to.

706
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,517
And I want world peace.

707
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,519
Look, take my advice.

708
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,114
LetJoe here escort you
safely back to your hotel.

709
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,786
Let your beautiful...
whatever she is...

710
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,795
ice your wounds.

711
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,730
In about a day or two,
we'll come and get you for your next fight.

712
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,728
- Get 'em outta here, Joe.
- <i>Let's go.</i>

713
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,042
I vouched for you. So it's my ass in the sling.
You understand?

714
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,045
- We didn't mean to get you in trouble.
- Yet here I am.

715
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,547
So you're gonna do
exactly what Nick says.

716
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,550
Now, the people that are running things,
they don't play.

717
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,052
I got enough strikes
against me as it is.

718
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,282
- You got an itch, Joe?
- What?

719
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,157
The cortisone. If it wasn't injected,
it could've been topical, like the pine oil.

720
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:27,994
They're both common ingredients
in lotions used to treat skin ailments...

721
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,228
- What the hell is she talking about?
- She's talking about your rash.

722
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,236
Psoriasis?

723
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,568
Eczema, which is none
of your concern. Let's go.

724
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,233
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa.
Where we gonna go, Joe?

725
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,300
We gonna go back to our hotel or...

726
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,369
mile marker 15?

727
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:49,816
<i>Where we found Billie Morgan</i>
<i>and Mason Roberts. You remember them.</i>

728
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,924
Who are you people?

729
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,983
I'm with the F.B.I., Joe.

730
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,122
<i>Look, I don't have my badge, I don't have</i>
<i>my gun, but you'd be wise to believe me.</i>

731
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,133
- Now, you have a choice.
- What kind of choice do I have?

732
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:08,365
To be the man that you were
before you threw your first fight.

733
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:14,945
Or you wind up dead
like the rest of these guys.

734
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:18,175
You were the real deal.
You were strong and fast.

735
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,275
Everybody wanted to
fight like you.

736
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,684
There was so much money.

737
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,817
Easy money.

738
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,362
I thought I could handle it.

739
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,558
<i>He was gonna get me</i>
<i>another shot at the title.</i>

740
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,659
- Who?
- <i>Nick's father, Sweet Pete.</i>

741
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,364
And he's owned me ever since.

742
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,373
Made me throw more fights.

743
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,433
- Made you kill Mason Roberts?
- I didn't kill anybody.

744
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,179
I just buried 'em.

745
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,374
For Pete?

746
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:58,149
<i>And when Billie Morgan</i>
<i>won her bet, you buried her too.</i>

747
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:02,659
She was a sweet kid,
just looking for a way out.

748
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,853
I begged Pete to let her be.

749
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,591
- He killed her.
- <i>Might as well have done it myself.</i>

750
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,533
I brought her in here. I knew
what kind of punks she'd be dealing with.

751
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,036
Bad enough
you're under Sweet Pete's thumb.

752
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,562
But now you're under his son's too?

753
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,371
That's what happens when
your luck turns in this town.

754
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,538
You keep hoping
it's gonna turn around again...

755
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,606
<i>hoping you're gonna</i>
<i>get back to even.</i>

756
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,009
But you never do.

757
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,117
Write your own story now, Joe.

758
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:40,220
You can make Nick, Sweet Pete,
all his friends just disappear...

759
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:44,859
the way they did to Billie and Roberts.
