1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,730
-How many shooters?
-Two.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,760
-How many down?
-One. 15-Year-Old boy.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,650
-How bad?
-Not good.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,860
-Can he talk?
-They're not optimistic.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,070
All right,get whatever
you can. I'm almost there.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,990
Boxer.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:28,890
Jerry reavers.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,850
Took one in the est
seven,ight minutes ago.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,550
He wasn't conscious
enough to talk.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,550
Please tell me
we have a witness.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,090
Coming your way.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,740
Mr. Wilcox?

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,910
This is my partner,inspector
lindsay boxer.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,380
Tell her what you saw.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,340
All right,i come
out of the club.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,990
I step off the curb.

17
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,230
This white van
blows right by me.

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,290
-A white van?
-Yeah.

19
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,170
He came so close to
me,he could've hit me.

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,570
He pulls up. He parks.

21
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,860
Then a different
car blows past him,

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,160
Pulls up,parks
right over there.

23
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,210
A guy in a red hoodie jumps
out,starts firing away.

24
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,170
The--The guy in
the red hoodie,

25
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,600
He was out of his car
when he was firing?

26
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,110
Yeah,and the guy in the
van starts firing back.

27
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,280
I didn't s the kid in the
middle till he got hit.

28
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,960
Is that boy gonna
be all right?

29
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,170
He's alive. Did you see
either of the shooters?

30
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,290
Yeah,the guy in
the red hoodie,

31
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,460
I got a real
good look at him--

32
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,700
White guy,maybe 30.

33
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,820
Now mr. Wilcox didn't see
the car across the street

34
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,960
Or the make of the van,but
the van had a porthole,

35
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,150
Driver's side.

36
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,350
This man in the
red sweatshirt--

37
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,700
We'd like you to sit down with
a sketch artist and describe him.

38
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,810
-This officer here will arrange it.
-Yeah,of course.

39
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,210
Cindy thomas,"san
francisco register."

40
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,400
I am a friend of
inspector-- Lindsay!

41
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,990
She's all right,officer.

42
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,860
Hey,what are you doing here?

43
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,760
Thought you were
reading "eat pray love."

44
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,590
Thought you were
watching "atonement."

45
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,500
So i hear it was a
drive-By turned shootout.

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,530
Any ideas?

47
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,300
Crazy wild hunch--
Drug dealers.

48
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,650
Hey. Hey. 9-1-1
just took a call--

49
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,880
A white van with a porthole
weaving down georgia

50
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,440
And 4th dinged a couple cars.

51
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,720
The guy can barely drive.

52
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,810
He must have been hit.

53
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,610
You will not even notice
me in the backseat.

54
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,520
Okay,fine. Sheesh!

55
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,870
He's still in the car.

56
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,470
He must be hit bad.
He's barely moving.

57
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,490
Police! Drop your weapon!

58
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm going in! Call for backup!

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,430
I'll take the other side.

60
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,680
5-Henry-15,i
need a 4-0-8

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,870
And fire to roll
my location,code 3!

62
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,510
Don't turn around,or i
will blow your head off.

63
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,740
Toss the 9.

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,370
I'm not giving up my gun.

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,700
I don't want to shoot
you,but if it means me

66
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,100
Getting out of here
alive,i'll do it.

Barney,barney,barney.

71
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,680
Tell your clnt he'll take five
to ten for aggravated assault,

72
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,790
Or i'll get a jury to put him
away for 20 on attempted homicid

73
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,370
You're a dol bye.

74
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,240
How was last night?

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,510
Last night was,uh...

76
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,170
Last night was good-Looking,smart
and has great abs.

77
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,300
I mean six-Pack,not
just the top two.

78
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,660
Have i mentioned
single life is fabulous?

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,970
And how'd you meet this one?

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,140
Saw him on the
treadmill. Woof.

81
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,590
-Only one problem.
-What,only one?

82
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,050
Claire's guest room
is not the place

83
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,320
For late-Night
screams of passion.

84
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,020
Screams?

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,540
A friend at mercy
tells me the kid shot

86
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,590
Last night pulled through.

87
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,880
Yeah,he's out of i.C.U.,

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,630
But he didn't see anything.

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,740
This one,on the other
hand,was not so lucky.

90
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,240
Chief medical examiner
came in to look,

91
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,190
Said this is why he
liked being behind a desk

92
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,060
And had deputies like me.

93
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,320
We might get an i.D. On him.

94
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,680
I managed a
partial thumbprint.

95
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,550
Pretty good one.

96
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,190
What? He barely has a hand.

97
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,960
Just enough skin left,though.

98
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,070
Did you send the
print to quantico?

99
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,220
And s.F.P.D.,like every
other time i've gotten prints.

100
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,620
I took these out of him.

101
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,560
One of 'em blew
his heart apart.

102
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,850
What kind of bullet is that?

103
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,020
Very chichi--
Incendiary . 308.

104
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,180
In english,that would be?

105
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,940
It hits your
gas tank--Boom.

106
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,860
That's probably an answer
to my partial print.

107
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,990
I ess our john doe
here is in the system.

108
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,100
?????????Claire?

109
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,810
He's not a drug dealer.

110
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,180
His name is steven russo...

111
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,050
And he's a cop.

112
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,970
Steven russo--He was one of
ours,undercover narcotics.

113
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,510
And he wasn't just
killed,he was burned alive.

114
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,030
We're gonna find who did
this and let them know

115
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,720
What it means when
they kill a cop.

116
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,230
Boxer and jacobi
are lead inspectors.

117
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,060
Okay,here's what we know.

118
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
The white van was ours.

119
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,710
It was his undercover vehicle.

120
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,310
What we don't know iif he was
killed because he was a cop.

121
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,460
The message,people,is
don't assume anything.

122
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,880
All right,mitchell's
team,you take street sources.

123
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,490
Miller's team,take
central records.

124
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,040
I'm liaison to narcotics.

125
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,350
Let's go.

126
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,320
Do we know what russo
was doing undercover?

127
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,980
Nothing yet.

128
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,890
Okay,why the stonewall
from narcotics?

129
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,230
It's messy. One of
their guys is down.

130
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,600
I'd act the same way.

131
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,680
Boxer,jacobi,they need
you in the evidence room.

132
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,850
Oh,hey,hey,linz,uh,look,since
kiss me not killer has been quiet

133
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,050
For four months now,the feds
no longer consider you a target.

134
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,390
Throw a party.

135
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,190
No more fbi agents in
your rear-View mirror.

136
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,940
They don't actually
believe he's done.

137
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,930
Maybe we caught a break here.

138
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,260
Don't bet on it,tom.
They never quit.

139
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,940
I want to talk
to russo's wife.

140
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,060
No. Narcotics hasn't
notified her yet.

141
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,370
He was undercover. It's
an ongoing operation.

142
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,100
Do you have any leads at all?

143
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,190
You know,the more
i think about it,

144
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,480
There's something i don't get.

145
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,980
This guy in the red hood,

146
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,470
Thone that blew up russo's
van--He got the drop on me.

147
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,230
He had an assault rifle
inches from my head.

148
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,350
He'd already killed
another person.

149
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,190
So why didn't he
shoot me,you know?

150
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,560
Why let me live?

151
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,980
-Cindy.
-Cindy.

152
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,960
I don't know how you do it.

153
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,390
If some guy held
a gun to my head,

154
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,010
<i>I'd be a total mess...
unless it was him.</i>

155
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,530
You're drooling.

156
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,780
-You're not?
-No.

157
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,280
Just observing.

158
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,330
Three coffees,light.

159
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,970
Who's that?

160
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,770
We don't know,but
lindsay likes him.

161
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,630
Grow up.

162
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,370
Wow,he likes you.

163
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,330
Right now he's dng a classic
take-A-Second-Look fake phone call.

164
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,850
He'll turn this
way in five seconds.

165
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,330
That's ridiculous.

166
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,970
Okay,not totally ridiculous.

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,230
Go talk to him,and while
you're at it,forget tom.

168
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,490
Oh,god,that's... over.

169
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,540
I mean,officially,it's over.

170
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,030
And--And i am ready
to--To get back out there.

171
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,270
I'm just not a make-
The-First-Move kind of girl.

172
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,140
So claire said
that the white van

173
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,860
Was blown up using
incendiary bullets.

174
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,990
-Can i use that?
-Sure.

175
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,700
Do we have anything on the
victim--Name,age,anything?

176
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,130
Still working on it.

177
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,530
All right,well,keep me posted.

178
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,850
Why did we just lie to her?

179
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,580
Why didn't we tell
her the victim's a cop?

180
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,640
<i>Undercover cop.</i>

181
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,560
Well,i hear tom
talked to narco again.

182
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,750
They won't let us
talk to russo's wife.

183
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,420
We're still getting a
stonewall from narcotics?

184
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,450
She deserves to know
her husband is dead.

185
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,390
Let's pretend we didn't get that
message and go see her anyway.

186
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,530
I begged him to quit.

187
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,350
Anything but undercover.

188
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,490
He--He was a
dedicated cop.

189
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,380
He should have been
dedicated to us!

190
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,630
Mom? Mom?

191
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,380
-Nicky won't give me the remote.
-All right.

192
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,910
-Hey,guys,why don't you show me your room?
-Okay,come on!

193
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,710
Do you know if steve
was on assignment?

194
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,500
I only saw him two or
three nights a week.

195
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,260
You know how it is.

196
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,640
They have to avoid
being followed.

197
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,250
When was the last
time you saw him?

198
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,050
Monday night.

199
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,940
You married,inspector?

200
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,990
Uh,no.

201
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,190
Well,a wife always knows,and
i should have known,

202
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,270
Even before he told me.

203
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,930
What do you mean?

204
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,980
I mean he wanted out...

205
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,410
And i never should
have let him go back.

206
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,550
This was yesterday.

207
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,930
<i>Hey,it's me.</i>

208
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,260
<i>I got a minute.</i>

209
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,970
<i>I just wanted to say you were</i>

210
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,180
<i>Things are crazy out
here--  Really strange.</i>

211
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,620
<i>It's goin' bad.</i>

212
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,030
<i>So listen,i'm gonna
make them bring me in,</i>

213
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,420
<i>And i'm never goin'
out again.  I love you.</i>

214
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,660
Hey,kid.

215
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,480
Marty.

216
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,250
You could say "dad."

217
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,670
What are you doing here?

218
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,460
I would have phoned,but...

219
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,870
You don't take my calls.

220
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,760
-It's been what,six years?
-Seven.

221
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,660
I didn't know
you were counting.

222
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,040
When you got thrown
off the force,

223
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,700
I thought i made it clear i'm
not interested in your life.

224
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,880
You crossed the
line,talking to the widow.

225
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,450
I still have a few friends in
the department who talk to me.

226
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,070
Watch out,kid.

227
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,080
People see you bending the
rules,and they're not happy.

228
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,860
Me,bending the rules?

229
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,610
Sorry. I don't need career
advice from a dirty ex-Cop.

230
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,990
Don't go easy on me just
'cause i'm your old man.

231
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,260
Right,i forgot.
It's all about you.

232
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,790
Marty,it's my job. It's
my case. It's my li.

233
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,730
Stay away.

234
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,790
Your sources in the
homicide bureau--

235
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,150
They said they couldn't i.D.
The victim in that explosion?

236
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,130
That's what they said.

237
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,000
My sources say the body in
the van was an undercover cop.

238
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,070
Narcotics flipped out
when asked for comment.

239
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,310
I'll... uh,i'--
I'll look into it.

240
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,720
"Undercover cop shot
in the line of duty."

241
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,860
If we wait too
long to go with it,

242
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,340
The "chronicle"
will have it first.

243
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,050
We're going with
scott's story.

244
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,990
How's mr. Wilcox doing on
our man in the red hood?

245
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,400
In your computer
in ten minutes.

246
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,640
Thanks.

247
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,230
Hey,linz. The
"register" has atory up--

248
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,580
"Unnamed undercover
cop killed."

249
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Every relative of every
undercover cop within 100 miles

250
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,700
Is calling to see if their
loved one died in that van.

251
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,030
Have we heard
from narcotics yet?

252
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,750
-Zip,nada,nothing.
-Okay.

253
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,910
Any relative that calls needs to
be interviewed by an inspector,

254
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,350
And anything interting
comes straight to us.

255
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,650
Lindsay?

256
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,620
You all knew the victim was
a cop,and you didn't tell me.

257
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,650
When an officer gets
killed,people get scared.

258
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,150
We hadn't even
notified the wife yet.

259
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,680
Don't you think that i
would have held the story?

260
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,260
What,suddenly you
don't trust me?

261
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,700
Cindy,we absolutely trust you.

262
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,030
Funny way of showing it.

263
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,490
I thought that
we were friends.

264
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,190
I thought that we
were in this together.

265
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,540
-I've...
-Coffee light.

266
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,210
I just--I don't
usually do this.

267
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,100
I-I left my money
in my wallet.

268
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,860
Don't even sweat it.

269
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,850
-Just pay me later.
-Thank you.

270
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,200
Sorry.

271
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,300
-You seem...
-Annoyed and frustrated?

272
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,510
No,i was gonna say
u seem to like coffe

273
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,940
-I'm pete.Pete raynor.
-Hi. Lindsay boxer.

274
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,010
-Hi.
-Hi.

275
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,390
I've been fiending for a
blueberry muffin for hours.

276
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,370
You don't look blueberry.

277
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,960
What do i look like?

278
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,200
More... scone.

279
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,220
Know something,lindsay
boxer? You're very pretty.

280
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,530
Tha--  Tha-That's quite
a jump from scones.

281
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,210
We can always go back to
pastry. No,no,no.Uh,it's...

282
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,140
Thank you.

283
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,620
Sorry.

284
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,500
-Well,i should get back to work.
-Yeah,of course.

285
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,800
-I mean,i-I
will,too. -All right.

286
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,390
-Okay.
-Excuse me.

287
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,250
Um,i'll stay. Look...  okay.

288
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,080
You know,we all get frustrated
and annoyed sometimes.

289
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,240
Sure,okay,lindsay.
It's not your fault.

290
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,760
You connect with him,but he
doesn't ask for your phone number.

291
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,580
I'm sure there's a
logical explanation.

292
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,490
-Right.
-Right.

293
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,530
Yep,no problem.

294
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,850
Sutton just interviewed
a relative who came in,

295
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,380
Says we should talk to
her. She is on her way up.

296
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,420
What?

297
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,850
-Nothing.
-Come on.

298
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,280
No,it's stupid.

299
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,340
Okay,what would prompt you,

300
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,420
A guy who thinks a
woman is "very pretty,"

301
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,970
To not ask for her phone
number? Totally hythetical.

302
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,450
You're right. It's stupid.

303
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,680
-Told you.
-Maybe i'm married.

304
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,330
-No ring.
-I have a girlfriend.

305
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,280
-Walks like a single guy.
-Gay.

306
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,210
-I'd know.
-This is san francisco.

307
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,700
I'm positive.

308
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,740
Inspector boxer?

309
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,800
Sandy foster. I
was told to see you.

310
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,980
Right,yeah. Uh,thank
you for coming in.

311
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,030
This is inspector jacobi.

312
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,610
-Hi.
-Hi.

313
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,350
I understand you have a
relative who's undercover?

314
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,610
Yeah,andy mccarthy.
He's in narcotics.

315
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,420
Look,i just need to know if
he's the cop that was killed.

316
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,700
Be-- Mrs. Foster,the man who was
killed isn't named andy mccarthy.

317
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,510
Oh,my god. Thank
you. Thank you.

318
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,650
The--The problem is--Is
we haven't spoken today.

319
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,070
He always calls me
wednesday mornings.

320
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,390
So,i mean,our--Our
dad is in the hospital,

321
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,130
So he calls for
updates and--

322
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,460
You're sure it wasn't him
in that van? It wasn't him.

323
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,000
Okay.

324
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,390
-Anyway,i'll let you get back to work.
-Thank you.

325
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,420
Andy mccarthy. Undercover
narcotics? Just like russo.

326
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,680
"Undercover
narcotics." Mccarthy.

327
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,320
Oh,my god.

328
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,740
Does andy mccarthy look like
the guy that blew up that van?

329
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,120
I don't want to know this.

330
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,310
Inspector andy mccarthy
killed inspector steve russo.

331
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,120
One undercover cop
killing another,why?

332
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,460
I can think of a few reasons.
I don't like any of 'em.

333
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,430
Lindsay,warren-- Bill
schroeder,narcotics.

334
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,640
I understand you think one
of my inspectors has gone bad.

335
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,390
Well,captain,it
looks that way.

336
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,900
We have a witness
sketch of the man

337
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,160
That blew up steve russo's
van. It's andy mccarthy.

338
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,080
So andy mccarthy,ten years with
the departmen has started working

339
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,240
For drug dealers and
killing other cops?

340
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,580
I don't buy it.

341
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,260
It's him in the sketch,and
he did blow up russo's van.

342
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,480
What other explanation
would you suggest?

343
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,290
There's an old expression-- When
you hear hoofbeats in the forest,

344
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,050
You look for a
horse,not a zebra.

345
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,270
Steve russo was posing
as a drug dealer.

346
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,370
It was probably another
drug dealer that killed him.

347
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,750
I disagree,and we need
to question mccarthy.

348
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,590
Not while he's on the street.

349
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,260
We're done here.

350
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,340
Were mccarthy and russo
working a case together?

351
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,460
Yes.

352
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,950
Just the two of them?

353
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,430
One other officer--
Henry kraft.

354
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,370
You want to tell
me he's dirty,too?

355
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,350
Well,actually,sir,no,

356
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,110
I wouldn't bet on two cops
going bad at the same time.

357
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,940
Kraft could be in danger.

358
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,570
If mccarthy's killed
one of his partners,

359
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,230
We should be concerned
about the other one.

360
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,080
Captain,pull kraft
off the street.

361
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,700
I don't need advice
on how to run my unit.

362
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,160
If kraft dies,it's on you.

363
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,310
Boxer.

364
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:52,030
Stay away from mccarthy,kraft,their
families... and me.

365
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,100
Get her in line,or
i go to the chief.

366
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,340
You go after a captain
like that,lindsay?

367
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,510
He's got a dirty cop in his
unit,and he won't accept the truth.

368
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,480
You know what?If
you keep this up,

369
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,310
I'll have no choice.

370
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,800
I'll have to take
you off this case.

371
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,250
I didn't want to say anything,

372
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,010
-But i hear your dad dropped by this morning.
-Don't do this.

373
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,170
Come on,we were married
when they got your dad.

374
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,250
I watched you go through it.

375
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,850
I know how difficult it was.

376
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,870
This isn't about my dad.

377
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
We both know what
you're trying to prove.

378
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,710
What i think about andy mccarthy
has nothing to d with my father.

379
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,430
They're both dirty cops.

380
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,960
If i was your priest,i'd say that
you're looking for redemption.

381
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,530
Well,i'm glad
you're not my priest.

382
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,380
Hey,linz.

383
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,980
-Ed,you look good.
-Well,you know,i try.

384
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,660
But she's all yours.

385
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,810
I got a young cop waiting to
be told his life isn't over

386
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,490
Just 'cause he's
in a wheelchair.

387
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,220
-See you at home?
-All right. Bye,baby.

388
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,920
-See you.
-See you later.

389
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,960
-I have to ask you something.
-Yeah?

390
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,270
Tom says i'm going
after this dirty cop

391
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,860
So aggressively
because of my father.

392
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,170
-He's crazy,right?
-Maybe.

393
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,040
And maybe he has a point.

394
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,510
Maybe you're both crazy.

395
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,660
Fine,i'll shut up.

396
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,080
Claire?

397
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,220
What's the matter?

398
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,610
Sorry.

399
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,820
Just working some things out.

400
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,660
What,is this about
jill saying you guys

401
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,690
Are cramping her style again?

402
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,680
No,she hasn't mentioned
that in a while.

403
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,320
It's ed. It's not working.

404
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,130
It?

405
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,050
I knew there was always a chance
that the paralysis would get worse,

406
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,170
And one of the first signs
would be down the,you know.

407
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,930
Your case last year,you know,where
you helped that dtor's daughter?

408
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,670
I tried to get an appointment with
her,but there's a 6-Month wait.

409
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,780
Maybe you can
pull some strings?

410
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,660
-Sure.
-Thanks.

411
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,230
How long has this
been going on?

412
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,660
Almost three months,and
honestly,i am going out of my mind.

413
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,210
-I will call her today.
-Thank you.

414
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,170
And i heard about your
hypothetical situation.

415
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,220
He flirted,i
flirted,and nothing.

416
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,860
Maybe he's shy.

417
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,450
I'd say he's the
opposite of shy.

418
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,520
-Maybe he's gay.
-I'd know.

419
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,540
I'm positive. I'm positive!

420
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,600
I'll see you after lunch.

421
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,370
They're prepping me for
my grand jury testimony

422
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,660
On that double
homicide in the mission.

423
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,250
Yeah,grand jury...

424
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,210
I just figured out how
to find henry kraft.

425
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,780
If you're suggesting what
i think you're suggesting,

426
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,290
The answer is no.

427
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,540
These three cops were making
cases a long time undercover.

428
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,840
They must have given
confidential grand jury testimony.

429
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,970
Linz,no.

430
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,240
If i can see their testimony,

431
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,180
I can find out where they
worked and where they hung out,

432
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,640
And then i can
find henry kraft.

433
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,810
You're talking about sealed
documents-- Their testimony,

434
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,000
-The district attorney's notes.
-I know.

435
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,900
I do this--
Someone finds out,

436
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,400
The least--I
lose my job.

437
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,410
I could be disbarred.

438
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,240
Narcotics won't give me
anything. Come on,jill.

439
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,020
I'm telling you,this
cop is in trouble.

440
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,580
I need something
besides your hunch.

441
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,950
I don't have anything else.

442
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,430
You're not gonna help me?

443
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,720
This isn't about you,just
like it wasn't about cindy.

444
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,200
We're friends,but we
all have jobs to do.

445
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,070
-I'd like to keep mine.
-Okay.

446
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,580
I'm-A find andy mccarthy,and
i'm-A find henry kraft.

447
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,330
And if you don't help
me,i'm-A find a way.

448
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,060
They said the fbi was
finished keeping an eye on me.

449
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,140
I appreciate the concern,but
you're wasting the xpayers' money.

450
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,420
I'm not a fed,inspector,

451
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,990
And you should stop telling stories
about andy mccarthy being dirty.

452
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,200
What is your name,officer?

453
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,670
Look,i have been through
andy mccarthy's checking,

454
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,820
His savings,credit cards.

455
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,890
He is living on
his salary,linz.

456
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,390
Nothing here says he's on a
drug dealer's payroll. Nothing.

457
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,900
I'm buying.

458
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,430
If he's not on a dealer's
payroll,why'd he kill a cop?

459
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,550
Coffee lights,uh,mocha
supremo with extra caramel.

460
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,180
-Jacobi's hooked on sugar.
-Yeah.

461
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,070
Uh,there was a
guy here yesterday.

462
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,980
Oh,yeah,mr. Blueberry muffin.

463
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,550
Yeah. Uh... oh,

464
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,070
Uh,kay,uh,nonfat
latte,double shot.

465
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,680
He wor in that
office building.

466
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,890
Next time he passes by,

467
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,930
Do you want me to
mention you were asking?

468
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,290
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

469
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,230
-No.
-No?

470
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,560
-No.
-No?

471
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,920
Thank you.

472
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,330
I'll drink jacobi's
mocha. Let's walk.

473
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,370
I gotta tell ya,everyone thinks
you're a little overinvested

474
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,700
In this because of your dad.

475
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,930
I am trying to save
a cop's life,okay?

476
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,330
This has nothing to
do withe or my dad.

477
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,850
Linz,we all know it's not easy
being martin boxer's daughter--

478
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,580
The looks,the whispers,living
with it your whole career.

479
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,430
If i say you're right,will you
give me the grand jury notes?

480
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,090
Anyone finds out about this,i
could end up doing time,

481
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,020
And i don't think i'd
enjoy the food in prison.

482
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,530
Read it and burn it.

483
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,710
Before mccarthy
killed steve russo,

484
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,910
They worked a couple
of cases together.

485
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,050
The third
cop--Henry kraft--

486
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,910
Was part of those
operations,too.

487
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,520
This will tell you who they
talked to and where they go.

488
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,410
Henry kraft?

489
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,050
<i>Officer henry kraft?</i>

490
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,630
You want somebody else.

491
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,390
I'm inspector boxer.

492
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,520
This is inspector
jacobi. We need to talk.

493
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,820
I don't need to
talk to nobody.

494
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,380
One of your guys--
Mccarthy--Turned.

495
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,880
You heard about steve russo?

496
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,660
Mccarthy killed him.

497
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,560
Not a chance. I know mccarthy.

498
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,950
<i>We thinkccarthy's
after you now.</i>

499
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,630
I'm undercover.

500
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,120
I'm gonna stay under
until i get called in.

501
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,470
Now the only ones looking
to get me killed are you.

502
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,510
We gotta take him in.

503
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,900
Mccarthy,don't do it!

504
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,900
Come on,man. Everything's
gonna be copasetic.

505
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,840
Come on,baby,put the gun down.

506
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,320
Come on,mccarthy.

507
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,320
Come on,andy.

508
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,540
Put it down. Just put it down.

509
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,070
That's it.

510
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,410
Where's mccarthy?

511
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,720
He's my guy,so i'll
do the interview.

512
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,860
-Captain...
-Not another word.

513
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,120
You went after him in
direct defiance of my orders.

514
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,200
-Bill,it's boxer's case.
-Step back,tom.

515
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,290
Boxer is the reason
that henry kraft

516
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,130
Is in the hospital,not
in the morgue.

517
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,100
You've been blocking us every
step of the wa and i get it--

518
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,430
You got a bad cop,you want
to clean your own house,

519
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,940
It stops here,or i go to i.A.

520
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,940
I'm watching.

521
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,450
Hi,andy.

522
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,340
Andy?

523
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,090
<i>Andy,we need to talk.</i>

524
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,550
Andy?

525
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,380
I have to go.

526
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,530
I can't be here.

527
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,560
You want to tell me why
you shot henry kraft?

528
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,710
<i>You could have shot me,
but you didn't. Why is that?</i>

529
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,060
Man,i have to go.

530
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,320
I cannot be here.

531
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,850
I can't be here!

532
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,090
Tell me about the watch.

533
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,610
Ramos... he gave it to me.

534
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,110
David ramos?

535
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,530
Salvadorian drug lord.

536
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,270
They do that.

537
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:22,510
They buy you things and
treat you like a-A friend.

538
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,980
But you're not.

539
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,310
Ram-- But ramos,man,he
saw right thrgh me.

540
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,030
Ramos made you?

541
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,400
He figured out i was
working undercover.

542
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:47,910
And then they... they...
they put a gun to my head.

543
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,370
They made me tell
them everything.

544
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:59,610
<i>They told me i had to
kill russo and kraft.</i>

545
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,120
Andy,why didn't you
come in and tell us?

546
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:15,000
Because...  they
found out where i live.

547
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,280
Oh,god.

548
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,790
They're in my home.

549
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,160
They have my wife and my son.

550
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,200
I didn't want to kill anyone.

551
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,040
I had to.

552
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,330
They have my family.

553
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,280
They have my family.

554
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,850
Okay. Okay.

555
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,780
The hostages are a woman
and her 10-Year-Old son.

556
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,830
There are two captors.

557
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,210
I want no police presence
within sight of that house.

558
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,780
These guys see any sign of
lice,they'll kill the hostages.

559
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,670
I got it,lieutenant.

560
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,530
No uniforms,no sector cars.

561
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,960
My men know how to do this.

562
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,120
Judge anderson issued warrants

563
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,780
To cover entry
and surveillance.

564
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,970
You wouldn't think
we'd need warrants

565
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,420
To save two
people's lives,right?

566
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,550
Which is why you carry the
gun,and i see the judge.

567
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,100
Good luck.

568
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,710
Hey,i got your
message. What's up?

569
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,590
I'm sorry i didn't
tell you about russo.

570
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,440
It's okay.

571
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,140
What's with the body armor?

572
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,790
Frankly,it's a
little bulky on you.

573
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,210
We got two hostages,and
we're gonna go get 'em.

574
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,940
It's your exclusive
if you want to watch.

575
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,500
Wait,if you're doing this
justecause you feel guilty,

576
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,200
I want to say,awesome!

577
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,900
Lindsay,she signs
a liability release.

578
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,350
Get it before we leave.

579
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,460
Suddenly,this
feel very serious.

580
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,440
Can we see in
the house at all?

581
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,800
They've got every
front window covered.

582
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,490
We might be able to see
something from the back.

583
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,700
Anything from parabolics?

584
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,350
Still positioning.

585
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,980
We should have ears
inside in a minute.

586
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,890
Heat sensor's up.

587
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,090
That must be two
of ramos' men.

588
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,770
Now where are the hostages?

589
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,460
Okay,mccarthy's
wife,son on the floor.

590
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,000
That's a water
heater below them.

591
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,490
We gotta get 'em
ouof that room.

592
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,530
We go in when he's
there,he'll kill 'em all.

593
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,450
-I don't know how we do
-Got something on the horn.

594
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,620
One of 'em's
making a cell call.

595
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,220
Whoever he's talking to says...
mccarthy hasn't checked in.

596
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,050
The guy in the house wants to
know if it's time to shut it down.

597
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,880
The caller thinks
s,but wants to confirm.

598
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,630
Says he'll call back with
an answer in five minutes.

599
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,610
They're gonna kill that
woman and her child.

600
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,630
All right,we create a
diversion at the front,

601
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,140
Draw the second guard
into the living room.

602
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,480
-We go in.
-I'll go.

603
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,640
No. They will make you as
a cop and kill those people

604
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,080
Before you can
ring the doorbell.

605
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:35,950
And they won't make you?

606
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,620
You got "cop" tattooed
on your forehead.

607
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,270
L right,all right.
We need someone else.

608
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,100
Call the bureau.

609
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,130
-We can't get anybody here in five minutes.
-I can do it.

610
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,610
Forget it.

611
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,440
You need someone who's
not a cop. That's me.

612
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,150
And i speak spanish.

613
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,120
I said forget it.

614
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,740
You're a civilian. It's
out of the question.

615
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,810
Narcotics used civilian
decoys in a string

616
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,880
Of busts in the
haight last year.

617
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,210
Those were for dime bag
busts,not hostage situations.

618
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,940
Lieutenant,they're moving
the woman and child.

619
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,790
You have to let me do it.

620
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,880
Tell me how.

621
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,450
Okay. You'll know when we start
to make our move,all right?

622
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,570
You'll see us coming in.

623
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,810
The moment that you
do,drop to the ground.

624
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,590
Don't run,don't move
left or right,okay?

625
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,080
Just pancake on the grou.

626
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,010
Pancake. Got it.

627
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,690
-You scared?
-Terrified.

628
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Good.

629
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,180

637
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,460

She said that you

<i>Ella me dej?/I>

<i>Es que no tiene llaves.</i>

<i>Lárgate, huh?</i>

646
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,650
<i>¿Puede avisar?</i>

647
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,520
<i>La señorita se enojaría si
los gatos se quedan sin comer.</i>

648
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,830
<i>Escúchame.</i>

649
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,980
<i>Eduardo? ¿Cuál es la problema?</i>

650
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,170

I just spoke to st. Mary's.
Your wife and son are fine.

They're gonna release
'em inbout an hour.

668
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,530
Thank you.

669
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:15,320
I spent two years trying to get
someone to testify against ramos.

670
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,030
Now i'm gonna do it myself.

671
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,300
Whatever works.

672
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,320
Cost steve russo his life.

673
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,800
I-I didn't know
him that well.

674
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,680
We weren't friends.

675
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,390
Now he's in my head
every minute of the day...

676
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,050
The cop i killed.

677
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,300
Steve russo...
the cop i killed.

678
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,350
Two visits in two days?

679
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,180
A really unpleasant record.

680
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,090
Congratulations on
saving the cop's family.

681
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,120
I'm proud of you,hon.

682
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,890
Wasn't always this way,was it?

683
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,830
I remember walking
you down the aisle

684
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,950
And sneaking you that slice
of pizza at the reception.

685
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,920
And look how all
that turned out.

686
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:33,930
Good-Bye,marty.

687
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,770
How did you find henry kraft?

688
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,770
You pulled off a miracle,and
people want to know how.

689
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,430
They don't like
you for it,lindsay.

690
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,500
They see you cracking
these impossible cases,

691
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,300
And they want to
know how you do it.

692
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,180
What have you got
that no one else has?

693
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,290
-Who's asking--Schroeder?
-Not just him.

694
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,580
So that's why
you're here--

695
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,160
To tell me that people are
pissed off because i'm a good cop.

696
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,510
No,i'm here to warn you not
to make the same mistake i did.

697
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,280
I wont be taking paper bags
full of $50s from dominic bucci,

698
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,940
If that's what you're asking.

699
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,450
Is that what you think i did?

700
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,670
It's what the
court says you did.

701
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,220
If a case like this
teaches you anything,

702
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,490
It's that things aren't
always what they appear.

703
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,340
I'm still your
father,like it or not.

704
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,620
See you around,lindsay.

705
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,940
-Hey.
-Hi.

706
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,000
How much did you hear?

707
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,630
Didn't hear a thin

708
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,790
We've been,collectively
considering the question of

709
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,640
Why an eligible man
wouldn't ask a smart,funny,

710
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,860
Strong,beautiful woman
for her phone number.

711
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,480
I had nothing to do with this.

712
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:54,740
And?

713
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,540
It's the gun.

714
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,480
-The gun?
-Scared him off.

715
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,690
I wasn't carrying a gun.

716
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,110
-Oh,but he could sense the gun.
-Yeah.

717
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,040
Face it,linz,some women are
always carrying their gun,

718
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,540
Even when they're not.

719
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,200
Sweetie,we love having
you as a houseguest,

720
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,360
But we're cramping your style.

721
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,580
Actually,i think
i'm cramping yours.

722
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,820
Guess our walls
are pretty thin,huh?

723
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,550
-How much have you heard?
-A lot.

724
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,930
All right.

725
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:38,450
I don't know much about
marriage,claire,except thebvious,

726
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,510
Which is consider the possibility
it's always about two people,

727
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,750
Not just one.

728
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,030
Come here.

729
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,150
Great job today.

730
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,440
And i shouldn't have
brought up your father.

731
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,920
It wasn't about him.

732
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,580
Night.

733
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,720
* i tasted,tasted
love so sweet *

734
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,970
* and all of it
was lost on me *

735
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:16,100
* bought and sold
like property *

736
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,030
* sugar on my tongue *

737
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,040
Look,if you think this doctor
friendf lindsay's can help--

738
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,220
No,i don't.

739
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,110
What?

740
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,350
You don't need
a doctor,ed.We do

741
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,750
Someone that we
can talk to about

742
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,180
What's been going on...

743
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,780
With both of us.

744
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,800
* that the simple
should be hard *

745
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:46,540
* all we are,we are *
* all we are,we are *

746
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:53,510
* and every day's a start
* * at something beautiful *

747
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,920
-Lindsay boxe
-I have a question for you.

748
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,240
Me first. How'd you find me?

749
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,640
-I'm a detective.
-Yeah,i heard.

750
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,710
The kid at the coffee cart.

751
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,470
I told him not
to say anything.

752
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,860
-Your question?
-Right. My question is...

753
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,100
Why does a man have
a nice conversation

754
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,060
With a woman that
he thinks is pretty,

755
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,450
And then doesn
ask for her number?

756
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,810
Maybe the man thought
about asking for her number.

757
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,200
W hard did he
think about asking?

758
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,840
It occupied his
whole afternoon,

759
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,260
Including a number of
calls to friends for advice.

760
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,530
But then he remembered that
he's only in town for two weeks.

761
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,130
-Where are you going?
-Cambodia. I build hotels.

762
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,730
I'm there for a year.

763
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,830
So you think in two
weeks i'll get attached,

764
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,810
And then you'll
break my heart?

765
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,440
No,lindsay,i think in two
weeks,leaving might break mine.

766
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,310
Still,i was,um... i was
about to come find you.

767
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,570
Are you-- Are you
a good detective?

768
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,240
Well,i'm--I'm better at
my job than i am at this.

769
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,090
Well,then,detective,who
are those flowers for?

770
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,660
I-I don't have
enough information.

771
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:59,090
* i kept falling over*
* kept looking backwards *

772
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,060
"To lindsay."

773
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,830
-You want to get somethingo eat?
-Yeah.

774
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,270
-N't forget the flowers.
-Okay.

775
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:19,820
* we are *
* and every day's a start *

776
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,580
* at something beautiful *

777
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:32,640
