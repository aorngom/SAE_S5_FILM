1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,600
little some times she
falls asleep on my pillow

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,500
all those number37 not to get die

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,200
what cute

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,800
i already told to know

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,200
that's dangerous

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,400
the practise for the k word

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,900
cats?

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,900
kates ? more ? sex

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,500
once a month

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,200
are you talking to someone
about this ? issues

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,900
you can't even commit
a date!

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,200
because she'd rather be here
with sexy old me.
what do you got?

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
death amst the jacarandas.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,400
neighbor heard a gunshot
about midnight and called it in.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,300
was the shot
preceded by, say,

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,700
shouting or the unds
of a struggle?

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,500
only the lonesome call
of the whip-poor-will.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
you were at the opera
again tonight, weren't you?

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,000
he gets in these moods.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,800
ew. somebody meant business.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,100
well, we can gather it wasn't
a carjacking. that's his car.

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,000
god, he's young.
yeah, 21.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,700
already married.

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,200
ethan williams.
his driver's license says he
lived a half mile up the road.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,300
he's a security guard
at pacific modern art gallery.

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,200
carried a gun--
all the good it did him.
employer probably

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,700
didn't bother to train him
how to use it.

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,400
so the killer disarmed him,
took the gun with him. smart.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,300
you think he was shot
with his own gun?
well, we won't know

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,600
what kd of gun
he had on him.
retrieve bullet, and ?

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,200
(lindsay) are those
blood stains on that scarf?
yeah, i was gonna ride by the labe

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,300
and see if the blood
belonged to the victim.
or our killers.

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,000
what are we thinking?

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,300
ethan came here to meet
somebody and got ambushed?
or he was followed--

35
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,800
they ? his car
? following hime

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,000
pulled his gun...
things went south from there.

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,400
there was a scuffle.
killer lost his scarf.

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,200
maybe he was wounded. ethan got
a clean shot to the forehead.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,900
uh, i'll be right back.

40
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,100
okay, we know nothing
fit to print,

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,000
so don't bother asking.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,900
i wasn't going to ask. i was
going to offer information.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,400
well, in that case,
offer away.

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,500
this park used to be totally
evil-drug-dealer infested.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,900
then there was this whole
save-the-park campaign, a-and--
it got caned up, i know.

46
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,500
who do you think
did the cleaning?
oh, right, the police.

47
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
do you think
the dealers came back?

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,900
could be another one
of our ten possible theories.

49
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,900
maybe his cell records
will shed a little light.

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,300
i'll get rolling
on a subpoena.
looks like another

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,800
?
i love my job.
y at the hall.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,300
i've gotta go notify
a very young widow.

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,300
yes?

54
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,800
good evening.
i'm inspector boxer.

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
this is inspector jacobi.

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,900
we're looking for
ethan williams' wife?

57
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,900
beth?
well, she's with ethan.

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,300
they went out for a walk
when he came home from work.

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,400
we're ethan's parents.
is everything okay?

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
i'm very sorry
to tell you,

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,800
uh, your son
was found dead.

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
he was shot and killed.

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,600
what about beth?
where is she?

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
oh, my god!

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,700
the baby.

66
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,600
they had a baby with them?

67
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,900
beth is
nine months pregnant.

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,800
found a scarf
at the crime scene.

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
ethan's parents said
that beth was wearing one

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,700
when they left.

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,300
it had blood on it.

75
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,500
search the whole park?

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,800
there was no body.
it looks like an abduction.

77
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
the car was abandoned,
and we found beth's purse

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,600
in her bedroom with 200 bucks
and credit cards inside.

79
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,500
so she didn't take off
on her own.

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,400
whoever killed him--

81
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,100
most likely took beth.

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
and there's only one reason

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
people are gonna abduct a woman
who's nine months pregnant.

84
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,900
somebody wants that baby.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,900
beth williams, white female,
20 years old.

86
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,600
we believe she was taken
from hawthorne park

87
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,900
at approximately 11:00 p.m.

88
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,900
now until we find her
and her baby,

89
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,800
they are all you care about.
baker, martinez,

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,300
i want you guys to hit
the art gallery

91
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,300
where beth's husband worked.
you guys work the neighbors,

92
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,400
see if there was anybody
suspicious hanging around beth

93
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,000
or ethan in the last few days.

94
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,800
miller, recanvass
the park area,

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,320
and you look for video cameras
in a 10-block radius.

96
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,319
now this girl is stickin' out
to here. she'll be hard to miss.

97
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
inector boxer's gonna be
in the thick of things,

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,420
so i'm command central.

99
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:41,120
everybodgets o.t. tonigh
let's find her.

100
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,220
(officers speaking indistinctly)
you contact
the girl's parents?

101
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,320
they're both dead. she moved
here out of high school.

102
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,520
outside of her in-laws,
she's got nobody.

103
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
which is probably why
she was in such a hurry

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,220
to start a family of her own.
at least she's young,
white and pretty.

105
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,408
the media will help us.

106
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,631
what was that?
what?

107
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,352
<i>that.</i>

108
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,991
well you got married

109
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,738
soon.
you knew that.

110
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,906
well, yeah,
but th is really soon.

111
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:16,944
you know...

112
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,185
i liked
our invitations better.

113
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,106
they were less fancy.

114
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,967
gee, thanks.

115
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,484
make sure you notify
all the divisions.

116
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,725
our place is kind of small,

117
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,386
so ethan and beth would drive
to the park to take a walk,

118
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,019
you know, get...
get some privacy.

119
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,519
is it possible
they were buying drugs?

120
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,662
no. how can you
even ask me that?

121
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,320
have you seen
anyone unfamiliar

122
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,016
hanging around
the neighborhood lately?

123
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,819
had either of them
made any new friends?

124
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,019
i don't think so.

125
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,720
i mean, ethan was always
out working, you know,

126
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,902
either at the art gallery
or at the mall.

127
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,820
you know, they were trying
to save up for their own place.

128
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,420
how about beth?
was she working?

129
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:13,840
doctor told her  take it easy.
she had some bleeding early on.

130
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,903
but she wants to go to college
after the baby is born,

131
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,720
maybe be a nurse.

132
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,020
was beth already pregnant
when they got married?

133
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,252
uh-huh. they were married almost
a year when that happened.

134
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:27,520
it wasn't planned.

135
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,125
but they got used
to the idea real quick.

136
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,573
they were so excited about
that little baby girl.

137
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,935
find beth...

138
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,053
and my granddaught.

139
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,787
please.

140
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,066
just find them.

141
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,504
how's he doing?

142
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,000
eh. it's a hell
of a thing to lose a kid.

143
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,896
i told him to go home
and try to get some sleep.

144
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,386
you should grab
a couple of hours yourself.

145
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,989
this thing could drag on.
yeah, maybe later.

146
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,339
well,
i'll go make the coffee.

147
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,720
ethan called a bunch
of discount stores

148
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,220
looking for a good deal
on a crib.

149
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,420
okay. what's this call
at 10:00 last night?
somebody named consuelo ?.

150
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,887
she hasn't called me back.

151
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,019
okay, well, i need more
than that. i need a full name.

152
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,520
i need an address.
yeah, phone company couldn't
get us complete records

153
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,893
till start of business.
they're on their way over.

154
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,165
meantime,
i'm doin' the best i can.

155
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,510
hey, it's  a i
situation.

156
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,920
what did jacobi find out?
well, everyone at the gallery

157
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,520
seems to think that
ethan walked on water.

158
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,673
i'm sure jacobi will hear
the same story at the mall.

159
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,657
yeah, people have such nice
things to say about a dead man.

160
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,307
yeah, maybe this time
it's actually true.

161
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,634
yeah, what else you got?
was there anything useful?

162
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,220
okay, thanks for calling.

163
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,820
i set up a hotline
at the "register" web site.

164
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,919
goabout  calls so far.
let me guess--
beth was abducted by aliens.

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,343
either that or arab terrorists.
the crazies can't decide.

166
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,068
perfect timing.

167
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,197
here's the bullet.

168
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
how can you have such
a gross job and still be

169
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,620
more emotional stable
than the rest of us?

170
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,720
speak for yourself.
what's that, a .38?

171
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
i'm betting
it matches the .38

172
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
his company issued him
a few months ago.

173
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
make sure
you get it tested.

174
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,242
yeah. always do.

175
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,392
the preliminary
x screen came back.

176
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,722
our boy's clean.
he would've made a good papa.

177
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,420
you didn't check
for alcohol.

178
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,120
page three. he was sober.

179
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,620
somebody's snippish today.

180
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,020
did you check
under the nails for d.n.a.?

181
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,944
already at the lab.
i put a rush on it

182
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,639
how could anybody want a baby
so badly they'd kill fort?

183
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,420
god, you're young.
hey, i'm with her--

184
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,920
midnight feedings
and babysitters

185
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
or clubbing with my girls

186
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,820
and noisy sex
with my boyfriend.

187
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,519
<i>when's the last time
we went clubbing?
we could.</i>

188
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,620
you do realize that
if you don't have kids,

189
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,120
you'll have  grow old
without a lifetime supply

190
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,414
of funky homemade
ceramic pencil holders.
you love those pencil holders.

191
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,220
more than life itself.

192
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,175
what about you?
you want a little boxer baby?

193
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,247
i just want to find theirs.

194
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,458
they were married and in love,
their first baby on the way.

195
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,336
whole life was in front of 'em.

196
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,689
ethan was pretty nervous
about the baby.

197
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,239
poor guy barely had
any fingernails left.

198
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,920
chewed 'em to the quick.

199
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,721
but  w ay
into the dad thing.

200
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,620
their lamaze teacher's
business card.

201
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,920
it's pretty worn
around the edges.

202
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,993
looks like it's been in and out
of his wallet a lot.

203
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,620
"consuelo sanchez."

204
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,240
ms. 10:00-p.m. phone call.

205
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,520
did they have lamaze classes
when you were having kids?

206
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,020
you'd have to ask my ex-wife.
which wife--
one, two or three?

207
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,748
(laughs) i forget. what i do
remember is working overtime

208
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,583
for five years ?

209
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:08,820
i bet you were
a good father.

210
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,720
eh, i was a cop.
so do you think the kidnapper's

211
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,020
planning to keep
this baby for himself,

212
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,511
or is he planning
to sell it?

213
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,320
i don't know.
i just hope he waits

214
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,627
for beth to go into labor
before cutting her open.

215
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,478
hi, we're looking
for consuelo sanchez.

216
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,303
(woman) they were
a real sweet couple.

217
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,767
ethan would take off work
so he didn't miss any classes.

218
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,520
why did they call you
last night?

219
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,420
oh, beth was having
braxton hicks contractions.

220
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,573
i said take a walk.
it...

221
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,438
oh, god.

222
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,220
if they hadn't
gone for that walk,

223
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,120
this never would have happened.
it's not your fault,

224
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,220
but we do need to know
where you were last night.

225
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,924
uh, i was at my cousin's.
i can give you her number.

226
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,322
it's like there's
a black cloud over my class.

227
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,901
last week, one of my girls
gave birth to a stillborn.

228
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,320
she was nearly full-term.
did she know beth?

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,112
they always sat together.
what was her name?

230
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,619
i don't think she's up
for talking to cops right now.

231
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,861
tell me her name.

232
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,520
melanie topor.

233
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,441
she was gonna be
a single mom.

234
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,216
melanie topor?

235
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,693
what is that sound?

236
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,392
melanie?

237
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,200
san francisco police department.
we need to talk to you.

238
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,789
(woman) come in.

239
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,032
what do you want?

240
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,907
is there a baby here?

241
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,932
i don't have a baby.
my baby died.

242
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,020
i'm very sorry.

243
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,368
do you, uh, mind
if we look around?

244
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,371
i still have milk.

245
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,120
when i feel better,
i'm gonna take it

246
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,543
to the hospital
for the sick babies.

247
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,320
it shouldn't go to waste.

248
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,694
i have 15 bottles
in the freezer.

249
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,614
melanie...

250
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
we're investigating

251
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,105
the disappearance
of beth williams

252
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,335
and the murder
of ethan williams.

253
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,520
oh.

254
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,261
do you know anyone
who could have hurt them?

255
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,420
well, the tv said
beth was kidnapped

256
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,120
by somebody
who wanted her baby.

257
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,515
your lamaze teacher said that
you and beth were good friends.

258
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,577
she was, uh,
she was pretty lonely.

259
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,420
why do you say that?

260
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,578
well, she was cooped up
with ethan and his parents...

261
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,179
and then he found out
about her boyfriend.

262
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,120
beth had a boyfriend?

263
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,320
what was his name?

264
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,273
i don't know.
i met her after they split.

265
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,520
you don't think that
he was the one tt--

266
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,620
melanie, can you remember

267
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,420
anything she told you
about him?

268
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,372
this is very important.

269
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,764
i'm trying.

270
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,820
i think she said
that he was--

271
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,650
he was from saramon.

272
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
such a stupid thing
to remember.

273
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,620
th-that's fine.

274
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,220
can you remember
anything else?

275
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,638
she said that
he was handsome and exciting--

276
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,982
a lot more fun than ethan...
at first.

277
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,020
but then she got pregnant...
and did an amnio

278
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,320
and found out
that it wasn't his,

279
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,120
and he started
screamin' at her

280
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,620
for sleepin'
with her husband.

281
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,520
she said it was the first

282
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,580
and the last time
he ever hit her.

283
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,225
oh.

284
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,615
excuse me.

285
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,220
yeah?

286
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,619
hey. the blood work ? came back

287
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,136
it's placental blood
mixed with amniotic fluid.

288
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,725
okay, thanks.

289
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,520
beth's water broke
at the crime scene.

290
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,020
that was 11 hours ago.

291
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,591
if she's still alive,
she's in labor... now.

292
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,019
her husband works two jobs,
goes to lamaze classes,

293
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,654
and she goes cheatin' on him?

294
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,620
she got married too young.

295
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,076
she didn't have
her head on straight.

296
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,420
one day she's into safe.
next day she's into sexy.

297
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
she es her whole life
all mapped out for her

298
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,607
and decides
she doesn't like it.

299
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,116
so no perfect couple award
after all.

300
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,520
just once before i die
i would like to see a marriage

301
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,320
that really was
what i thought it was.

302
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,820
you know,
my first child,

303
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,020
i was only in labor
six hours.

304
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,888
that baby could be out
in the world already.

305
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,820
i'm not gonna accept that
as a possibility.

306
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,020
why?
because if the baby's
been born,

307
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,620
there's a chance we're not
looking for beth anymore.

308
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,420
we're looking for her corpse.

309
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,320
as long as beth is in labor,
she's probably safe.

310
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,720
yeah, why risk cutting
the baby out of her

311
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,859
when it's already coming out
the natural way?
there is another possibility.

312
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,930
beth and romeo
got back together.
they whack hubby and ride off ?

313
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,720
(lindsay) with hubby's baby?

314
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,192
i can't see boyfriend
raising another man's child.

315
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,920
?

316
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,120
she didn't meet him on the job.
she didn't have one.

317
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,920
there are other places
to meet men.

318
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,420
yeah, the hotline
got a couple of calls

319
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,020
that beth shopped at the market
on 7th and walnut--

320
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,620
a prime hookup spot.
do you know how many
of those hotline tips

321
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,560
actually lead somewhere real?
and yet i am checking out
each and every one of them

322
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,920
that don't involve martians
or o.j. simpson.

323
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,620
i'm gonna schedule
another press conference,

324
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,220
keep beth's face out there.

325
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,233
i'm gonna go torture
the in-laws some more.

326
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,266
something is up with her.

327
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,563
is something up with her?

328
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,795
baby cases.
cops hate baby cases.

329
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,820
ohh. yeah, that's right.

330
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,620
press conference is set
for half an hour.

331
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,920
here's a couple more
pictures you can use.

332
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,220
let me know if you need
anything else.

333
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,442
how's she doing...
with everything?

334
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,920
i worry about her.

335
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,008
she doesn't want
to be worried about.
yeah, i know, but...

336
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,220
why'd you take this job?

337
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,920
it's a big step up for me.

338
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,807
you had other opportunities,
better ones.

339
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,548
i hear you could have gone
and worked for the chief.
i wanted to work homicide.

340
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,369
you wanted an excuse
to be near her again.

341
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,568
i am marrying heather.

342
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,406
if you say so.

343
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,220
i can't believe
beth had an affair.

344
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,520
how could she do that
to our son?

345
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,920
did ethan know about it?

346
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,171
we believe so. he never said
anything to either of you?

347
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,520
he always protected us
from the bad stuff.

348
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,020
when he was a boy,

349
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,250
he didn't go to the hospital
till his appendix almost burst.

350
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,920
he didn't want to complain
about the pain.

351
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,420
techs found this
in the trash can

352
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,220
and put it back together.
to "beth williams."

353
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,819
return address "sam johannes."

354
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,920
i remember that.

355
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,720
you hardly ever get
handwritten letterthese days.

356
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,417
i asked beth who it was from.
she said an old friend.

357
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,820
you think that's the guy?

358
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,220
if he hurts my granddaughter,

359
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,420
i'll make that
son of a bitch pay.

360
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,332
<i>no, i will.</i>

361
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,720
according to jill,
sam did three years

362
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,320
for almost killing
a guy with a pool cue.

363
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,620
any chance
he's from san ramon?

364
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,820
you want everything.

365
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,120
so beth is one of those girls
who wants to marry mr. clean

366
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,220
but likes doing the nasty
with the nasty bs.

367
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,420
the story of my life.
who are you, clean or nasty?

368
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,658
(chuckles) sam johannes?
where is he?

369
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,726
(man) no, no, that was fine.
you can mark it.

370
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,884
hey, hey, hey, hey.

371
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,220
oh.

372
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,120
merry christmas.

373
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,893
nice.

374
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,987
(jacobi) sam johannes?

375
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,169
what?

376
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,886
you sam johannes?

377
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,520
where's beth williams?

378
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,906
i don't know
who you're talking about.

379
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,645
your girlfriend.
where is she?

380
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,457
where's the baby?

381
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,629
i need to talk to my lawyer.

382
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,420
he could be holding beth
prisoner somewhere.

383
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,820
we gotta talk to this
slimeball's coworkers...
got people on it.

384
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,420
and get in touch with his wife.
baker has people on that.

385
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,220
wellget him some help and go
through his credit cards.

386
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,172
who's this, his lawyer?
lindsay, lindsay, i need you
to take it easy, okay?

387
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,720
we're no longer married.

388
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,586
you're not allowed
to give me inane advice.
sure i can. i'm your boss.

389
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,520
you have to understand,
my client got screwed

390
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,020
by the cops once before.

391
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,735
we have a missing girl
whose water broke

392
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:03,183
at least 14 hours ago.
i can assure you sam had
nothing to do with it.

393
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,020
how do you know beth?
last time i talked
to you people,

394
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,720
i got three years in san q.

395
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,880
how long were you
sleeping with her?

396
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,220
(scoffs) that wasn't the nature
of their association.

397
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,920
what werthey doing,
playing parcheesi?

398
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,820
if this baby dies while
you're jerking me around,

399
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,520
i will make san q.
look like club med.

400
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,220
we got enough
to hold this guy?

401
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,368
sure, except for that
whole probable cause thing.

402
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,320
inspector jacobi?

403
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,790
sam's wife sachiko.

404
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,606
uh, ma'am, why don't we
go back to my desk?

405
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,432
beth williams was not
my husband's girlfriend.

406
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,433
then who was she?

407
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,319
you wanted
to adopt beth's baby?

408
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,220
before we go any further,
we need assurances that--

409
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,039
we met her on
an internet adoption site.

410
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,338
it's kind of an informal place
where pregnant women

411
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
can connect with people
who want to become parents.

412
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,953
beth didn't have a computer.she ?

413
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,022
we've been trying
for years to adopt

414
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,620
or even be foster parents,
but--

415
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,944
when you have a felony on
your record, no one wants you,

416
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,720
even if you've got
ten years sober,

417
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,620
and you've completely turned

418
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,020
did ethan know that beth
wanted to give up the baby?

419
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,107
yeah. we met
the both of them over coffee.

420
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,420
they were getting divorced.
i don't think either one of them

421
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,020
wanted to become
a single parent.

422
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,808
why'd she choose you?
she said she liked my e-mails.

423
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,120
and you offered them money,
too, right? how much?

424
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,920
don't answer that.
and that's why
you weren't talking,

425
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,420
because baby buying
is illegal.

426
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,919
it was only $15,000, and it was
to cover maternityxpenses.

427
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
totally legal.
depends on the contract.

428
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,820
which you sent beth
in the mail.

429
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,220
and she i.m.'ed us yesterday
that she'd signed it

430
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,320
and that ethan would, too,
as soon as he got home.

431
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,820
but then we never hed
from her again.
maybe you did.

432
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,620
maybe beth told you that they
had changed their minds,

433
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,020
and you weren't getting
the baby after all.

434
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,220
see? what'd i tell you
about cops?

435
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,008
is my client under arrest?

436
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,620
it would be better for you--

437
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,840
okay, let's get the hell
out of here. come on.

438
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,943
come on.

439
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,081
good luck.

440
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,920
sachiko, is there
anything else you could--

441
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,620
come on.

442
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,992
dale peterson.

443
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,320
beth and i were i.m.'ing
one day,

444
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,156
and she said she had a boyfriend
named dale peterson.

445
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,098
dale peterson from san ramon.
i'll start hunting him down.

446
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,520
meanwhile i'm gonna need--
computer hard drives
from beth's local library.

447
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,620
i'll draw up a subpoena

448
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,087
and track down
our resident geek.

449
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,720
(cindy) here we go.

450
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,274
somebody at the library
logged in to pacificbaby.net.

451
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,020
talk about creepy. any old
pervert could log on here

452
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,620
and say he's
an adoptive couple.

453
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,220
find some
vulnerable pregnant woman

454
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,089
and invite her to some...
who knows.

455
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,220
this job is bad for my head.

456
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,221
okay. sam johannes
chatted with "bw20."

457
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,320
beth williams, 20 years old.

458
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,519
this is from 9:30 last night.
bw20 says,

459
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,420
"we'll bring you the contract
first thing tomorrow."

460
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,519
(jill) "i can't tell you
how happy this makes us."

461
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,220
<i>so sam the man and sachikoko
were telling the truth.
(telephone rings)</i>

462
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,420
wait a minute. why didn't beth
tell her good friend melanie

463
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,618
that she's putting her baby
up for adoption?
(ring)

464
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
jill bernhardt.

465
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,303
she probably felt weird
about giving up the baby ?

466
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,820
you know, salt in the wound.
wa a minute. is there
anything from what's his name--

467
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,558
dale peterson?
uh, not yet.

468
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,041
got it. gotta move.

469
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
what is it?
that was lindsay.

470
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,120
dale peterson
is not from san ramon.

471
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,920
he lives onthe "san ramon."
it's a boat.

472
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,533
i have about five minutes to
push through a search warrant.
(typing)

473
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,120
(lindsay) this place
is certainly a step up

474
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,720
from her in-laws'.

475
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,594
yeah. she meets an adventurer
who lives on the high seas...

476
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,186
hell, i'd run away
with him, too.

477
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,346
dale petson?

478
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,229
san francisco p.d.
we have a warrant.

479
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,011
you smell that?

480
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,583
yeah. bleach.

481
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,122
(lindsay)
somebody's been cleanin'.

482
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,320
not a very good job.

483
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,079
mnh-mnh.

484
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,955
lindsay... we got a knife.

485
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,185
you think we're looking
at another homicide?

486
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,095
i think either way,
beth had her baby.

487
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,720
still no leads
on dale peterson.

488
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,724
no permanent place
employment.

489
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,120
what do you think he did
with beth after...

490
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,983
we're sending down divers
just in case.

491
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,020
i'm gonna hit the marina
and see if anybody saw dale,

492
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,119
beth or a very newborn baby.

493
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,470
all right, keep me posted.

494
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,320
how could anyone do this?

495
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,220
actually, homicide is
a leading cause of death

496
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,300
of pregnant women.

497
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,220
oh, my god.

498
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,920
if you want to kill someone,
at least shoot them.

499
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,720
don't slice them open
with a fish knife.

500
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,220
it's possible he just
used the knife to cut

501
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,370
the baby's umbilical cord.
why go to all that trouble
for a baby that isn't even his?

502
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,320
maybe dale thought beth lied
and the baby really was his.

503
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,320
we found the placenta.

504
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,620
that's it. no kids.
i mean it.

505
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,693
you don't have to
give birth on a boat.

506
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,420
ugh.

507
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,020
was the baby born alive?

508
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,885
no way to know.

509
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,120
what?

510
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,120
(cindy) hey, i got
a hotline tip that a--
forget the damn hotline.

511
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,820
that a pregnant girl
used to hang out

512
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,916
at some bar by the pier
with a guy who lived on a boat.

513
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,600
so i've been making
the rounds, and, uh,

514
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,200
guess who's trying
to pick up a young hottie

515
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,600
at the lucky badger?

516
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,400
dale peterson. you wait.
i'm on my way.

517
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,900
i'll keep saying it.

518
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,100
i have no idea
what happened to this baby.

519
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,200
you want me to say it
in french, spanish...

520
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,400
she was born on your boat.

521
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,100
if i could help you guys,
i would.

522
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,000
i've got nothing against beth.
i think she's a great girl.

523
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,100
a little screwed up,
but who isn't?

524
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,400
when's the last time
you saw her?

525
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,100
i broke up with her...

526
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,200
must be months ago.

527
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
we hear she broke up with you

528
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
because you like
to hit pregnant women.

529
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,700
that's not my style.

530
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,900
okay, she kicked me in the nads
when i told her it was over.

531
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,500
but i never touched her.

532
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,700
you were pissed
the baby wasn't yours.

533
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,300
are you kidding?
i was thrilled.

534
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,900
look...

535
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,200
beth was a small-town girl

536
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,600
that i met on the pier one day
listening to street musicians.

537
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,200
i invited her to my boat.

538
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,500
we had a good time
for a few months there.

539
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
i figured she was looking

540
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,100
for a little break
from her boring life.

541
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,900
i am sorry if she
was hoping for more.

542
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,600
her blood is
all over your boat.

543
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,000
great. i haven't been home
in three days.

544
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
i never go there on
the weekends,

545
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
and she knows that.
maybe i should go in there.

546
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,700
hey, she's doing great.
she's a pro.

547
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,800
where were you last night
from 9:00 p.m. on?

548
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,600
that's my business.

549
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,800
my partner is still
on your boat.

550
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,900
i can just give him a call

551
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,500
and tell him
to tear the place apart.

552
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,100
i was with a friend.

553
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,900
i travel in a lot
of different circles.

554
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,700
this one's a little more,
uh, pacific heights.

555
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,200
uh-huh. what's your
lucky friend's name?

556
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,100
all right, see, that's where
i'm kind of stuck.

557
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,500
um, she provides me with the

558
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,900
wherewithal to
maintain my lifestyle.

559
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,000
and unfortunately, she's,
uh, she's a little shy, so.

560
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,700
shy because
she doesn't exist.

561
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,400
we've got you cold on
beth's murder, and you know it.

562
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,700
whatur main concern is
right now is this baby girl.

563
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
so if you could just
tell us where she is

564
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,600
and ease
her grandparents' minds,

565
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
i'm sure we can
work out a deal.

566
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,100
i'm a pretty laid-back guy...

567
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,300
but i don't like it
when chicks try to hustle me.

568
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
is that what beth did to you?

569
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,300
even chicks as sexy as you.

570
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
what did you do
with the baby?

571
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,300
honey, if you want a baby,
i'll give you one.

572
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,900
whoo!

573
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
get up!

574
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,000
you want to mess with me?
wow.

575
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
boxer. boxer!
you're not gonna tell me
where this kid is?

576
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
you gonna hit me?
get the hell off me!

577
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,500
boxer! lindsay, hey!

where is that baby?

578
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,300
i can handle it. back off!
back--back off!

579
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,800
you back--come on. come on.
where the hell is that baby?

580
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,400
boxer? is that your name?

581
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,900
yeah, i want the videotapes,
'cause i'm pressin' charges.

582
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
you just made me
a millionaire, baby!

583
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,200
get off me!

584
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,500
what the hell
did you do that for?

585
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,200
are you kidding me?

586
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,100
i was about to break him--
in half, which doesn't help!

587
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,300
now we still don't know
if the baby is alive or dead.

588
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,800
lindsay, calm down.

589
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,300
calm d--god, i am so glad
i'm not married to you anymore.

590
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,500
you and me both.
maybe jacobi ought to take

591
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,700
the lead on this one.
maybe jacobi should take the lead

592
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,100
on the entire department!
lindsay.

593
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
how could you--
lindsay?

594
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,000
what?
luke just called from the e.r.

595
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,900
somebody droed off
a baby girl.

596
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,300
you're sure nobody saw
the baby being dropped off?

597
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,400
are we sure
it's beth's baby?

598
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,000
uh, shwas found
in a fishing tackle box

599
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,600
by the back maintenance door.

600
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
i don't suppose anybody was
careful about fingerprints?

601
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,000
i didn't think so.

602
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,400
here's
your little princess.

603
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,100
is she okay?

604
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,100
yeah. her attending says
she's doing great.

605
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,900
oh, she's actually
kind of beautiful.

606
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,200
???

607
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,300
you can touch her.

608
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,000
no, thanks.

609
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
stop! sir, ma'am, i--
thank you.

610
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,100
you can't come in here
dressed like that.

611
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,900
is that her?

612
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,400
you're not dressed properly.
please, we just need
to see our child.

613
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
i'm sorry.
you don't understand.

614
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
we're the family.
we'd like to see
our child. thank you.

615
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,500
please don't interre.
sam.

616
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,000
uh, why don't we just
go in the hall?

617
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,000
let's just
go out in the hall.

618
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,100
that baby
is legally ours.

619
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,200
actually, she's not.

620
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,900
her mother agreed to it.

621
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,800
r lawyer says
the birth mother's wishes--

622
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,000
you don't have
a signed contract.

623
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,800
the grandparents' claim
is preeminent.

624
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
how'd you know
the baby was here?

625
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,000
um, we read it
on the internet...

626
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
on some tv station
web site.

627
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,400
when?

628
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,600
maybe a half an hour ago.

629
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,600
my boss gave the media
the information 15 minutes ago

630
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,000
before that, no one knew.

631
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,200
okay, so it was
15 minutes ago.

632
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,400
you want
another trip downtown?

633
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,200
some woman
called my cell phone

634
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,900
about an hour ago

635
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,600
and told us the baby
was at the hospital.

636
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
you didn't recognize her voice?

637
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
no.

638
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,300
give me your phone.

639
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,300
we just didn't want things
to get complicated.

640
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,200
give me your phone. now.

641
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,700
i didn't call anybody.

642
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,500
you used t payphone
right down the block.

643
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,300
that's not too bright.
i-i didn't.

644
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,600
what happened to beth, melanie?
what'd you do to her?

645
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,100
nothing. that's crazy.

646
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,500
tell me why we shouldn't believe
that you killed beth and ethan

647
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,200
and stashed the baby
somewhere.

648
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,300
these weren't for
sick babies, were they?

649
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,700
they were for beth
and ethan's baby.

650
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,500
but you panicked,

651
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,700
and you dumped
the baby at the hospital.

652
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,000
no, you got it all wrong.

653
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,700
that's not what--
you're under arrest.

654
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,600
that not why i took
the baby there.

655
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,900
i...i don't know
what happened.

656
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,100
she was scared.
she asked me for my help.

657
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,400
she said it was best
for the baby.

658
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,600
she?

659
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,700
no!

660
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,200
beth!

661
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,400
get back.

662
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,300
get out.

663
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,900
just calm down, all right?
nobody has to get hurt today.

664
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,400
out! out of the room!

665
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,700
all right. all right.
now just calm down.

666
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,100
you, too. get out.

667
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,500
it's okay.
i got it.

668
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,300
i said get out.

669
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,700
drop your gun.

670
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,600
a lot of people
have been looking for you.

671
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,600
shut up. drop it.

672
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,500
okay.

673
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,400
god. don't make me
shoot you.

674
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,100
okay. just calm down,
all right?

675
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,500
look. see?

676
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,000
is that your husband's gun?

677
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,100
oh...

678
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,800
is that the one
you shot him with?

679
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,000
i was just trying
to scare him.

680
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,400
the gun went off.

681
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,300
you were mad at him.

682
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,600
he said that he would sign
the adoption papers.

683
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,600
he promised me,
but...

684
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,900
then he wouldn't do it.

685
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,700
and then your water broke,

686
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,900
and you knew
the baby was coming,

687
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,600
and you didn't know
what to do.

688
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:36,200
i just--i just.
i just wanted to be free,

689
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
go somewhere, you know?

690
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,500
like, start all over again
without--

691
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:48,000
without ethan or dale
or the baby or anybody.

692
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,200
why not just give ethan
the baby and go?

693
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,500
why give him anything?

694
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,400
he was breaking up with me,

695
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,100
and i needed the money
so i could start fresh.

696
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,500
so the gun went off,
and you panicked.

697
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,500
and i couldn't go anywhere.

698
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,800
i didn't go
to the hospital.

699
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,300
they'd find me.

700
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,000
and you delivered that baby
all by yourself?

701
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,600
i was so scared.

702
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,100
then the baby
started crying,

703
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,400
and i had to get her
to the hospital.

704
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,600
i knew melanie would help.

705
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,300
she's my only frie.

706
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,900
are they coming here?

707
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,400
my partner
probably called them.

708
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
beth, why don't you
just give me the gun?

709
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,300
no.

710
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,500
no. i'm leaving.

711
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,000
beth--
i'll shoot you.

712
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,200
do you want to know
how your daughter is?

713
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,600
doctors say she's doing fine.

714
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,700
beth, you could've dropped
that baby into the ocean.

715
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,200
it certainly would have been
a lot safer r you.

716
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,600
but you didn't.
you took her to the hospital.

717
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,700
you did a great job

718
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,800
of bringing your baby
into this world.

719
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,600
no! no!

720
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,600
you okay?

721
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,200
i'm fine.

722
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,300

723
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,000

745
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,300
a murdered father,
mother in jail...

746
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,600
she's gonna have a lot
to deal with growing up.

747
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,100
well, she's got two people
in her life

748
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,200
who care more about her
than anything in the world.

749
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,400
i'd say that's a good place
to start.

750
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,200
oh.

751
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,500

you need a drink.

752
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,900
i just want to go home
to my dog.

753
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,400

for obstructing justice,

763
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,200
and he bought it.

764
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,300
thanks, tom.

765
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,300

766
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,300

i would...

767

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
ours didn't.

779
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,300
and that's nobody's fault.
nobody is a failure.

780
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,500
it just happens.
yeah, i know.

781
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,900
and it was four years ago.

782
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,400

to work three days later.

783
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,000

00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,300
the japanese

794
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,100

00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,500
to take their baby
to a better world.

800
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,200
a better world.
