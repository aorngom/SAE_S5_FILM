1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,480
??

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,510
<i>???that turned me from a
vampire back into a human.</i>

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,860
how long will it
last? i don't know.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,250
maureen? no!

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,010
ben talbot from the
district attorney's office.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,210
and you are? i'm mick st. john.
i'm a private investigator.

7
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,250
maureen was killed
by a vampire.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,290
i can't save beth
as a human.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,960
you have to turn
me back. (snarls)

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,630
your face--
what happened?

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,600
but vampires and humans
can have sex,man.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,660
you're not afraid
beth's gonna get hurt.

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,960
<i>you're afraid you're gonna
get hurt. being a vampire</i>

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,080
is not what's keeping
us apart. it's just you.

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,440
he's still on us. * all alone
in my room,think of you *

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,110
* at a rate that
is truly alarming *

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,520
<i>okay. this is a
one-way street.</i>

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,860
so?

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,960
i'm going one way.
yeah,the wrong way.

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,480
* i keep looping
my memories of you *

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,960
* in my head,i pretend that
you want me * hang on.

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,120
okay,you can't die.
you can't die.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,930
you cannot die. what?

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,510
hmm? nothing. it's fine.

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,750
(tires screech) * pretending
that she still wants me *

26
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,360
look,i've worked in
many d.a.'s offices,

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,810
and whenever you
get a new boss,well,

28
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,950
everybody runs things
differently,you know?

29
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,040
it's-- it's all about personality.
yeah,but maureen was what

30
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,910
made "buzzwire" work for me.
she was totally supportive

31
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,700
of the kind of stories i wanted
to pursue. and your new boss isn't?

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,920
i don't know yet. he's calling
a big meeting this afternoon

33
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,050
to discuss "buzzwire's"
new direction.

34
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,650
which might not
include stories about

35
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,940
demented college professors or serial
killers. you've looked at my stories.

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,610
yeah. they're,uh,not
what i expected.

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,500
what do you mean?

38
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,600
they're not all fluff.

39
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,510
thanks... i think.

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,150
* attached to,on my
mind,let me show you *

41
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,320
i can shake him.
(tires squeal)

42
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,670
* i can't stop
thinkin' about you *

43
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,000
* and i can't stop
thinkin' about you *

44
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,130
* and you never could
or would do what i do *

45
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,700
* and i can't stop
thinkin' about you *

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,720
* i can't stop
thinkin' about you *

47
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,110
* i can't stop
thinkin' about you *

48
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,690
* and you never could
or would do what i do *

49
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,800
no,no,no,no,no!

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,380
* can't stop
thinkin' about you *

51
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,050
you did it. you lost him.

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,640
that j-turn gets
them every time.

53
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,470
okay,so you've
done that before.

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,420
afraid so.
welcome to my world.

55
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,080
so... you've been
reading my stories.

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,640
you've asked me
to lunch. why?

57
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,280
nothing nefarious. i just...
wanted to learn more about you,

58
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,120
and we went through some
pretty heavy stuff together.

59
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,290
yeah,it's not like
you get kidnapped

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,070
by a plastic
surgeon every day.

61
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,640
we almost died,you know? and i
keep wanting to talk about it,

62
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,820
but i can't seem to explain
it to most people.

63
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,910
well,you can't unless
you experienced it.

64
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,110
there's no point of
reference. exactly. (laughs)

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,440
you know,i still don't
understand how mick

66
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,140
and that other guy got us out
of there. (brakes screech)

67
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,350
(ben) who is that?

68
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,800
where did you learn
to drive like that?

69
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,950
three sessions at the
nascar training track.

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,770
oscar gift bag,2006.

71
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,780
nice.

72
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,320
you ready?

73
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,170
* i put myself at ease *

74
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,920
(woman) tierney!
(paparazzi shouting at once)

75
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,200
is that tierney taylor?

76
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,710
yeah,making her "look at me.
i'm a celebrity" entrance.

77
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,610
<i>(mick) being human again,
however briefly,</i>

78
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,830
<i>put me back out into the
world, and it made me realize</i>

79
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,080
<i>i was tired of hiding.
beth was right when she said</i>

80
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,980
<i>that being a vampire
doesn't have to define me.</i>

81
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,120
<i>maybe i can use my job
to live in both worlds,</i>

82
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,140
<i>but jumping into this world</i>

83
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,270
<i>makes me feel like i've gone
straight from the minor leagues</i>

84
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,890
<i>to the world series.</i>

85
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,400
<i>welcome to hollywood.</i>

86
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,100
whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.
too close.

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,940
no such thing.

88
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,900
are you sure
you're not hungry?

89
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,470
yeah. i had a big breakfast.
doesn't this bother you?

90
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,360
i expect it here...
or at kitson,the grove--

91
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,550
anyplace they think
a celebrity will show up.

92
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,370
but they were waiting
outside my house this morning

93
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,760
like they knew exactly
what time i was leaving.

94
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,150
and they shouldn't have.
i sent fake schedules

95
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,360
to your manager,your
agent,your publicist.

96
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,250
well,we know it's not them
tipping off the paparazzi.

97
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,060
no,it's somebody close to
you,like a friend,your boyfriend.

98
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,450
no. no way. this nightmare
is affecting scott,too.

99
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,340
doesn't scott's band have a
new album that's coming out?

100
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,350
look,i'm just saying maybe
he wants the publicity.

101
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,100
i get it. i'm a celebrity.

102
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,280
i chose to live my life
in the public eye,

103
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,060
but... i at least
have to have

104
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,880
a couple people in my
life that i can trust.

105
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,400
that's why
you hired me--

106
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,290
to make sure you trust
the right people.

107
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,830
jason.

108
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,780
(laughs) tierney. mmm.

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,130
honey,you look
fabulous as usual.

110
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,010
oh,this one's new.

111
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,780
oh,no,jason,this
is mick st. john.

112
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,720
he's overseeing some new
security arrangements.

113
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,760
mick,this is jason abbott.

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,580
he's producing my
new movie,"lusitania."

115
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,020
and this little girl is
the reason for "lusitania."

116
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,300
we're gonna have a
billion-dollar franchise

117
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,110
on our hands.

118
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,610
yeah,now that we finally have
a start date,i am so excited.

119
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,510
would you two excuse me? i'm
going to the ladies' room.

120
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,450
hot lunch date?

121
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,730
very hot.

122
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,250
and sunny.
definitely too much sun.

123
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,190
it's not a date.

124
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,500
are you working for tierney
taylor? what do you know about her?

125
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,870
just what
everybody does--

126
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,060
what her favorite color
is,everybody she's ever dated,

127
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,750
what she had for
dinner last night.

128
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,220
right.

129
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,950
look,i've been meaning to
call you about the other night.

130
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,030
(lowers voice) the other
night when you kissed me?

131
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,090
so,uh,how do you
wanna do this?

132
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,580
(normal voice)
it's called dating.

133
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,190
right. we,uh,we go
out,get to know each other.

134
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,870
you've known me since i was 4.

135
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,260
okay,it's weird when
you say it like that.

136
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,090
(man) tierney! tierney!
miss taylor,look here!

137
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,420
hey,hey. how was lunch?

138
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,180
what,are you following me?

139
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,830
oh,not me.

140
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,240
hottie,huh? you should put
it up on your facebook page.

141
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,020
you've seen my facebook page?

142
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,500
of course i've seen
your facebook page.

143
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,660
hmm. did you like it?

144
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,970
yeah. and i was surprised
that mr. skulk-in-the-shadows

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,280
is suddenly all
over the internet.

146
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,020
yeah,well,you know,

147
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,890
i want to expand my
business,and i realize that

148
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,960
i need to put myself out there a bit more,so...
your flashy new client will certainly see to that.

149
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,890
now this tierney girl--
yes,i know. i know.

150
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,720
she's a celebrity,and
you're concerned

151
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,600
that i'm endangering myself to this
kind of public exposure. yeah.

152
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,620
but don't worry,dad.
i'll,uh,i'll be careful.

153
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,880
<i>don't call me that.
well,you did turn me.</i>

154
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,000
<i>re-turned you.
okay,re-turned.</i>

155
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,060
and you were gonna become
a vampire again anyway,

156
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,610
and i'm not your sire. you're
kinda my step-sire,though.

157
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,510
no.

158
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,900
now... you wanna know
what i was gonna say?

159
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,420
i was gonna say tierney
reminds me of jean harlow.

160
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,300
you went out with jean harlow?

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,470
i mostly stayed in
with jean harlow.

162
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,030
<i>now if i were going to give
you advice,which i'm not,</i>

163
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,490
d say go for it.
okay,have some fun.

164
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,440
but for somebody
who's finally decided

165
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,170
to join the 21st century,

166
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,580
you're going from zero to 60 in
about half a second. jean harlow?

167
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,970
yeah.

168
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,410
as reporters,

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,900
you've all been scrupulous
about researching your stories

170
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,490
and--and checking your
sources and not intruding

171
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,430
into people's privacy.

172
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,520
<i>and while you've
been doing that,</i>

173
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,930
"buzzwire" has been
scooped on an hourly basis

174
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,800
by tmz and perez hilton
and ain't it cool news.

175
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,870
so...
new rule--

176
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,720
if you hear amy winehouse
is out snortin' vodka shots

177
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,460
with prince harry,run with it!

178
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,210
yeah. and if it's not true?

179
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,480
we'll retract it later.
so... off you go,

180
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,350
my little scoopsters.
get me that news.

181
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,490
hi,mr. lewis.
i'm beth turner.

182
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,380
<i>oh,i know. i've had
my eye on you. really?</i>

183
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,250
i hear you have an in with tierney
taylor's new boyfriend. scott walsh?

184
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,310
mick st. john. oh,he's
not tierney's boyfriend.

185
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,210
he's a private investigator. even better. more
likely to have the inside scoop on the curse.

186
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,520
the curse? on
tierney's new movie--

187
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,550
the jason abbott
"lusitaniathing.

188
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,260
the start date's been pushed
back,like,three times. so you think there's

189
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,940
a supernatural curse on the movie? of course
not,but it makes for a great headline.

190
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,600
so abbott's throwing a party
for the movie tonight.

191
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,120
i scored you an invite,

192
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,620
and since you're in so
tight with her new hottie,

193
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,470
<i>i'm expecting you to come back
with something hot! okay.</i>

194
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,830
okay?

195
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,910
<i>the last time i
saw the "gray ghost"</i>

196
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,270
<i>was december 1942.</i>

197
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,070
<i>i was with my regiment,</i>

198
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,700
<i>sailing from new
york to england,</i>

199
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,360
<i>scared to death.</i>

200
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,150
<i>off the coast of scotland,
we got hit by a 92-foot wave,</i>

201
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,710
<i>almost capsized.</i>

202
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,710
<i>some guy wrote a
book about it.</i>

203
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,970
<i>he called it "the
poseidon adventure"--</i>

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,650
<i>exaggerated things a
bit, but i like to think</i>

205
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,460
<i>the gene hackman character
was based on me.</i>

206
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,110
oh,please. don't shoot.

207
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,680
tierney taylor's
new boyfriend.

208
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,250
<i>who i am is none of your
business. who are you?</i>

209
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,100
i'm dean foster,and
actually,everything that tierney does--

210
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,800
<i>it is my business.</i>

211
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,050
that's called stalking.
it's called making a living.

212
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,100
oh,yeah? you getting
any help with that?

213
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,420
anyone close to tierney been tipping you
off? you think i would tell you that?

214
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,240
look,i get the whole
obsessed fan thing.

215
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,110
you've seen all her movies.

216
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,750
you feel like there's some connection--
listen,i don't give a damn about tierney.

217
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,560
the only thing i care about
is how much i can make off her.

218
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,060
the girl's my ride,man.
dude,i've been knocked out

219
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,950
by guys way more
famous than you,

220
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,190
so go ahead. hit me,

221
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,850
and then we'll see how much
i can squeeze outta you.

222
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,840
come on.

223
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,210
i don't have time
for trash like you.

224
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,690
i told you this was a
paparazzi-free night.

225
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,970
you're here to
have a good time.

226
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,110
you don't pay me to party. well,i don't
pay you to be my bodyguard,either.

227
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,410
why don't you just think
of it as a night off?

228
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,710
go talk to your friend.

229
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,950
what friend?

230
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,600
(jason) how many movies? uh...
i saw you with her at lunch.

231
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,500
yes. she's um...

232
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,000
that was... last week,i
was talking to malcolm...

233
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,480
i think we're dating.

234
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,100
<i>you think?</i>

235
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,660
well,it's complicated.

236
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,860
can you be
yourself with her?

237
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,200
mostly,yeah.

238
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,980
then uncomplicate it.

239
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,460
scott,let's go,babe.

240
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,360
* hot *

241
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,060
* there ain't that
much room at the top *

242
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,630
* yeah,ah,yeah,ah *

243
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,810
(jason) i know i
look more mature,

244
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,810
and,hey,look,this
is a mature town.

245
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,420
it needs mature people.

246
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,220
* gotta get to the top *

247
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,760
<i>that was the most boring
conversation of my entire life.</i>

248
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,260
tierney's producer has
the most uelievable ego.

249
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,770
who were those other guys?
were they abbott's bodyguards?

250
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,880
investors. they're paying
for the movie and this party.

251
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,990
looks like
tierney's having fun.

252
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,540
yeah. she doesn't
get to relax much.

253
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,580
so,uh...

254
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,470
where does a vampire
take a girl on a date?

255
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,650
i don't know.
the usual places.

256
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,920
probably not a
lot of restaurants.

257
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,470
i'm guessing you get
bored watching women eat.

258
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,510
actually,i haven't exactly

259
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,510
been in a romance
relationship with a human

260
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,950
since i became a vampire.

261
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,860
what? do you mean,you
haven't... not with a human.

262
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,360
wow. it's not like
you've slept with a vampire.

263
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,610
maybe once in college,but
i was really drunk. right.

264
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,790
(tierney) and what else are
you doing behind my back?

265
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,770
i can't believe you don't trust me.
how can i,when you do stuff like this?

266
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,700
i'm not the one
keeping secrets,tierney.

267
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,700
i'll meet you
inside. (sighs)

268
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,080
are you okay? it's nothing.

269
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,090
it looked like
something to me.

270
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,210
it's a
misunderstanding,that's all.

271
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,700
i'm gonna go to my
stateroom and fix my face.

272
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,800
okay. i'll come
with. no,i'm fine.

273
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,120
you really are very nice.

274
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,320
* now you're famous *

275
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,070
* do you know the
price you pay? *

276
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,620
* i hope that ain't contagious,i
ain't gonna live that way *

277
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,700
* thank you,no *

278
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,950
* but i don't need to go... *

279
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,010
there you are. i've
been looking for you.

280
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,530
i'm sorry about that.

281
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,880
not a problem.

282
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,100
look,i-i've gotta
get back to "buzzwire"

283
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,910
and fabricate a hot story.

284
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,870
did you hear that? what?

285
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,770
it's tierney.

286
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,440
mick,no!

287
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,840
hey,show some respect.

288
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,570
for what? some drunk
actress who fell overboard?

289
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,760
you wanna go for a swim,too?

290
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,160
excuse me.

291
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,120
was she drunk?

292
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,780
no,she wasn't drunk. i
would've smelled it on her.

293
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,040
where are you going?
tierney's stateroom.

294
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,980
it had to be an accident.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,990
who would have a reason
to kill tierney?

296
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,200
nobody i know of.

297
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,440
but since i was
reviewing the security,

298
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,270
if she was in danger,i
should've known about it.

299
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,990
you can't think
this is your fault.

300
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,520
i told her she could trust
me,that i'd look out for her.

301
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,520
and now she's dead.

302
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,660
what is it?

303
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,100
(sniffs) blood.

304
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,870
this was wiped

305
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,560
and put back.

306
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,420
somebody hit her? (sniffs)

307
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,070
she was dragged from the room.

308
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,910
tierney was murdered.

309
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,980
well...

310
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,170
what a pleasant surprise.

311
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,460
what are you doing he? he's
here because the d.a.'s office

312
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,260
wants to make sure that
the police don't screw up

313
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,160
another high-profile
celebrity case. is that right?

314
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,610
either way,i need you
both to clear the scene.

315
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,960
the display case.

316
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,060
what about it?

317
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,450
the anchor's
your murder weapon.

318
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,180
bag it.

319
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,200
what amazing luck,you being
on the scene like that.

320
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,450
tmz didn't have anyone there,

321
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,930
and perez hilton's
just sitting at home,

322
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,820
waiting for somebody
to e-mail him.

323
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,290
i already have
the headline--

324
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,270
"wild child tierney
takes drunken plunge."

325
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,740
tierney wasn't drunk.

326
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
okay,if we're wrong,we'll--we'll
do a retraction.

327
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,440
but in the meantime,we-- it's okay that
people think she deserved what she got?

328
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,840
i can't help
what people think.

329
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,910
(lowers voice) there is a chance
that this was murder. seriously?

330
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,100
<i>yes,but don't post this until
i have the facts straight,</i>

331
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,060
or i'm not writing it,and you
have no on-the-spot story.

332
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,630
<i>this would go so
great with murder.</i>

333
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,670
okay,i'm thinking splash page.

334
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,250
don't ask me what
i paid for it.

335
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,450
where did you get this?

336
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,340
dean foster. and he's got
more where that came from.

337
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,690
mick! welcome back to
the land of the undead.

338
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,160
here for a little
a-positive? i restocked.

339
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,930
no,i'm here about tierney.

340
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,170
yeah,it's a shame.

341
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,520
i liked her movies.

342
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,150
never actually saw one.

343
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,880
oh,she did a nch
of teen movies.

344
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,770
i mean,not really my thing,

345
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,630
but matinee at the
chinese theatre--

346
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,310
best air-conditioning in
town,like a giant freezer unit.

347
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,880
yeah,if your freezer
smells like popcorn.

348
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,860
<i>dude,i sleep here.</i>

349
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,430
popcorn would be
a huge improvement.

350
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,420
you know,the press are
saying this was an accident,

351
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,070
that she was drunk.

352
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,150
you know her blood
alcohol was normal.

353
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,300
the c.o.d. was a temporal skull
fracture. so she was hit in the head?

354
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,610
yeah,with this anchor.

355
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,500
i found traces
of her blood on it,

356
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,140
and the shape
matches the fracture.

357
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,150
where'd you get it?

358
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,820
uh... a.d.a. talbot
brought it in.

359
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,220
hey.

360
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,770
hey. guillermo confirmed it.

361
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,230
tierney was dead before
she hit the water.

362
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,270
someone at the party killed
her. i came to show you this.

363
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,100
grant bought it off a
paparazzo named dean foster.

364
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,910
i ran into him on the
dock before the party.

365
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,620
to get the shot,he
had to be on the boat,

366
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,670
so how did he get past security
without an invite? (sighs) i don't know.

367
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,780
maybe whoever's leaking him
information got him in.

368
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,680
look,i gotta speak with
tierney's boyfriend scott.

369
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,250
i gotta find out what they were
arguing about. i would love to help,

370
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,500
but grant insists i
speak to tierney's producer.

371
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,440
he wants a quote using the words
"movie" and "cursed." (scoffs)

372
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,160
listen,once you're
done,you,uh,you wanna come by?

373
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,270
we could... share
some information.

374
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,550
i'd like that.

375
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,010
they weren't here five minutes
ago. who are they after?

376
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,840
hey,tierney's
boyfriend! over here!

377
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,980
go. save yourself.
see you later.

378
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,120
hey.

379
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,570
<i>hey. you little
punk,give me that camera.</i>

380
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,480
man,you kidding? you know
how much this thing costs?

381
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,040
the camera,lost boy.

382
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,040
you should be ashamed
of yourselves,

383
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,520
making a living like this.
talk about bloodsuckers.

384
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,420
it's perfect.
we work at night.

385
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,500
we can get places
other people can't.

386
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,780
you're a smoker? what
are you doing,kid?

387
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,720
what? it's gonna
stunt my growth?

388
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,440
what can you tell
me about dean foster?

389
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,950
he's a little
intense for the work.

390
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,770
i mean,we'll take a picture
of anyone,but old dean?

391
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,160
(scoffs) well,let's just
say he lacks diversity

392
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,180
in his subject matter.

393
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,960
let me guess--tierney
taylor. where can i find him?

394
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,610
nobody's seen him
since she died.

395
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,820
he's probably curled up
in his shrine room,crying.

396
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,760
mm-hmm. can you keep
your colleagues off me?

397
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,170
in the name of vamp
solidarity,we'd love to help,but...

398
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,690
you're a celebrity p.i. now.
you're the story,dude.

399
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,510
well,the movie's dead.
the studio pulled the plug.

400
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,040
i heard the studio thinks
the movie was cursed.

401
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,870
<i>sometimes i even
think there's a curse.</i>

402
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,570
you know,every time we're ready to roll,something
happens. like the fire on the stage and the boat sinking?

403
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,710
heal the bay's still
on my case for that one.

404
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,270
now tierney's accident...

405
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,840
except it wasn't an
accident. looks like murder.

406
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,020
now who'd wanna murder tierney?
well,that's what i'm trying to find out.

407
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,000
well,that's pretty
ballsy of you,miss turner,

408
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,370
chasing down tierney's killer.
you should sell me your story.

409
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,570
i could get cameron
diaz to play you,easy.

410
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,060
well,why didn't you get
her to replace tierney?

411
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,430
<i>nah. tierney was the movie.</i>

412
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,300
the studio'd never let
me do it without her.

413
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,040
you think i killed
her? i loved her.

414
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,490
people kill for
love all the time.

415
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,990
tierney and i fought
sometimes,sure,

416
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,010
but we-- we
always made up.

417
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,410
at the party,what was
the argument about?

418
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,520
i found out she was hiding
something for me,okay?

419
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,620
i was upset. the two of us--
we didn't have secrets.

420
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
everybody has secrets,scott.

421
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,590
not me and tierney.

422
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,430
i heard a message

423
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,770
that her business
manager left for her.

424
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,240
she paid this
paparazzo,dean,

425
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,860
50 grand to keep some
photos off the market.

426
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,140
when i asked her
about it,she blew up.

427
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,380
i figured dean had snapped her

428
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,430
fooling around
with some other guy.

429
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,740
maybe you,even.

430
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,490
there was nothing going on
between myself and tierney.

431
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,900
yeah,i didn't want to believe
she was cheating on me,

432
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,010
but when she
wouldn't tell me...

433
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,760
my band hasn't hit.. yet.

434
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,210
<i>tierney had, and,um,</i>

435
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,580
it was tough,sure,but...

436
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,540
we loved each other,

437
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,310
and,um,whenever tierney
was keeping from me,

438
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,720
we... we would have
worked it out.

439
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,100
come on. what are you doing?

440
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,790
i'm watching for paparazzi.

441
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,280
i figure we got
about ten minutes

442
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,070
before they
track me down...

443
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,150
(vehicle approaches)
or less.

444
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,670
mick!

445
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,590
oh,god. mick...

446
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,760
here.

447
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,950
(panting) let's get inside.

448
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,050
you okay? yeah.

449
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,150
Without a life vest
i'd be stuck again wish I was

450
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,150
much more masculine I got a
partial plate number off the car.

451
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,230
<i>whoever's after you is--
wait,wait. after me?</i>

452
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,270
<i>yeah,what do you think,they're trying to
kill me? they were headed right for you.</i>

453
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,680
i pushed you out of the way. you
had to push me out of the way,

454
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,980
<i>because i was standing next to
you. maybe they're after both of us.</i>

455
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
i mean,my case and your story
both connect to tierney,right?

456
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,160
maybe we're closer to a
killer than we thought.

457
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,980
what did abbott say?

458
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,910
there's definitely something
weird going on with the movie,

459
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,460
and,uh,now the
studio's shut it down.

460
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,250
they're not gonna replace tierney?
no,but the movie was insured,

461
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,880
so the investors will
get their money back.

462
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,900
what about
tierney's boyfriend?

463
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,480
we found out that tierney
was paying dean off. for what?

464
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,450
i don't know,but scott thought
tierney was cheating on him

465
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,720
and that dean had found
out and blackmailed her.

466
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,770
maybe she got tired of
paying him,and he killed her.

467
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,450
or she wasn't really
paying him at all.

468
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,630
maybe the boyfriend was lying
to cover up his own guilt.

469
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,760
no. the boyfriend's only crime is being
in an emo band. what's wrong with emo?

470
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,340
nothing,when they were
influenced by husker du,

471
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,320
but now they all just
copy jimmy eat world,

472
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,380
and,well,that explains
dashboard confessional,

473
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,510
doesn't it?

474
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,010
i like dashboard confessional.

475
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,060
no,you don't.

476
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,970
where you going?

477
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,030
home.

478
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,650
not alone,you're not.

479
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,720
somebody just tried to kill
you. well,you can't drive me.

480
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,210
there's paparazzi outside.

481
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,260
well,then you should
probably stay here,then...

482
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,490
with me.

483
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,410
oh,wow. from dating
to speed dating.

484
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,070
<i>no,i don't mean
with me,with me.</i>

485
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,840
i mean,i just--
i can't drive you,

486
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,590
and my couch is...
comfortable,and...

487
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,320
besides,i sleep in
my freezer upstairs,so...

488
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,630
okay. well,better
safe than sorry.

489
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,620
okay.

490
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,640
(clears throat) and,you know,i
mean,if you need anything,

491
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,910
i'm,uh,i'm just
right upstairs anyway.

492
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,230
in your freezer.

493
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,130
yeah.

494
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,540
sweet dreams.

495
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,290
you,too.

496
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,900
* now waking to the sun *

497
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,780
* i calculate
what i had done *

498
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,930
* like jumping from the bow *

499
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,940
* just to prove
that i knew how *

500
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,070
you know,tierney
spends $1,000 a month

501
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,630
on cat grooming.

502
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,080
<i>cat... grooming.</i>

503
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:26,980
(types on keyboard)
wait. whoa,whoa.

504
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,880
here's... something.

505
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,730
a check for 50 grand
to dean foster?

506
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,220
<i>scott was right.
tierney is paying him off.</i>

507
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,610
this is weird.

508
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,940
her--her business
manager,ryan gold--

509
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,640
he writes all
her checks,right?

510
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,880
well,there's a payroll
account,which is how he gets paid,

511
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,320
but every month like clockwork,he
also writes himself a check

512
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,280
from her personal
account-- 20 grand a pop.

513
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,370
maybe she found out gold
was embezzling from her.

514
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,050
(ben) "i sort of remember
seeing that guy"

515
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,890
isn't gonna stand
up in court.

516
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,840
look,depose him again.

517
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,840
somebody tried to
kill me last night.

518
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,910
ugh,listen,i have
to call you back.

519
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,070
seems to happen a lot.

520
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,880
well,i wouldn't say
a lot. (stammers)

521
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,320
i'm looking into the
tierney taylor murder.

522
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,410
(scoffs) because
i asked you not to.

523
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,820
and the car that
almost ran me down

524
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,190
might lead to
something important.

525
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,400
can you run the
plate? why me?

526
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,800
what if i told you that
everything i've found

527
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,210
points to one suspect,

528
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,060
and he might be the same guy who tried
to kill me? which suspect would this be?

529
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,030
dean foster--paparazzo
with an unhealthy interest

530
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,350
in tierney. yeah,well,tierney
wasn't the first.

531
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,450
you know about him?

532
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,370
yeah. he's a
person of interest.

533
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,810
look,five years
ago,an actress filed

534
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,070
a restraining order
against foster,

535
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,580
which he proceeded to
violate with wild abandon.

536
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,030
threat management got involved,but
foster wouldn't back off.

537
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,910
the actress finally
moved off to london,

538
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,760
and foster moved
on to someone new.

539
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,100
so tierney became more
than just a subject to him,

540
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,290
and then she rejected him,and he
killed her? it's possible,yeah.

541
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,980
well,why haven't
you picked him up?

542
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,830
because we haven't found
him yet. (cell phone rings)

543
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,410
i gotta take this.

544
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,300
i'll get back to you on
the license plate,all right?

545
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,970
everyone thought she was one
of those... vapid little girls

546
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,930
who runs around
without underwear,

547
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,310
gets married to ys they meet
in gas station bathrooms.

548
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,590
(sighs) tierney
wasn't like that.

549
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,110
sorry.

550
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,290
ahem. you're probably looking
for what we owe you.

551
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440
actually,i'm here to talk about
a payment that tierney made

552
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,850
to dean foster. it
was a private matter.

553
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,230
what about the $20,000 checks
that you cut each month

554
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,650
from tierney's account?

555
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,580
is that a private matter,too?

556
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,830
yes. leave it alone.

557
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,290
well,you can tell me,

558
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,600
or i'm gonna find out
myself,and if i do that,

559
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,510
it may not remain private.

560
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,230
"tierney taylor"
wasn't her real name.

561
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,310
she legally changed it.
her dad was a drunk.

562
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,280
he'd slap tierney
and her mom around,

563
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,910
and thenne day,her mom
had enough. she snapped.

564
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,630
she killed him?

565
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,420
when she got out of jail,she
was an emotional wreck.

566
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,470
and tierney bought
her mom a house,

567
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,280
hired staff,private doctors.

568
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,770
but the payments--they
couldn't trace back to her.

569
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,300
so you made them
in your name.

570
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,940
that kid would've done
anything to keep her mom

571
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,250
out of the limelight.

572
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,940
and then somehow dean found
out. despicable freak.

573
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,570
so in the middle
of everything else,

574
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,580
we had to find the
money to pay him off.

575
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,780
"everything else"?

576
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,370
her
movie,"lusitania"--

577
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,250
tierney was shelling
out her own money

578
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,780
for costumes,swimming lessons,

579
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,350
abbott kept saying he
was gonna reimburse her,

580
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,120
and she kept believing him

581
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,470
because he swore he wouldn't
make the movie without her.

582
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,030
frankly,i'm surprised
he stuck to his word.

583
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,600
i thought it was the studio
that shut the movie down.

584
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,910
no. it was all
abbott's decision.

585
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,990
hey,mick,what's up?

586
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,970
no-go on the
business manager.

587
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,100
i did find out that
tierney's pouring a whole lot

588
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,910
of her own money
into the movie,though.

589
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,860
and it wasn't the studio
that shut the movie down.

590
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,700
it was abbott. then why would
abbott telle the studio was behind it?

591
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,260
(sighs) look,go see logan.

592
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,110
see what you can
dig up on abbott.

593
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,890
beth turner.

594
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,280
dean foster.

595
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,960
did you get my e-mail?

596
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,770
pictures of mick st. john?

597
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,000
yeah,he's not a story
without tierney taylor.

598
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,450
"buzzwire's" not interested.
i didn't send them to "buzzwire."

599
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,930
<i>i sent them to you.</i>

600
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,360
so how did st. john

601
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,370
get hit by a car,then
just get up and walk away?

602
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,160
i don't know.

603
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,510
i'm willing to bet
that you do know.

604
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,370
what do you want?

605
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,860
you get a tip on a hot story,

606
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,310
i'm gonna be the first
person that you call.

607
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,880
from now on,i get all
of "buzzwire" exclusives.

608
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,190
otherwise,mick st. john
becomes my number one priority.

609
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,940
it's up to you.

610
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,740
logan discovered
that abbott was broke.

611
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,400
he spent all of
the investors' money

612
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,740
before they even
shot a frame of film.

613
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,330
he needed the insurance
to pay them back,

614
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,660
and the only way to do that

615
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,000
was if the plug was
pulled on the movie.

616
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,750
and that meant getting
rid of tierney. mm-hmm.

617
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,170
hey! abbott!

618
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,900
hey.

619
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,480
i was just,uh,i was just
heading off to a meeting.

620
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,920
for your next movie?

621
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,070
fish gotta swim.

622
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,730
i'll never,you
know,forget tierney.

623
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,290
yeah,me neither.

624
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:20,900
there is one thing

625
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,810
we were hoping you
could clear up,though.

626
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,010
sure. yeah,um,i'm--
i'm glad to help,but...

627
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,310
you know what?

628
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,510
i lefty... phone inside.
i'll be right back,okay?

629
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,230
he's making a run for it.

630
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,430
yeah. they always do.

631
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,580
<i>chasing people
is so much different</i>

632
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,080
<i>when you're a vampire.</i>

633
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,380
<i>a vampire is
always in control.</i>

634
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,470
<i>it's easy to forget
that it isn't just a game.</i>

635
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,120
<i>and i can't deny the rush...</i>

636
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,360
<i>please. ...when
i catch the bad guy.</i>

637
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,180
<i>i didn't wanna kill
her. then why did you?</i>

638
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,910
i had to pay back
the investors.

639
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,860
with tierney gone,the insurance
kicked in force majeure.

640
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,710
it's not an act of god when
you kill somebody,abbott.

641
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,880
you murdered that girl.

642
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,690
she would have done
anything for you,

643
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,990
but you killed her!

644
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,120
my investors are bad news.

645
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,620
they were gonna kill me.
i had to shut the movie down.

646
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,620
look,i-i tried other things.
i sicced the paparazzi on her.

647
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,710
i thought it would
stress her out.

648
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,850
i tried to get her to drop
out of the movie on her own,

649
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,020
and nothing worked.

650
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,120
let's go.

651
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,740
(man) hey,who is that?
(man) jason abbott.

652
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,010
(woman) mick,did he kill tierney taylor?
(man) did he kill tierney taylor?

653
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,990
hey,get these vultures outta
here. (camera shter clicking)

654
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,190
(man) hey,abbott,why'd
you do it?

655
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,270
i ran the partial.
it traced back to abbott.

656
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,860
but i guess you already knew
that,huh? we just came to talk to him.

657
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,130
he confessed. it'd be better
if he confessed to the police.

658
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,410
i'm sure he'll give
a repeat performance.

659
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,530
i guess that's the end
of my 15 minutes of fame.

660
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,050
what happens when
a vampire thinks

661
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,900
he's about to be exposed?

662
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:29,430
he moves on,changes
cities,names,starts all over.

663
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,750
have you ever done that?

664
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,430
no,but i've been
careful... and lucky.

665
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,710
i suppose one day
my luck will run out,

666
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,990
but until then,

667
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,920
listen...

668
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,670
how about dinner tonight?

669
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,080
arbor bistro?

670
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,860
it's a great restaurant.

671
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,480
they grow all their
own vegetables.

672
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,280
you are gonna get so
tired of watching me eat.

673
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,430
i hope so.

674
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,660
it's a date.

675
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,830
the rest of the
paparazzi have moved on,

676
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,080
but dean won't.

677
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,050
he won't stop stalking mick.

678
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,920
and eventually he'll get
a picture of mick vamping

679
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,370
or drinking blood.

680
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,340
you know,this whole
digital revolution

681
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,190
is bad for vampires.

682
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,630
back in the day,a
photo didn't matter.

683
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,220
because vampires come
out blurry on film?

684
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,090
it's the silver ne the emulsion,and
all a blurry photo proves

685
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,020
is the photographer's
incompetence.

686
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,290
are you speaking from
personal experience?

687
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,250
let's just say there was

688
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,090
a,uh,particularly rowdy
night at garbo's

689
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:48,030
i wouldn't want documented. don't tell me.
you're the reason she wanted to be alone.

690
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,870
now,beth,you wouldn't want me
to kiss and tell,would you?

691
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,040
so what do you want me to do
about this foster character?

692
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,320
i thought you could
handle it,you know?

693
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,700
pay him off or something.

694
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,280
yeah,well,you
think that'll work?

695
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,740
no.

696
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,820
well,then you know how
i'm gonna handle it.

697
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,940
mick has protected me

698
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,690
and saved me more
times than i can count.

699
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,180
and you're
returning the favor.

700
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,020
just don't tell him
we're doing this.

701
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,410
i can keep a secret.

702
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,690
but as long as
you're involved with mick

703
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,210
and you work at "buzzwire,"

704
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,900
his secret will
always be in danger.

705
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,760
i,um...

706
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,700
yeah?

707
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,150
(sighs) i have
something to tell you.

708
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,410
i quit "buzzwire."

709
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,600
why?

710
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,330
well,with maureen gone,

711
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,220
there's not even a veneer
of respectability,

712
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,320
and i'm not gonna make a
living feeding off people

713
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,290
like some kind of...

714
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,210
yes,well,um...

715
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,740
i suppose we're all vampires
in one form or another.

716
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,060
to vampires.

717
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,880
to us.

718
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,330
hey. get outta her
kid. come on.

719
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,640
come on. there ain't
nothing for you to see.

720
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,070
go on. move along.

721
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,920
hey,i'm talkin' to
you,you little punk.

722
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,510
go on. get outta here.

723
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,310
hey,don't you got a
curfew or somethin'?

724
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,670
<i>not in over a hundred
years or so... punk.</i>

725
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,840
hey,what's going on?

726
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,000
(whispers) oh,god,no.

727
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,410
i'm thinking yes. (snarls)

728
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,740
<i>and for the last time,</i>

729
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,450
<i>this is beth turner
reporting for "buzzwire."</i>

730
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,040
(man) * don't blame me *

731
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,200
* i had a vision *

732
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,820
* and a whole philosophy
of how things are to *

733
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,240
* be *

734
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:23,980
