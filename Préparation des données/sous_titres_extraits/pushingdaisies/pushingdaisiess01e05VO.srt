You only got a minute.
60 seconds.

3
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:06,017
I know.

4
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:11,818
What if you didn't have to be dead?

5
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:14,871
You touch murder victim, you ask
who killed them, you touch them again,

6
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:17,661
they go back to being dead,
and you collect the reward?

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,792
That's it in a nutshell.

8
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,596
<i>We haven't seen
each other in like 20 years.</i>

9
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,228
Don't you wanna know about me?
I wanna know everything about you.

<i>We've all done things
we're not proud of.</i>

<i>We all have secrets.</i>

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,184
Who's the funny girl stuck to Ned?

13
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,375
Childhood sweetheart.

14
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:32,627
<i>He digs her in a way
he definitely doesn't dig you.</i>

15
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:34,594
I don't like that girl, not one bit.

16
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,032
We recently lost our niece.

17
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:39,447
Your niece, Charlotte Charles, is dead?

18
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:42,819
Olive, what the hell are you doing here?

19
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:44,489
Pie delivery.
Tart apple.

young Ned would hope for a letter,</i>

to make it all better.</i>

29

{\pos(192,230)}<i>But from his father,
there was never a word.</i>

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,463
<i>"He's grieving your mother," they said.</i>

31
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,875
<i>Young Ned would concur.</i>

32
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:28,859
<i>Then one day before all hallows' eve,</i>

33
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:30,718

34
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:32,779
<i>It was hard to believe.</i>

35
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,249

00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,473

44
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:02,993
{\pos(192,210)}<i>He needed to see

a wink, and a quick "the joke's on you."</i>

52

was a honeycomb chew.</i>

53
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:30,933
Happy halloween.

00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:04,192
Hello?

61
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,200
Ned hates Halloween you know.

62
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,472
Makes him moodier
than a pumpkin full of PMS.

63
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,457
What? Ned doesn't hate halloween.

64
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,466
I think tomorrow's
his least-favorite day.

65
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,656
In fact, when he sees all this,
you're gonna be one sorry little zombie.

66
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,058
Seriously, you are so.

67
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,409
... dead.

68
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:44,521
So...

69
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,463
I guess you delivered
some pies to my aunts.

70
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:49,978
Yeah, they're sweet.

71
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:52,510
Probably be a lot sweeter
if they didn't think you were.

72
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,613
Murdered.

73
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:55,579
Did you tell them I was alive?

74
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:59,090
Kinda think that might make
their little heads explode.

75
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,231
What was that rhyme?

76
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:03,258
I scream, you scream, we all scream
'cause you faked your death.

77
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:05,288
You think I faked my death?

78
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:06,908
That's what I just sang.

79
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:08,939
Unless you have a better explanation.

80
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:10,930
<i>The fact, the truth was too,</i>

81
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,313
<i>unimaginable even to be considered
relieved Chuck.</i>

82
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,905
<i>But there were other problems.</i>

83
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:19,328
Olive. Chuck.

84
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:22,908
<i>If one thing scared the pie maker</i>

85
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,155
it was that the sercret
of Charlotte "Chuck"

86
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,181
<i>- Charles would get out.</i>
- Spooky!

87
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,906
We don't usually
decorate for halloween...

88
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:31,485
This much.

89
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:32,983
Or at all.

90
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,097
Yeah, I'll have them down in a jiffy.

91
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:38,404
- Chuck just had her head up her.
- No, it's okay. Leave them up.

92
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,081
Probably good for business.

93
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:41,125
I mean...

94
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,715
Thanks, Chuck.

95
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:50,573
Ned used to love Halloween.

96
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,855
Yeah.
I guess I know Ned better than you do.

97
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,449
Now I know you better than Ned does.

98
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:57,436
So, does Ned know
what you think you know?

99
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:58,630
- Not yet.
- Who does?

100
00:04:58,901 --> 00:04:59,904
Who knows?

101
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:05,733
<i>Olive Snook loved to win.</i>

102
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:09,240
<i>She celebrated the fact that
the unflappable brunette</i>

103
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,916
<i>Who had swept in from nowhere
to steal the pie maker's heart,</i>

104
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:15,557
<i>might be flappable after all.</i>

105
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,979
<i>But,
as often happens when one celebrates,</i>

106
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:22,058
<i>the universe is quick to even the score.</i>

107
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:26,787
<i>A sad ending for local blacksmith
Lucas Shoemaker...</i>

108
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:27,810
Jiminy christmas!

109
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:31,468
<i>who was trampled to death late yesterday
while working at manchester downs.</i>

110
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,166
<i>Police have agreed
that the death was unusual,</i>

111
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:36,691
<i>considering the victim's experience
with horses,</i>

112
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,735
<i>but they say they do not suspect
any foul play, at this time.</i>

113
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:43,643
<i>In other news, kittens on</i>

114
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:50,495
I know the decorations
were a lot of work.

115
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:52,854
This has always been
my favorite holiday.

116
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,747
Remember when
we used to go trick-or-treating,

117
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,398
gorge ourselves on candy?

118
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:00,465
You used to love that.

119
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,298
Why don't you like halloween anymore?

120
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:08,204
Remember razor blades in apples?
Never actually happened,

121
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,836
not once.
Just vicious rumor.

122
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:12,509
Are you changing the subject?

123
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:13,429
No.

124
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:14,676
Have you seen Olive?

125
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:15,597
Olive?

126
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:17,025
I wonder where she went.

127
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,252
<i>Chuck imagine where Olive might be.</i>

128
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:23,116
Ladies, I love your tea,
and your house is so cute.

129
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,620
By the way, Chuck's alive.

130
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:29,281
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

131
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:31,916
I said "Olive" and your whole face
just went whoosh.

132
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,151
Why don't you like halloween anymore?

133
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:36,010
Things change. I grew up.

134
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,273
You grew up?

135
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:39,718
Are you changing the subject?
Why the whoosh?

136
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:42,276
That's how I look now
when I feel nothing.

137
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,407
My face relaxes into something
that looks nervous.

138
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:46,655
Didn't used to.

139
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:47,956
Things change.

140
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,353
I grew up.

141
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:55,574
<i>As the pie maker walked out one door,</i>

142
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,952
<i>Olive opened another.</i>

143
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,217
As she looked in...

144
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:02,929
<i>A secret flooded over her</i>

145
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:06,185
<i>as sharp and horrible as the day
she had sealed it in.</i>

146
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,072
Check, please.

147
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,280
Or cash.

148
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:13,054
- Cash is good.
- I want to hire you.

149
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,478
Technically, I already have,

150
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:16,159
since you were so grabby with the cash.

151
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,780
Think of it as in escrow
between my thighs.

152
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,760
- What's the case?
- Yesterday,

153
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:24,168
a farrier named Lucas Shoemaker
was found dead, trampled.

154
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:27,198
Why should I care about a dude
that sells fur coats?

155
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,870
Not a furrier.
A farrier.

156
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:29,815
"air."

157
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:31,648
- Farrier?
- It's a blacksmith.

158
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:33,243
Puts shoes on horses.

159
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:35,864
Like that's a word everybody knows.

160
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,775
Police are saying his death was an...

161
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,185
... accident.

162
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:43,678
- You got reason to think otherwise?
- I might.

163
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:46,012
- This farrier, friend of yours?
- Used to work together.

164
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,884
- He ever put shoes on or off of you?
- Wasn't like that. We were...

165
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,447
Competitors.

166
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,833
What did you compete about?

167
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:54,336
Promise you won't laugh?

168
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:55,258
No.

169
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:59,241
I used to be a profesional horse jockey.

170
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,088
Shut up!

171
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:15,643
<i>The facts were these...</i>

172
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:20,300
<i>For 8 years, 11 weeks, and 4 days,
Olive Snook had been a jockey.</i>

173
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:21,990
<i>At the peak of her career,</i>

174
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:25,325
<i>she was considered among the best
and brightest of her sport.</i>

175
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,647
<i>Lucas Shoemaker had also been a frequent
visitor to the winner's circle.</i>

176
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,016
<i>Then, upon reaching
the age of 45 years, 3 weeks,</i>

177
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:37,569
<i>4 days, and 4 hours old,
he retired for a second time...</i>

178
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:38,985
<i>Permanently.</i>

179
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:45,247
Is this a bad idea, Olive as a client?

180
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:46,841
It's a little too close for comfort.

181
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,867
Hang on a second.
Let me ask the money.

182
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:51,625
Hey, money, it's me, Emerson.

183
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:52,847
I'm good.

184
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:54,418
I'm good.
Yeah, thanks for asking.

185
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:56,891
Say, can I still pay my bills
and buy stuff with you,

186
00:08:56,906 --> 00:08:58,579
even though you was Olive's money first?

187
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:01,586
Yeah.

188
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,346
Okay, then. Thanks.

189
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,603
The money don't care.
Touch him.

190
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:12,986
hi.

191
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:14,670
Hi. Ugh.

192
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,746
This may seem like asking the obvious,

193
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,729
but were you trampled by a horse?

194
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:24,015
Yeah.

195
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:27,270
They put a bomb in your daybed?

196
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,361
John joseph jacobs killed you?

197
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:33,170
- Yeah.
- How can you understand him?

198
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,199
I was in full orthodontic headge
for three years.

199
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:36,983
When?

200
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,315
- Puberty.
- You always had nice teeth.

201
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,313
My aunts told me it
was a form of birth control.

202
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:43,327
Yes, it did suck.

203
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,883
Can we get on with this, please?

204
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:47,296
So, you're sure John Joseph Jacobs
killed you?

205
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:48,506
Yeah.

206
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:51,054
I assure you, Mr. Shoemaker,
justice will be served.

207
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:52,300
Wait. Except...

208
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:53,415
Here it is.

209
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:54,442
Except what?

210
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,794
He's dead.

211
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:58,429
W- who's dead?

212
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:04,604
John Joseph Jacobs died seven years ago.
He saw it.

213
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:06,979
His gope kill me.

214
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:08,465
His goat killed you?

215
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:11,187
Gope.

216
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,216
Gope.

217
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,628
And he's going to kim agem.

218
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:24,129
- That sounded like...
- A ghost. A ghost killed him.

219
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:27,234
And he's going to kill "agem."

220
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:29,645
Most people hear "ghost,"

221
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:32,558
and they think of a disembodied
dead sea captain or something.

222
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:35,247
But there's actually
an entire spectrum of ghosts.

223
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:37,176
I'm fine with dead sea captain.

224
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,110
You don't really believe a ghost killed
Lucas Shoemaker, do you?

225
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,647
I'll bet she does.

226
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,259
How do you know there's not a ghost
somewhere right now telling his ghost

227
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:49,471
friend, don't really think there's a guy
touch dead people back to life, do you?

228
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:50,447
that's not fair.

229
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:51,993
Just because there's magic in one place

230
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:53,701
doesn't mean
there's magic in every place.

231
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,303
I don't believe in ghosts or witches
or haunted houses or spirits.

232
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,517
And maybe that sounds a little crazy
coming from a guy

233
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,971
who can shoot sparks out of his finger,
but...

234
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:05,199
- That's what I believe.
- You used to believe in ghosts.

235
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:07,459
He used to think
my aunts house was haunted.

236
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,999
We had a seance there one night.

237
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,397
He peed his pants.

238
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,632
I did not.

239
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,949
I knocked the hors d'oeuvre
plate into my lap,

240
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:21,229
and the brie was runny.

241
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:23,937
I'd stick with
the pissing-my-pants story.

242
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,648
There's Olive.

243
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,015
You were right.
Lucas Shoemaker was murdered.

244
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,128
I knew it.

245
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:40,303
Word is there could be more.
Know who else might be in danger?

246
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:41,366
Might be jockeys.

247
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:42,389
You got names?

248
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:43,994
Got places. Bar I know.

249
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,564
Bunch of them hang out.

250
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,616
The name John Joseph Jacobs
mean anything to you?

251
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:50,428
W- why?

252
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,155
Someone said they saw his ghost.

253
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,212
<i>It was plain that the name
John Joseph Jacobs</i>

254
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,527
<i>meant every thing to Olive Snook.</i>

255
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,475
That name means everything to her.

256
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:11,791
I'm gonna check out who else
knows about this supposed ghost.

257
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:13,586
Olive said there was a bar.

258
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:16,418
I'll check out the stables,
see if the perp left behind any clues.

259
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,745
You mean like protoplasm
or melted crucifixes?

260
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:20,306
Or, you know, real clues.

261
00:12:20,593 --> 00:12:21,693
Did he say "perp"?

262
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:22,740
He did.

263
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:24,045
Isn't he cute?

264
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,351
I'll come with you if you like.

265
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,638
Actually, I'd rather go alone. Besides,

266
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:32,550
I think Emerson needs you.

267
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:33,641
What?

268
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,218
Don't kick me.

269
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,761
Did you just kick him under the table?

270
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:40,347
No.

271
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,718
Yes.

272
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:43,950
There's just something else I got to do.

273
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:45,132
Case related?

274
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,171
Yes.

275
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:48,177
No.

276
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:51,854
In fact, I probably won't even
make it to the stables.

277
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,465
Fine. I'll go to the stables.
You go to the bar.

278
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,105
You go and do whatever private, secret,

279
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,157
alone thing you need
to go and do by yourself.

280
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:01,701
Alone.

281
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,358
She's upset.

282
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:12,577
But this really is something
I have to do alone.

283
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,265
Telling me helps.

284
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,458
Where's Olive?

285
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:18,879
Oh, shoot.

286
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:22,956
<i>A raison 60% of Olive Snook's blood</i>

287
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:25,452
<i>had left her head was this</i>

288
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,073
<i>For 3 years, 4 months, and 26 days,</i>

289
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:33,621
<i>John Joseph Jacobs
had been the golden boy of horse racing.</i>

290
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,976
<i>Win after win on the world circuit
earned him grander trophies and greater</i>

291
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:40,350
<i>purses until he was a sure bet</i>

292
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,093
<i>to become the greatest
Jockey of all time.</i>

293
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:46,791
<i>His chance to prove this came
in the race of the century,</i>

294
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:49,909
<i>pitting the top jockeys
of the day against each other.</i>

295
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:53,213
<i>But as he was about to win
the jock-off 2000,</i>

296
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:57,174
<i>John Joseph Jacobs
suddenly found himself...</i>

297
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,352
<i>... unseated.</i>

298
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:02,905
<i>His patented early lead,
ideal for winning but not for falling,</i>

299
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:07,858
<i>led to his being unwittingly trampled
by the four other riders in the race,</i>

300
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:12,713
<i>including the jock-off 2000's
eventual winner, Olive Snook.</i>

301
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:14,788
I quit racing the next day,

302
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:17,371
put the trophy and my winnings
in a safe-deposit box.

303
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,017
I thought if I locked it all away,
I could...

304
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:21,705
Forget.

305
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:24,013
You think whoever killed
Shoemaker was looking

306
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:25,898
to get revenge for
John Joseph Jacobs death?

307
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:28,374
I know it sounds crazy.

308
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,530
It ain't crazy.

309
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:31,864
Guy's supposed to win a race,
and then he doesn't.

310
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,586
A lot of angry gamblers looking for
someone to blame. But why now?

311
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:37,571
Seven years is a long time
to nurse arudge.

312
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,231
What if it is John Joseph's ghost?

313
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:40,473
See, now, that's crazy.

314
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:43,623
What if he's going after everybody
who finished the race where he died?

315
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:45,793
Gordon was fourth.
Shoe showed third.

316
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,193
Pinky placed second.

317
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:49,799
I never should have won.

318
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:52,441
You need another drink.

319
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:54,818
Barkeep!

320
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,214
Listen, King Kong. I already told
you. You can finish your beer and go.

321
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,605
- We don't want your kind in here.
- Hey!

322
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:02,695
Take a breath, big fella.

323
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:05,548
I'm merely referring
to the sign behind the bar.

324
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:09,735
Damn it, Pinky Mccoy.
I'm trying to save your life.

325
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:11,371
Will you just calm down?

326
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,113
The P.I.'s here about shoey.

327
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,007
He just wants to ask you some questions.

328
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,162
Why do they call you Pinky?

329
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,839
If you're looking to make a joke
at my expense...

330
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:25,438
- It's just a question.
- Knock it off, the both of you!

331
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,895
And you put that gun away!

332
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:28,732
Listen to the little lady.

333
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:32,747
A bird gun like that ain't
gonna do you no good if the ghost

334
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,294
of John Joseph Jacobs
comes a-calling for you.

335
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:38,063
Shut your trap, Gordon!

336
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:40,331
You seen this ghost, friend?

337
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:42,627
Oh, I've seen him, all right.

338
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,991
He rises from his grave

339
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,364
and walks the stables by night...

340
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:49,655
Oh, brother.

341
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:51,886
Looking for revenge

342
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,665
on the riders who mangled him.

343
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,640
Oh, no.

344
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,101
Then it's true.

345
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:02,439
The ghost of John Joseph
murdered that jockey.

346
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:07,165
And he'll get the rest of us, too,

347
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:09,731
one by bloody one.

348
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,323
That's it! I'm cutting you off!

349
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:14,896
<i>The only thing that ghost's
a murdering is my business.</i>

350
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:18,767
You don't believe me,
you go look at his tomb for yourself.

351
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:21,481
The lid's been broken

352
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:23,681
on account of him

353
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:26,138
climbing out all the time.

354
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:31,018
<i>Who heats in a tomb?</i>

355
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:33,299
<i>There's crackers everywhere.</i>

356
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:35,689
Whoever it was couldn't
have been here very long ago.

357
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:39,324
Gordon was right. The lid's been broken,
just like he said.

358
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,727
Maybe John Josephis coming back
from the dead.

359
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,414
Or someone wants
to give that impression.

360
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:46,231
Maybe Gordon knows more than he's
letting on. We got to look inside.

361
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:49,051
Maybe John Joseph faked his death.
People do that all the time.

362
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,462
No, they don't.

363
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:51,908
Yeah, they do.

364
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:54,377
Sometimes they just
don't even try to cover it up.

365
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:57,509
They just show up and ruin your life
like no one's ever gonna figure it out.

366
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,850
But then you do figure
it out 'cause you're not an idiot.

367
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,226
Are you an idiot?

368
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:02,906
No, because an idiot might misunderstand

369
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,810
what you're saying and hit
you with a shovel.

370
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:06,345
I think you know.

371
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,144
I think you're wrong.

372
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,209
Can we do this?

373
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:10,154
Yeah.

374
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,417
You want to do it.

375
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:27,949
Okay. Yeah.

376
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:39,177
1...

377
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:41,627
2...

378
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:45,396
- Shut up.
- ... 3!

379
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,836
Sweet secretariat!

380
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:52,905
That don't look like John Joseph.

381
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:54,825
A horse with no name.

382
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:56,073
Or legs.

383
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,091
Hello!

384
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,949
Hello, is anybody here?

385
00:18:05,894 --> 00:18:07,127
Nay yourself.

386
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:10,958
{\pos(192,210)}Come on, Digby,
let's go look for evidence.

387
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:13,823
{\pos(192,210)}You know, if you think about it,
we've already been murdered once.

388
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:16,138
{\pos(192,210)}How many people or dogs can say that?

389
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:18,526
{\pos(192,210)}You know what we are?

390
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:21,375
We're the walking dead on halloween.

391
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,045
If anyone should be scared,

392
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:24,920
it should be them.

393
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:30,241
Look,

394
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:32,557
someone dropped an oyster.

395
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,380
Emerson!

396
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:40,837
What are you doing here?

397
00:18:41,044 --> 00:18:43,759
There's a legless skeleton of
a horse in John Jacob's tomb,

398
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,105
and Olive knows you're dead.

399
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,247
First of all?

400
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:48,749
And secondly,
Olive thinks that

401
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:51,590
I faked my death, which is complely
different to knowing that I'm dead.

402
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:53,443
Yeah, different like purple and mauve.

403
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,985
I was sending pies to my aunts.

404
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:56,836
I didn't know
Olive was gonna deliver them.

405
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,500
This is exactly what Ned was afraid of.
Now she can ruin everything.

406
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,378
I hope he's okay, wherever he is.

407
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,035
<i>At that moment,</i>

408
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:09,164
<i>the pie maker found himself across town
and across time.</i>

409
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:11,837
Happy halloween.

410
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,915
<i>Dad's heart had done
what it need the most.</i>

411
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:19,155
<i>It moved on and never looked back,</i>

412
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,053
<i>'till Ned was nothing...</i>

413
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,738
<i>But a ghost.</i>

414
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:27,462
<i>So, the ghost ran away,
one thought in his head</i>

415
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:31,634
<i>To go back to his old house
and lie down in his bed.</i>

416
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,843
<i>But you can't go back in time,
any ghost can see.</i>

417
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:39,229
<i>So, he laid down
where his bed used to be.</i>

418
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,083
<i>20 years went by.
Paint chipped, grass grew.</i>

419
00:19:45,277 --> 00:19:49,425
<i>Young Ned never forgot,
and young Ned grew, too.</i>

420
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:54,288
<i>So he came back to haunt the house
where good times were had</i>

421
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:56,785
<i>'till the times, they'd marched on,</i>

422
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:58,866
<i>and with them, dad.</i>

423
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:04,922
Hey kid!

424
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,818
Throw another egg,
and you have my word,

425
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:08,997
it'll be the last egg you ever throw.

426
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,839
That's right.
Run, you little bastards.

427
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,029
Well, whoever killed Shoemaker obviously

428
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:20,872
wants to give the impression
he's John Joseph's ghost.

429
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:23,162
Stealing his body
must be part of the plan.

430
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:24,333
Got it.

431
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:27,563
The mother may not know anything
about her son's body being missing,

432
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:28,702
so tread lightly.

433
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:30,323
Anything else?

434
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:32,473
Sorry I'm late.

435
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,058
Hansel and Gretel
would have lived a lot longer

436
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:37,900
if they had had to find this dump.

437
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:39,536
- Hi.
- Hi.

438
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:42,075
Olive's coming.
She knows the woman.

439
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:42,908
Great.

440
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:46,303
You know, Hansel and Gretel lived,
by the way.

441
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:49,042
Once they tricked the witch
into the oven, they stole her jewels,

442
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:51,975
went home with their father,
only to discover that their stepmother,

443
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,520
who had sent them
into the woods, had died of evilness.

444
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:56,115
You can't die of evilness.

445
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:59,444
Happens all the time. You do something
mean or hurtful to someone, like...

446
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:00,982
tell a secret.

447
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:03,608
- You're dead.
- Or...

448
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:06,263
You're not really dead.
You're just pretending to be dead,

449
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,268
while other people{\ who think
you're dead} are heartbroken.

450
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:11,133
Or, bang... You talk too much,
and you both go wait in the car.

451
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:17,983
Hello!

452
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:19,587
Olive!

453
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:21,593
I never thought I'd see you again.

454
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:24,078
Well, you're a modest dresser,

455
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
as always.

456
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,724
I do hope
you'll forgive all the mess.

457
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:35,625
but the hall of fame
is remodeling their exhibit on Johnny.

458
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:38,552
And they asked me
to go over all of his trophies.

459
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:40,488
Congratulations, Mrs. Jacobs.

460
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:41,328
Thank you.

461
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,315
It's probably just as well that
you trampled him when you did, Olive.

462
00:21:44,451 --> 00:21:46,868
Or else...
I would have had to buy another house

463
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,686
just to put all the trophies in.

464
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,108
I know that must sound a little...

465
00:21:52,174 --> 00:21:53,074
Bitchy.

466
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,549
What did you say your name was?

467
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:56,854
Brandon?

468
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,418
Butch?

469
00:21:58,554 --> 00:21:59,750
- Chuck.
- Chuck.

470
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,987
I knew it was something unladylike.

471
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,128
My point was that...

472
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:08,731
I have made peace...
with Johnny's death.

473
00:22:08,897 --> 00:22:10,672
It wasn't easy at first, but...

474
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:12,508
knowing that it was an accident,

475
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,260
and that you've stayed single

476
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,777
and that all the rest
of them are drunks...

477
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,472
It made it a little easier.

478
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:21,663
How do you know I'm still single?

479
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:24,319
Well, you wouldn't need all that bait

480
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,742
if your belly were full of fish, dear.

481
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:36,439
- That's a big trophy.
- Yes.

482
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:37,802
That...

483
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,616
one belongs to me.

484
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:42,897
This is Johnny's final resting place.

485
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:43,946
His ashes.

486
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,107
His ashes?

487
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:48,196
- Then what did you bury at his funeral?
- All the gold.

488
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:49,954
His horse.

489
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,509
You see, Johnny
always wanted to give the horse

490
00:22:52,642 --> 00:22:55,726
that made his career a hero's burial,

491
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:58,446
but the health department
wasn't too keen on that,

492
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,686
so... I did it in secret.

493
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:03,205
I want you to know, Mrs. Jacobs,

494
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,411
I never spent
the winnings from that race,

495
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:06,818
until now, to hire Mr. Cod

496
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:08,852
to help solve this awful murder.

497
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:11,944
I do...

498
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:14,311
forgive you, Olive Snook.

499
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:18,460
The fall was an accident.
I can't blame you for not slowing down.

500
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:19,967
Johnny never did.

501
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:28,351
Well, I guess
that explains the horse skeleton.

502
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:30,097
- But not the murder.
- Or the ghost.

503
00:23:30,112 --> 00:23:31,811
I think John Joseph's come back,

504
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:34,299
and he's coming after every one
of us who was in that race.

505
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:37,016
- And I think she knows it.
- But you didn't do anything.

506
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,859
And she forgave you.

507
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,009
<i>As the little voice</i>

508
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,006
<i>in Olive's head told her
something bad was about to happen...</i>

509
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:45,612
We need to check on Pinky.

510
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:48,071
We're closed!

511
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,765
<i>... the not-so-little voice
in Pinky McCoy's head agreed.</i>

512
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,793
<i>Unaware that his friends were closing in</i>

513
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:01,724
<i>on the trail of what appeared
to be a murderous ghost,</i>

514
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:04,620
<i>the pie maker continued
to haunt his own past.</i>

515
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,764
{\pos(192,225)}Halloween's a busy time for us.

516
00:24:08,903 --> 00:24:12,324
{\pos(192,225)}Some of the neighborhood children
started a rumor we were witches.

517
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,502
{\pos(192,225)}They said we turned
little boys into birds.

518
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:16,856
That's...

519
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,150
terrible.

520
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,886
Help me. Help me.
They turned me into a bird.

521
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:24,771
Scares the willies out of them.

522
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:28,380
Lily, Vivian...

523
00:24:29,508 --> 00:24:31,787
do you remember
very much about my father?

524
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,588
A neighbor's a neighbor.
Hard to remember so long ago.

525
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,201
He was a handsome man.

526
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,996
And he liked to edge
his lawn on saturdays.

527
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,541
Your father was a jackass.

528
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,924
Everybody said how terrible it was
when he moved away like that.

529
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:55,578
You ask me,
he did us all a favor...

530
00:24:56,197 --> 00:24:57,397
You included.

531
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:11,537
<i>The pie maker stared
at the ripe strawberry</i>

532
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:14,201
<i>that had turned rotten
at the touch of his tongue.</i>

533
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:16,247
<i>It could only mean one thing.</i>

534
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:18,283
<i>He had touched it before.</i>

535
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,019
Where did you get this pie?

536
00:25:20,096 --> 00:25:22,220
We thought
you were having them delivered.

537
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:23,536
Comes every week.

538
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:26,860
I don't know how we survived without it.
It's like a sex addiction.

539
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:31,565
I would imagine.

540
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,983
<i>The pie maker realized
Lily and Vivian had their own ghost.</i>

541
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:41,085
If this is that Armenian baker

542
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:42,922
pulling some kind of switcheroo...

543
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:44,721
No.

544
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,871
It's me. I'm sending them.

545
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:53,783
I just figured you could use
a little sweetness in these hard times.

546
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:56,794
I, uh...

547
00:25:58,288 --> 00:25:59,789
I really got to go.

548
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:02,446
Wait.

549
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:06,571
- Your father...
- I know.

550
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,788
He was emotionally stunted,
afraid of getting close.

551
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,352
Definitely not the best at goodbyes.

552
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:12,881
"Jackass" is as good a word as any.

553
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:15,608
Then why do I still miss him?

554
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,261
We see what we want to see.

555
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:21,856
Sometimes...

556
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,698
I put pillows under
the covers of Charlotte's bed

557
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:27,109
and pretend she's sleeping.

558
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,123
I miss her too.

559
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,025
Nobody remembers your father, Ned.

560
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:36,602
What they do talk
about is how you turned out

561
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:38,836
to be such a nice, wonderful boy.

562
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:44,779
Man, even.

563
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:58,802
I'll keep the pies coming.

564
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:01,603
<i>As the pie maker started off,</i>

565
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:04,407
<i>he realized that,
for the first time in his life,</i>

566
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:07,082
<i>he missed something more than his past.</i>

567
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:09,581
<i>He missed his present.</i>

568
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,699
- Where have you been?
- Not important.

569
00:27:14,898 --> 00:27:16,458
It's important to me.

570
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:17,807
I missed you.

571
00:27:19,242 --> 00:27:20,528
I missed you too.

572
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:23,725
Can we get on with this, please?

573
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,392
Come on.
Let's go outside.

574
00:27:31,802 --> 00:27:34,191
We'll let Emerson and Ned
look for evidence.

575
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,810
Come on.

576
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:49,393
Crap.

577
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:51,349
I need a drink.

578
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,492
All right, who did this?

579
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:03,545
Wouldn't have believed
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

580
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:05,185
Same silks,

581
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:08,186
same goggles, same as the day he died.

582
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:09,622
The ghost did it.

583
00:28:10,392 --> 00:28:11,974
Finally got his revenge.

584
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:15,295
Not that I don't deserve it,
as I'm the one who gave him the snip.

585
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:16,381
What snip?

586
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:17,941
Let's just say...

587
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:20,683
I played the ponies
better than I rode them.

588
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:24,026
- You bet on your own races.
- Only the ones I fixed.

589
00:28:24,342 --> 00:28:26,217
You see Olive, you tell her...

590
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,413
I'm sorry.

591
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,062
She don't deserve what's coming to her.

592
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,291
What's she got coming to her?

593
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,595
It's pretty clear
John Joseph's come back

594
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,651
because he knows
how we all kept the secret.

595
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:36,724
What secret?

596
00:28:36,858 --> 00:28:38,695
Make yourself comfortable.

597
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:40,443
It's quite a story.

598
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:47,271
Son of a bitch.

599
00:28:54,945 --> 00:28:57,794
Was confronted
with the lie that Pinky had briefly

600
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,647
revived to point the finger...

601
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:01,023
she broke down.

602
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:03,976
<i>The facts were these:</i>

603
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:08,394
<i>In the pandemonium that followed
the tragedy-marred jock-off 2000,</i>

604
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:12,496
<i>the four surviving jockeys,
Pinky, Lucas, Gordon, and Olive...</i>

605
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,343
<i>gathered in secret.</i>

606
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,934
<i>One of them had deliberately
cut the fallen jockey's girth.</i>

607
00:29:18,443 --> 00:29:21,672
<i>John Joseph Jacobs had been sotaged.</i>

608
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:23,426
<i>Accusations flew.</i>

609
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:27,220
<i>But to protect their own honor,
and that of their storied profession,</i>

610
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:30,671
<i>the heinous crime
would never be revealed to anyone.</i>

611
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:32,546
<i>Olive tried to protest...</i>

612
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:33,356
No.

613
00:29:33,514 --> 00:29:35,120
<i>... but she was overwhelmed.</i>

614
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,976
<i>The oath to keep
the terrible secret was taken...</i>

615
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,520
<i>and the evidence destroyed.</i>

616
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:50,941
You're in a lot of danger.

617
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,732
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about the girth.

618
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:54,910
Why would you spend
all those years lying{\ for each other}?

619
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:55,911
We took an oath.

620
00:29:55,947 --> 00:29:57,928
I was scared for
what would happen if I broke it.

621
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,278
Sometimes you have to keep a secret,
even if it means hurting someone.

622
00:30:01,414 --> 00:30:02,400
Exactly.

623
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:05,709
Damn it.

624
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:06,862
Bottom line is,

625
00:30:06,877 --> 00:30:09,858
someone wants to get payback either
'cause they found out about the secret,

626
00:30:09,873 --> 00:30:12,707
or because they knew about it all along
and want it to go away forever.

627
00:30:12,722 --> 00:30:14,166
That only leaves Gordon and you.

628
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:16,562
I didn't do it,
and it certainly wasn't Gordon.

629
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:18,517
We got to find Gordon
before somebody else does.

630
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:19,977
But if it is a ghost...

631
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,344
I'm getting the car.

632
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:24,661
All I'm saying...

633
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,659
if this is some spirit
trying to correct a terrible wrong,

634
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:30,182
then you need to confront it
and tell it to move on.

635
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:31,713
If I were a ghost...

636
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:34,871
it would be hard for me to move on, too.

637
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,261
I'm sure it would be.

638
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:43,952
Keep the curtains closed

639
00:30:43,985 --> 00:30:45,953
and the windows locked
for the rest of the night.

640
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:46,954
Yes, sir.

641
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:49,847
Hey.

642
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:52,892
Be careful.

643
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,042
I will. You too.

644
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:01,696
Lock the door behind me
and don't let anyone in.

645
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:07,517
I love in-charge Ned.

646
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:11,217
You really don't have to stay.
I can totally take care of myself.

647
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:12,669
You're not scared?

648
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,789
No.
Why? Are you?

649
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:17,039
No.

650
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:20,473
I'll make some tea.

651
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:23,205
And I'll get the booze
to take the edge off.

652
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,737
Bourbon, with a splash of chamomile.

653
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:26,212
Aunt Lily's favorite.

654
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:32,141
Thank you for respecting my secret.

655
00:31:32,163 --> 00:31:34,637
I'd never do this
to my aunts if I didn't have to.

656
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,089
I won't tell Ned.
I'll leave that up to you.

657
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:40,108
I keep the booze by my bed.

658
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,334
John Joseph.

659
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:55,203
If you're...

660
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:57,519
scared of a ghost, confront it.

661
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:02,912
Hey, Olive, I love your horsey mugs.

662
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,182
It is you!

663
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:35,644
John Joseph Jacobs.

664
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:38,224
It's really you?

665
00:32:44,024 --> 00:32:45,024
{\pos(192,225)}Nice shot.

666
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:46,175
{\pos(192,225)}Are you okay?

667
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,684
{\pos(192,225)}I found this outside the window.

668
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:51,477
{\pos(192,225)}I gave this to John Joseph jacobs right
before the jock-off 2000 for good luck.

669
00:32:53,975 --> 00:32:56,386
John Joseph, I thought you were dead.

670
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:58,605
You should be ashamed of yourself...

671
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:03,555
... and about...

672
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,856
two feet shorter.

673
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:07,990
Let me explain.

674
00:33:08,182 --> 00:33:09,498
<i>The facts were these:</i>

675
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:13,933
<i>John Joseph Jacobs had indeed died
on the track that fateful day.</i>

676
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:15,066
Clear!

677
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:19,247
<i>But the shock of 1,200 volts
brought his heart back to life.</i>

678
00:33:20,823 --> 00:33:23,831
<i>Unfortunately,
his legs would not be so lucky.</i>

679
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:25,649
<i>Consulting with the family,</i>

680
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:29,034
<i>the doctors turned to another racer
who had fallen that day.</i>

681
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:34,208
<i>After a 14-hour surgery,
all the gold...</i>

682
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:35,725
<i>would live on...</i>

683
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:39,054
<i>Below the belt of John Joseph Jacobs.</i>

684
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:41,377
We thought you were a ghost.

685
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:46,155
Well, I've basically been living
in mama's basement

686
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,558
for the past seven years.

687
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:49,081
When I heard you talking

688
00:33:49,258 --> 00:33:51,327
about Shoemaker
through the heating vent,

689
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,817
I thought I was dreaming.

690
00:33:52,894 --> 00:33:55,047
Did you kill him, John Joseph Jacobs?

691
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:56,478
Of course not.

692
00:33:56,608 --> 00:34:00,208
Why would I want to kill anybody
if it was just an accident?

693
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:04,219
Then who would be trying to frame you?

694
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:05,391
I don't know.

695
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:09,019
Truth is, I've done my best
to forget that whole chapter of my life.

696
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:12,822
I guess I kind of tried that, too.

697
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:14,953
Can we go back a little?

698
00:34:15,298 --> 00:34:16,398
You have...

699
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:17,991
horse legs?

700
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:21,323
It's called xenograft
bone transplantation.

701
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:23,189
Those doctors were artists.

702
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,698
It only took two years

703
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:27,304
until I could walk up
the basement stairs on my own,

704
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:30,966
and only another
three until my mama let me.

705
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,324
I'm so sorry
your mom keeps you in the basement.

706
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:34,129
No.

707
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:37,115
It's my choice now.
I feel safe down there.

708
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:38,911
Besides...

709
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:41,306
since the operation,
mama thought...

710
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,009
I might scare people.

711
00:34:43,737 --> 00:34:45,946
Is that why you've been hiding
in the basement?

712
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:48,179
John Joseph, you look gre-at.

713
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,768
And you beat death.

714
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:50,985
You're alive.

715
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,706
Don't you owe it to your horse

716
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:57,234
to stand up on his two legs
and get out there and live?

717
00:34:58,864 --> 00:34:59,993
Maybe you're right.

718
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:04,630
Maybe it's time to tell my mother
I'm ready to get out there on my own.

719
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,738
I mean, geez...

720
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:08,418
I'm almost 40.

721
00:35:08,937 --> 00:35:12,072
John Joseph, do you want us
to help you talk to her?

722
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:13,802
That would be great.

723
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:17,542
And I kind of need a ride home.

724
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:27,625
My mama's still at her aqua therapy.

725
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:28,932
Make yourself at home.

726
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:30,663
Thanks!

727
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:36,278
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

728
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:39,275
If John Joseph didn't do it,
then the killer's still out there.

729
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:41,572
We're out of crackers.

730
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:45,247
Crackers?

731
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:46,942
Oyster crackers.

732
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:48,816
I have low blood sugar.

733
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:51,913
I kind of get crazy-grumpy
if I don't watch it.

734
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,544
I have more bags downstairs.

735
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:57,392
This trophy bugs me.

736
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,608
Olive, there...

737
00:35:58,664 --> 00:36:00,909
there was oyster crackers
at every murder scene.

738
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:05,722
Then what do you think
she keeps in here?

739
00:36:05,744 --> 00:36:08,228
I don't know but hurry up
and open it before he comes back!

740
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:11,493
What if he changes
when his blood sugar level drops?

741
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:14,188
Hurry up!

742
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,134
There are ashes in here.

743
00:36:21,572 --> 00:36:23,419
What if he's gonna go get his horse?

744
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Look!

745
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,915
It's John Joseph jacob's saddle.

746
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:34,397
- He does know the secret.
- Yes.

747
00:36:47,647 --> 00:36:50,943
<i>As Olive prepared to be
the ghost rider's third victim,</i>

748
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,703
<i>Gordon considered
the sober prospect of being the fourth.</i>

749
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:01,518
Can you not sing?

750
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:03,847
If I don't sing, I throw up.

751
00:37:04,197 --> 00:37:05,197
Sing.

752
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:09,143
I miss Pinky.

753
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:12,174
I even miss Shoey.

754
00:37:13,452 --> 00:37:15,045
They were good people.

755
00:37:15,642 --> 00:37:17,130
Even after Shoey...

756
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,636
got on the wagon
and became an epic bore...

757
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,124
I loved him.

758
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:24,816
He stopped drinking?

759
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:26,172
That poor sucker.

760
00:37:26,217 --> 00:37:30,187
He even made amends
to John Joseph's mother before he died.

761
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:32,350
What do you mean, "made amends"?

762
00:37:33,158 --> 00:37:35,591
Told the old bag of nails everything.

763
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:39,740
He even brought her
the ashes from the saddle to prove it.

764
00:37:41,388 --> 00:37:42,388
Go.

765
00:37:47,616 --> 00:37:48,727
Mama Jacobs?

766
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:50,789
You killed Lucas and Pinky?

767
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:53,005
As far as anyone knows,

768
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:56,482
it was the ghost of John Joseph,
and it's gonna stay that way.

769
00:37:56,784 --> 00:38:01,087
- The crackers were a nice touch.
- Hypoglycemia is hereditary, sweetie.

770
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:04,713
I trampled them
just the way they did my boy.

771
00:38:04,954 --> 00:38:06,709
But John Joseph is alive.

772
00:38:06,843 --> 00:38:08,643
They murdered his career.

773
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:10,353
He could've won the triple crown.

774
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,511
He could've been
the best there ever was.

775
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,605
Olive is innocent,
she didn't cut the girth.

776
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,225
But I kept the secret.

777
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:20,652
Now that we've reestablished
why I need to kill you,

778
00:38:20,774 --> 00:38:22,362
it's time for you to run.

779
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:24,239
I have found that trampling

780
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:26,636
works better at a full gallop.

781
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,780
Come on!

782
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:36,225
- This way! This way!
- Wait!

783
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,984
Come on. Come on.

784
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,688
They're not there.

785
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:47,506
The woods!

786
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,960
Come on.
Follow me.

787
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,798
My ankle.

788
00:39:04,003 --> 00:39:05,701
Here, put your arm around me.

789
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:07,345
You got it. You got it.

790
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:09,761
- Go. Go.
- Lean on me.

791
00:39:12,742 --> 00:39:13,942
Hurry! Hurry!

792
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:16,800
Are you okay?

793
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:20,712
Are you okay?

794
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:22,320
- Run. Save yourself.
- No.

795
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,778
She's after me, not you.
Tell Ned I love...

796
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,664
... his pies.

797
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:29,255
But... Olive!

798
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:32,760
Over here!

799
00:39:32,827 --> 00:39:35,159
The old gray Mary,
she ain't what she used to be,

800
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:36,968
ain't what she used to be.

801
00:39:49,936 --> 00:39:51,200
I love you, shovel.

802
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:53,115
Are you okay?

803
00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:54,734
You saved me.

804
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,329
<i>Though Olive Snook
had won the race for her life,</i>

805
00:40:13,384 --> 00:40:15,406
<i>in the race for the pie maker's heart,</i>

806
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:18,074
<i>she had, once again, placed second.</i>

807
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:22,111
<i>As for mama Jacobs,
this race would be her last.</i>

808
00:40:22,812 --> 00:40:26,924
<i>She had always seen her son as a winner
and could not see him as anything else.</i>

809
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:30,142
<i>Her murderous grip
on the past landed her a trip</i>

810
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,531
<i>to a private museum for one.</i>

811
00:40:33,316 --> 00:40:36,752
<i>Olive offered John Joseph
the trophy from the jock-off 2000</i>

812
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:38,695
<i>she felt was rightfully his.</i>

813
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:40,603
I couldn't possibly.

814
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:42,113
<i>He took it...</i>

815
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,212
<i>as well as the unspent purse,</i>

816
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:46,004
<i>which he happily accepted.</i>

817
00:40:47,331 --> 00:40:49,244
I'm so glad you brought me back here.

818
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,737
I haven't been back here in a long time.

819
00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:54,745
I had to confront a ghost today.

820
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:56,816
Whose ghost?

821
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:58,648
My own.

822
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,272
I know about the pies, Chuck.

823
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:09,709
- Did Emerson tell you?
- No.

824
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:13,210
I mean, you're not mad?

825
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:14,872
No.

826
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:17,571
I understand.

827
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:26,587
Come on,
there's something you got to do.

828
00:41:42,176 --> 00:41:43,581
Is that clock right?

829
00:41:43,813 --> 00:41:45,406
It's 2:00 in the a.m.

830
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,679
I'll get my gun.

831
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:49,744
And I'll get the candy bowl.

832
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,242
Trick or treat.
