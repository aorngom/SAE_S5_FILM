00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,833
Allah, in his wisdom and greatness,

3
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,531
has given us each a gift.

4
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:52,760
A gift that we must share with others.

5
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:55,832
Even if they do not wish to accept it.

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,205
<i>It is our obligation</i>

7
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:00,869
<i>to share Islam with non-believers.</i>

8
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:03,236
So that we may save them

9
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,420
<i>from themselves.</i>

14
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:56,517
<i>My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?</i>

15
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:57,717
That's a movie.

16
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:59,233
<i>I'm starting to get over the idea...</i>

17
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,166
Not just any movie.
That's "Double Identity".

18
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:05,689
Your power of observation is unearthly.
Now, leave me alone.

19
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,136
This is the best part.

20
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:09,492
I not gonna get between
a chick and a flick.

21
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,892
How do you know it's the best part?

22
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,960
Because it is the third
time I have seen it.

23
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,396
You don't even watch movies.

24
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,958
This is not a movie.

25
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:19,430
It's a classic film.

26
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,924
Yeah,
I know that. You don't know that.

27
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,252
Film studies?

28
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:26,707
Well...

29
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,620
I really appreciate that, Ziva.
Really, I do.

30
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:32,740
I am taking it because it is the best
way to pick up American colloquialism,

31
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:33,857
like "bug off."

32
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:36,082
You should watch
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High".

33
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:38,223
I saw it last week.
Sean Penn is a genius.

34
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:39,664
Phoebe Cates is a babe.

35
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:40,733
Now,

36
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:42,479
do you mind?

37
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,416
- I can get you a list...
- I have a list!

38
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,030
Bye.

39
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:49,744
Morning, Probie Pan.

40
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,598
Where'd you pick that up? Neverland?

41
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:53,149
No, Pottery Den.

42
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,888
50% off.
Got six of them for ten dollars.

43
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,449
That's pretty big, don't you think?

44
00:03:57,464 --> 00:03:59,644
Well, I don't like getting refills
ten times a day.

45
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,697
Well, but I mean, that's a little...

46
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,024
A little what?

47
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:08,655
Seuss-ical?

48
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:10,579
Leave. I'm enjoying my moment.

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,632
Am I the only normal one here?

50
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:15,518
No.

51
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:16,732
Morning, Boss.

52
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,552
Marine killed.
Let's go.

53
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:20,959
Shotgun.

54
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:25,098
<i>Anacostia and 18th,</i>

55
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:27,896
not the battlefield he thought
he'd die on.

56
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:31,893
Baghdad's safer than this neighborhood.

57
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:32,951
Hey.

58
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:34,861
What do we got?

59
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:38,974
Ring, watch, and wallet are missing.

60
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:41,949
Government issue.

61
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:44,431
Could be the murder weapon.

62
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:46,397
A Marine killed with his own gun?

63
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:48,067
Nearly 30% of all

64
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:49,915
gun-related deaths

65
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:52,457
<i>are the results
of the owner's own weapon.</i>

66
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,781
Your first impressions, Mr. Palmer?

67
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,249
Well, there should be much more
blood loss evident.

68
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,424
Based upon?

69
00:04:58,477 --> 00:05:00,638
<i>Based on the position of the body,</i>

70
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:02,662
even with the heart slightly elevated.

71
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:03,918
Precisely even

72
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,978
with a gunshot that high in the thoracic

73
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:07,656
cavity, one would expect more

74
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,315
- blood loss.
- Meaning?

75
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:11,218
Meaning I'm not going
to say anything else

76
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,396
until I've examined
the body more closely.

77
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,956
The gurney, please, Mr. Palmer.

78
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:16,113
Right away, Doctor.

79
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,406
Good lad.

80
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:18,806
Good Marine.

81
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:21,045
<i>Sunni.</i>

82
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:23,892
- How do you know that?
- If he were a Shiite,

83
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,349
<i>he'd have a turba with him.</i>

84
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,873
Like Hadji on "Johnny Quest".

85
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,145
No, I believe that's a turban, Tony.

86
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,709
A turba is a small stone tablet

87
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:36,285
that the Shiites
set their forehead on while praying.

88
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,963
The devout develop a callus.

89
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,969
Ziva.

90
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:42,439
Checking for local Sunni mosques.

91
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:43,777
McGee.

92
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:46,835
Checking all security cameras. Got it.

93
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:49,777
There's a Sunni mosque two blocks east.

94
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:50,797
Show me.

95
00:05:58,498 --> 00:05:59,752
<i>She cannot come in here.</i>

96
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:01,754
Women are not allowed.

97
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:03,732
I will wait outside.

98
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:05,328
Federal agents.

99
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,764
She's with me.

100
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:12,315
She is welcome here.
As you are.

101
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:14,596
I'm sure you understand traditions.

102
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:16,420
We do not wish to offend anyone.

103
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,163
I am Jewish.

104
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,817
I do understand tradition.

105
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,812
You... wish to ask me questions?

106
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:25,737
No.

107
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:30,319
Then, you wish to speak to every man
who worships here under the age of 30.

108
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,345
No.

109
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:32,767
Then what?

110
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,572
We think this man
may have attended your mosque.

111
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:36,993
And what has he done?

112
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:39,024
Nothing. He is dead,

113
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:41,385
killed two blocks from here.

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,662
Do you know him?

115
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,526
<i>Stahf'Allah.</i>

116
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,048
This is my son.

117
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:03,468
<i>Your son have any enemies?</i>

118
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,540
Yes. Ignorance, intolerance, and hatred.

119
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:08,882
Any with a first name?

120
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,374
We would like your permission
to look at Abdul's things.

121
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,569
I'll need to tell the family
what has happened.

122
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,182
We will have someone drive you.

123
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,351
Thank you.

124
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,003
You wait here.

125
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:21,257
Please.

126
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:29,900
Come on.

127
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:32,515
Guy was with his son right before
he died. Suspect.

128
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,526
Victim.

129
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:35,804
<i>Abdul Mohammed Bakr,</i>

130
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,979
<i>age 23, Lance Corporal.</i>

131
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,862
Served in First FAST Company.

132
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,420
<i>Bronze Star and Purple
Heart for service in Iraq.</i>

133
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:44,474
Three tours, boss. He kept going back.

134
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,840
If he stayed, he might still be alive.

135
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,225
Hypothetically, Boss.

136
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,191
- What else?
- Had some run-ins with the law.

137
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,322
- Arrests?
- <i>Assault and battery, twice.</i>

138
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,477
Here in DC, both cases were dismissed.

139
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:59,349
Maybe they gave him favorable treatment
because he was serving in Iraq.

140
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,351
Find out.

141
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:02,127
Tracking down his personnel officer,
Boss.

142
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:03,159
- Cameras.
- <i>Yeah</i>

143
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:06,738
I tapped into Metro traffic cameras and
a few parking lot surveillance networks,

144
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:10,153
stitched together Abdul's route
from the alley back to the mosque.

145
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:12,755
<i>There's no sign of anything until...</i>

146
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,703
... here.

147
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,650
Can't get a reading on the man's face,
but he did go into the alley.

148
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,817
Back it up.

149
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,089
<i>Stop.</i>

150
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,505
<i>Tighter his hands.</i>

151
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:31,578
<i>He was carrying a phone.</i>

152
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:32,704
Forward.

153
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:35,250
<i>Stop.</i>

154
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:39,078
- Must have dumped it.
- McGee.

155
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:40,907
Already ran the phone records, Boss.

156
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:43,134
His cell didn't send or receive
any calls that day.

157
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,795
- Find it.
- <i>On it.</i>

158
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,174
Probie, you start the search near
the crime scene.

159
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:48,727
We'll meet you there later.

160
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:50,557
David, with me.

161
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:53,622
Captain's right down here.

162
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:55,876
I'm sorry, the correct answer is
"Full Metal Jacket".

163
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,754
That was not the best Marine movie.

164
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,114
"A Few Good Men" was.

165
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:02,108
Based on the fact that I'm right,
I'm overruling you.

166
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:04,414
If you're here to volunteer,

167
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:07,227
- we'll take you.
- I already have a job, Captain Mills.

168
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,624
NCIS.

169
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,660
We're here about a Marine.
Abdul Bakr.

170
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,171
You were his personnel officer.

171
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:15,075
Yeah,

172
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:17,660
First FAST Company. He's in Iraq.

173
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,090
No, he's in our morgue.

174
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,379
<i>He was murdered earlier today.</i>

175
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:24,078
God.

176
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:27,784
- He's such a good kid.
- Well, we know he had some troubles.

177
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,732
A few fights, he never started 'em.

178
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,733
We would like to see
his personnel records.

179
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,069
Sure, I'll...

180
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,440
I'll get you everything I got.

181
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:39,716
<i>You coach?</i>

182
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,110
Yeah, I'm a

183
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,339
parole officer in civilian life.

184
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:46,610
- <i>We have an after-school league.</i>
- Civilian life?

185
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,527
I'm a reservist,
recalled for active duty last year.

186
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,114
Manpower issues.

187
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,139
Iraq?

188
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:53,633
Iraq.

189
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:55,521
So, a parole officer
and a personnel officer,

190
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:57,197
that's kind of the same thing, isn't it?

191
00:09:57,543 --> 00:10:01,102
Yeah, the Marine Corps likes to place
reservists in similar lines of work.

192
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:02,639
Makes things run more efficiently.

193
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,211
So in your professional opinion,

194
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,170
you think Lance Corporal Bakr's
run-ins could have led to his murder?

195
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,480
<i>Maybe someone he
had a fight with came back?</i>

196
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:11,928
Nobody stayed mad at him.
He was a good kid

197
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:13,277
and a great Marine.

198
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:14,342
And a Muslim.

199
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,486
Yeah.

200
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:17,779
That's what the fights were about.

201
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:19,273
He stuck up for his people.

202
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,523
Hard to be a Muslim and a Marine.

203
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,020
Was he ever sympathetic
to un-American activities?

204
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:25,148
No way.

205
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:27,249
Not this kid.

206
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:31,365
Ducky.

207
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:35,150
Just a moment, Jethro. Is the needle
in his femoral artery, Mr. Palmer?

208
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:36,315
Yes, Doctor.

209
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:37,308
<i>Good.</i>

210
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:40,774
Never seen a gunshot victim
with so much blood left in his body.

211
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:42,621
Rare but not unheard of.

212
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:46,266
And if the bullet pierced his heart,
it would have stopped pumping instantly.

213
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:48,727
And of course the pressure
of the boards on his back

214
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:51,101
may have prevented gravitational loss.

215
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:53,112
Right, that should do it.

216
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:56,315
Take those up to Abby.
Get her to run the usual tox screen.

217
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:57,471
Right away.

218
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,270
Neatly done, Mr. Palmer.

219
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,594
Thank you, Doctor.

220
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,648
That young man will make a first class
medical examiner one of these days.

221
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:09,385
Today?

222
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:13,432
Yeah, well, until I open him up,
I can't say for sure.

223
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:17,121
But all indications are that
he was killed by the gunshot wound.

224
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:18,852
<i>There are no defensive wounds,</i>

225
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,017
no lacerations, no abrasions,
no contusions.

226
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:25,199
<i>And unless I find intradermal bruising,</i>

227
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:27,270
no signs of a struggle.

228
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:29,864
A Marine
with combat experience let someone

229
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,814
take his weapon away from
him without a fight?

230
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,851
Well, I only tell you
what the body tells me.

231
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:36,792
Ask different questions, Duck.

232
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:39,183
I will, Jethro. I assure you.

233
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:41,527
Yes, well, the first question is,

234
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,735
what damage did that

235
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:45,865
<i>bullet exactly do?</i>

236
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:47,004
<i>Ducky, wait...</i>

237
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:48,611
Need to talk to you.

238
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:50,718
Mr. Bakr has something to say.

239
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:03,757
Dr. Mallard, please don't cut into him.

240
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,476
I beg you to respect our religion.

241
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:09,221
So my son can find peace in heaven.

242
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,972
With all due respect, we have to.

243
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:13,621
I beg of you, please don't do this.

244
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,725
Sorry, there's no choice.

245
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,097
There is a choice, Jethro. Mine.

246
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:23,373
I can't do this autopsy.

247
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:36,377
So what are you saying exactly?

248
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:39,674
That we have an obligation
to honor faith as well as science,

249
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:42,487
and in this case,
the wishes of the family.

250
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,850
We cannot waive an autopsy
in the middle of a murder investigation.

251
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,683
- Why not?
- Because the laws are very specific.

252
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:50,245
We can try to accommodate

253
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,771
some aspect of tradition
or religious ceremony,

254
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:57,066
but we can't forfeit the most
critical aspect of the investigation.

255
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:00,258
Abdul Bakr was a Marine
who died as a hero.

256
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:02,786
That young man risked
his life for this country.

257
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:05,151
The least we can do
is to respect him in death.

258
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:07,764
He didn't die in Iraq, Ducky.

259
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,396
Well, but that's not the point!

260
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,840
What is the point, Duck?

261
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:12,943
This country was founded on freedom,

262
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,340
religious freedom.

263
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,987
That family came here to practice it,

264
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:19,685
and I can't ignore
a basic tenet of their beliefs:

265
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,575
that if I cut open the body,

266
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,738
that will prevent their son from
finding peace in heaven.

267
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:26,450
There is no greater sin.

268
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,689
What about murder?

269
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:31,905
We need to find a cause of death.

270
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,868
We need to find evidence.

271
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:36,344
You need to do the autopsy.

272
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,022
That's it.

273
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:40,407
All right, I'll do it.

274
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:43,348
Under protest.

275
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,697
I have another body to examine.

276
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:47,081
So this will have to wait.

277
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,984
Why?

278
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,029
I already told you why.

279
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,330
Why?

280
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,046
This case brings back
memories of a mass grave.

281
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,896
I was a volunteer medical examiner

282
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:03,067
for a UN task force in Bosnia in '93.

283
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:06,111
I did 44 autopsies in five days,

284
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,653
most of them children under 12,

285
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:10,324
all Muslims.

286
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:14,425
The village was targeted because
of who they were or who they weren't.

287
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:15,712
Nothing more.

288
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:18,592
Selected for their ethnicity.

289
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:23,665
The parents begged me
not to autopsy their children.

290
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,491
Begged me on their knees.

291
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:27,430
But I had no choice.

292
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,827
I suppose I still don't.

293
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,043
I'll give you my report when I'm done.

294
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,407
His phone's got to
be around here somewhere.

295
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:43,821
Waiting.

296
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:45,546
<i>"Juicy Fruit".</i>

297
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,211
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next".

298
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:48,229
Close enough.

299
00:14:48,745 --> 00:14:51,118
<i>"Hell, the fall will probably kill you."</i>

300
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:53,346
"Butch Cassidy and the Sunrise Kid".

301
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:55,334
Great scene. Jumping off the cliff.

302
00:15:01,713 --> 00:15:03,276
Did you try calling the cell?

303
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,972
Yeah. It's on silent mode,
or else I would have heard it.

304
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:15,317
Found it.

305
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,784
You scared the hell out of me.

306
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:22,230
- Sir.
- You lose something?

307
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:24,207
No, just escaped.

308
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:27,045
Gotcha.

309
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,042
Broken?

310
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,220
Does a baby change its own diapers?

311
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:33,151
Nay.

312
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,756
Does it burp and feed itself?

313
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:35,875
I don't think so.

314
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:39,337
It takes a lot of TLC
to keep my children happy and...

315
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:42,102
and fully functioning
in the lab of Abby, or

316
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,838
"Labby," as I like to call it.

317
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:45,800
You're my favorite.

318
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:47,946
Labby?

319
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,045
You want results,

320
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,582
you got 'em.

321
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,009
Yeah, I want 'em.

322
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:53,431
First. Fingerprints.

323
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:56,413
<i>There were a bajillion of them,
all on Lance Corporal's Koran,</i>

324
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:57,577
<i>his clothes,</i>

325
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:59,301
but none on his <i>misbaha</i>.

326
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:01,739
His what?

327
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:03,112
<i>Misbaha</i>.

328
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,646
Muslim prayer beads.

329
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:07,612
It's kind of like a rosary,
but different.

330
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:11,528
- And?
- I ran all the fingerprints

331
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:13,569
through AFIS, Interpol, the FBI.

332
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:15,718
<i>Several worshiped at the same mosque,</i>

333
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:18,328
but there's nothing to connect
any of them to this crime.

334
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:19,437
Right. Go on.

335
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,507
Abdul's prayer rug

336
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:24,826
and his boots tested positive
for phosphorus,

337
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:26,917
saltpeter, Semtex and C-4.

338
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,260
Explosives.

339
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,162
Yeah, which could mean one
of two things.

340
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,445
Give 'em both to me.

341
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:34,996
He was serving in Iraq with
FAST company a couple of weeks ago.

342
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:38,322
So if he was defusing
and handling IED's,

343
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:40,681
that would account
for the traces of explosives.

344
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:41,498
Or?

345
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:45,480
Or...
he was handling them once he got back.

346
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,070
That would not be good.

347
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:48,184
Terrorism.

348
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:50,074
I cloned and mirrored

349
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,530
Bakr's hard drive from his laptop.

350
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:56,029
He recently visited
three Jihadist websites.

351
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,959
It's training videos.

352
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,114
Suicide bomber's last statements.

353
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:01,760
Anti-American everything.

354
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:04,858
These sites are known hubs
for al Qaeda communication.

355
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:06,739
Lance Corporal Bakr visited these?

356
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,120
Well, either him or someone
that had access to his computer.

357
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,161
His father?

358
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:15,178
Good work.

359
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,828
<i>Back to your babies.</i>

360
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:21,372
Hey.

361
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:23,439
- Thought you checked phone records?
- I did.

362
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:26,283
Technically, Abdul never
placed a call or sent a text.

363
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:30,230
He did, however, press 11 keys,
before tossing his phone up on the roof.

364
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:31,674
He wanted us to find it.

365
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:32,549
Code.

366
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:34,800
Well, basic Marine letter substitution.

367
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:36,643
- <i>Crude but very effective</i>.
- <i>And?</i>

368
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,539
Well, he may have named his
killer, Boss.

369
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,248
<i>Hans Staiger.</i>

370
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,460
Suspected ties to al Qaeda in Germany.

371
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:43,761
Known as the "Recruiter".

372
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:46,994
Attempted to buy off several
customs officials in France last year.

373
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:48,000
Got away.

374
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,010
Where?

375
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:52,145
There's no record of Staiger coming
into this country or anywhere else.

376
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,696
He could be here with false papers.

377
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:54,989
Find him.

378
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:56,032
We looked.

379
00:17:56,081 --> 00:17:57,663
If he's here, he's way underground.

380
00:17:57,684 --> 00:17:58,701
Dig deeper.

381
00:17:58,914 --> 00:18:00,284
- Where?
- Mosque.

382
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:02,121
Bug it.
That's where this all started.

383
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:03,299
Getting a warrant.

384
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,683
Would be easier if Bakr
just sent us a text message.

385
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,568
Not if he thought someone was monitoring
or intercepting his cell transmissions.

386
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:11,450
Someone was following him, Tony.

387
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,407
"Three Days of the Condor"?

388
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,040
Based on the novel "Six Days
of the Condor" by James Grady.

389
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,667
Hey, I got one for you two.
Find out who killed my Marine.

390
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:22,900
Nobody likes a know-it-all.

391
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:24,049
Gibbs does.

392
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:25,619
Warrant just came through.

393
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,803
Anyone else have a problem with this?

394
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:33,451
Bugging a place of worship?

395
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,431
Check. One, two, three, four.

396
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:38,429
If this were a Catholic church
or a doctor's

397
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:40,034
office, we'd still be judge-hunting.

398
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:43,817
I agree. It should not be so
easy bugging a mosque.

399
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,652
Give it to me.
I'm going in.

400
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,443
You're a woman.
It'd be easier for me to blend in.

401
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:52,864
- Yes, you would blend right in.
- All right, then we'll flip for it.

402
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:54,819
If I flip you, you will get hurt.

403
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,276
You can take her, Probie.

404
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,895
Do it.

405
00:18:58,489 --> 00:18:59,550
<i>Compromise.</i>

406
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,941
Tony will do it.

407
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:02,761
I don't want to do it.

408
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:05,954
<i>That's impossible.</i>

409
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:07,451
We haven't even planted a bug yet.

410
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:09,740
There's a transmission
coming from inside the mosque.

411
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:11,422
It's already being bugged?

412
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,244
We tracked the signal back to the FBI

413
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,815
frequency, Mr. Langer.

414
00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:19,938
I checked
and no warrant was issued to the FBI.

415
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:22,008
I can't confirm

416
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,083
or deny if the mosque is under FBI
observation.

417
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:27,424
This is a murder investigation.

418
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:31,015
Some interagency cooperation
would be nice.

419
00:19:31,657 --> 00:19:32,854
Anything we should know?

420
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:35,258
Not that I can tell you.

421
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,873
That's crap.

422
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:40,453
We both know that you
can say anything you want to.

423
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:47,094
Did I come at a bad time?

424
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:49,949
Jethro.

425
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:53,285
- How are you?
- How'd they let you in here, newbie?

426
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:57,584
<i>Man, it's been a long time.</i>

427
00:19:58,174 --> 00:20:00,787
You two know each other. How nice.

428
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:02,529
Taught him everything he's forgotten.

429
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:04,877
I thought you retired.

430
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:05,957
I tried.

431
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:08,433
You look good, old man.

432
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,187
<i>Hey, listen, sorry about our</i>

433
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:12,528
inconvenient convergence here.

434
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,589
Our what?

435
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:18,338
Gibbs used to fine me for
every three-dollar word I used.

436
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,999
How much?

437
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,754
- Three dollars a word.
- You owe me six.

438
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:24,776
See.

439
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:27,432
Marines.

440
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:30,380
No, actually, I started here.

441
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:32,044
Gibbs took me under his wing

442
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,115
and then proceed to crush me.

443
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:35,759
Nothing you didn't deserve.

444
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:38,121
Left me no choice but
to crawl over to the FBI.

445
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,644
Yeah, and they actually hired you.

446
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,011
Yeah, can you believe that?

447
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:45,963
Well, now maybe the NCIS and the FBI

448
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,957
can cooperate on this investigation?

449
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:50,761
We may be observing the mosque.

450
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:53,185
Well, that's a little vague.

451
00:20:53,421 --> 00:20:55,871
I can't tell you any more than that,
Jethro. You know that.

452
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:57,672
Okay.

453
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:00,546
Well, I hope we don't
get in each other's way.

454
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:05,646
Well, now if you guys
find anything out then...

455
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:07,048
You'll be the last to know.

456
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:10,060
Hey, come on.

457
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:11,788
<i>Excuse me, Director.</i>

458
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:14,763
Jethro, I think I have it.

459
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Have what?

460
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:18,904
A way to find the cause
of Lance Corporal Bakr's death.

461
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,405
You're going to do that autopsy?

462
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:23,319
No. Well, yes.
Well, in, in a manner of speaking.

463
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:26,569
But a lot of people are going
to have to look the other way.

464
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,228
Starting with you, Director.

465
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:41,262
Lost?

466
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:44,004
Actually, I was looking for Agent Gibbs.
He was just...

467
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:45,625
<i>just...</i>

468
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,524
upstairs a minute ago.

469
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:52,760
Can I help you?

470
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,441
Yeah. You...

471
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:57,269
Maybe you could give him
my card and ask him to call me.

472
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:02,612
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
I'm in charge here.

473
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:06,403
Well, hey, I'm Special Agent
Brent Langer FBI. You know that's weird.

474
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:09,047
I could've sworn that Agent
Gibbs said he was in charge.

475
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,462
He is.

476
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,444
<i>Well, yeah,</i>

477
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,476
he's in charge when he's here, but when
he's not here, I'm in charge.

478
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:17,487
I'm in charge.

479
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:20,191
Well, I'll just call him later.

480
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:21,092
But

481
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,558
thanks anyway.

482
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,862
What an ass.

483
00:22:27,863 --> 00:22:29,484
Yes, indeed.

484
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,492
You're Langer-leering.
You're leering at Langer.

485
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:33,913
What if I am, Tony?

486
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,992
He's cute.

487
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:40,363
- "Cute". He's not cute. He's like...
- Don't speak.

488
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:42,785
"Bullets Over Broadway".

489
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,942
Woody Allen.

490
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:45,265
Very good.

491
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:47,020
You'd get a "B" in my class.

492
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:49,025
- I could teach your class.
- Yeah, right.

493
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:52,820
Officer David.

494
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:55,405
<i>I'm going to need you to come
down to the evidence garage,</i>

495
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:57,622
and I need you to
bring someone with you.

496
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:02,114
The key here, Jethro, is discretion.

497
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:06,407
We're not going through
official channels, Mr. Palmer.

498
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:10,068
Official channels take time.
That's the one thing we don't have.

499
00:23:10,126 --> 00:23:11,710
Muslims desire their

500
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,765
dead to be buried within 24 hours.

501
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:17,305
That leaves us 13.

502
00:23:21,978 --> 00:23:23,713
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

503
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:25,871
You have 20 minutes.

504
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:29,396
A minute longer, you'll get
found out and I'll get fired. Clear?

505
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:31,310
How do I repay you?

506
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:33,053
I just repaid you.

507
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,702
We're even now.

508
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,906
Something wrong, Mr. Palmer?

509
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:56,597
If this weren't a Muslim family,
we wouldn't be here.

510
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,793
That is correct.

511
00:23:57,794 --> 00:23:59,832
I don't think anyone should
get special treatment.

512
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,515
We're risking our careers by doing this.

513
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:03,020
You can always leave.

514
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:06,082
- Doctor, I wasn't with you in Bosnia.
- True.

515
00:24:06,384 --> 00:24:08,564
And I certainly wasn't on the Crusades.

516
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,044
But 9/11.

517
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:11,770
The Intifada. Hamas.

518
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,994
You have a problem with Muslims,
Mr. Palmer?

519
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,102
No. No, I do not.

520
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:18,775
But it seems like they
have a problem with us.

521
00:24:18,853 --> 00:24:22,499
Religions have been the
basis of conflict for generations.

522
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:27,579
- So we just live with this?
- Until we learn to respect one another.

523
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:40,185
<i>All right, Mr. Palmer,
let's follow the path of the bullet.</i>

524
00:24:42,637 --> 00:24:44,307
<i>The resolution's astonishing.</i>

525
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:46,689
Yes, and magnification...

526
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,570
You can actually almost see
as well as a traditional autopsy.

527
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,927
Angle of the trajectory indicates

528
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:56,789
<i>the bullet traveled through the first
intercostal space avoiding</i>

529
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,185
<i>the heart and bronchial
branch of the lungs.</i>

530
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:00,706
<i>Missed all vital organs.</i>

531
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:03,950
<i>Went to the third intercostal space and</i>

532
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:05,631
exited the back.

533
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:07,328
Hold your horses.

534
00:25:07,678 --> 00:25:10,132
There seems to be a bullet fragment

535
00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:11,972
chipped off the eighth rib

536
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:13,683
and then disappeared.

537
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:15,471
<i>There's no other exit wounds.</i>

538
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,066
<i>Is the fragment still in his body?</i>

539
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:18,758
Density's becoming an issue.

540
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,942
We're seeing too much bone
and not enough soft tissue.

541
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:23,536
MRI?

542
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,050
Excellent idea.

543
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:38,915
Tea?

544
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:41,369
You shouldn't have, but thank you.

545
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:45,074
Well, if you change your mind.

546
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:48,025
You're an Israeli Jew, no?

547
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:50,004
Yes.

548
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:52,075
I used to take my family to Haifa.

549
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:54,892
I spent my summers in Haifa.

550
00:25:57,414 --> 00:25:58,902
<i>No, just push it to one side.</i>

551
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:00,441
You make it Arab style?

552
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,253
Strong.

553
00:26:06,053 --> 00:26:07,133
I like strong.

554
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,381
You like Muslims?

555
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:12,223
Yes.

556
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:14,028
May I ask why?

557
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:16,560
I mean, I don't wish to offend you.

558
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,994
I'm just curious.

559
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:21,960
When you grow up in Israel,

560
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:23,793
most of your neighbors are Muslim.

561
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:25,848
My best friend was Muslim Arab.

562
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,201
He was a young boy.

563
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,322
We were very close.

564
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,527
Are you still close?

565
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:33,286
No.

566
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,591
He was killed when I was 12.

567
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:37,790
By an Israeli missile strike

568
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,361
on a hotel.

569
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:42,576
There has been too much death.

570
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:45,959
I agree.

571
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:55,009
Come on now.

572
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,738
Show us this bullet fragment.

573
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:00,363
What is it, Mr. Palmer?

574
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,134
It's moving.

575
00:27:02,503 --> 00:27:03,507
<i>His neck.</i>

576
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:05,767
<i>Is that a bullet fragment?</i>

577
00:27:05,864 --> 00:27:07,162
No, bullets are lead.

578
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,886
They're non-magnetic.

579
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,063
Turn off the power.

580
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:21,831
What is it?

581
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:23,577
This, my dear Officer David,

582
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:25,372
is what you call

583
00:27:25,903 --> 00:27:28,427
an unexpected turn of events.

584
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:34,436
Abby.

585
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,564
Yay! It worked.

586
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,373
- What?
- My Gibbs early warning alarm system.

587
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:41,676
<i>The Arabs used to put dried brush
outside their tents</i>

588
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:43,558
to alert them in case
there was an intruder.

589
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:45,389
So I just updated it to bubble wrap.

590
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:46,988
<i>You called me.</i>

591
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,971
I know. It was a test.

592
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,444
<i>You want to know what I found.</i>

593
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:52,641
Trippy.

594
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:54,719
I like it.

595
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:58,957
I was able to extract an undiluted
sample from inside the needle shaft.

596
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:02,863
And <i>voilà</i>,
I give you the blue-ringed octopus.

597
00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:04,156
A what?

598
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:08,873
It produces a toxin that's a hundred
times more deadly than cobra venom.

599
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:11,750
It's the most deadly natural neurotoxin

600
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:14,825
on the planet, and it's impossible
to trace in the bloodstream.

601
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,323
You did.

602
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:18,185
Well, because it wasn't
in the bloodstream.

603
00:28:18,204 --> 00:28:20,288
It was still inside the needle
shaft Ducky found,

604
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:21,861
perfectly preserved and pure.

605
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:23,238
He walked a long way.

606
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:25,418
Because the needle snapped
off during insertion.

607
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:27,490
It was a result of oxidation and age,

608
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,749
so that resulted in metal fatigue.

609
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:31,801
Lance Corporal Bakr,

610
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:33,201
he only got a partial dose.

611
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,891
That's why he could walk for two blocks.

612
00:28:34,906 --> 00:28:36,787
- Yeah, but it killed him.
- Yeah...

613
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:38,392
or the bullet.

614
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:39,707
I mean, it's hard to say.

615
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,221
I'm running the toxicology now.

616
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:43,849
Aren't you gonna ask me?

617
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:45,526
What?

618
00:28:45,644 --> 00:28:48,370
Why the needle was
affected by magnetic force.

619
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:50,582
I mean, they make
these out of 440 carbon.

620
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,739
It's a non-magnetic steel.

621
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:53,587
Why?

622
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,874
Because...
the needle was really old.

623
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:58,055
It was, like,

624
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,888
from the '70s.

625
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:03,837
Not that that's...

626
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:05,521
That's not old.

627
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:08,189
I mean, well, it's old for a needle,

628
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,393
sure, but it's certainly

629
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:10,860
not old for,

630
00:29:11,137 --> 00:29:13,329
you know, a man.

631
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,758
Where?

632
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,191
There's two companies in the
United States that handle the toxin.

633
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,399
They use it for research on antivenoms.

634
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,588
- They're both in the DC area.
- Names?

635
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:28,228
- Morgan Industries and Bio-Tonics.
- Have an e-mail sent...

636
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:30,333
I already e-mailed it to McGee and Tony.

637
00:29:30,883 --> 00:29:31,962
You're my favorite.

638
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:33,647
<i>Abs...</i>

639
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:35,501
Lose the bubble wrap.

640
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:39,681
Go, McGoo.

641
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,365
<i>Morgan Industries is clean.</i>

642
00:29:41,517 --> 00:29:43,948
Got it.
Probie's over at Morgan Industries.

643
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:45,977
They show no missing venom.

644
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:47,760
Can I help you?

645
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:50,114
Yes, we need to check your records.

646
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,417
<i>You see?
Every drop accounted for.</i>

647
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:56,890
- <i>There's none missing from inventory.</i>
- Check again.

648
00:29:57,991 --> 00:30:00,576
I've checked four times.
I'm telling you, we watch this stuff.

649
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:03,313
Here you go.

650
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,393
Okay.

651
00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:05,625
"Paycheck".

652
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,065
- Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman?
- That's right.

653
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:09,606
Ben plays the bad guy,

654
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:12,410
does dirty work for this company
and then they erase his memory.

655
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:15,530
Beats the bad guys by
mailing clues to himself.

656
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,990
We are going to need all
your shipping manifests.

657
00:30:18,313 --> 00:30:19,336
<i>Originals.</i>

658
00:30:19,682 --> 00:30:22,305
Everything that's been sent
out of here in the last six months.

659
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:25,023
McGee can go back and do
the same at Morgan Industries.

660
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:26,978
That's a lot of inventory to check.

661
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,578
We got time.

662
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:29,882
Okay.

663
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:31,529
Hey!

664
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:33,865
Where are you going, Jackrabbit?

665
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:36,434
I'm going to paradise.

666
00:30:36,492 --> 00:30:38,352
- Where are you going?
- To the parking lot.

667
00:30:38,412 --> 00:30:40,129
Put your butt in the back of our car.

668
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,614
Go.

669
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:48,297
Hacked into Bio-Tonics
worldwide tracking software.

670
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:52,056
We followed a shipment of the neurotoxin
from Bio-Tonics to Stanford University,

671
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:54,145
except the university
never received the shipment.

672
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,209
But as you can see,
Bio-Tonics tracking shows

673
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:58,281
that the venom was ordered
and delivered.

674
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:00,721
- Who signed for it?
- Nobody. It never got there.

675
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:04,059
It turns out that the university
never even ordered the neurotoxin,

676
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:06,519
so there was nothing
missing from the warehouse.

677
00:31:06,591 --> 00:31:08,630
Enabling them to walk
out the front door with it.

678
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:10,351
- Who?
- <i>Ryan Sikes, shipping clerk.</i>

679
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:11,611
<i>Thinks he's a jackrabbit.</i>

680
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:13,077
And an ex-con.

681
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,590
<i>Did time for armed robbery,</i>

682
00:31:14,658 --> 00:31:16,912
<i>computer crimes, other assorted tidbits.</i>

683
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,011
In prison, he converted to Islam.

684
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:20,559
- Get him.
- Got him.

685
00:31:20,732 --> 00:31:21,562
Good.

686
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,659
There is only one God and He is great.

687
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:29,233
That's good to know.

688
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:31,139
Why'd you kill Corporal Bakr?

689
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:34,911
Why has this country killed
a hundred thousand Iraqi civilians

690
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:37,105
and 30,000 sick children

691
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:38,813
after they invaded the first time?

692
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:40,883
Corporal Bakr was a Muslim.

693
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:42,468
<i>You're a Muslim.</i>

694
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:44,337
Killing him, that's a sin.

695
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,868
How many civilians
have the Marines killed

696
00:31:47,226 --> 00:31:48,535
on Muslim soil?

697
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,096
I'm talking about a
Marine on American soil.

698
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:53,934
<i>Ryan.</i>

699
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:57,118
Ryan is my slave name.

700
00:31:58,065 --> 00:32:00,226
My real name is Akbur

701
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:01,750
Mohammed.

702
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:02,810
Your slave name?

703
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:03,736
<i>Yes.</i>

704
00:32:04,032 --> 00:32:05,344
You want a statement?

705
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,816
Death

706
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:08,571
to America.

707
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:09,997
<i>You want a confession?</i>

708
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:11,683
I did it.

709
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:13,538
I killed that turncoat bastard.

710
00:32:13,553 --> 00:32:15,105
He turned against his own people...

711
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,251
Hey, what are you...?!

712
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:19,992
He didn't even look.

713
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,379
Gibbs doesn't need to.

714
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:24,096
Get in here!

715
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:30,764
Were you gonna tell me about this?

716
00:32:30,802 --> 00:32:32,895
The ankle bracelet was
a condition of his parole.

717
00:32:33,007 --> 00:32:35,583
<i>We have requested the tracking
records from the parole office.</i>

718
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:38,420
Be able to put him in the alley
at exactly the time Abdul was killed.

719
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:39,876
I already confessed.

720
00:32:40,031 --> 00:32:41,188
Now, I killed him.

721
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:42,736
Boss?

722
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:44,029
<i>Bad news.</i>

723
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,213
Just got the tracking records back.

724
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:48,450
GPS records show that Sikes was

725
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:51,137
20 miles away from the crime scene
at the time of the murder.

726
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:54,832
He's got an airtight alibi,
the US government.

727
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:05,352
Waiting on you, newbie.

728
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,221
Are you still working on this damn boat?

729
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,787
Finished it twice.

730
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:13,367
This is number three.

731
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:15,688
And still drinking the same beer.

732
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,353
So, yes,

733
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:21,621
we think the mosque is a recruitment
center for al Qaeda.

734
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,410
The cell in DC?

735
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:25,493
No.

736
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,230
Al Qaeda's changed their business model.

737
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:29,321
We think they're paying people now,
cash,

738
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:32,172
to Muslims and non-Muslims, US citizens.

739
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:33,789
Capitalist jihad.

740
00:33:33,904 --> 00:33:34,838
<i>Smart.</i>

741
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:36,344
More like dangerous.

742
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:39,377
We're pretty good at monitoring
radicalized citizens, but, now,

743
00:33:39,532 --> 00:33:42,381
anyone with a need or greed might
be playing on their team, who knows.

744
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,404
- You think our murder is connected?
- <i>Possible.</i>

745
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:47,271
The dead Marine's father,
he's on our watch list.

746
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,267
Why?

747
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:56,492
Everything we've got is on this,
and it's not much.

748
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,142
To be perfectly honest with you,
I'm not even sure why we're

749
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:01,118
investigating.
Homeland is working on something,

750
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,680
but it's so compartmentalized,
no one's sharing.

751
00:34:03,757 --> 00:34:05,011
<i>MP3 files.</i>

752
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,677
Last six months of recordings
from inside the mosque.

753
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:11,029
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me. I was never here.

754
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:15,436
You ever consider using power tools?

755
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,780
You are still a pain in the ass.

756
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:20,983
I learned from the best.

757
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,799
Catch you later, Boss.

758
00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:37,132
Khalid is asking for some money
to be made as a donation to the mosque.

759
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:49,984
This other man is speaking Arabic,
but it is not his first language.

760
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:51,533
Think he could be German.

761
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,584
What's he saying?

762
00:34:52,728 --> 00:34:55,720
Khalid is accepting cash
paid through an offshore account.

763
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,986
Running the voices through Interpol,
FBI and databases.

764
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:02,742
Start with Hans Staiger.

765
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:08,682
Positive ID, boss, it's Staiger.

766
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:12,102
Suspected al Qaeda recruiter.
Wanted in four countries.

767
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,472
No face, no prints,

768
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:15,986
just calls intercepted
over the last year.

769
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:19,302
We don't know who he is,
just that he is.

770
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:21,411
And that he's talking to Khalid.

771
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:57,716
You're okay?

772
00:35:58,596 --> 00:35:59,596
Yeah, I'm fine.

773
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,095
The funeral home is sending a car.

774
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,670
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.

775
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:09,221
Your son was a great credit
to his country and his culture.

776
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:13,843
Jethro, he family has requested
his personal effects to be returned.

777
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,656
Anything you want to tell me?

778
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:25,984
About?

779
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:28,146
Anything.

780
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:32,459
- Why do you hate us?
- I don't.

781
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:33,887
Your people do.

782
00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:38,219
All we ask for, is to live in peace
and observe our beliefs.

783
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:41,082
I think you are.

784
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:44,280
Islam came to your country
with hostility in 2001,

785
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:45,672
and that was wrong.

786
00:36:46,815 --> 00:36:50,673
But you came to our land 500 years ago
and you've never left.

787
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:55,516
All we wish for, is to be left alone
to practice our ways,

788
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,809
and yet you cannot leave us alone.

789
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,470
Why?

790
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:02,780
Why did the recruiter kill your son,
because he said "no"

791
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,217
or because he said "yes"?

792
00:37:06,987 --> 00:37:07,987
There is a man.

793
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,782
- A German.
- Hans Staiger.

794
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:11,880
He recruits for al Qaeda.

795
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,394
This recruiter approached my son.

796
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:17,788
Abdul was gathering information
for the authorities.

797
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,229
A spy for his government.

798
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:22,531
I called the FBI.

799
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,782
I called them to investigate
my own mosque.

800
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:27,932
I killed my own son.

801
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:29,893
No, you didn't.

802
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:31,865
But until we find who did,

803
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:34,712
we need to keep his body
a little longer.

804
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:37,262
Find this recruiter

805
00:37:38,477 --> 00:37:40,522
and allow me to have my vengeance.

806
00:37:41,714 --> 00:37:42,714
<i>Please.</i>

807
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:45,796
He's mine.

808
00:37:52,155 --> 00:37:53,364
The body stays, Duck.

809
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,850
I already released the body.

810
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:56,423
Well, un-release it.

811
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,305
I determined a cause of death.

812
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:01,727
The poison may have weakened his system,

813
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,589
but it was the gunshot that killed him.

814
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:06,418
The body stays.

815
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:09,010
Until we find our killer.

816
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:21,267
- I have killed for less.
- You cheated.

817
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:22,558
- Did not.
- Yes, you did.

818
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:24,154
That is a book of movies.

819
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:26,932
I bet you never saw all those movies,
you just read the book.

820
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,858
- I like books.
- I like movies.

821
00:38:28,924 --> 00:38:30,697
Don't quote books,
I will not quote movies.

822
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:32,860
What if it's a book
that's been made into a movie?

823
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:34,007
<i>Patterns.</i>

824
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:36,869
George C. Scott, 1970,
won seven Academy Awards,

825
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:38,750
- including Best Picture, boss.
- <i>Patterns.</i>

826
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:40,388
Patterns, not "Patton".

827
00:38:41,063 --> 00:38:42,063
Patterns?

828
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:44,153
If this is al Qaeda,
that means activity.

829
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:46,022
Activity means patterns.

830
00:38:46,111 --> 00:38:47,472
Dead Marines who are Muslims.

831
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:48,842
Checking.

832
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,215
<i>That's all we've got, two of them.</i>

833
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:54,140
A Shiite Muslim stationed at Camp David.

834
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:56,436
Died of unknown causes two weeks ago.

835
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:59,257
Sergeant Major out of Norfolk,
Sunni, died last week.

836
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:00,799
Both were stationed in Iraq,

837
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:02,405
both had run-ins with the law.

838
00:39:02,522 --> 00:39:05,476
- Both died of natural causes.
- They have something else in common.

839
00:39:06,362 --> 00:39:07,802
- What?
- They're both dead.

840
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:09,377
No. Something else.

841
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:11,431
- What?
- What?

842
00:39:14,066 --> 00:39:15,539
Same personnel officer.

843
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:19,499
Look,

844
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:20,855
I'm a patriot.

845
00:39:21,368 --> 00:39:23,132
I'm a volunteer reservist.

846
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:25,972
With money problems.

847
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:29,156
You're divorcing your wife,
claimed you were broke in court,

848
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:31,947
you oversee a lot of drug addicts,
access to needles,

849
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,811
access to Brian Sikes.

850
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:37,033
Which gave you access to the toxins
used to kill three Marines.

851
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:40,577
We found $270,000 in your shed.

852
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:42,503
I guess your money problems are over.

853
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:44,674
What exactly are you charging me with?

854
00:39:44,855 --> 00:39:48,017
A German named Hans Staiger
was paying you

855
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:51,979
to help recruit troubled Muslim Marines
to serve for the other side.

856
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:54,417
Two of them obviously refused
and are now dead.

857
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:56,690
I'm a parole officer,

858
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:58,639
I know how the system works.
Lawyer...

859
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:02,450
- right now.
- You killed a Marine yesterday.

860
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:05,538
- Shot him with his own gun.
- Why would I do that?

861
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,032
To make sure he was dead.

862
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:12,034
"Natural causes" didn't work as well
for him as it did for the other two,

863
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:13,693
so you followed him and you shot him.

864
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:16,844
Lawyer.

865
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:19,214
Boss. Sorry.

866
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:20,991
Ducky needs you.
Now.

867
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:22,222
Sorry.

868
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:24,662
Sorry.

869
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:27,076
I was wrong.

870
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,995
- About what?
- The gunshot.

871
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:32,930
Abby's toxicology report.

872
00:40:33,254 --> 00:40:35,043
Abdul was dead before he was shot.

873
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,228
Some of the poison did get
into his system.

874
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:39,799
If your personnel officer
did shoot him,

875
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,188
he didn't kill him.

876
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:45,162
The most you could legally prove
is that he desecrated a body.

877
00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:48,331
If we don't have him for murder,
he'll never give up the recruiter.

878
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,324
We just matched the slug
from Abdul's body to your gun,

879
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,820
not his.

880
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:09,355
- That's impossible.
- Yeah.

881
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,722
And a good lawyer could prove that,
but you're not getting a lawyer.

882
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:13,957
You're getting a transfer

883
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:16,426
<i>to a Naval base in Cuba.</i>

884
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,179
It's called Gitmo.

885
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:19,557
Ever heard of it?

886
00:41:21,802 --> 00:41:22,939
Case closed.

887
00:41:28,472 --> 00:41:29,752
I can give you Staiger.

888
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,243
He's the one
who injected Corporal Bakr,

889
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:36,655
and the other two Marines
when they wouldn't cooperate.

890
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:41,067
He said it'd be quick. The needle broke,
so he followed him from the mosque,

891
00:41:41,652 --> 00:41:42,652
he shot him.

892
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,854
You just happened to be there?

893
00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:46,367
I was the go-between.

894
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,823
You want more?

895
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:49,573
I want a civilian case,

896
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:51,342
filed with the DA's Office,

897
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:54,436
with the guarantee that
I won't be prosecuted for terrorism.

898
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:56,683
Deal.

899
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:58,998
Staiger.

900
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,553
Bedford Hotel.

901
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:03,547
Room 126.

902
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,676
These belong to Abdul.

903
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:23,506
They were returned to his father.

904
00:42:24,102 --> 00:42:25,102
Are you sure?

905
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,510
Gibbs, I...

906
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,383
No, nothing like them.

907
00:42:35,523 --> 00:42:36,545
I didn't think so.
