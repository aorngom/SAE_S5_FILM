00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,776
- Where we going with this?
- Right over here.

4
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,764
Turn around,
turn around, turn around.

5
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:42,935
What is that?

6
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:47,440
- It's a Christmas tree.
- You're joking.

7
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,834
Douglas-fir, Scotch pine,

8
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:54,822
Bruce Spruce...
these are Christmas trees.

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,533
This is LA, Hetty.
Wait till you see the menorah.

10
00:01:58,224 --> 00:02:01,013
I am so alone.

11
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,841
Mr. GQ. What's up
with the big boy clothes?

12
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:09,587
Somebody's got a hot date?

13
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,964
- Mommy in town for the holidays?
- No, thank goodness.

14
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,883
- Job interview?
- You're leaving us?

15
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,179
- Who's leaving us?
- Nate's got a job interview.

16
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,560
- Where?
- Nowhere. I don't have a job interview.

17
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:22,189
I just thought
that I would dress it up today.

18
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,852
- You backed into Hetty's Jag.
- Again.

19
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,896
Don't even kid about that.

20
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,778
Personally,
I think you look fantastic.

21
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:35,696
God, I love men in suits.

22
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:37,640
- And uniforms.
- And costumes.

23
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,242
When did I date anybody
who wore a costume?

24
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,634
What about the pirate guy?

25
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:43,653
Didn't he make you wear
a milkmaid outfit?

26
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:45,914
That was for a Renaissance fair,
and I was a wench.

27
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:47,458
So much better.

28
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,580
That shirt is wrong
on so many levels.

29
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,415
- Thank you.
- What's up, ladies?

00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,405
ATM footage
from the bank in Westwood.

31
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:58,714
Asher Ross was withdrawing
a hundred dollars

32
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:01,867
from his checking account
07 a.m. last Thursday

33
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,712
when he got a cell phone call.

34
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,425
It was his last.

35
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,436
He was killed by what appears
to be some sort of

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,783
explosive device
planted in his phone.

37
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:12,691
Now, Ross was no stranger
to explosives.

38
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:16,341
He's a former Staff Sergeant
with a Marine EOD unit...

39
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:18,531
Explosive Ordinance Disposal.

40
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,783
Six months ago,
he was part of a convoy

41
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,661
hit by a roadside bomb in Fallujah.

42
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:27,397
Three Marines were killed,
several others were severely injured.

43
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,374
Ross was given a medical discharge

44
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,294
because he lost the hearing
in one of his ears.

45
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:34,130
Phone records. Find out
where the trigger call originated.

46
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,335
Dom, forensics on Ross' phone
and personal belongings.

47
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,468
We'll check out the ATM
where he was killed.

48
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,849
We might be able to get some footage

49
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,893
from across the street at the store.
Maybe even a traffic cam.

50
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,564
- Anything?
- Ross got a coffee and a muffin,

51
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,555
then stopped to buy
the L.A. Times before hitting the ATM.

52
00:03:54,597 --> 00:03:56,527
- What kind of muffin?
- Seriously?

53
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:00,239
You can tell a lot about a person
by their choice of breakfast pastries.

54
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:03,200
Take Sam, for instance.
Spicy Cinnamon.

55
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:05,546
Ignore him.

56
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,830
If Santa was working
the day of the bombing,

57
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,725
- he might have seen something.
- Maybe our guy's on his naughty list.

58
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:13,325
Wait, hold on.
I checked already. There's nothing.

59
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:15,629
What do you got?

60
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,924
<i>The call that triggered
the bomb in Ross' cell phone</i>

61
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,937
originated in the same cell site.

62
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,073
Which means that the caller was within
<i>half a mile or so of the explosion.</i>

63
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:26,599
Could have been closer than that.
He might have been watching.

64
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,185
Killer could have got a prepaid
phone to make the trigger call.

65
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,591
I already traced it.
It's a dead end.

66
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:35,024
The killer used a prepaid cell phone,
placed the call, then threw it away.

67
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:38,986
- There's no way to track it.
- Is the trigger phone still in service?

68
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:40,988
It doesn't appear to be.

69
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,948
Probably turned it off
before he tossed it.

70
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:45,534
You can remotely
reactivate it, right?

71
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:46,744
Do it.

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,142
So I'll try to find the cell phone,
see if we can pull some prints,

73
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:51,958
track it back to
where he purchased it.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,703
We'll go check out Ross' house.

75
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,517
The most obvious suspect is going to be
someone in Ross' bomb disposal unit.

76
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:06,249
But we cannot forget that he also
studied chemical engineering.

77
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:08,894
So what, one of his fellow
students had a beef with him,

78
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:10,977
he cooked up explosive
and wired his phone?

79
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,972
I think that Eric needs
to do a background check

80
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:14,689
on everyone in his classes
just in case.

81
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,113
You'll have to excuse the mess.

82
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:22,783
My wife was supposed
to help me pack up his things.

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,228
Asher was our only son.

84
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:28,160
She's just not ready yet.

85
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:30,861
We're very sorry for your loss, sir.

86
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,067
There may be some evidence
in your son's belongings

87
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:37,592
that could help our investigation.

88
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:39,466
The police already went
through everything.

89
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,644
Nothing here
that will bring him back.

90
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:47,721
Any idea who may have wanted
to hurt your son?

91
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:51,782
I'd like to say my son didn't have
any enemies, but...

92
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,770
I wasn't close enough
to him to know.

93
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,697
You had a falling out?

94
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,031
Just working a lot.

95
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,529
Trying to make sure
my family was taking care of.

96
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,574
One day
you're missing Little League,

97
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:09,910
next thing you know,
they're moving out.

98
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,548
And all that time in between...

99
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:15,708
it's just lost.

100
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,386
Did Asher ever talk to you about...

101
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:23,443
his time in the Marines or school?

102
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:26,943
The last time we talked...

103
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,296
argued...

104
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:31,952
it was about money.

105
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:36,324
He'd lent a lot of his savings to...

106
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:38,839
a Marine buddy
and he wasn't paying him back.

107
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,206
Do you have a name?

108
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,859
King.

109
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,739
Don't ask me first,
last nickname. I just...

110
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,773
know they were together in Iraq.

111
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,582
Ever since Asher was little
he wanted to be a Marine.

112
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:03,365
I just wish...

113
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,466
he could be eight again.

114
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:10,763
We could start over.

115
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,656
I just reactivated the phone
that called Asher Ross.

116
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:20,105
I'm sending its GPS signal
to your phone.

117
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,108
Should be accurate
to within a couple meters.

118
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:23,791
<i>See anything?</i>

119
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,737
Got an alley, lots of garbage,
a couple of dumpsters.

120
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:30,074
- He probably tossed it in one of them.
- Call the cell phone.

121
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:33,911
- What if it's booby-trapped, too?
- Just do it, Eric.

122
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:51,743
It's ringing.

123
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,147
Sam, are you all right?

124
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,733
It's restaurant garbage.
It's full of maggots.

125
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,168
I hate maggots!

126
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,015
Don't think of them as the "M" word.

127
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:11,240
Think of them
as the larval form of flies.

128
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,535
Sterile versions are used
in medical procedures

129
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,874
as a form of wound debridement.
<i>The larva eat...</i>

130
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,791
- Goodbye, Eric.
- Hello?

131
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:35,725
This is worth it.

132
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:40,933
Run a search on a guy named King.
He served with Asher Ross.

133
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:41,937
<i>I'm on it.</i>

134
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,224
All right, I got a Hastings King,
also a member of Ross' EOD unit.

135
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:49,444
He was severely injured
in the same convoy attack in Fallujah.

136
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,654
You got an address?

137
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,532
Just off Colorado Avenue.

138
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:55,534
Not too far from Sam.

139
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:58,245
Call Sam, have him check out King.
We're headed back.

140
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,246
<i>I'm on it.</i>

141
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:12,509
Hey, Mr. King?

142
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:15,220
We're closed. Get lost.

143
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,891
Your customer service needs
some work. I'm NCIS.

144
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,392
Asher Ross is dead.

145
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,728
Show me your hands
and come out before I pull you out.

146
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,854
Seriously, you need to get lost now.

147
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:27,983
I got a little problem here.

148
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:32,757
Yes, you have.

149
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:47,328
I called LAPD.
Bomb squad's on the way.

150
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,438
Great. Last thing I need is
some civilian blowing up my garage.

151
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:53,300
The bomb's probably wired
into the car's ignition.

152
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,525
See anything on the battery?

153
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,112
But it looks like
she's tied into the starter.

154
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:17,354
There's something like a cell phone
wrapped in electrical tape.

155
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:19,534
Must be a secondary device.

156
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:21,036
Impressive.

157
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,800
You're lucky I stopped by, King.

158
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:25,008
This is a two-man job.

159
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:27,376
Green wire on three?

160
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,380
- Yellow one for me.
- Tricky.

161
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,715
Switched the color
just to be difficult.

162
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:36,426
On three?

163
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:37,469
Go for it.

164
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:38,929
One...

165
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:41,668
two...

166
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:44,079
three.

167
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:55,696
Bet you didn't wake up this morning
thinking you might get blown to hell.

168
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,197
Can't say I did.

169
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:03,078
- How did you find it?
- It was luck.

170
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:04,950
I knew I had a tranny leak,

171
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,912
so I rolled underneath
to take a look...

172
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:11,086
and there she was.

173
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,388
Still getting used to the leg.

174
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:23,766
Glad it didn't slow you down
in the business.

175
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:26,226
Wall Street took care of that.

176
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:29,688
Is that why you didn't pay Ross
back the money he lent you?

177
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:33,734
That's why you're here?

178
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,530
You think I killed Ross
so I didn't have to pay him back?

179
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,365
Just covering all the angles.

180
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,617
- Where were you last Thursday?
- Working.

181
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:43,888
Alone.

182
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:46,589
And Asher Ross saved my ass
more than once.

183
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:51,015
He's the only one who took a chance
and loaned me the bucks to get started.

184
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:56,358
I got a little behind
on my payments.

185
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:58,759
You think I'd kill him over that?

186
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:00,302
Any idea who would?

187
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,057
I'm going to need
to take that back for analysis.

188
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:07,513
Don't drop it.

189
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:14,368
This is what's left of Asher
Ross' laptop from the explosion.

190
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,532
Getting anything off it,
it's gonna be tough.

191
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:20,697
Preliminary forensics show Ross' cell
phone fragments had traces of HMX.

192
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:24,409
HMX is a military-grade explosive.
It's expensive and hard to get.

193
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:27,371
Which means our bomber
needed access, or he ripped it off.

194
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,789
- I'll check for any reports of theft.
- All right.

195
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:32,650
The killer had to have access
to Ross' cell phone

196
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:35,212
in order to wire it with an explosive
without Ross knowing.

197
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,143
What about the cell phone
that Sam found?

198
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:39,097
Nothing. Prepaid. No prints.

199
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,362
Killer must've wiped it clean
before tossing it.

200
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,387
Keep working on that laptop, Eric.

201
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,975
Ross and King were on the same bomb
disposal unit for nine months.

202
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,749
- That sounds like a short time...
- Considering the burnout rate,

203
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,668
- they were old-timers.
- Disabling bombs

204
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,194
that can blow you with the slightest
mistake takes it toll.

205
00:12:54,236 --> 00:12:56,358
Work often results in PTSD.

206
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,809
King appears to be coping,
given all that he's suffered.

207
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:02,713
Some of the more severe symptoms
might take months to manifest.

208
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:05,595
Untreated, it can cause
massive personality change,

209
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:06,948
depression, aggression.

210
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,893
Enough to blow
one of your buddies' heads off

211
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:11,123
- if you've got a beef.
- It's not out of the question.

212
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,088
- Full Windsor.
- Really? Again with the tie?

213
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,632
I had you pegged more
as a half Windsor kind of guy.

214
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,718
Is that supposed to have
some sort of meaning?

215
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,594
You're the psychologist.

216
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:36,898
Shouldn't you be working on
that somewhere a little more secure?

217
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:38,733
- Like where?
- I don't know.

218
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,445
A room with armor plated walls
comes to mind.

219
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,238
Light's good in here.

220
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,365
I will buy you a lamp.

221
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:48,980
King said it was defused.
He seemed to know what he was doing.

222
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:49,911
Relax.

223
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:55,375
The million dollar question is,
do you know what you're doing?

224
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,671
This is not good.

225
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:04,259
He hid a secondary micro
detonator inside.

226
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,316
It has a mercury switch.

227
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:10,849
Don't anybody move.

228
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,644
Sorry about that.

229
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:19,899
Full Windsor.

230
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,980
It's a Christmas miracle!

231
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,316
We got something off Ross' laptop.

232
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:29,510
He had lunch two days
before he died with Stanton Olin,

233
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:31,828
who's another member
of his EOD unit in Iraq.

234
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,747
That's access and ability.

235
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,890
If Olin's got motive...

236
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:38,543
he's our guy.

237
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:42,255
It wasn't really a miracle.
It was just me doing what I do.

238
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,423
That shirt is awesome.

239
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:53,767
What's up, dude?

240
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:59,273
Psych evaluations are coming up
in a few weeks, and,

241
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:02,067
I'll be interviewing
the team members.

242
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,812
And for that, you need my signature.

243
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,533
And who interviews you,

244
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,826
- Mr. Getz?
- It doesn't work that way.

245
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:15,044
Doesn't seem fair somehow, does it?

246
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,895
What did you do to your tie?

247
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:22,289
I spilled something on it.

248
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,676
- Should I get it dry-cleaned?
- That's an option.

249
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:29,154
Soda water?

250
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,362
I'd recommend either donation
or incineration,

251
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:33,829
not in that order.

252
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,851
You don't like this tie?
It was a gift.

253
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:39,476
Obviously not from a loved one.

254
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:42,524
Come on.

255
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,519
Let's go cheer you up.

256
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,266
You're wondering about the suit?

257
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:52,334
No, a man doesn't need a excuse
to be fashionable.

258
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:55,412
And besides,
you look so professional.

259
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:58,006
I tried the whole West
Coast casual thing,

260
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,541
I think it was working against me.

261
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:01,543
You know, with the agents.

262
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:06,256
I know undercover work is difficult
and dangerous,

263
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,260
I know they've been forced
to take on roles

264
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,052
and do things
that they're not proud of.

265
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:13,626
But they think that burying memories
is better than talking about them.

266
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,083
Come.
Let's try a half Windsor this time.

267
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:19,508
It can make such a difference.

268
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:22,147
There you go.

269
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,540
You know,

270
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:27,517
in my experience, if you're patient,

271
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:31,495
sooner or later,
the people who need to talk

272
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:33,158
will seek you out,

273
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,066
often under the guise
of some other intention.

274
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,575
You just have to listen.

275
00:16:48,302 --> 00:16:49,800
I could pull off a bow tie?

276
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:53,512
Not without a red rubber nose
and those big, floppy shoes.

277
00:16:58,441 --> 00:16:59,976
Olin's got quite the view.

278
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:05,390
He can sit on his porch at night
and watch the drive-bys.

279
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:17,494
Olin?

280
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,649
Federal agents. Stop!

281
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:37,798
Come on.

282
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:46,261
Eric, we need an ambulance.

283
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:58,630
So, your buddy Ross gets killed,
we turn up, and you take off?

284
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,954
Why did you run?

285
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:03,290
Someone's been following me.

286
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,333
Ross mention anything
about being followed?

287
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,128
Nah, he just said
I was being paranoid.

288
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:09,848
Now who's being paranoid?

289
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,514
Who is doing this?

290
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:14,758
Who wants us dead?

291
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,956
Footage from an LAPD traffic cam.

292
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,944
Not likely triggered by a timer.

293
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:26,910
There's no way of knowing exactly
when he'd get back into his car again.

294
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:29,245
It's not rigged to the starter,
otherwise

295
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:31,387
it would've blown up
as soon as he turned the key.

296
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,320
Could've been remote detonation,
same as Ross.

297
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,140
Rewind.

298
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:39,051
Back window of the car.

299
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:41,981
Clean it up, Eric.

300
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:45,637
Probably some neighborhood kids...
"Wash me", things like that.

301
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,876
You know, when I was in high school,

302
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,340
I wrote "I wish my girlfriend
were this dirty", on my principal's car.

303
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:53,173
I thought it was pretty funny...

304
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,008
until I got expelled.

305
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,309
It's from the Qur'an,

306
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,561
Al-Maeda, chapter five, verse ten.

307
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:10,731
"Those who reject our faith and deny
signs shall be companions of hellfire."

308
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,761
Seems like Ross and his buddies
might have brought back

309
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:16,446
more from Iraq than they realized.

310
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:20,058
I'm here to help you, Olin.

311
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:22,744
But you'll to have to trust me.

312
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:33,088
It's my fault Ross is dead.

313
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,006
Why do you think that?

314
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:37,523
Because I didn't try hard enough
to convince him

315
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:38,885
that something was going on.

316
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:40,409
He shut me down,

317
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,315
so I stopped trying.

318
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:46,268
Maybe it's because
you didn't want to believe it yourself.

319
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,971
Sometimes it's easier to pretend
something's not happening

320
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:53,108
than to face it.

321
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:56,127
Yeah, well, I just faced it.

322
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:57,663
Okay?

323
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:01,395
Just like I faced it
every day out there.

324
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:03,985
Every day.

325
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,887
My partner and I spent
a little time in Fallujah.

326
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:15,505
We were augmenting
a Marine Expeditionary Force.

327
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:19,608
More bad days than good ones.

328
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,430
The last thing I wanted to do
was talk about it, but...

329
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:27,559
it helped.

330
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:30,589
The only way to quiet it...

331
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:33,189
is to get it out.

332
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:36,735
I'm afraid...

333
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:39,259
if I give it
even a glimpse of light,

334
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:40,989
it'll swallow me.

335
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:42,908
I know.

336
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:45,994
I guess everyone deals
with it differently.

337
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,140
King threw himself
into his business.

338
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:51,904
I found God.

339
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:55,841
Ross did the best. He just moved on.

340
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:01,843
Before the bombing,

341
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,258
somebody wrote a warning in Arabic

342
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,951
on the back of your vehicle.

343
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,947
It was a warning from the Qur'an.

344
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,436
You have any idea
who might have left that?

345
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,062
There was a guy in our unit,

346
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:17,442
Tariq.

347
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:19,494
He was Muslim.

348
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:22,672
I didn't know him very well.
No one did.

349
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,699
Have you seen him
since you've been back?

350
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,105
I know he had family here in LA.

351
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,039
I don't even know if I'd recognize him
if he walked by me on the street.

352
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:33,239
Why wouldn't you recognize him,
Olin?

353
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:36,784
IED.

354
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,410
He was badly burned
in the explosion.

355
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:43,785
His back, his arms, his... face.

356
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:49,307
Maybe he... blames us for that.

357
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:54,604
Tariq Barad Al-Jabiri.
Born and raised in Michigan.

358
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:56,882
Followed his older brother
to Los Angeles in '06

359
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:58,608
where he joined up
a few months later.

360
00:21:58,857 --> 00:22:00,603
Service record's clean as a whistle

361
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,375
Last known address
was a house in Mar Vista.

362
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:06,324
Name on the lease is...
Kimberly Johnson.

363
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,365
All right.

364
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,670
I haven't seen Tariq
since he got back.

365
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:13,385
The Corps told me he'd been hurt.

366
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:15,333
That he'd been disfigured.

367
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:18,749
I tried to see him in the hospital,
but he wouldn't allow it.

368
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:21,239
He wouldn't see me,
wouldn't take my calls.

369
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:24,156
He didn't even respond
to my e-mails.

370
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:26,678
Mommy, when are we gonna see Santa?

371
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,549
Real soon, honey.
Why don't you go

372
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:31,204
put on your blue dress
so you can get your picture taken?

373
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,262
My daughter Elly is Tariq's niece.

374
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:41,443
I was in a relationship
with Tariq's brother.

375
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:45,085
After he found out I was pregnant,
he was out of here fast.

376
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,574
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so was I.

377
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,505
I thought he loved me.

378
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,388
But Tariq stepped up

379
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,579
and supported us,

380
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:55,871
treated Elly like she was his own.

381
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:57,962
And after a while...

382
00:22:58,672 --> 00:22:59,812
You fell in love.

383
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:01,654
Yeah, very much so.

384
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,242
We were building
a great life together.

385
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,229
Then he shipped off to Iraq.

386
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:10,111
And now he's finally back, but...

387
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:12,179
he's still gone.

388
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:15,666
I just want him to come home
so that we can be a family again.

389
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,458
Did Tariq get along
with all the guys in his unit?

390
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:23,352
Were there... any conflicts
over religious beliefs?

391
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:25,608
Tariq was very tolerant.

392
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,823
He even let Elly
have a Christmas tree.

393
00:23:31,024 --> 00:23:31,985
He loved her.

394
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:37,040
He still drops money off for us
every month.

395
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:45,757
Security cam footage
from Cali-South Mailboxes.

396
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,366
According to Kim Johnson,

397
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:50,272
Tariq drops cash off here
for his family once a month.

398
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:51,863
And this was two days ago?

399
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,324
Could be our guy.

400
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,352
Tariq goes over to fight for
his country, but he gets disfigured.

401
00:23:57,582 --> 00:24:00,359
Starts to question his belief
in the war, America,

402
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,889
even his fellow Marines.

403
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,609
- Forgets whose side he's on.
- Maybe we should stake out the store.

404
00:24:05,493 --> 00:24:07,862
It's too long to wait.
Somebody could be dead by tomorrow.

405
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,155
Clock is ticking.

406
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:13,201
We could make a special delivery.

407
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,448
Is... is that a...?

408
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,167
It's a bomb, Paul.

409
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,586
We believe this bomb has come
from one of your mailboxes.

410
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,965
- And who... who are you guys?
- We work with Homeland Security.

411
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,883
I think I should call my boss.

412
00:24:30,744 --> 00:24:32,010
Recognize this guy?

413
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:34,639
That's a trick question.

414
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,975
How can you recognize him
when half his head's gone?

415
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:39,978
Box 117.
I want a name and address.

416
00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:44,315
Strong possibility there's another one
coming next week.

417
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:46,226
Strong possibility there's a bomb

418
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,763
just like this in one
of those mailboxes right now.

419
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:51,281
I'd hurry up.

420
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,662
Rented by Asher Ross.

421
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:58,997
<i>Déjà vu.</i>

422
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:14,036
Clear.

423
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:15,762
Clear.

424
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,458
Found this in Asher's bedroom.

425
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,521
Looks like our boy Tariq's
found a place to stay.

426
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:27,275
And to work.

427
00:25:37,263 --> 00:25:38,745
So we have Ross, a former Marine,

428
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:41,873
EOD specialist who's blown up
with his own cell phone.

429
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,084
Then we have another member
of his unit, Olin, who's nearly blown

430
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,377
to hell in his own car.

431
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:49,380
Then we have our boy King who finds
a bomb under his truck and

432
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,466
disarms it with a little help
from yours truly.

433
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:54,385
That leaves Tariq, who we now
know was staying at Ross' place

434
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,012
and working with King.

435
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,889
So Tariq is the common vector.

436
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,393
Why didn't King mention him?

437
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:01,559
These guys have been
to hell and back together.

438
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,892
King didn't tell Tariq's family.
Why would he tell us?

439
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:07,732
If they were buddies, why would Tariq
place a bomb under King's truck?

440
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,361
I think it's time someone
pays another visit to King.

441
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:15,573
You don't still have
that... wench outfit, do you?

442
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,287
Can I help you?

443
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,472
This thing's been coughing
and jumping like a Brahman bull.

444
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:43,017
So, is Tariq here?

445
00:26:43,326 --> 00:26:44,644
Sort of tall,

446
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,687
dark, handsome?

447
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:48,689
I'm the only handsome one here.

448
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:51,734
In fact,
I am the only one working here.

449
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,307
<i>Because you see,
I met this guy, Tariq,</i>

450
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:58,154
<i>at a gas station, and he was wearing
a shirt with your logo on it:</i>

451
00:26:58,497 --> 00:26:59,742
<i>Quality Automotive.</i>

452
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:01,536
So that's how I knew to come here.

453
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:04,377
Never had anybody
named Tariq working here.

454
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,957
Sorry.

455
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,961
When's the last time you put some
carburetor cleaner through this thing?

456
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,218
I don't know.

457
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:14,013
I've been out of town,
so it's been sitting for about a month.

458
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,967
Leave your man waiting a month, too?

459
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:18,607
This bike has twin cams on it.

460
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,818
Carburetor looks all right.

461
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:24,269
Let's take a look
at the throttle control rod.

462
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:26,936
- You were in the Corps?
- Yep.

463
00:27:28,586 --> 00:27:30,356
Don't tell me you're a Marine, too.

464
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,845
My father was.

465
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,485
I grew up moving from base to base.

466
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,030
I was even...

467
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:39,157
engaged to a jarhead once.

468
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:40,742
He managed to escape?

469
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,410
Killed in Fallujah.

470
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,830
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:49,751
Let's see what's giving
this bike indigestion.

472
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,872
Is that true
about Kensi being engaged?

473
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,630
I don't know,

474
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:57,800
but if it is,
it explains all the serial dating.

475
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:00,970
Here's your problem right here.

476
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:03,335
These spark plugs aren't stock.

477
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:06,313
You gotta stick with factory
or the ion sensors misread,

478
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,478
you get a bumpy ride.

479
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:11,291
You know,
Tariq said he was a Marine.

480
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:14,380
Now, I know you Devil Dogs
stick together, so,

481
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:18,154
come on, hook a girl up.

482
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,199
All right.

483
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:27,955
I got somebody down here
wants to talk to you.

484
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,832
That's our girl.

485
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,077
<i>- Want a beer?
- Can't drink and drive.</i>

486
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:37,382
Here she is, you lucky dog.

487
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:41,302
Who are you?

488
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,349
We're NCIS agents.

489
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,061
Who are you?

490
00:28:53,086 --> 00:28:54,148
Told you he'd run.

491
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:56,179
I know, I know.
I hate when they run.

492
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:59,418
What's the matter with you?
Throwing a hammer

493
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,488
at my head!

494
00:29:01,484 --> 00:29:02,698
You lying bitch.

495
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:05,487
You set me up.

496
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:07,800
I'm NCIS,

497
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:09,994
but my father was a Marine.

498
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:13,313
How does he feel
about his daughter growing up

499
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:15,512
to be a professional liar?

500
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:21,676
Good news, Mr. Olin.

501
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,636
Tariq's been taken into custody.

502
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:24,839
Tariq?

503
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,014
In relation to Ross' murder.

504
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:35,857
Me and Ross,
we were coming back from a patrol.

505
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:40,246
We saw these two old ladies
huddling in a doorway.

506
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,282
We offered them a couple candy bars.

507
00:29:45,756 --> 00:29:48,154
And I think
they just appreciated the gesture.

508
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:51,608
But...

509
00:29:57,043 --> 00:29:58,501
It's okay, Olin.

510
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:01,077
Take your time.

511
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:05,402
Out of... out of nowhere,
this other lady

512
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,296
comes, and she's younger,

513
00:30:07,885 --> 00:30:08,764
with a baby.

514
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:12,810
And Tariq starts shouting at her
in Arabic,

515
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,441
telling her to move away and stuff.
"Move away! Move away!"

516
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:17,106
Everything to him
was a security risk.

517
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:19,372
The woman with the baby
wanted your help?

518
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:20,766
Everybody was shouting!

519
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:23,711
And the old ladies
were crying, and...

520
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:27,876
I was just trying to get them all
to settle down.

521
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,644
And then Tariq starts firing
his gun right by my head.

522
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:38,636
Ross, too.

523
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,640
I turned back around...

524
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:47,470
they're all dead.

525
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:50,578
The woman,

526
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:52,634
her baby...

527
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:55,799
the old ladies.

528
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:03,023
I guess I just...

529
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,030
never really got a chance
to talk to anybody about that.

530
00:31:06,716 --> 00:31:07,615
You should.

531
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:11,314
You need to.

532
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:19,793
I want you to have this.

533
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:22,547
You read the Bible?

534
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:24,682
I've... skimmed.

535
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,502
I have...

536
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,010
poor reading habits.

537
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:32,745
It would mean a lot to me...

538
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:34,183
if you took it.

539
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:37,714
It's helped me out through
a lot of tough times.

540
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,724
Who knows?
Maybe it'll help you someday.

541
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:48,274
Thank you.

542
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:52,355
I appreciate it.

543
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:11,377
He would have been very proud.

544
00:32:13,444 --> 00:32:15,714
And you look like
you could use some tea.

545
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:18,610
This is a holiday blend
with cinnamon

546
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:20,771
and safflower petals.

547
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:22,902
Well, thank you.

548
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:25,139
You're welcome.

549
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:27,138
Congratulations.

550
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:31,233
It seems you may have caught
our mad bomber.

551
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:37,003
You don't seem very thrilled.

552
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:42,318
I mean, yes, I hope so.

553
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:45,561
I just wish that...

554
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:47,454
you know what, I don't know.

555
00:32:49,356 --> 00:32:52,043
I just think that when it comes
to going undercover,

556
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,097
I deal with the danger
a lot better than the deception.

557
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:57,588
I see.

558
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,561
Like with Hastings King,
for example,

559
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,603
today.

560
00:33:03,423 --> 00:33:06,324
Some of what I told him was true,
some of it was a complete lie,

561
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:07,855
and some of it was a...

562
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:10,951
was a combination of both.

563
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:14,092
Deception you perpetrate
is a necessity.

564
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:16,967
You need to embrace it,

565
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:18,471
not fear it.

566
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,456
I'm sure your father would agree.

567
00:33:26,634 --> 00:33:29,007
Anyway, if men wanted
the truth all the time,

568
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,969
I wouldn't have
a French maid's outfit

569
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,003
in my boudoir, would I?

570
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,139
- You have a...
- Just...

571
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,409
drink your tea, dear heart.

572
00:33:44,545 --> 00:33:46,668
Forensics reports are in
on the explosives.

573
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,727
- Two different types were used.
- Two?

574
00:33:53,257 --> 00:33:55,280
<i>Tell me about Ross and King.</i>

575
00:33:58,445 --> 00:34:01,122
Ross and King let me couch surf
between their two places.

576
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:03,214
You and Ross were friends?

577
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:05,216
Ross saved my life.

578
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,941
He saved Olin and King, too.

579
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:12,250
When he pulled King out,
the guy's leg was still underneath me.

580
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,314
Ross pulled Olin and King out first?

581
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:18,838
Do you resent that?

582
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,519
Had he pulled you out sooner, you might
not have suffered the burns you did.

583
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,521
If he hadn't pulled me out,
I'd be dead.

584
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:31,316
- The dude is a freakin' hero.
- Okay, let's go back before that.

585
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:34,091
Tell me about the Iraqi woman
and her baby?

586
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:36,752
What woman?

587
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:39,227
You don't remember?

588
00:34:39,803 --> 00:34:42,371
Olin and King were handing out
candy bars to

589
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:45,669
a couple of old ladies,
and you disapproved.

590
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:49,628
That sort of stuff looks great
on the news, but it's a security risk.

591
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:51,255
Old ladies?

592
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:53,757
When you move away from the vehicle.

593
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:56,427
You never know
who's on the other side of that door,

594
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:59,138
or who's looking down at you
from a rooftop.

595
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,890
- It's why you shot her?
- I didn't.

596
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,738
You ordered her to step away
from the vehicle, and when she didn't,

597
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:07,750
- you shot a mother and her baby.
- There was no baby.

598
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:13,291
She was carrying
a 60 millimeter mortar shell

599
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,435
wrapped in a blanket
with a hand trigger.

600
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:18,073
And I didn't shoot her.

601
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Olin did.

602
00:35:21,377 --> 00:35:22,477
He saved me.

603
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,955
He saved the old ladies
and everybody else for half a block.

604
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,168
Olin shot a suicide bomber?

605
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:31,921
Ask King.

606
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:35,437
Check your patrol logs
if you don't believe me.

607
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,260
Did Olin ever talk religion to you?

608
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:40,905
He was a Christian.

609
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:45,392
But he could quote the Qur'an
or the Talmud as easily as the Bible.

610
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:57,912
I'm getting
a bad feeling about this.

611
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,298
<i>We got the forensics from the bombs
in Ross' cell phone,</i>

612
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,786
<i>King's truck and Olin's car.</i>

613
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:06,038
<i>Ross's cell phone
and King's car bomb</i>

614
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:09,216
<i>were both high-grade explosives...
tetrahexamine tetranitramin.</i>

615
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:12,797
<i>But the explosive in Olin's car
was trinitrotoluene.</i>

616
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:14,671
It's a much lower grade.

617
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,867
<i>Right. And it was a shape-charge,</i>

618
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:19,853
<i>under the rear of the vehicle,
pointing away from the driver.</i>

619
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,845
So it blew out of the car,
instead of in.

620
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:24,586
<i>So basically it looks convincing,
but</i>

621
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,073
<i>whoever set it,
must have known it wouldn't kill Olin.</i>

622
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:29,405
Everything Olin told me
was either a grossly distorted

623
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:30,855
memory or an outright lie.

624
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:33,691
He reads and writes in Arabic.
He could written the note on the car.

625
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:35,678
Tariq's not the bomber.

626
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,237
Olin is.

627
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:54,086
What are the chances
this place is wired?

628
00:36:54,406 --> 00:36:58,006
- I'd say between 99 and 100%.
- Always the optimist.

629
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:13,914
All right, room's clear.

630
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,279
Olin, you in there?

631
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,698
Agents Callen and Hanna.
We're coming in to talk.

632
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:32,052
Wait.

633
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,590
- Pressure pad.
- Thanks.

634
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:47,240
Clear.

635
00:37:48,943 --> 00:37:52,694
Got a list of names and cities.
Got King, Ross, Tariq.

636
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,814
I bet the rest
are all Marines as well.

637
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,488
<i>Hit me, G.</i>

638
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,076
See if our boy Olin is on
any flight manifests tonight.

639
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,698
These are receipts from today.

640
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,576
Eight bottles of peroxide
from Fairfax Beauty Supply.

641
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,186
So now we're chasing a blonde?

642
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:12,387
These are the ingredients
for making TATP.

643
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,417
He must have ran out of HMX
so now he's improvising.

644
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:19,254
TATP is highly explosive,
but it's extremely unstable.

645
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,965
<i>All right, I got Stanton</i> Olin
on a flight to Atlanta

646
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,009
tonight, 11:55 p.m.,

647
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,076
<i>Delta Airlines.</i>

648
00:38:25,118 --> 00:38:27,528
Okay, alert airport police <i>at LAX.</i>

649
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:31,466
Listen to this.

650
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:35,270
"In flaming fire taking vengeance
on them that know not God."

651
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:39,358
Sounds like the Qur'an quote
Olin put on his car.

652
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,074
It's essentially the same,
only this is from Thessalonians.

653
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:44,033
- Oh, boy.
- What?

654
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:45,572
This Bible was a gift

655
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,549
from Olin.

656
00:38:47,749 --> 00:38:51,055
Giving away prize possessions,
it's a warning sign of suicide.

657
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,753
Olin doesn't want to harm
innocent people.

658
00:38:55,191 --> 00:38:58,057
He wants to punish himself and those
in his unit out of some strange,

659
00:38:58,285 --> 00:38:59,753
twisted sense of penance.

660
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:03,691
OK, you know what, call Callen.
I'm going to King's garage.

661
00:39:10,922 --> 00:39:13,506
<i>Olin wants to</i> finish what he started
with Hastings King.

662
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:15,978
- Kensi's <i>headed there now.</i>
- Got it. We're on our way.

663
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:17,666
Sam! Let's go.

664
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,283
- Come on, we've got to go.
- What are you doing here?

665
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:35,039
I need to get you out of here now
before Olin arrives to kill you.

666
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:38,583
- Why in hell should I trust you?
- Because I'm telling you the truth.

667
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,668
Since when?

668
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,691
I was undercover.
I was trying to solve Ross' murder,

669
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:45,727
and I really don't want to have
to solve yours, okay? So move!

670
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,183
You do not want to do this.

671
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,185
I don't want to.

672
00:39:59,404 --> 00:40:00,396
But I have to.

673
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,100
<i>I don't know what you're wired with,
Olin,</i>

674
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,898
<i>but you of all people know
that a suicide bomb</i>

675
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:10,781
<i>is not the way of a real warrior.</i>

676
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:13,881
The stuff he's wired with
is unstable.

677
00:40:14,006 --> 00:40:16,789
- Put a bullet in it, it could go off.
- What about a head shot?

678
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,007
Just the impact of him falling
could trigger it.

679
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:22,133
You're just chock-full of good news,
aren't you?

680
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,822
You can leave.
It's just King and I

681
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:33,697
who seek absolution
for what we did in Iraq.

682
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,245
No one gets absolution
by killing themselves.

683
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:41,206
- We did bad things.
- It was a war.

684
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:44,300
Brings out the worst in men.
But this isn't gonna help.

685
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,106
Without the shedding of blood...

686
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:49,488
there is no remission.

687
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,932
Kensi, elbow!

688
00:40:53,663 --> 00:40:54,785
Get the trigger!

689
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,461
Eric, need an ambulance.

690
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,053
- Looks like Hetty's still here.
- She worries.

691
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,749
- Not that she'd ever let us know that.
- I had some paperwork

692
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:23,835
to be completed before tomorrow,
Mr. Callen.

693
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:26,691
Some of us take our paperwork
seriously.

694
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:27,934
But...

695
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:31,687
with the successful outcome of
our mission and everyone's safe return,

696
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:34,314
I thought perhaps some tea
might be in order.

697
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,661
No offense, Hetty, but I don't think
tea is gonna cut it tonight.

698
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,231
It's a very special tea, Mr. Hanna.

699
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,773
"Glen Garioch."

700
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,792
1958.

701
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,509
That is some Scotch, Hetty.

702
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,500
That's what Oliver Reed thought

703
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:53,025
when he tried to make me
his special musketeer one night.

704
00:41:53,713 --> 00:41:56,388
But he kept his sword
in his scabbard,

705
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:58,636
and I kept the scotch.

706
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:02,769
Looks like you also started
without us.

707
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:05,979
I got bored with my paperwork.

708
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,614
I figured I'd try and dress up
this abomination.

709
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:13,022
Holy moly.

710
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,683
Where's Nate?

711
00:42:16,808 --> 00:42:19,786
He's been known
to enjoy a good single malt.

712
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:21,487
He's busy.

713
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:23,800
Spreading some cheer of his own.

714
00:42:47,886 --> 00:42:49,036
Welcome home.

715
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:57,055
<i>Go home.</i>

716
00:42:57,924 --> 00:42:59,356
<i>Find a wench,</i>

717
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:01,262
<i>raise fat babies,</i>

718
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:03,214
<i>live a good</i>

719
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:05,572
<i>long life.</i>
