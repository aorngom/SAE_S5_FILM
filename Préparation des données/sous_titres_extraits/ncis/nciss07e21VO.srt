2
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,464
Got a heart attack.
BP 88/62, pulse 98.

3
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:13,630
All right.

4
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,059
Okay, steady. Steady.

5
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:17,392
- Place him down. You got him?
- Got him.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,064
Look out!

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,691
Move out of the way!

12
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:13,072
You remember Brenda Bittner?

13
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:15,843
- The name sounds familiar.
- You friended her.

14
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:18,041
She's a barista
at Gibbs' coffee shop?

15
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,507
Oh, yeah. Brenda.

16
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:22,420
I'm reading her profile now.

17
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:25,614
She just posted
that she is in a committed relationship

18
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:27,086
with Tony DiNozzo.

19
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:28,407
Our Tony DiNozzo?

20
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,386
Sure looks like him.
Look at her home page.

21
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:36,373
Well,
how long has this been going on?

22
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:39,785
- How long has what been going on?
- When were you going to tell us?

23
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,956
- Tell you what?
- You are in a committed relationship.

24
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:47,765
With who?

25
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,214
The ever-lovely...

26
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:51,057
Brenda Bittner.

27
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:55,016
- Where did you hear that?
- She posted it

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,949
at 7:14 a.m. this morning.

29
00:01:57,668 --> 00:01:59,335
I left her place around 7:00.

30
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,021
How long have you two been dating?

31
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:03,425
Well... no, we're not dating.

32
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:04,658
Last night was it.

33
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:06,360
It must have been one hell of an it

34
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:08,700
because she can not wait
to tell all of her friends.

35
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:11,316
How many friends
can she possibly have?

36
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,924
2,412.

37
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,634
She is very popular.

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,059
Can she post this
without my permission?

39
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,045
Depends on
your privacy settings, Tony.

40
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,418
Well, obviously,
I haven't got them set right.

41
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:29,594
Will you get over here, McGeek,
and make this go away, please?

42
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,694
Tony, you know, you're getting way
too old for these one-night stands.

43
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,396
Your biological clock is ticking.

44
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,188
Men don't have biological clocks.

45
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,270
When I meet Ms. Right...

46
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:40,498
I'll be ready to settle down.

47
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:42,328
Don't ever settle, DiNozzo...

48
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:46,123
Dead lieutenant,
Monroe University Hospital. Let's go.

49
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,240
- Was he sick long?
- No.

50
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,834
Never got admitted.

51
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:56,008
Victim is Lieutenant
Jeffrey Wilton Hutton.

52
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:57,810
He's attached to NIOC.

53
00:02:57,894 --> 00:03:01,388
He's living in base housing
at the Anacostia NSF.

54
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,680
Parents are deceased.

55
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,016
Next of kin?

56
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,490
A sister.
I'm gonna go try and track her down.

57
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:09,782
So what exactly
are you looking for in Ms. Right?

58
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:14,692
Aside from the obvious,
physical requirements...

59
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:16,649
I don't know.

60
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:17,924
I guess she'd be a...

61
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:19,657
very independent woman.

62
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,065
Intelligent,

63
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:22,743
successful.

64
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:24,370
A professional.

65
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:25,872
Okay, just one question.

66
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:29,194
What would this woman possibly

67
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:30,784
see in you?

68
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:36,398
So, I can assure you of one thing.

69
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,863
Car crash was not
the cause of death.

70
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:39,961
What was?

71
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:41,846
Well, I haven't the faintest idea.

72
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:45,788
I mean, there are no contusions,
no obvious signs of trauma.

73
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,538
I mean, the poor Lieutenant...

74
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:49,395
I doubt he was here
to visit someone.

75
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,062
But he must have had
an egregious ailment.

76
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,694
I mean, he was in a hell of a hurry
to get himself to the hospital.

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,055
Figured that out myself, Duck.

78
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,667
Appreciate the help.

79
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,244
- We done here?
- I am.

80
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:06,132
Lieutenant Hutton's sister's name
is Dana.

81
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:07,269
Wait. Dana Hutton?

82
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:11,193
- I just got off the phone with...
- ZNN reporter?

83
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:12,354
Yes.

84
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:17,344
Just got off the phone
with her producer.

85
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,739
He says that she's been working
at home today.

86
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:22,417
Dana Hutton.

87
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,805
I would really like
to interview her, boss.

88
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:25,770
Sure.

89
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:29,685
Take Ziva with you.

90
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,558
You know who she is.

91
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:37,626
She did that great piece
on Doctors without Borders in Darfur.

92
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,032
Embedded with that Marine unit
in Kandahar, last year.

93
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:41,518
What does she look like?

94
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:43,469
Blonde. Cute.
Real cute.

95
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:45,814
Looks even better
in a helmet and flak jacket.

96
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,960
Okay, Tony, do I have to remind you
that her brother just died?

97
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:50,331
I'm a professional.

98
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,544
What?

99
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:53,876
Brenda Bittner.

100
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:57,743
Yeah! I guess she saw
I changed my dating status.

101
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:00,189
Well, you cannot avoid her forever.

102
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,929
Well, I guess she's not home.

103
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:13,137
Looks like we got probable cause.

104
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:38,777
Clear!

105
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:48,056
Ms. Hutton did not do this
to her own place.

106
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,101
Where is she?

107
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,321
Someone tossed the place pretty good
looking for something.

108
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,990
Metro's processing her apartment.

109
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:08,438
They are going to coordinate
their investigation with us.

110
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,850
- Already put out a BOLO.
- Dana Hutton...

111
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,706
should be easy to spot.
She's pretty well known.

112
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,529
Do we assume her disappearance
is related to her brother's death?

113
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:18,218
No.
We don't assume anything.

114
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,167
Jeffrey and Dana Hutton.

115
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:21,527
Military brats.

116
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:23,745
Their father was a Marine
combat helicopter pilot.

117
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:26,162
Died at the age of 42
in a training exercise.

118
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:27,803
They were raised by their mother.

119
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:30,927
Died five years ago
of pancreatic cancer.

120
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:32,523
Overachievers, both of them.

121
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:35,477
He played water polo
and lacrosse at the academy.

122
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,772
Did a tour at the Pacific,
spent a year

123
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,940
at the Pentagon
before they moved him to...

124
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:43,070
Navy Information Operations Command.

125
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,061
NIOC. Secret stuff.

126
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:47,001
Wonder what he was working on.

127
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:50,105
I'll know in three minutes.
Talking to his C.O. in MTAC.

128
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,439
Impressive woman.

129
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:59,376
Won a piano competition
when she was 13 years old.

130
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,214
Phi Beta Kappa graduate
of Georgetown before joining ZNN

131
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,041
at the age of 22.

132
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:09,311
Boss, went
through Lieutenant Hutton's residence.

133
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:12,267
Nothing.
Dropped off his laptop with Abby.

134
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:15,704
Yeah. Gibbs.

135
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,853
Yeah. On my way.

136
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,211
Let's go, McGee.

137
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:31,098
Multiple organ failure,
but no apparent reason.

138
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,584
You seem perplexed, Dr. Mallard.

139
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:34,773
Oh, I am.

140
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,039
I'm just reviewing
Lieutenant Hutton's physical,

141
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:40,292
taken only last week.
The man is in perfect health.

142
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,964
I'm about to take blood
and tissue samples up to Abby.

143
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:47,403
Should I have her look
for anything specific?

144
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:50,970
Well, that is my dilemma, Mr. Palmer.
I wouldn't know what to tell her.

145
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,861
Or Gibbs, for that matter,

146
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:56,153
when he comes calling,
as he undoubtedly will.

147
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:03,858
<i>Captain Austin Sears.</i>

148
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,812
<i>Have to assume this is
about Lieutenant Hutton?</i>

149
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:09,947
<i>What happened?
Was it an accident?</i>

150
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,448
I don't know.
What can you tell me about him?

151
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:13,576
<i>Good officer.</i>

152
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:15,602
<i>Hard-working, smart.</i>

153
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,121
<i>Maybe too smart.</i>

154
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,053
What does that mean?

155
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,375
<i>Was a politician.</i>

156
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:22,533
<i>Knew how to work the system.</i>

157
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,788
<i>Had a... master plan.</i>

158
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,298
<i>His career wasn't going to end here.</i>

159
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,343
- What was he working on?
- <i>A classified project.</i>

160
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,144
We've got clearance.

161
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:34,388
<i>Not for this one.</i>

162
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:37,266
<i>Can't read you into the program
unless it's cleared by SECNAV himself.</i>

163
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,476
I'll make the call.

164
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:43,198
<i>I suggest you have
your director do it.</i>

165
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:48,000
Gee, what a sweet guy.

166
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:54,853
Doesn't DiNozzo have
a buddy at NIOC?

167
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,617
We can talk in here.

168
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,663
After you called this morning,

169
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,012
I tried to track Dana down,
but couldn't find her.

170
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:04,294
What's going on?

171
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,455
We need to talk to her.

172
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,507
Is this about the naval officer who died
in the car accident this morning?

173
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:12,431
Came across our news desk.

174
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,179
That was her brother.

175
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:19,109
That's horrible.

176
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:21,895
And ironic.
What are the odds?

177
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,032
Of what?

178
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:27,116
An old friend and mentor of Dana's was
killed in a car accident two weeks ago.

179
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:29,054
Is it unusual
for her not to come in?

180
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:30,961
Yes, but she's been distracted.

181
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,757
She's the executor
of her friend's estate

182
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,056
and had to get involved
in the sale of the business,

183
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,076
an old bookstore in Dupont Circle.

184
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:40,794
Shouldn't she check in with you?
I mean, you're her boss, right?

185
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,489
I'm not her boss.

186
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm her segment producer.

187
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,809
She's... the star.

188
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:48,462
Gets to choose her own assignments.

189
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,172
What is she working on now?

190
00:09:51,977 --> 00:09:55,176
She was doing a piece
about private military companies.

191
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:59,056
But the last few days, she started
researching the old Soviet KGB.

192
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,095
I told her that was
yesterday's news.

193
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:03,250
Bet you couldn't talk her out of it.

194
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:08,119
When Dana's passionate about something,
she can lose objectivity.

195
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,867
Does she have any friends
who may know where she is?

196
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:14,003
I don't know.
Our relationship's all about work.

197
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:15,863
She have a boyfriend?

198
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,866
Wouldn't know.

199
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:22,046
All right, could you give us a call
if you hear from her?

200
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:23,886
Sure.

201
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:26,417
All right, well,

202
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,393
we'll find our own way out. Thanks.

203
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:34,138
Mr. Rivera's with the Justice
Department in Mexico.

204
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,963
He's here in Washington

205
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:38,611
to set up an International Law
Enforcement Task Force.

206
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,308
I am sure you know our country
is in the middle of a horrible drug war.

207
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:44,300
We are desperate for help.

208
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,727
It is imperative that our countries
continue to share techniques

209
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:49,328
and intelligence.

210
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:52,927
I'll do what I can do.

211
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:55,067
Excuse me.

212
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:56,896
Yes?

213
00:10:58,185 --> 00:10:59,181
Send her in.

214
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:02,755
Hello, gentlemen.

215
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:06,460
I'm sorry I'm late.

216
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,041
Hello, Mr. Gibbs.

217
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,963
The State Department has appointed
Ms. Hart to be Alejandro's legal counsel

218
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:14,423
for the task force.

219
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:17,095
Of course they did.

220
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,687
I met Allison in Mexico City.
We work well together.

221
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,391
He was very helpful in my securing
Colonel Bell's release from prison.

222
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:27,644
Maybe we shouldn't be cooperating,
Leon.

223
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,052
Mr. Gibbs has
a strange sense of humor.

224
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:40,600
I'll be spending
a lot of time on the project.

225
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,453
Director Vance kindly extended me
temporary employee status.

226
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:52,513
How we doing
on Lieutenant Hutton's tox screen?

227
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:53,306
We?

228
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:54,713
Get in line, Palmer.

229
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:59,071
I've ruled out all common viruses,
biological agents, and drugs.

230
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:01,464
You didn't give me any direction.
This is going to take time.

231
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:03,555
Now, go, scram, leave me alone.

232
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:05,116
McGee is bugging me

233
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,367
to analyze the contents
of the hard drive of this laptop.

234
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:09,812
That's a terabyte.
Do you know how large that is?

235
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:15,075
She's in a foul mood again.

236
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:18,904
I have guns in my ballistics lab
and I know how to use 'em.

237
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:26,829
Did Metro send the fingerprints
lifted from Dana Hutton's condo?

238
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:28,707
Yes.

239
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:29,947
And?

240
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,642
And I haven't gotten to them yet.

241
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:35,087
When I have answers,
I will call you.

242
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,442
Now, out!
Both of you.

243
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:42,555
Congratulations.

244
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:46,921
- For what?
- Hooking up with Brenda Bittner.

245
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:49,236
Breena and I would love
to double with you.

246
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,555
Do you guys have
plans Saturday night?

247
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,521
I will see you tomorrow, Mr. Gibbs.

248
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,156
This is going to be fun,

249
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:03,907
at least for me.

250
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:09,554
Anything?

251
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:13,487
Been checking Hutton's credit cards,
phone activity. Nothing here.

252
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,682
DiNozzo make contact
with his buddy from NIOC yet?

253
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:17,004
I don't know.

254
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,028
Where is he?

255
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:20,857
No idea.

256
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:24,867
<i>I have such admiration
for authors like yourself.</i>

257
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,345
<i>There's this bookshop here
in Washington, DC</i>

258
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,519
<i>that was my refuge as a child.</i>

259
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:34,034
<i>I spent hours there curled up
on an old couch with a book.</i>

260
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:35,554
<i>I hope one of mine.</i>

261
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:40,237
<i>My mom didn't think you were proper
reading material for a young lady.</i>

262
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:51,159
<i>Supposedly the insurgents
had left the area, but</i>

263
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,947
<i>that's clearly not the case.</i>

264
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:55,083
<i>They've gathered on top
of this ridge ahead of us,</i>

265
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,682
<i> heavily armed...</i>

266
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,142
<i>We're taking fire.</i>

267
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,714
<i>Let's go.</i>

268
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:02,034
<i>Come on.</i>

269
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,578
<i>We need this shot.</i>

270
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:04,636
<i>Follow me.</i>

271
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,379
<i>Dana, come back!
Come on.</i>

272
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:17,043
DiNozzo,
you talked to your friend at NIOC?

273
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,359
Been playing phone tag, boss.

274
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,265
ZNN is going to break the story
on Dana Hutton and her brother.

275
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:25,989
I'm surprised
they held it this long.

276
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:35,118
- Give me her number.
- Whose?

277
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,250
- Dana.
- Nope.

278
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,002
I would like the number, please.

279
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,171
I've been monitoring
her cell phone, not on.

280
00:14:41,469 --> 00:14:43,583
Give me the number
or I'll Gibbs-slap you.

281
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,277
Boss, there's a bookstore where Dana
used to hang out when she was a kid.

282
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:01,775
She'd go there
when things were bothering her.

283
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,820
- How do you know that?
- It's called research, David.

284
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,029
The owner died
in a highway accident.

285
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:11,053
Dana is the executor of his estate
and is trying to sell the store.

286
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:14,276
- I think I should go check it out.
- Friend killed accidentally.

287
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,229
Healthy brother dies
of unknown causes.

288
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:18,744
She disappears.

289
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,360
I think we're setting
a record here for coincidences.

290
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:26,008
Ziva, background
the bookstore owner.

291
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,266
Get the details on his car accident.

292
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:43,331
May I inquire what the Lieutenant
is doing back on the table, Mr. Palmer?

293
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:47,701
You seemed so worried
last night that I thought, well,

294
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:49,406
maybe...

295
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:53,328
I wonder if it wouldn't be a good idea
for me to come in early and...

296
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:57,748
Are you upset?

297
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:00,334
Don't be silly.
I admire your initiative.

298
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:04,861
You found something.

299
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:07,126
Yeah, the left trapezius muscle.

300
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:11,011
There is a one-millimeter round dot
which at first glance appears to be....

301
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:14,056
an imperfection on the film, but...

302
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:18,861
there is...

303
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:22,556
a corresponding mark
on the Lieutenant's shoulder.

304
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:27,596
Well, let's see what it is.

305
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,500
I've prepared
your instruments for you.

306
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,553
No, this is all yours, Mr. Palmer.

307
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,159
Allow me...

308
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,167
to assist.

309
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:50,785
Tweezers.

310
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,747
What on earth is that?

311
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,936
Looks like a teeny-tiny
bowling ball.

312
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,937
What is it?

313
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,567
You got me.

314
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,876
Has me and Dr. Mallard baffled, too.

315
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,281
Okay, well,
I will add this to my to-do list.

316
00:17:33,215 --> 00:17:36,113
- I'd like for you to meet...
- <i>Señor</i> Alejandro Rivera.

317
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,041
I read about your visit
on the interoffice e-mail.

318
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,239
<i>Encantado</i>.

319
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,226
I have been looking forward
to meeting you.

320
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,646
You are a legend in the field
of forensic science.

321
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:47,227
Shucks.

322
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:50,270
I was wondering if you could give
Mr. Rivera a quick tour of your lab.

323
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:54,129
I would love to, but I am just...

324
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,533
I am way too busy.

325
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,535
Mr. Rivera is
on a very tight schedule.

326
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:01,329
He's only going to be
in Washington for one more day.

327
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:03,331
Well, maybe next time.

328
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,878
Ms. Sciuto...

329
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:07,252
Ms. Sciuto is obviously very busy.

330
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,981
I appreciate your work ethic.

331
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,287
I wish I had someone
like you on my team.

332
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:13,175
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

333
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,217
<i>Por nada.</i>

334
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:34,351
That sounds nice, man.

335
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,163
Maggie Reed.

336
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:49,165
I hope you're not insulted,

337
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:52,056
but you don't look like someone
who would be buying a used bookstore.

338
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,160
I'm not.

339
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:00,774
You're here about Dana.

340
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:03,316
I heard it on the TV this morning.

341
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,894
They said she was missing
and her brother died?

342
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:08,287
What's going on?

343
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,671
I tried to call her
a couple of times yesterday.

344
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:13,475
How well do you know 'em?

345
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,111
I didn't know Jeffrey,

346
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:18,864
but I'm a patron of the bookstore,
so I've seen Dana here over the years.

347
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,331
Charley Bascom, the owner...

348
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:24,371
he was like a father to her.
She took his death very hard.

349
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:26,852
- Is that Charley up there?
- Yes.

350
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:29,246
I understand
Dana is handling his estate.

351
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:32,397
Yes, she approached me
last week at Charley's funeral.

352
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:35,423
Asked me if I would help
with the sale of the business.

353
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,999
His will instructs that the proceeds

354
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,626
go to a charity promoting
literacy for children.

355
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:42,608
So Charley.

356
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,336
Is this place worth much?

357
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:47,992
If you were a potential buyer,
I'd say yes, but...

358
00:19:48,476 --> 00:19:49,396
to be honest,

359
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:52,432
there's less than a year left
on the lease. Everybody's...

360
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:55,768
getting electronic readers.

361
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,183
Books are a dying business.

362
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,263
Dana used to curl up on this couch.

363
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:02,364
You know her?

364
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,671
You mind?

365
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:06,592
No.

366
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,416
This safe always open?

367
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:21,556
I have no idea.

368
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:24,277
I don't think
Charley had much of value to lock up.

369
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,690
You hear from SECNAV?

370
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:38,180
So... what was Lieutenant Hutton
working on?

371
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,794
<i>A report for a very select group
of people:</i>

372
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,908
<i> the Joint Chiefs.</i>

373
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:45,042
About?

374
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:47,329
<i>Private military companies.</i>

375
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:50,060
<i>There's been
a lot of negative reaction</i>

376
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:52,042
<i>to the military's
contracting out operations.</i>

377
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:55,801
<i>The lieutenant was point man on a paper</i>
<i>that we cease and desist with...</i>

378
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,568
<i>such arrangements.</i>

379
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,507
<i>I'll send you the report by courier.</i>

380
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,478
I appreciate it.

381
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:05,096
<i>What can you tell me
about Lieutenant Hutton's death?</i>

382
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:06,514
Boss, we got to go.

383
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:09,324
Got to go, Captain.

384
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:18,829
Dana Hutton was doing a story
on private military companies.

385
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:20,718
Add it to the list of coincidences.

386
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,301
- Lieutenant Hutton was murdered.
- How?

387
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:25,382
Look.

388
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,311
We found it.

389
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,214
Mr. Palmer found it, actually...
embedded in the Lieutenant's shoulder.

390
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:35,499
What is it?

391
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,765
It's a spherical metal pellet.

392
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:40,839
It is 1.5 millimeters in diameter.

393
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,913
It's composed of 90% platinum
and 10% iridium.

394
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:45,512
There were two holes drilled in it

395
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:48,903
that created an X-shaped cavity,
and guess what I found in the cavity.

396
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:52,936
He hates it when I ask him to guess.

397
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,269
Traces of ricin.

398
00:21:55,353 --> 00:21:57,665
One of the deadliest toxins
known to man.

399
00:21:57,846 --> 00:22:00,694
Your 21st century Naval Lieutenant

400
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:03,423
was killed by an old,
Cold War-era...

401
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,782
KGB weapon.

402
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:18,951
KGB?

403
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:22,427
It's been SVR since '91.

404
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:24,867
Well, someone's out there
is using one of their old tricks.

405
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:29,002
That's what made me think
of the infamous Umbrella Murder of 1978.

406
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:31,900
Russian dissident
assassinated in England.

407
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,184
Georgi Markov.

408
00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:36,312
Now, while he was standing
at a London bus stop,

409
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,232
a passerby...

410
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:41,401
carrying a folded umbrella
bumped into him.

411
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:44,112
He didn't think much about it until

412
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:46,948
he began to feel ill
about a day later.

413
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:50,257
In fact, he had been injected
with a ricin pellet.

414
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,702
The delivery mechanism

415
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:55,601
was felt to be the spring-loaded tip
of the umbrella.

416
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:58,044
How long does it take
ricin to kill, Duck?

417
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,377
Three, four days.

418
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:02,624
Lieutenant Hutton, like Markov,
wouldn't have known what happened,

419
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,857
and ironically,
if he had made it to the hospital,

420
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:06,301
they couldn't have helped him.

421
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:09,760
There is no antidote.

422
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,348
Thank you, Dr. Mallard.

423
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:20,591
Yesterday morning,
this was a simple car accident.

424
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:23,329
Now we're talking KGB assassination.

425
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,639
You been able to connect
the Lieutenant's murder

426
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:29,478
with the disappearance
of his sister?

427
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:30,533
Maybe.

428
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:34,537
She was preparing a negative piece
on private military companies.

429
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:38,500
Her brother was presenting
a paper to the Joint Chiefs

430
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,726
recommending the government
cut off contracts with them.

431
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:42,918
I'll make some calls.

432
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,770
It's 1:00 in the morning.

433
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:54,445
What are you doing down here?

434
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:56,476
That's none of your business.

435
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,187
I thought you were gonna
start locking your front door.

436
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,276
If I did that,
I'd have no social life.

437
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,269
What are you doing here,
M. Allison Hart?

438
00:24:03,353 --> 00:24:06,277
You didn't seem happy
with my new status at NCIS.

439
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:09,656
And I thought
I covered that so well.

440
00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:16,906
Are we going to have a problem?

441
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,043
It came from the top.
I take orders.

442
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:23,948
Since when?

443
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,242
You know what?
I need to finish this.

444
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:29,634
You never know
when I may need to saw a lady in half.

445
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,097
I heard you were looking
for Dana Hutton.

446
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:37,929
Is that why you're here?

447
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,270
- No.
- Come on.

448
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:43,557
You knew she was investigating
private military contracts

449
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:46,632
like the one owned
by your biggest client, Colonel Bell.

450
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,945
Don't go there, Mr. Gibbs.

451
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,539
He's the one who pays
for your $500 shoes.

452
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:53,109
I take offense.

453
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:54,788
They cost 1,200.

454
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:58,314
And I asked
because Dana is a friend.

455
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:02,292
How close?

456
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,376
Close.

457
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,877
When is the last time you saw her?

458
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:07,881
A week ago.

459
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,527
She wanted to talk.
She had just...

460
00:25:10,846 --> 00:25:12,927
broken up
with her producer boyfriend.

461
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,570
And if you want any more out of me,

462
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:20,102
you're going to have
to ply me with liquor.

463
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:25,629
<i>Going to air in ten minutes.</i>

464
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:27,276
<i>Going to air in ten minutes.</i>

465
00:25:27,816 --> 00:25:30,153
- You find Dana?
- No. I came to see you.

466
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:31,769
Why?

467
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:35,052
Because there are consequences
for misleading federal agents.

468
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:36,906
What are you talking about?

469
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:39,561
Why didn't you tell me
you were involved with Dana?

470
00:25:39,864 --> 00:25:42,790
Really didn't think it was relevant.
Or any of your business.

471
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,393
I'll determine what's relevant.

472
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:47,420
How serious is it?

473
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:51,580
Aside from work,
nothing's ever that serious with Dana.

474
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,468
No one seems to get it.

475
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:56,824
She's not this perfect angel
that everyone sees on TV.

476
00:25:56,908 --> 00:25:57,805
She's a pro.

477
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:01,476
She knows how to work it and
she uses people like the best of 'em.

478
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,394
- She use you?
- Yeah.

479
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,197
I let her.

480
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:06,439
And enjoyed it.

481
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,484
She has even more talent
off screen...

482
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:11,527
What's the matter with you?

483
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,337
I won't take up any more of your time.
But I just want to say that,

484
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:31,130
if you come to Mexico,

485
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,803
I will be your personal host.

486
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,463
You shall see my country
as few people get to see it.

487
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:37,136
I can't wait.

488
00:26:38,604 --> 00:26:39,472
Until then.

489
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,861
- Morning.
- Morning.

490
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:51,992
What was that all about?

491
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:56,948
Alejandro has invited me to Mexico
to speak at a symposium.

492
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:59,038
Don't you love that word?

493
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,166
Symposium.

494
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:04,706
- You're not gonna go, are you?
- Are you kidding me? Why wouldn't I go?

495
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,417
I bet he just wants to find out
how many tats you have.

496
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:10,169
Maybe I have a new one
that you're never going to see.

497
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:12,507
Why'd you call me down here?

498
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:15,327
I cracked the encryption
on Lieutenant Hutton's hard drive.

499
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:21,639
What am I looking at?

500
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:24,553
He was using
his top secret clearance

501
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:27,520
to access old FBI
and CIA transcripts.

502
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:29,992
That is a debriefing of

503
00:27:30,076 --> 00:27:32,442
a KGB defector in 1985.

504
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:34,027
The Year of the Spy.

505
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:36,123
Spies have their own year?

506
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:37,739
More spies were arrested

507
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,325
on U.S. soil in 1985
than a other year in history.

508
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,036
That's why the media dubbed it
Year of the Spy.

509
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,600
You think the Lieutenant

510
00:27:46,684 --> 00:27:49,083
was accessing
intel as part of his work with NIOC?

511
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,461
His C.O. never mentioned it.

512
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:55,340
He's doing it on his own?

513
00:27:57,566 --> 00:28:00,262
Virginia State Police sent this file
along with the autopsy report.

514
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,764
Mr. Bascom's death
was definitely an accident.

515
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:06,200
A car driving
from the opposite direction blew a tire,

516
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,640
crossed the center divider
and it hit him

517
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:10,605
head-on.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.

518
00:28:11,228 --> 00:28:12,398
What did you find?

519
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:19,964
Charley Bascom
was a naturalized citizen.

520
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:23,590
He immigrated to the United States
from Canada, 1963.

521
00:28:23,674 --> 00:28:26,537
His birth certificate indicates
that he was born in Hamilton,

522
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,914
just outside of Toronto.

523
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:31,125
But he died at the age of three.

524
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:32,835
Meningitis.

525
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:35,804
Bogus papers.

526
00:28:37,557 --> 00:28:39,092
Get the autopsy report to Ducky.

527
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:44,931
You talk to Tony?

528
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,809
Late last night.

529
00:28:49,126 --> 00:28:50,853
He went to ZNN this morning.

530
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:55,900
What?

531
00:28:56,898 --> 00:28:59,028
Tony got physical
with Dana's producer.

532
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:05,756
I think he may be obsessed
with this woman.

533
00:29:33,862 --> 00:29:36,706
<i>Hi, this is Dana's cell.
Please leave me a message.</i>

534
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:40,286
Dana, this is Special Agent DiNozzo.

535
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:43,196
Tony DiNozzo. I'm with NCIS.

536
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,408
We've been looking for you
for the past two days.

537
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:49,739
We can help you.

538
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:53,070
Please trust me.

539
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,326
I know this is going to sound crazy,

540
00:29:56,992 --> 00:29:58,382
but I feel like I know you.

541
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,884
You can call me at this number.

542
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:23,713
I'm surprised you did not call me
<i>Laura</i>.

543
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,352
Cop falls for missing woman.

544
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:28,727
1944.

545
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,226
Gene Tierney.

546
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,003
Dana Andrews.

547
00:30:32,642 --> 00:30:35,101
You making a film reference.
Go figure.

548
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:37,627
This is a murder investigation.

549
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,462
Okay? This is not a movie.

550
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:42,340
Dana Hutton is missing
and may be dead like her brother.

551
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:45,092
She's not just gonna walk in
through that door and into your life.

552
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:52,547
What do you got, Duck?

553
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:57,672
My esteemed colleague
in Stafford County, Virginia,

554
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:00,267
did a thorough and well-documented

555
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,610
postmortem of Mr. Bascom.

556
00:31:02,855 --> 00:31:06,822
Since the cause of death
was massive blunt trauma to the skull,

557
00:31:07,338 --> 00:31:09,654
there were detailed photographs
of his head.

558
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:11,369
I had this one enlarged.

559
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:16,206
Notice anything unusual?

560
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:17,803
Looks pink.

561
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:20,461
Yeah, it's a condition
called pink tooth.

562
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,050
It's caused by the use
of an arsenic compound

563
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:25,892
in the mortification of dental pulp

564
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:28,161
prior to endodontic obturation.

565
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:30,101
Jeez, Duck, come on.
English.

566
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,939
Suffice to say, it's a therapy

567
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:36,060
unique to Russia
during the mid-20th century.

568
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,855
Mr. Bascom may have emigrated
from Canada,

569
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,604
but I'll stake my reputation
he was born...

570
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,404
in the Soviet Union.

571
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:57,999
I've consulted with senior
and retired agents

572
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,787
and analysts who specialize
in counterintelligence.

573
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,713
During the height of the Cold War,
there was a legend

574
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,551
of Yuri,
a mole in the Washington area

575
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:08,426
who operated as the banker,

576
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:11,554
funding covert KGB ops in America.

577
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:13,639
Now, some doubted his existence,

578
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,362
but most believed he was real.
They worked up a profile.

579
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:18,978
Charles Bascom fits
that profile to a "T".

580
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,889
Used bookstore
would be a perfect front.

581
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:21,897
It's believed

582
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,942
he kept over 10 million U.S. dollars
in a slush fund.

583
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,760
FBI's thinking that

584
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,614
once the Berlin Wall was torn down,
KGB was disbanded,

585
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:31,157
old Charley Bascom

586
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:34,390
and his money were forgotten about
in the ensuing chaos.

587
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:35,661
Charley was Yuri,

588
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:37,934
then he was a spy.

589
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:41,564
Kind of like Kevin Costner's landlord
in the film <i>No Way Out</i>.

590
00:32:42,446 --> 00:32:43,669
What does that make him,

591
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,963
Dana Hutton
and her brother's handler?

592
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:49,550
Are you suggesting Dana is a spy?

593
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:51,719
I'm just saying,

594
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,304
if I was currently writing a novel,

595
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,797
I couldn't come up
with a better cast of characters.

596
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:57,723
We've got Lieutenant Hutton.

597
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,602
He's a Navy Officer with top-secret

598
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,770
clearance.

599
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:04,773
Tony, she's on a first-name basis
with the President of the United States.

600
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,776
You two are both way off base.

601
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,110
If Bascom was Yuri,

602
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,613
then what happened to the money
after he died in the accident?

603
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,741
Leon,
maybe that's what this is all about.

604
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,410
Come on.
We're going to the bookstore.

605
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,805
Thanks for coming so quickly.

606
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:26,903
No problem.

607
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:31,776
Any word from Dana?

608
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,873
No, ma'am.

609
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:35,030
We'll let you know
when we're through.

610
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:41,380
Check out these vents.
Use the snorkel.

611
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,598
Excuse me for a second.

612
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:47,019
Hello.

613
00:33:47,103 --> 00:33:48,884
Ziva, check behind the books.

614
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:53,152
There have to be thousands of them.

615
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:56,421
Nothing in the vents.

616
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:58,513
Where's Tony?

617
00:33:58,597 --> 00:34:00,623
Have not seen him
since he got the phone call.

618
00:34:01,961 --> 00:34:04,857
Bet he's probably talking to his girl,
Brenda Bittner.

619
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:30,684
Boss, what is that?

620
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:34,530
Something I haven't seen
in a lot of years.

621
00:34:34,828 --> 00:34:36,115
Microfiche.

622
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:38,284
It kind of

623
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:42,037
a 1970s version of one of those memory
plug things that you put in the side

624
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,168
of the computer.

625
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:44,665
Flash drive.

626
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:47,379
Yeah, one of those.

627
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:02,927
That's me.

628
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:06,780
Wasn't sure you'd show.

629
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:12,063
You were,
very convincing on the phone.

630
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,420
So, you said you could help me?

631
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:18,491
Where have you been?

632
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:22,328
Hiding.

633
00:35:25,806 --> 00:35:27,326
I got a panicked

634
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:29,543
phone call from my brother.

635
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,251
He told me not to talk to anyone.

636
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:36,597
He was on his way to the hospital...

637
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,475
but wouldn't say why.

638
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,976
I heard on the news...

639
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:48,740
that he had died.

640
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:52,233
Ricin poisoning.

641
00:35:53,162 --> 00:35:55,694
He was injected
with a microscopic pellet.

642
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,655
Probably didn't even know
it happened.

643
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:02,243
It's an old technique developed
by the KGB during the Cold War.

644
00:36:05,174 --> 00:36:06,205
You all right?

645
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:12,398
Couldn't,

646
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,252
couldn't the doctors
have helped him at all?

647
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:16,350
I mean...

648
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,342
There's no antidote.

649
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:27,757
What else do you know?

650
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:33,158
Your old friend, Charley Bascom,

651
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:35,568
was a deep-cover Soviet agent,

652
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,486
code named Yuri.

653
00:36:39,162 --> 00:36:42,366
Controlled a slush fund
for the KGB worth millions.

654
00:36:46,697 --> 00:36:48,330
And you already know this.

655
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:52,063
Charley's will instructed me
to sell the business.

656
00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:55,546
There's an old safe in the store,

657
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,228
so I had a locksmith open it.

658
00:36:58,801 --> 00:36:59,814
I was...

659
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:03,436
shocked at what I found.

660
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,763
There were Russian documents
and codes.

661
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:10,377
I was baffled.
You know, why...

662
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:12,881
why Charley would have them.

663
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:17,135
So I confide in...

664
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,447
the one person I trusted the most.

665
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:23,424
Your brother.

666
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:31,043
Jeffrey used
his top-secret clearance

667
00:37:31,412 --> 00:37:35,306
to try to make sense of the documents,
and I started researching the old KGB.

668
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:39,340
You could have just gone to the FBI.

669
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:43,338
Charley was...

670
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,159
he was like a father to me.

671
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:51,143
I didn't want to expose him as Yuri
until I was absolutely sure.

672
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:54,269
Was the money in the safe?

673
00:37:56,637 --> 00:37:57,346
No.

674
00:38:02,954 --> 00:38:04,329
But I know where it is.

675
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:16,208
Tony actually found Dana Hutton.

676
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,782
Well, she is even better-looking
in person.

677
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:24,752
Money's hiding in plain sight.

678
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:30,398
Charley converted it into something
he treasured more than anything else.

679
00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:40,587
A leather-bound first edition.

680
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,307
The Collected Works
of William Shakespeare,

681
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:46,323
published in 1623.

682
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,909
In today's market at auction

683
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,143
it could fetch $6 million.

684
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,210
And this.
Could you help me?

685
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,965
You can't judge a book by its cover.

686
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,758
This is the Holy Grail

687
00:39:09,062 --> 00:39:10,180
of book collectors.

688
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:16,061
The complete first edition
Gutenberg Bible

689
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,861
of 1456.

690
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:20,569
It's printed on vellum.

691
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,335
Where did he get this?

692
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,402
Well, according to the Internet

693
00:39:24,808 --> 00:39:26,280
it was stolen by the Nazis

694
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,657
during World War II
and sold on the black market

695
00:39:29,095 --> 00:39:31,382
in the early 1990s for $2.5 million.

696
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:33,809
It's worth ten times that now.

697
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,499
Many of the books in this case
are of significant value.

698
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:39,084
Hell of a story.

699
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,956
Too bad it doesn't have
a happy ending.

700
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:42,713
Jeffrey's dead.

701
00:39:44,154 --> 00:39:45,549
Who killed your brother?

702
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,222
I don't know.

703
00:39:49,673 --> 00:39:50,686
Probably...

704
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:52,973
probably the same person...

705
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:54,850
that killed me.

706
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:02,389
I had to...

707
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:04,717
I had to find out
what happened to Charley, you know.

708
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,825
Sometimes when...

709
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:08,697
I get into a story.

710
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,976
I don't know when to stop.

711
00:40:19,524 --> 00:40:21,168
You made us look good with the FBI.

712
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,954
Fornell says he owes you dinner.

713
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:28,092
Microfiche
was Yuri's accounting ledger.

714
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,563
Recorded dates,

715
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:32,962
names, and the amounts
of every penny he dispersed for the KGB.

716
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,849
From the day
the bookshop opened for business

717
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:38,330
till the last payment in 1991.

718
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:40,502
Most of them are dead,

719
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,815
in prison,
or they were called back to Russia.

720
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:45,484
They would have known
about the money.

721
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:47,285
Maybe one of them is the killer.

722
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:49,863
The Bureau's picking up
the remaining few.

723
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:54,872
There's one name on there
I'm going to pick up.

724
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:05,129
You need to get in again.

725
00:41:05,817 --> 00:41:06,671
No.

726
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,424
Actually,
we found everything we were looking for.

727
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,969
Dana Hutton, the money,
Yuri's files.

728
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:15,220
When Charley Bascom died, you could
have just gone on living your life.

729
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,941
But you're greedy.

730
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:20,769
And you just had to have
that old KGB money.

731
00:41:21,472 --> 00:41:23,673
And you'd kill anybody
that got in your way.

732
00:41:29,774 --> 00:41:31,238
Lieutenant Jeffrey Hutton.

733
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:54,870
How'd it go?

734
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:01,757
She went peacefully.

735
00:42:05,578 --> 00:42:06,592
You okay?

736
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:10,832
Not really.

737
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,373
I broke rule #10...

738
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:22,644
Again.

739
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,401
Never get personally involved
on a case.

740
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:38,338
That's the rule
I've always had the most trouble with.

741
