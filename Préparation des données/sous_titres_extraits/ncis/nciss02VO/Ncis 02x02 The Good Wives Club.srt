1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,520
Hey, Harry...

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,260
Stop! Stop!

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,900
Hey, what's up?

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,780
Throw me a flashlight.

5
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,730
- Agent Gibbs?
- Yeah.

6
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,410
Lieutenant Commander
Willis, Base Security.

7
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,690
Commander Hutchins' day to play golf?

8
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,970
Intestinal virus.

9
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,890
Ah. Special Agent
Todd, McGee and DiNozzo.

10
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,010
How long since anyone's
lived in these units?

11
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,290
Base closed the tract five years ago.

12
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,370
Plans were to convert it to a park.

13
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,530
Cutbacks put it on hold.

14
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,730
Units were becoming a
security and health hazard,

15
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,170
We brought in a private
company to demo it.

16
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,210
When Gibbs introduced us, he
introduced you, then McGee, then me.

17
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,410
Why'd he mention me last?

18
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,450
You are kidding.

19
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,410
No. For Gibbs to mix up the
seniority order like that,

20
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,490
it's just... just
seems weird, that's all.

21
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,690
Well, I don't think it really means...

22
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,770
Toby, no.

23
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,170
I wouldn't put too much stock in it.

24
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:45,970
Why do you say that?

25
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,770
'Cause I don't think it has
anything to do with seniority.

26
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,690
What do you think it has to do with?

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,730
My guess would be level of
intelligence and general competence.

28
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,890
I didn't say anything.

29
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,050
It's what you're thinking, probie.

30
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,730
Soon as we knew what he
had, all work was stopped.

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,890
We contained the scene.

32
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,170
Old bunker?

33
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,370
We don't know what it is.

34
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,170
A little bit more left.

35
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,490
Your other left, McGee.

36
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,090
Sorry, boss.

37
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,570
A little nervous, probie?

38
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,210
Hold it right there.

39
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,570
The tunnel leads to the house.

40
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,530
That's a little weird.

41
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,530
Boss, over here!

42
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,130
Kate, McGee, you're with me.

43
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,250
DiNozzo, wait for Ducky.

44
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,370
Let's do it.

45
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,050
Nails were hammered in
at a left-to-right angle.

46
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,810
Might have been left-handed.

47
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,970
Ever seen anything
like this before, boss?

48
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,970
Only in the movies.

49
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,130
Where's our bride, DiNozzo?

50
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,210
Nine feet down, twelve feet over.

51
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,730
You're kidding, right?

52
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,130
This actually reminds me of my
days at Edinburgh Medical College.

53
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,210
You took a tunnel to
get to school, Ducky?

54
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,170
No, the morgue was tiny.

55
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,970
Yeah, we had a... a fellow student who
suffered terribly from claustrophobia.

56
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,690
Constantly hyperventilating.

57
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,370
Yes, one day, he decided
to overcome his fear.

58
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,530
Eh... he shut himself in
one of the morgue drawers.

59
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,650
Well, the ventilation
was off, of course.

60
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,250
He asked us not to
disturb him for 24 hours.

61
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,090
We were very impressed
with his gumption.

62
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,290
Did it work?

63
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,130
Unfortunately not, no.

64
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,410
He died of a massive coronary.

65
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,610
So, you see, people can
be frightened to death.

66
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,090
Hey, Duck.

67
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,370
This is really sick.

68
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,290
Stephen King would love it.

69
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,970
Oh, my dear.

70
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,410
Get you out of this place.

71
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,610
Into somewhere more appropriate...

72
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,330
I promise.

73
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,290
That was really nice, Doctor.

74
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,010
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

75
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,930
Now, if you'd give me the
bag for transportation.

76
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,370
It's in the... truck.

77
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,730
I know.

78
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,890
Next time, you'll remember.

79
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,250
The Good Wife's Guide.

80
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,170
Ten Steps To Pleasing Your Husband.

81
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,410
I think I read something
like that in Redbook.

82
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,050
Redbook?

83
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,650
Yeah.

84
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,650
You read Redbook?

85
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,970
Yeah, all the time.

86
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,050
Well, I don't think you
read this one, McGee.

87
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,090
It's from May, 1955.

88
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,930
How long's she been here, Duck?

89
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,570
Oh, it's hard to say, Jethro.

90
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,250
Poor thing's been dead for months.

91
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,490
How about years?

92
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,690
Perhaps one...

93
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,810
not more than two.

94
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,970
Housing's been abandoned for five years.

95
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,050
Well, then she wasn't the last tenant.

96
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,970
Check it anyway.

97
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,970
The last tenant in that
house was Lieutenant Commander

98
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,130
Carlton Halpin, his
wife and two children.

99
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,850
Moved out January, '99.

100
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,610
Transferred to the San
Diego Naval Station.

101
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,770
As far as we can tell,
he's never been back.

102
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,330
McGee?

103
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,010
All the materials used in
the construction of the bunker

104
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,730
could've been purchased
at any Lowe's in the area.

105
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,690
DiNozzo?

106
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,970
A lot of the furniture in
the room is authentic '50s

107
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,530
Not my taste, but what the hell.

108
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,170
All from various manufacturers.

109
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,890
Nothing in production today.

110
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,415
The way I figure it,
he would have to have

111
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,490
collected the pieces from
antique shops or garage sales.

112
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,410
What about the possibility they
were handed down from family?

113
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,770
Yeah, I was getting to that.

114
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,090
There is, of course,
always the possibility

115
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,330
that the pieces had been
handed down from family members.

116
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,410
Point is...

117
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,810
either scenario is not a
road that's easily traceable.

118
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,250
Question for you, probie.

119
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,730
Redbook. Why?

120
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,610
Redbook was and still is the definitive
magazine for today's young woman.

121
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,530
Planning a sex change?

122
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,170
No. Since I've always been interested
in women, I figured the best way

123
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,130
to know about them was to,
you know, know about them.

124
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,530
McGee...

125
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,650
the best way to know about
them... is to know them.

126
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,970
Do you think she knew him?

127
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,970
Well, it's difficult to say.

128
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,370
She could have been lured by
a confidant or grabbed by a...

129
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,650
by a stranger.

130
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,010
The result, unfortunately, in the case
of so many women, is the same either way.

131
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,490
Is your recorder on?

132
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,690
Do you want it to be on?

133
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,330
No, do you want it on?

134
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,490
It helps me to be more
accurate in my report.

135
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,490
Well, then turn it on.

136
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,210
It is on.

137
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,770
Then why didn't you just say so?

138
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,890
I'm... n-not sure.

139
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,050
The victim is a
Caucasian woman, 20 to 25.

140
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,570
Cause of death can be attributed
to non-specific asphyxiation.

141
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,330
No obvious signs of sexual trauma.

142
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,410
But due to the dehydration
and mummification of tissue,

143
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,410
it's impossible to say
whether she was violated.

144
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,450
Yeah, but you'd think
that she was though, right?

145
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,170
I mean all-all the stories
that you read about,

146
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,050
these guys, they usually
don't keep girls down in a...

147
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,970
cellar for conversation.

148
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,850
Where do you read these
stories, Mr. Palmer?

149
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,890
I... I-I-I didn't mean
that I actually read them.

150
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,010
I- I meant to
say that-that...

151
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,410
She wore a ring.

152
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,770
A wedding ring?

153
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,970
Yeah, no doubt.

154
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,570
It was removed violently.

155
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,650
MrPalmer...

156
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,610
What stories?

157
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,450
What do you have, Abby?

158
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,290
What don't I have, Gibbs?

159
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,690
Clothing fibers, carpet fibers,
dust, beetle parts, soiled bedding...

160
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,810
There's even a pamphlet
called The Good Wife's Guide.

161
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:42,890
What's up with that?

162
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:43,970
Ask McGee.

163
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,170
McGee?

164
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,170
McGee.

165
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,570
Really.

166
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,930
The dress, Abby?

167
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,850
As you might imagine,
it's not exactly virginal.

168
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,530
It was made in 1952.

169
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,370
She'd wearing it for
months before she died.

170
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,650
And I'm running a DNA sample as we...

171
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,290
Prints?

172
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,610
All over the room.

173
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,770
Thanks to our semi-mummy, I was
able to get a match for our victim.

174
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,530
Your crack team is
running it through AFIS.

175
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,850
Only prints in the room were hers?

176
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,050
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

177
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,210
I found traces of
cleanser on the furniture.

178
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,010
He's cautious.

179
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,530
So am I, when I...

180
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,730
chain guys up.

181
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,970
Victim is Carolyn Figgis.

182
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,810
Petty Officer Third Class. 22.

183
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,330
Went missing 18 months ago.

184
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,570
I pulled the file, Boss.

185
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,730
It was a Pacci case.

186
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,570
Didn't have much.

187
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,050
She left for work one
morning and poof, gone!

188
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,770
No witnesses, case went cold.

189
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,690
Yeah, well, it just got hot again.

190
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,850
Ducky estimates she's
been dead about a year.

191
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,450
That means she was in the bunker
for six months before she died.

192
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,050
That rules out the last tenants.

193
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,810
Kate?

194
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,930
Tell me about the killer.

195
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,010
The basic pathology is obvious.

196
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,410
He was probably abused as a child.

197
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,210
Dad beating on mom; one or
both beating on him, who knows?

198
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,890
He's trying to create
the perfect relationship.

199
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,570
That's right.

200
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,130
And control's the name of the game.

201
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,970
This one didn't live
up to his expectations.

202
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,730
Why y was I sure you'd
understand that part?

203
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,690
So, cut off her air supply, left her in

204
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,010
an airtight chamber to die and moved on.

205
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,530
Yeah, that's the problem.

206
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,090
This kind of pathology is driven.

207
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,610
He's not going to stop until
he finds the perfect one.

208
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,850
He's playing house with
somebody else out there.

209
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,530
Something's off.

210
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,730
Gibbs, I recreated it
from McGee's photos.

211
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,730
Gibbs, everything in here was ALS'd.

212
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,970
All pertinent forensic evidence

213
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,090
was sent to Abby for analysis,

214
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,930
and then I rebuilt it from the photos.

215
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,690
This room and everything in it

216
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,170
is exactly as it was when we found it.

217
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,410
What is with his '50s thing?

218
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,690
The '50s represents

219
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,890
an idealized time

220
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,210
when the rules between men

221
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,370
and women were simpler.

222
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,810
This was an older guy.

223
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,370
Actually, I think he was younger.

224
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,330
As Tony said, a lot of the stuff in here

225
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,530
is authentic '50s,
but a lot of it isn't.

226
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,250
Some is '60s, some are
reproductions, but it isn't pure.

227
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,250
He couldn't get his
hands on the real deal.

228
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,490
I don't think it mattered.

229
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,850
I think he put this room together
based on his idea of a fantasy,

230
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,130
rather than some remembrance
of an ideal experience.

231
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,410
Someone who grew up with
it would be more "pure"?

232
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,770
Well, I think he'd want to be as close

233
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,090
to what he actually
experienced as possible.

234
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,010
Plus, he didn't seem to have a problem

235
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,250
with just picking up and
leaving everything behind.

236
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,930
How do we know he didn't have to leave?

237
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,730
Transferred.

238
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,810
It's possible.

239
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,890
Ducky said her wedding ring was removed.

240
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,730
Well, it makes sense
that'd be the one thing

241
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,210
that he keeps in common
from one "bride" to the next.

242
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,850
You know, it might
help if I could observe

243
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,450
a reenactment of the victim's
life inside the chamber.

244
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,850
Put someone in the wedding dress.

245
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,530
Tony would look cute.

246
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,410
No.

247
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,330
He's interviewing the victim's parents.

248
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,290
Well, McGee, then.

249
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,330
Nope.

250
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,090
He's with Tony.

251
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,570
Abby?

252
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,090
No.

253
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,770
Up to her tats in forensics tests.

254
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,930
Well, what about you?

255
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,250
You won't have to wear the dress.

256
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,730
I hate that song, McGee.

257
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,250
I thought you bought tickets
to see them next week.

258
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:46,890
Changed my mind.

259
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,810
I'm selling them on eBay.

260
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,890
Well, could we listen to something else?

261
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:52,850
Sure.

262
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,930
This isn't about music, is it?

263
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,650
This what?

264
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,650
Whatever it is, it isn't music?

265
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,570
This is your conversation, McGee.

266
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,410
Tony, I'm not after your job.

267
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,850
Do you think I'm actually worried
about you taking my place, probie?

268
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,970
No... I mean, of course not.

269
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,050
How could I be?

270
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,370
You're Gibbs' right-hand guy.

271
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,250
Did Gibbs say that?

272
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,450
Uh... not...

273
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,010
not directly.

274
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,050
Then why did you say that?

275
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,410
Well... well... 'cause I've,
I've heard him say nice things.

276
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,530
What kind of things?

277
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,330
I- I-I don't
remember.

278
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,970
Remember.

279
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,930
Um... okay.

280
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,010
Uh, yesterday.

281
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,210
Yeah?

282
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,690
Yeah. He, uh...

283
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,130
said... something about
filing your case report.

284
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,650
What did he say, exactly?

285
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,090
He said it wasn't late, for once.

286
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,770
This is not what I had in mind, Gibbs.

287
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,370
You wanted a reenactment.

288
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,490
Reenact.

289
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,450
I wanted to observe.

290
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,050
I'm observing.

291
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,170
Okay.

292
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,850
She can make it to the toilet.

293
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,770
But she couldn't make it to
the threshold of the tunnel.

294
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,450
I can't imagine what she
must have gone through, Gibbs.

295
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,450
How many months did she
suffer before giving up

296
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,370
and realizing she was
never gonna be found?

297
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,490
She had no hope.

298
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,850
She had nothing left to do but sit
and stare at her own reflection.

299
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,130
What?

300
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,090
The rug.

301
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,170
The spots.

302
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,450
Someone was standing
there over and over again.

303
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,930
Mm-mm. The pattern's wrong.

304
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,010
It's not from a shoe or foot.

305
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,130
It's too round, too large.

306
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,210
She wasn't standing.

307
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:16,810
She was kneeling.

308
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,250
Enough to permanently wear
an indentation in the carpet.

309
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,050
Praying.

310
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:30,250
Praying.

311
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,130
Polopinus Ingens, commonly
known as the darkling beetle.

312
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,010
As with all beetles, the
darkling has two sets of wings.

313
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,850
One set of hard front wings and a set
of soft hind wings, used for flying.

314
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,410
This is going to be useful, Abby, why?

315
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,570
Gibbs, I know you know that I need a
good windup before I deliver my knockout.

316
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,570
Just hit me with it, baby.

317
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,450
Okay.

318
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,010
This particular species of darkling
is indigenous only in extreme

319
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,290
Southeast Georgia and Northeast Florida.

320
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,210
What's it doing in Virginia?

321
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,090
My guess?

322
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,330
Somebody stepped on it.

323
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,450
A piece of it got lodged
in her shoe and then

324
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,050
it dislodged in Mr. Sicko's love nest.

325
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,210
Very Silence Of The
Lambs, don't you think?

326
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,530
Our nasty little critter could've
called any one of three Navy bases home:

327
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,530
Jacksonville Naval Air Station or
Mayport Naval Station in Florida;

328
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,290
Naval Submarine Base,
Kings Bay, Georgia.

329
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,890
We have a piece of a beetle
that shouldn't be in Virginia.

330
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,170
It doesn't mean that the guy
who did this is there now.

331
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,130
Didn't say it did.

332
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,490
No, she's right, boss.

333
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,290
I mean, he could've just been
there on vacation, who knows?

334
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,410
Could've been.

335
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,490
He still could be here.

336
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,010
Except nobody else is
missing from Norfolk.

337
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,930
Somebody is from Jacksonville.

338
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,450
She fits the profile.

339
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,450
NCIS Agent Jane Melankovic
forwarded a Missing

340
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,850
Persons Report she filed
on a female petty officer.

341
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,970
Barbara Swain, Petty Officer
Second Class at Jacksonville.

342
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,170
She's been missing
for almost four months.

343
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,050
She's close in age to
Carolyn Figgis; similar look.

344
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,690
Same deal, too—disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

345
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,370
Never made it to work.

346
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,610
No witnesses, no clues, case went dead.

347
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,530
Get us on the next flight
to Jacksonville and tell

348
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,290
Agent Melankovic we think her
victim might still be alive on base.

349
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,290
On it, boss.

350
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,770
Pretty thin, Gibbs.

351
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,850
All we've got, Kate.

352
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,170
The Seahawk's still searching for
thermal anomalies on the ground surface.

353
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,170
Been sweeping for a long
time, Agent Melankovic.

354
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,170
At this altitude, they're
working 150-foot swatches.

355
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,290
It's time-consuming but more accurate.

356
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,850
Hungry again, Tony?

357
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,250
Actually, no, Kate.

358
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,170
I... I'm just bored.

359
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,730
I had something to eat on the plane.

360
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,250
Not sure what I ate, but it was filling.

361
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,890
You had the chicken Singapore
with port mushroom sauce.

362
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,930
Something you read in Redbook, McGee?

363
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,770
Ladies' Home Journal, actually.

364
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,690
The Food and Home section?

365
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,810
Yeah, that's right.

366
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:48,930
The best.

367
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,330
Oh, no question.

368
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,490
McGee, right?

369
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,730
Timothy.

370
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:54,690
Jane.

371
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,690
Me Tony.

372
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,970
Oh, looks like they're picking
up a thermal signature; it's warm.

373
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,890
Warm is good.

374
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,250
Let's go!

375
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,810
Whoa, whoa, don't shoot!

376
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,935
Don't shoot!

377
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,410
Please don't shoot!

378
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,930
Petty Officer Third Class Darrell Baum.

379
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,050
Works in Avionics.

380
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,850
Claims he was growing
for his own personal use.

381
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,050
What do you think?

382
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,530
Well, there's over 200 plants, boss.

383
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,770
Gotta think he's spreading the love.

384
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,850
I am pretty sure Darrell's
cutting into his profit margin.

385
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,530
There's nothing here.

386
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,370
Doesn't look like it.

387
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,170
Says he started over three months ago.

388
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,330
Size of the weeds indicates
that would be about right.

389
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,650
And you'd know this because...?

390
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,970
Of my experiences with the
Baltimore PD Drug Task Force.

391
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,010
You were never on the
Baltimore PD Drug Task Force.

392
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,770
I have friends; we shared experiences.

393
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,370
Actually, Darrell does seem
to be on the level, boss.

394
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,770
Oh, and you know this, why, McGee?

395
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:19,930
From personal knowledge?

396
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,850
No. No, no, no.

397
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,610
I- I mean, you know, there was the
occasional, uh, innocent youth, experimenta...

398
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,170
Commander Spencer would
like to see you, sir.

399
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,410
Let me guess.

400
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:31,970
You never inhaled.

401
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,770
I inhaled.

402
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:34,530
Yeah?

403
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,330
Yeah. Once. A little bit.

404
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,970
How was it?

405
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,450
I didn't like it.

406
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,290
You didn't like it?

407
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,130
No.

408
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,050
He didn't inhale.

409
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,170
All 423 houses have been
analyzed, Agent Gibbs.

410
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,890
No heat signatures other than
this one have been recorded.

411
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,050
Okay with you if I recall the helo?

412
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,810
What now, Gibbs?

413
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:06,010
Well,

414
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,290
I guess we just give up, Agent Todd.

415
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,815
Shove the forensics water on our mummified bride.

416
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:31,290
Except for the prints nothing in the
underground chamber is really speaking to me.

417
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,490
The carpet fiber indicates a cheap
nylon product, available anywhere.

418
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,290
The analysis of the
accumulated dust only indicates

419
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,450
that our sicko murderer
wasn't any better a housekeeper

420
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,810
than he was a pretend husband.

421
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,850
Clothes fibers.

422
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,890
White cotton, probably
socks and purple silk.

423
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,170
Don't know what that's about.

424
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,330
Maybe a scarf or an ascot kind of thing.

425
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,970
How many guys wear ascots today?

426
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,850
I have.

427
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,130
You would.

428
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,610
Okay. Thanks, Abbs.

429
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,210
Oh, anything for you,
oh, Wonderful Wizard.

430
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,250
By the way, Tony...

431
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,090
Yeah?

432
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,130
I need it back when you're done.

433
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,170
Files you requested.

434
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,410
All transfers from Norfolk
over the past six months.

435
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,170
Put them over there, Agent Melankovic.

436
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,290
Hey, we appreciate the use of your desk.

437
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,850
Not a problem.

438
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,530
You finding everything all right?

439
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,730
Yeah, DiNozzo there sure found
the nuts without much trouble.

440
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,970
I haven't eaten since the plane.

441
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,850
I hope you don't mind.

442
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,130
I do, actually.

443
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,290
They're for my sister.

444
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:32,810
Oh, sorry.

445
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,290
But... probably for the best.

446
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,210
So fattening.

447
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,210
I'm sure you know that from
all your food magazine reading.

448
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,530
She's anorexic.

449
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,930
According to the Missing
Persons report, the last person

450
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,450
to see Petty Officer
Swain was her roommate.

451
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,370
That's right.

452
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,650
Petty Officer Debra Marshall.

453
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,970
She still on base?

454
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,290
Mechanic in Motor-T.

455
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,970
All right, Kate, you're with me.

456
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,330
DiNozzo, you're with McGee.

457
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,290
McGee. Yep.

458
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,730
Help her with the transfers.

459
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,410
Agent Gibbs...

460
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,170
I did the initial
interview with the roommate.

461
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,410
Yeah.

462
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,370
I know.

463
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,970
- Petty Officer Marshall?
- Yeah.

464
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,250
NCIS.

465
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,330
Is it about Barbara, ma'am?

466
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,090
Yes.

467
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,530
Have yound her?

468
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,330
No.

469
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,850
You don't expect her to be found alive?

470
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,810
I was told the odds get
worse the longer a person

471
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,890
goes missing, sir.

472
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,530
Well, yeah. That's true.

473
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,970
Agent Melankovic might have gone over
this ground with you before, but...

474
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:39,730
No problem, ma'am.

475
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,850
You last saw your roommate when
she left for work four months ago.

476
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,890
It was 0600, sir.

477
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,370
She worked here in Admin.

478
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,450
That's how we met.

479
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,890
Was there anyone acting strange
around her, any arguments

480
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,130
or disputes you might know about?

481
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,850
No, ma'am.

482
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,450
Everybody liked Barbara.

483
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,210
Even likable people have beefs.

484
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,770
So I'm told.

485
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,770
Was there anything particular
on her mind at the time?

486
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,410
Nothing other than what
was always on her mind.

487
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,810
Guys.

488
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,970
She was hung up that she
couldn't find the right one.

489
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,210
She wanted to get married.

490
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,930
In the worst way, sir.

491
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,250
Except all the guys she met were losers.

492
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,890
She thought something
must be wrong with her.

493
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,850
Even mentioned she might
even see somebody about it.

494
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:26,530
Did she?

495
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,530
I don't know.

496
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,610
She was a really private person.

497
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,970
Did you ever meet any of the losers?

498
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,890
No, sir.

499
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,170
I couldn't even tell you their names.

500
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,370
I doubt Barbara could, either.

501
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,210
CPO Alan Drewe.

502
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,050
Transferred from Norfolk two months ago.

503
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:45,890
Left-handed.

504
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,210
Father was a drywall sub-contractor.

505
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,530
He could've built a bunker.

506
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,650
Captain Marshall Buckner.

507
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,690
Right-handed, but
heads up a Seabee crew,

508
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,930
and has a domestic disturbance
charge on his record.

509
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,650
Transferred last May.

510
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,730
"Always respond enthusiastically
"to your husband's amorous advances.

511
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:04,650
"It's a wife's duty to make
sure his physical needs are met."

512
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,090
You know, except for the
murder/abduction part,

513
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,370
I kind of think this
guy's onto something.

514
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,690
I can't believe you said that.

515
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,610
Why?

516
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,130
It's sexist and insensitive
and what the hell

517
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,970
does it have to do
with our investigation?

518
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,250
Do you know, Timothy?

519
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,210
Answer Jane, Timothy.

520
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,130
The real question is,
do you find it pertinent?

521
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,210
Every bit as pertinent to this
investigation as those files, probie.

522
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:37,730
It is?

523
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,490
Speaks to the suspect's state of mind.

524
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,770
Tony, with all due respect, I think
it speaks to the state of your...

525
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,290
With all due respect, probie!

526
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,610
How much time do you have in the field?

527
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,970
Not a lot, of course.

528
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,690
Exactly, because you're a
probationary field agent.

529
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,570
I know it can be confusing sometimes.

530
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,130
I'm actually not confused.

531
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,930
Oh, you just think you're not confused.

532
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,010
In reality, you're very confused.

533
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:10,370
And that contradiction is what makes
the whole situation seem, um, more...

534
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,930
Confusing.

535
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,330
Exactly.

536
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,450
Just because she didn't
see a Navy therapist

537
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,050
doesn't mean she wasn't
seeing someone off base.

538
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,010
She's a Petty Officer.

539
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,690
Civilian shrinks are expensive.

540
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,290
Private people go to
long lengths sometimes.

541
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,210
Sometimes.

542
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,890
Sometimes they don't have to.

543
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,850
Bit's in your mouth, Gibbs.

544
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,170
She didn't have to see a shrink.

545
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,410
Okay.

546
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,770
Second divorce.

547
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,210
Saw the padre.

548
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,890
Chaplains don't keep records.

549
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,170
Yes, I saw her.

550
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,050
Only once, though.

551
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,250
We know that whatever you
discussed is confidential,

552
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,210
but her life could hang in the balance.

553
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,970
What happened to the woman in
Norfolk could be happening to her.

554
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:59,610
Petty Officer Swain didn't say much.

555
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,210
In fact, I did most of the talking.

556
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,770
What were her issues?

557
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,130
She s attracted to men
who fulfilled her needs

558
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,770
on a physical level,
but not a spiritual one.

559
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,410
And I tried to make her see

560
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,010
they didn't need to
be mutually exclusive.

561
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,530
It's a difficult
concept in today's world.

562
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,810
Did she mention any
of those men by name?

563
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,650
No, she met them in bars.

564
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,210
I got the impression they
weren't around very long.

565
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,450
She was supposed to call
and make another appointment.

566
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,050
Never did.

567
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,090
Well, this one's not left-handed
either, but everything else fits.

568
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,450
DiNozzo.

569
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,890
How's it going with the transfers?

570
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,610
Uh, almost finished, boss.

571
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,810
We've ID'd 15 that fit a
substantial part of the profile.

572
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,530
Put down The Good Wife's
Guide and listen up.

573
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,130
Padre thinks says Petty Officer Swain

574
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,170
could have met this guy at a local bar.

575
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,850
lit up, canvass the area.

576
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,090
See if a bartender can make
a connection to one of 'em?

577
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,410
I'll make copies of
their service photos.

578
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,370
Uh, DiNozzo?

579
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,450
Yeah?

580
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,490
Make the copies yourself.

581
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,650
Of course.

582
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,050
You're sure about this, DiNozzo?

583
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,690
All in his SRB, boss:

584
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,250
Left-handed, transferred
six months ago.

585
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,250
From where?

586
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,610
Norfolk.

587
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,730
Boss, you remembhat Abby
said about the clothes fibers?

588
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,450
Chaplains sometimes wear a vestment
called a stole over their uniform.

589
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,490
It's a band of silk
cloth hung ad ne Silk.

590
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,050
color of the stole depends
on the liturgical season.

591
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,290
It can be red, or green, or white...

592
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,770
or purple.

593
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,930
It wasn't Petty Officer Carolyn
Figgis who was praying, was it?

594
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,690
No.

595
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,430
After your interview, he must have
sensed it was just a matter of time.

596
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,990
What do you know about him, Commander?

597
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,150
Not much.

598
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,190
He was Episcopal-
I'm Catholic.

599
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,790
Only time I ever met
h s at the Navy Ball.

600
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,910
Seemed normal to me.

601
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,070
Yeah.

602
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:58,910
Usually do.

603
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,750
Medical examiner's on the way.

604
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,710
I'll get the search
helo back in the air.

605
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,550
I wonder what Ducky would
say to this piece of work.

606
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,190
He'd ask Evans where he's
keeping Petty Office Swain.

607
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,750
I said I'm gonna get married.

608
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,670
John said he's gonna get married.

609
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,510
That's great!

610
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,990
That's wonderful, John.

611
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,030
You're the one who convinced me, Oz.

612
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,190
Why this delightful home,
wonderful family, devoted wife.

613
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,630
Ah, this is the way a man should live.

614
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,870
I didn't realize what I'd
been missing all these years.

615
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,990
What are you watching?

616
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,070
Ozzie and Harriet.

617
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,350
Ran for 14 years, 435 episodes.

618
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,670
Why am I not surprised
you would know that?

619
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,550
I have the "best of" box set at home.

620
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:41,870
It's really good.

621
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,110
Where'd you find those?

622
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,470
Uh, found them stashed under the settee.

623
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,630
The settee?

624
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,910
It's a small sofa with seating for two.

625
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,390
Sold mine at a garage sale last year.

626
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,550
Are you gonna watch
the whole hour, or...?

627
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,150
They were a half-hour,
McGee, and what if I do?

628
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,950
I guess that would mean you're trying
to figure the suspect's state of mind?

629
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,830
Ha! We're gonna make a field agent

630
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,710
out of you yet, Probie.

631
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,910
DiNozzo!

632
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,790
Flipped on the light
switch- look what I got.

633
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,630
Well, it's either a darkroom,
or a really small bordello.

634
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,510
What's your call?

635
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,870
Have you always been a
smart ass, Agent DiNozzo?

636
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,390
Tony. Probably as long as you've
been an overachiever, Jane.

637
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,750
He might have pictures
somewhere around here...

638
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,750
to remind him.

639
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,030
He might.

640
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,110
Are you ready to find
where Ozzie stashed Harriet?

641
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,710
The Chaplain could have hidden
her in a number of places

642
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,990
the thermal scanner wouldn't pick up.

643
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,510
We have unoccupied housing,
training and maintenance units,

644
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,150
as well as boiler rooms here and here.

645
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,310
Base housing storage
is another possibility.

646
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,590
Several abandoned ammo
dumps in this quadrant,

647
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,750
and an ammo bunker's in this one here.

648
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,910
Jacksonville N.A.S.
is almost 4,000 acres.

649
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,230
Hundreds of buildings.

650
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,750
It'll take us days to search them all.

651
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,230
Then we'd better start now.

652
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,390
How much time does she have?

653
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,510
If he cuts off the O2 like he
did the others, a few hours.

654
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,790
"My Darling, my betrothed.
I long for the day

655
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,390
we will be together always..."

656
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,510
Must be more than 50
of these love letters.

657
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,270
All sounding like
Nelson Eddy recordings.

658
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,550
That guy was on the air for 14
years singing lyrics like that?

659
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,310
Different Nelson.

660
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,470
Not Ozzie Nelson, Nelson Eddy.

661
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,390
Do you have his collection, too?

662
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,990
The Forgotten Recordings.

663
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,110
You, you seem to have an awful
lot in common with this...

664
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,350
She's not Petty Officer Figgis or Swain.

665
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,750
And neither is this one.

666
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,950
There's Figgis.

667
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,870
God, she looks terrified.

668
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,710
Here's Swain.

669
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,030
Where did he hide you,
Petty Officer Swain?

670
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,710
I'll scan the prints,
upload them to Abby.

671
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,190
Wish we had the negatives.

672
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,870
Probie.

673
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,110
Negatives.

674
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,430
When I was a kid I used to
hide stuff in my record player.

675
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,710
Nice work...

676
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:08,910
hotshot.

677
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,870
Some of these prints were
enlarged from the negatives.

678
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,990
I think you'll find this
one very interesting.

679
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,310
Okay, this is Petty Officer
Swain's photo from the album.

680
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,950
Now look at the full negative.

681
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,590
There's much more visible in the
background now around the bed,

682
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,470
and there's some sort
of door to the left.

683
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,070
Abbs, can you blow that up?

684
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,790
Lighten it?

685
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,550
Oh, yeah.

686
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,150
It's a riveted door frame.

687
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,550
That's an ammo bunker.

688
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,910
You're right, Gibbs.

689
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,510
These ammo bunkers are
the only underground

690
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,150
structures on the base
with riveted doors.

691
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:52,830
How many?

692
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,230
Six bunkers, all with multiple corridors

693
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,630
and up to a hundred compartments each.

694
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,790
Some units have bar
locks, others padlocks.

695
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,470
They've been vacated so long,
couldn't get access to a master key.

696
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,510
We'll need bolt cutters.

697
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,030
Got 'em.

698
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,910
The search dogs won't be
here for another half-hour.

699
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,670
We can't wait.

700
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,110
Kate. McGee. DiNozzo.

701
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,350
Take Bunker Two. Thanks.

702
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,470
Melankovic, you're with me.

703
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,190
We'll take Bunker Three.

704
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,590
Clear.

705
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,270
Clear.

706
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:39,750
Clear.

707
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,030
Kate.

708
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,910
I hear tapping.

709
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,270
Petty Officer Swain?!

710
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:34,990
Open it.

711
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,750
Ready?

712
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,430
Bunker One is cleared.

713
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,510
What's everyone's status?

714
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,190
McGee and I are almost done in Two.

715
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,950
I got a couple more, boss.

716
00:36:59,350 --> 00:36:59,990
Keep me posted.

717
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:00,550
Yup.

718
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,910
Petty Officer Swain.

719
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,230
You all right?

720
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:26,790
Where's Brett?

721
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,230
Well, you don't have to worry about him.

722
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:31,670
He's dead.

723
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,630
You're safe now.

724
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,870
Okay?

725
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:41,710
Boss.

726
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:42,790
DiNozzo.

727
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,030
I got her.

728
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,630
Bunker Two, Corridor "C."

729
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,710
She's all right, but...

730
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,910
DiNozzo?

731
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,710
Tony? Tony, you there?

732
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:08,950
Kate?

733
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,310
Is it true?

734
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,030
Brett's dead?

735
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,550
Put the gun down, Petty Officer.

736
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,150
We were supposed to get married.

737
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,550
I don't think I can go on without him.

738
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,230
Kate?

739
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,270
You've done everything that
Brett's asked, haven't you?

740
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,550
I have.

741
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,270
You wouldn't want to
disappoint him, would you?

742
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:48,950
No.

743
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,310
Doesn't the guide say that the good wife

744
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,270
must carry on in her husband's absence?

745
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,870
Let me show you.

746
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,710
How's your head?

747
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,550
Still throbbing.

748
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,350
You know what bongos are?

749
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,350
Yeah.

750
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,550
Well a beatnik is
playing them in my head.

751
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,630
You finally met the perfect '50s woman

752
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,630
and she almost kills you, DiNozzo.

753
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,310
She was so obedient.

754
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,950
Yeah, scary how
impressed you are by that.

755
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,830
I find it hard to believe how Chaplain
Evans could have such power over her.

756
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,310
Classic Stockholm Syndrome.

757
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,470
She formed an emotional
attachment to her captor.

758
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,030
It'll take her time, but she'll recover.

759
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,310
DiNozzo, Kate, McGee, M-TAC now!

760
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,510
DiNozzo, Kate, McGee...

761
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,310
DiNozzo, Kate...

762
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,870
McGee...

763
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,350
Beatnik gone?

764
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,190
Yeah.

765
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,790
Cool.
