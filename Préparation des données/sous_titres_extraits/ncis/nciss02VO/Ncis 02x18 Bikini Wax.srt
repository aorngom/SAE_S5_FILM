1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,620
What's going on, Virginia beach?

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,500
Yo, yo

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,940
Y'all ready to get this started?

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,300
Are you ready?

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,620
Hey, how you feeling?

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,785
Maybe you didn't hear me.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,700
I said, how are you
feeling, Virginia Beach?

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,420
All right.

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,980
Y'all ready for me to
bring out these women?!

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,500
All right, all right, let's get started.

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,020
Our first contestant is a teacher,
and enjoys long, hard... math problems.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,860
Please give a warm welcome to Monica.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,780
God bless you, baby.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,620
All right, our next
young lady is a Capricorn,

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,780
and one of Jamel's personal favorites.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,540
Say hello to Tina.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,140
Our third contestant is a Navy girl.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,540
So stand at attention, boys.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,100
This is the beautiful Tiffany.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,580
Do we have a contestant number three?

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,940
Well, apparently, Tiffany
had some place better to be.

22
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,420
What's new, pussycat?

23
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,300
Hey, Tony.

24
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,180
Diggin' the tie. Is it new?

25
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,700
Yeah.

26
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,900
I just got it last weekend.

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,580
It's Zegna.

28
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,580
I like.

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,540
I'm glad.

30
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,780
Paid over a hundred bucks for it.

31
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,700
Why do you always do that?

32
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,420
What?

33
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,580
You always have to announce how
much you paid for your clothes.

34
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,500
It's weird.

35
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,740
What's weird?

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,620
Abby asked me a question about my tie.

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,700
I answered.

38
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,780
It's called a conversation, Kate.

39
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,500
No. Abby asked you if it was new.

40
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,860
She didn't ask you how
much you paid for it.

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,180
The two things have no correlation.

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,180
Yeah, if I didn't pay for it,

43
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,220
then it wouldn't be new now, would it?

44
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,980
Look, what is the
point of bragging to us

45
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,220
about how much you
spend on your clothes?

46
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,980
We work with you.

47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,340
We all know how much you make.

48
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,820
I don't.

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,500
Look, all I'm trying to say is

50
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,700
that it's not very professional.

51
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,340
Gibbs would never walk in here

52
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,060
and tell us how much
he paid for his shirt.

53
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,380
That's because the prices have been

54
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,340
pretty consistent at
Sears since the late '70s.

55
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,860
We have a body in Virginia Beach.

56
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,780
McGee?

57
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,380
Yeah.

58
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,220
Call Ducky.

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,980
You got it.

60
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,140
Hey, uh, boss, have you
had a chance to sign off

61
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,460
on that missing persons
report I gave you?

62
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,460
No, DiNozzo, I haven't.

63
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,940
I tried to get to it last night,
but Sears was having a sale.

64
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,100
So when you found the
body, you were alone?

65
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:28,940
I give it five seconds.

66
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,900
Until what?

67
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,300
Until he notices there was...

68
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,540
Bikini contest?!

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,220
It's over, DiNozzo.

70
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,140
Gear up.

71
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,620
Agent Gibbs?

72
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,780
Lieutenant Sommers,
Virginia Beach Police.

73
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,700
I assume you want to take this one.

74
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,340
You assume correctly, Lieutenant.

75
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,700
As soon as we found her Norfolk

76
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,140
I.D. card, we cleared out.

77
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,420
I brought in extra men
just to seal off the area.

78
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,540
Bikini doesn't leave
much room for an I.D.

79
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,420
There was a small beach bag
next to her in the stall.

80
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,660
What is Volt Entertainment?

81
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,340
It's a local cable
channel that caters to men.

82
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,820
They air all of the contests.

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,900
I'll get a dub.

84
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,860
Who discovered the body?

85
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,940
An elderly woman at about 1400.

86
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,620
She notified one of
my men shortly after.

87
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,020
She was pretty frantic.

88
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:16,860
Where is she?

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,620
She's in my car back there.

90
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,580
You don't want to see her, Agent Gibbs?

91
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,580
Kate.

92
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,260
He's not really one for chit-chat.

93
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,060
I can see that.

94
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,980
Are there any more girls
from the bikini contest?

95
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,740
Hey.

96
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,700
DiNozzo!

97
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,860
Right behind you, boss!

98
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,380
That is one hell of a swirlie.

99
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,220
S wirlie?

100
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,060
You take the kid by the ankles,
dunk him in the toilet, then flush.

101
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,260
Usually reserved for dorks.

102
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,700
Does it look familiar, Probie?

103
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,420
I don't think so.

104
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,300
Noogies,

105
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,620
sure. Wedgies, an occasional
melvin, but, uh, no...

106
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,780
If you two don't start
working, I will show you hazing.

107
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,220
And the Marine Corps does not
do wedgies or noogies or melvins.

108
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,340
Thank you, boss.

109
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,100
DiNozzo, measure and
sketch these footprints.

110
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,100
You think she made 'em, boss?

111
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,580
Well, they match her shoes.

112
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
Not smudged.

113
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,660
No sign of panic.

114
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,740
Think she went to the
toilet voluntarily?

115
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,460
No sign of a struggle.

116
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,740
No bruises on her arms or neck.

117
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,460
Why wouldn't she run or fight back?

118
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,260
Maybe she didn't have a chance to.

119
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,020
She could have been in the vomiting
position when she was attacked.

120
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
That's good, DiNozzo.

121
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,580
Thanks, boss.

122
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,460
Now get on the floor and
start sketching the footprints.

123
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,060
It's a public restroom, boss.

124
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,380
It's really disgusting.

125
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:40,980
It could be worse.

126
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,700
How could it be worse?!

127
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
Could be a men's room.

128
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,980
Ah, Jethro.

129
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,220
Hey, Duck.

130
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,860
DiNozzo and McGee'll be
done in a few minutes.

131
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,820
Oh, no hurry.

132
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,860
It takes time to do
detailed and concise work.

133
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,060
Mr. Palmer here finishes
his work quite quickly.

134
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,340
Thank you, Doctor.

135
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,100
People, please clear the boardwalk.

136
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,700
Well, thank you, Sergeant Klein.

137
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,940
You have been very helpful.

138
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,260
My pleasure.

139
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,100
Thanks.

140
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,140
Her name was Petty
Officer Tiffany Jordan.

141
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,900
Her C.O. said she was deployed on
the USS Monroe for the last 57 days.

142
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,340
Ship returned to port
yesterday at about this time.

143
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,260
What did the witness say?

144
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,380
She doesn't usually
use public rest rooms.

145
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,260
Has a phobia.

146
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,820
Well, this won't help.

147
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,180
Victim's address?

148
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,860
9375 Rosewood Drive, Norfolk.

149
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,580
Come on, let's go.

150
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,700
She is all yours, boys.

151
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,620
Thank you, gentlemen.

152
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,420
Mr. Palmer...

153
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,220
I love the beach.

154
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,500
Reminds me of college.

155
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,820
I thought you went to Ohio State.

156
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,780
I'm talking about spring break, Probie.

157
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Every year my buddies and I hop in
the car and head down to Panama City.

158
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,460
Yeah, at MIT, we never did
the whole spring break thing.

159
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,660
Go figure.

160
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,700
Hey, so was it as wild
as it looks on MTV?

161
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,140
Probie, my stories alone
could make you a man.

162
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,820
Something wrong, Doctor?

163
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,380
Her head is in the toilet, Mr. Palmer.

164
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,620
Right. Sorry.

165
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,020
I've just never seen
you hesitate before.

166
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,300
Well, when a person is as experienced as

167
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,140
I am, it's rare to come across
something you've never seen before.

168
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,740
How long has she been here?

169
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,300
Roughly two, maybe three hours.

170
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,340
That is incredible.

171
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,740
You know, you-you have a real gift.

172
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,140
Give yourself time, Mr. Palmer.

173
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,460
I've been doing this since long before
you were a twinkle in your mother's eye.

174
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,580
Or even your mother's mother.

175
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,980
You know, some people find it strange...

176
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,940
our profession.

177
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,260
Yes, so I've heard.

178
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,220
Did you ever consider
another line of work?

179
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,220
I suppose so.

180
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,860
Yes, I think there comes a time

181
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,140
in everybody's life
when they stop and wonder

182
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,780
if what they're doing is meaningful.

183
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
It's only healthy.

184
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,500
Really? What other kind
of, uh, career did you...?

185
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,460
Shortly after I graduated
from Edinburgh Medical School,

186
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,140
I gave serious consideration
to a career in teaching.

187
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,980
Yes, in fact, I-I heard there was
a vacancy at Eton, my alma mater.

188
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,100
I almost applied.

189
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,940
Well, why didn't you...?

190
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,860
I loved the idea of
teaching the world's youth.

191
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,100
Yeah.

192
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,340
But then I realized that deep
down, academia was not for me.

193
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,940
I could never picture myself giving
those long, rambling, esoteric lectures.

194
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,420
Me, either, Doctor.

195
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,540
Well, let's get you
out of here, my dear.

196
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,820
She keeps a clean place.

197
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,660
Yeah.

198
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,220
Well, she probably
didn't see much of it.

199
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,860
Battling the Bulge by Jeff Drixon.

200
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,700
Looks to me like Jeff
is losing the battle.

201
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,900
How to Lose 15 Pounds in
15 Days, Losing is a Choice.

202
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,260
They're all weight-loss books.

203
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,420
These are all workout videos.

204
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,460
Preoccupied with weight loss,
vomiting before her attack.

205
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,540
Sounds like an eating disorder.

206
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,140
Gibbs, take a look at this.

207
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,220
"Tiff, I hope you enjoyed my letters.

208
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,220
"I live for the day
that we can be together.

209
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,340
Love, Jon."

210
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,180
Romantic.

211
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,340
Flowers are fresh.

212
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,460
And he delivered them himself.

213
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,860
How do you know that?

214
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,860
The florists put their
insignia on their cards.

215
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,460
This card is blank.

216
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,860
Don't you ever get flowers?

217
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,260
Don't like gifts that require attention.

218
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,260
These are all bills
from before she left.

219
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,180
Where are the letters?

220
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,300
You think she trashed them?

221
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,860
She never got them.

222
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,900
She's been at sea for
the past two months.

223
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,380
Right. So, yesterday, she should
have returned home to a stack of mail.

224
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,100
She did what people do
when they take a trip.

225
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,100
She had her mail stopped.

226
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,340
Where have you been?

227
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,580
I missed lunch, so I decided
to go out for a snack. Why?

228
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,620
We're heading to the USS Monroe.

229
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,820
I set up an interview with Petty
Officer Jordan's former rack mate.

230
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,540
Can I have two minutes to eat?

231
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,740
You get anything for me?

232
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,460
No. I had a few dollars.

233
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,860
Then there's no time.

234
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,740
No food in the truck.

235
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,820
What?!

236
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,980
Gibbs' rules, not mine.

237
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,860
On second thought, I think the rule
is that there's no eating in Autopsy.

238
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,980
The truck's okay.

239
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,700
Why are you breathing like that?

240
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,500
What's wrong with you?

241
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,020
I'm not feeling so hot.

242
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,140
I don't like boats.

243
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,020
It's not a boat, it's a ship.

244
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,860
And it's docked.

245
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,100
Doesn't matter.

246
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,700
As soon as I get on the water, I
immediately start feeling queasy.

247
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,900
Well, that's not a good trait for
someone who investigates the Navy.

248
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,300
Oh. I'm feeling dizzy.

249
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,020
Well, it's a good thing
you didn't eat that burger.

250
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,300
Could've been embarrassing.

251
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,500
I can't believe this happened, sir.

252
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,940
She was such a great person.

253
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,460
Do you know of anyone that may
have been angry with Tiffany?

254
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,580
Not at all.

255
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,740
Tiff was friends with everyone.

256
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,300
We all loved her.

257
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,500
Sir, are you sure you're okay?

258
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,940
Oh, yeah. No.

259
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,860
I- I just haven't
gotten my sea legs yet.

260
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,060
Can I get you anything?

261
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,220
Some Dramamine maybe?

262
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,100
Well, I already took six.

263
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,540
You know what, I'll be fine.

264
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,740
Don't worry about me.

265
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
Had Tiffany been sick?

266
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,500
I don't think so. Why?

267
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,300
It appears she may have been
vomiting when she was attacked.

268
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,780
Is there something we should know?

269
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,820
Yeah, it's hot...

270
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,860
She came to me about a month
ago and said there was something

271
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,020
that could potentially
ruin her career in the Navy.

272
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,780
What do we have, Duck?

273
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,220
Well, no shortage of water in her lungs.

274
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,180
She definitely drowned.

275
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,140
Any internal damage?

276
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,700
Yeah, her esophagus is quite worn,
as if she'd been vomiting excessively.

277
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,940
Was she bulimic?

278
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,580
Possible, but not probable.

279
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,580
Her throat shows little
evidence of self-regurgitation.

280
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,340
Preliminary tests conclude that her bout

281
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,940
with hyperemesis was caused
by a hormonal imbalance.

282
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,700
Particularly, a drastic
rise in her estrogen level.

283
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,700
Morning sickness?

284
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,900
Indeed.

285
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,620
Our young exhibitionist was pregnant.

286
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,820
It's Petty Officer Tiffany Jordan.

287
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,100
J- O-R-D-A-N.

288
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,060
No, I was just on hold!

289
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,740
A warrant will take days.

290
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,820
I need her mail now.

291
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,140
Well, I understand that it's Federal.

292
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,060
That's not soon enough!

293
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,060
Is the ocean view partial or panoramic?

294
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,540
Oh, sweet!

295
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,940
Oh, yeah.

296
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,420
And the bar's in the lobby?

297
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:19,820
Yup.

298
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,180
Yeah! That sounds great.

299
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,020
Oh, yeah.

300
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,940
All right. Yeah, I'll talk

301
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,300
to you soon.

302
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:26,820
Thank you. Thanks.

303
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,740
We're working; you're
planning a vacation.

304
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,380
Oh, it's not just a vacation.

305
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,780
Kate, it's spring break.

306
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,580
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

307
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,900
No.

308
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,380
Talk to my frat brothers last
night, just booked the hotel today.

309
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,580
The wheels on the party
bus are now in motion.

310
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,300
Let me guess Panama City.

311
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,900
Oh, yeah.

312
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,060
Palm trees, mai tais and
coeds all week long, Probie.

313
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,660
Don't you think you're just
a little old for spring break?

314
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,940
I can bong a beer in under six seconds.

315
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,700
Believe me, I'll fit right in.

316
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,540
Abby didn't find any
foreign prints on the bouquet

317
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,580
or the beach bag, and that means
one of you had better give me a lead.

318
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,020
DiNozzo, start with you.

319
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
I talked to Petty Officer
Jordan's rack mate from Monroe.

320
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,740
She said Jordan bought
an early pregnancy test

321
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,540
during a brief stop at King's Bay.

322
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,620
Well, she knew she was pregnant.

323
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,380
Any idea about the father?

324
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,140
She used a pay phone to call
him, but his cell was turned off.

325
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,260
She said she left a message.

326
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,380
That's your worst nightmare, Tony.

327
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,860
How's it going with those letters, Kate?

328
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,580
I'm working on it.

329
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,260
Thanks, Tony.

330
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:26,980
How long?

331
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,580
Uh, two days; three, tops.

332
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
You got four.

333
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:32,900
Really?

334
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,580
Hours.

335
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,980
Sounds about right.

336
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:35,940
McGee.

337
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,580
Are you waiting for me to announce you?

338
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,780
No. I'm sorry.

339
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,580
I, uh...

340
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,060
I pulled the phone records from
Petty Officer Jordan's apartment.

341
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,300
Uh, only one call since she returned.

342
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,380
It was yesterday at 1100 to a Lisa Kerr.

343
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,260
Two hours prior to Ducky's
estimated time of death.

344
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,300
This address her work or her home?

345
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,900
Uh, both. She's an
at-home yoga instructor.

346
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,300
Good job, McGee.

347
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,020
DiNozzo, you're with me.

348
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,500
Yeah!

349
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,420
Right behind you, boss.

350
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,100
Three hours, 58 minutes.

351
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,700
Doctor, can you come here for a second?

352
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
What is it, Mr. Palmer?

353
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,700
I am not sure.

354
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,940
What do you think?

355
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,540
Well, it looks like some
sort of paraffin wax.

356
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,620
Yeah, it... it-it reminds me of a
product my grandfather used to use.

357
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,220
He put a little of it on
either end of his mustache.

358
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,500
Gave him the handlebar look.

359
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,420
Well, that doesn't make sense.

360
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,420
Well, it was well before your time.

361
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,060
Back then, it was a very popular look.

362
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,820
Yeah, it epitomized high society.

363
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,100
No, no, not-not about your grandfather.

364
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,500
Why would she have
this stuff in her hair?

365
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,980
Well, I would surmise it
was on the killer's hands.

366
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,460
Get it up to Abby right away.

367
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,060
Thanks for having me come along, boss.

368
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,060
I know when it comes to women,
sometimes I get a little distracted.

369
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,420
I just want to let you know that I
appreciate this vote of confidence.

370
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,260
What I'm trying to say is,
I'm not gonna let you down.

371
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,380
I'm going to be attentive and
meticulous to every detail in my notes.

372
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,820
Oblivious to any distraction.

373
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,900
We're here.

374
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,860
DiNozzo!

375
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,900
Oh, yeah.

376
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,100
I'm with you, boss.

377
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,940
DiNozzo, your PDA.

378
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,580
Right.

379
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,140
Here it is, got it.

380
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,140
Sorry about that.

381
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,820
It's not a great start, huh, boss?

382
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,260
Could have been better.

383
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,700
Sorry.

384
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,500
Extend your arms.

385
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
And try to get your
forehead to the ground.

386
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,300
Nice long stretch.

387
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,780
Let the head just hang...

388
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,420
Lisa Kerr?

389
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:12,980
...to the ground.

390
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,580
Yes.

391
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,980
Hi. Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

392
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,420
Special Agent DiNozzo.

393
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,380
We have a few questions for you.

394
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,420
Of course, yeah.

395
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,140
Uh, Sally?

396
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:24,740
Yeah.

397
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,180
Can you just take over
the class for a second?

398
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,740
Thanks.

399
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,300
Oh, sure, sure.

400
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,100
I don't know if it's hit me yet.

401
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,420
You were close?

402
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,380
As close as you can
beto a girl in the Navy.

403
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,340
I mean she was here for
one month and gone the next.

404
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,980
How'd you meet?

405
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,300
She signed up for my tantric yoga
class a little over a year ago.

406
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,060
It combines physical
fitness with the ability

407
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,420
to heighten a woman's pleasure
during prolonged lovemaking.

408
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,500
I'll reboot.

409
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,300
Who was Tiffany
romantically involved with?

410
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,300
Never known her to date anyone.

411
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,060
In fact, she was the
only one in the class

412
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
who was there for physical fitness.

413
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,940
She wanted to lose ten
pounds for her shoot.

414
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,180
Shoot?

415
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,100
Yeah, she was doing a spread
with two other girls for GSM.

416
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,540
It was called, um,
"Naughty in the Navy."

417
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,980
Hit stands a couple months ago.

418
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,460
I remember that issue.

419
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,580
It was a good layout.

420
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,380
What is GSM?

421
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,780
Get Sum Magazine.

422
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,580
It's like Playboy, but less risque.

423
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,740
They both have really great articles.

424
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,460
The Navy respond?

425
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,500
Oh, it was revealing, but it wasn't
nude, so she got a slap on the wrist.

426
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,580
I got a copy of it inside.

427
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,340
Do you guys want to see it?

428
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,060
That won't be necessary.

429
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,300
Why... won't it?

430
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,500
I make a point of
keeping all of my copies.

431
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,700
Like I said, great articles.

432
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,540
Tiffany called you yesterday.

433
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,380
Yeah, she said that
she was back in town,

434
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,140
and that she wanted to see me that
night, and she needed to talk to me.

435
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,860
About what?

436
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,580
Never said.

437
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,900
Hey, Lisa.

438
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:52,940
Hey.

439
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,300
How was it?

440
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,180
Ah, it was all blown out.

441
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,900
Not a wave worth paddling after.

442
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,780
Should have gone with
me for the a.m. sets.

443
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,500
The waves were overhead
and clean all morning.

444
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,940
They're from NCIS.

445
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,660
Guys, this is my fianc, Kevin Holt.

446
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,340
Hey.

447
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,340
Hey.

448
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,740
So, any suspects yet?

449
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,100
We're working on it.

450
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,340
Girl gets murdered in public
during a bikini contest.

451
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,700
I don't know. You'd think
it'd be pretty simple.

452
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,820
You'd think.

453
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,500
We're finished here.

454
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,500
Up arm...

455
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,900
What is this stuff?

456
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,300
Bikini glue.

457
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,060
The contestants use it to keep
their suit bottoms from riding up.

458
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,380
Really?

459
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:45,860
Yup.

460
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,660
I used to go through sticks of that
stuff when I was on the circuit.

461
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,300
There's so much you don't know, McGee.

462
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,420
Is this what Jimmy found in her hair?

463
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:57,980
No.

464
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,540
I compared both substances.

465
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,980
The stuff in her hair is thicker.

466
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,900
It's more like a wax.

467
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,140
How's Kate doing on time?

468
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,380
Down to eight minutes.

469
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,500
Seven.

470
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,740
Your watch must be slow.

471
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,940
Kate, you made it!

472
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,020
What's this?

473
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,900
Uh, don't ask.

474
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,140
So, how'd you do it?

475
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,900
Did I ever tell you about
that Feeb in mail fraud

476
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
that's always flirting with me?

477
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,460
Yeah.

478
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,180
I called him.

479
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,980
You didn't say you'd go
out with him, did you?

480
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,780
Not exactly.

481
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,300
I read him Section 22
Dash A of the Federal

482
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,700
Government's sexual harassment code.

483
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,060
And then I told him I needed a favor.

484
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,140
Right on.

485
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,980
I've never seen so much crap.

486
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,100
This is why I've liberated
myself from paper mail.

487
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,780
Why does that not surprise me?

488
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,060
I don't even have a mailbox.

489
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,260
If it doesn't come electronically,
I am not getting it.

490
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,340
Okay, we'll each take a
third and filter through it.

491
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,860
I love it when you're rough, McGee.

492
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,740
Huh. I knew she looked familiar!

493
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,620
Who?

494
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,380
Lisa Kerr. She's the
daughter of Mister Kerr.

495
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,860
You know, from Mr. Kerr's Cupcakes.

496
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,620
Oh, yeah. Well, that explains the house.

497
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,100
And she's in all of the commercials.

498
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,900
And it was driving me
crazy, 'cause I was trying

499
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,140
to figure out where I knew her from.

500
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,300
Why don't you just ask her?

501
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,300
I was kind of afraid to.

502
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,500
Why?

503
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,580
Well...

504
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,180
I've had a lot of
short-lived relationships,

505
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,740
and I kind of have a hard
time remembering all of them.

506
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,740
I have the same problem with ex-wives.

507
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,900
The name's Jonathan Redding.

508
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,380
He's written our victim four
letters in the last six weeks.

509
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,980
And the writing
indicates classic stalker.

510
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,740
If he can't have her, no one can.

511
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,020
He sounds like our guy.

512
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,980
We have a return address?

513
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,780
Cellblock F. He's in the
Danville Correctional Facility.

514
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,220
It can't ever be easy.

515
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,780
Well, I-I still think
we should talk to him.

516
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,260
I mean, we can't just
ignore evidence like this.

517
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,260
What evidence?

518
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,660
The guy's still in prison.

519
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,500
Not anymore.

520
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,460
I just spoke to Danville's
assistant warden.

521
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,180
Jonathan Redding was
paroled 13 days ago.

522
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,580
Jonathan Redding was arrested for
assault and battery in May of '01.

523
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,171
He had two priors
before that violation of

524
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:55,140
a restraining order and
possession of narcotics.

525
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,260
Two of his three arrests
involved ex-girlfriends.

526
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,140
We locate him?

527
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,340
I, uh, phoned his registered address.

528
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,780
They claim they haven't seen him.

529
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,740
His parole officer?

530
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,825
Phoned him, as well.

531
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,700
Still waiting to hear back.

532
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,140
I'm gonna... call him again.

533
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,660
This guy definitely fits the profile.

534
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,860
All we have is a rap
sheet and some fan mail.

535
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,620
Even if we find him,
we can't detain him.

536
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
That may not be true, boss.

537
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,460
Redding's former cell mate
saw the murder on the news.

538
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,500
He says he has some
information we should hear.

539
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,620
In exchange for what?

540
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,340
Depending on what he gives us,
the D.A. may cut him a deal.

541
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,380
Take Todd.

542
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,260
Find out what he knows.

543
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,220
You got it.

544
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
Kate, with me!

545
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,460
You ever interrogate a prisoner, Kate?

546
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,540
Yes, Tony. I've been
at this for a while now.

547
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,420
Well, it's important to remember
you can never let your guard down.

548
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,940
An inmate, unlike a
civilian, has nothing to lose.

549
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,420
Yeah, but this inmate,
Tony, asked to speak to us.

550
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,780
Wants to do the right thing.

551
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,580
He's a felon, and that's the
way we're going to treat him.

552
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,700
Open the gate!

553
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,900
How long were you and
Jonathan Redding cell mates?

554
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,140
Six or seven months.

555
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,780
Which it, Luke?

556
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,140
Six or seven?

557
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,260
What's with the third degree?

558
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,180
I'm trying to help you guys.

559
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,260
Then answer the question.

560
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,820
Well, he came in right
around my birthday, so...

561
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,580
I guess it was closer to seven.

562
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,740
So, you gave him the magazine
with Tiffany's picture.

563
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,300
When was it that you started
to believe that Jonathan was...

564
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,940
You're an Alpha Chi Delta?

565
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,660
Rutgers.

566
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,700
'91.

567
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,860
Ohio State. '89.

568
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,260
No way!

569
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,340
Yeah, dude!

570
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
Are you in touch with
any of the brothers?

571
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,940
Try to.

572
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,540
You know, these days it's not that easy.

573
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,180
Oh, yeah.

574
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,580
You?

575
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,540
Well, I'm still best friends with
three of the guys from my pledge class.

576
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,940
In fact, we're heading down
to Florida for spring break!

577
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,020
Aw, that's awesome, man.

578
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,580
Yeah, yeah...

579
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,620
Oh, I used to love spring break.

580
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,700
Panama City!

581
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,180
Palm trees...

582
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,780
Nope, that's all for now.

583
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,420
Thanks very much.

584
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,620
Boss, located Redding.

585
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,860
He is working at the
Water Wheel Car Wash.

586
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,420
It's only two miles away from where
Petty Officer Jordan was attacked.

587
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,740
We should've had him three hours ago.

588
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,420
I'm sorry about that.

589
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,940
I- I kept hitting dead ends.

590
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,140
Learn to anticipate, McGee.

591
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
Anticipate?

592
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,980
Always think a step ahead.

593
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,980
Shouldn't have to ever waste
time deciding what to do next.

594
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:28,820
Anticipate...

595
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:32,100
Yeah. Gibbs.

596
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,380
According to his cell mate, Redding...

597
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,780
...stared at Petty Officer
Jordan's photos for hours at a time.

598
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,660
No, I'm in the bedroom...

599
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,540
And then the letters started.

600
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,540
You think he was obsessed?

601
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,260
Oh, yeah.

602
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,660
He found her address over the
Internet and said his plan was

603
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,860
to contact her when he was released.

604
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,540
He didn't want to live without her.

605
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,580
Or her to live without him.

606
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,980
McGee track down an address?

607
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,180
Yeah. We're on our way.

608
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,220
Hey, McGee, get the...

609
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,060
Keys to the car.

610
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,180
Keys to the car.

611
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:17,420
We're a little out of place here, McGee.

612
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,580
Feels like high school.

613
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,820
What the hell is that?

614
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,820
Believe it's an Escalade, boss.

615
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,980
The wheels, McGee.

616
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,140
Oh, uh, the rims.

617
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,140
They're called "spinners."

618
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,860
What's the point?

619
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,020
It's a hip-hop thing.

620
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,660
The more I know, the less I understand.

621
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,300
Afternoon, gentlemen.

622
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,100
Your sedan looks like
it could use a... wash.

623
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,100
We're looking for Jonathan Redding.

624
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,740
I'm Rodney, Jon's supervisor.

625
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,260
Something I can help you with?

626
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,820
Yeah, you can point him out to us.

627
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,020
He's right over there.

628
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,260
I've got him driving today.

629
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,260
Jon do something wrong?

630
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,700
Jonathan Redding!

631
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,380
Stop! Federal Agents!

632
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,340
Where's he going?!

633
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,380
Whoa!

634
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,700
Redding!

635
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,220
Redding!

636
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,140
Redding! Stop!

637
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,300
Anticipate, McGee.

638
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:49,940
Luke was right.

639
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,740
This dude is creepy.

640
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,980
Do you realize you've been
talking about Luke since we left?

641
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,100
He's a good guy.

642
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,580
He's a criminal, Tony.

643
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,420
And you have a man-crush on him.

644
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,060
I do not have a man-crush.

645
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,380
I just feel bad for the guy, that's all.

646
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,500
Well, I just don't understand what
it is about men and their fraternity.

647
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,900
It's like this pact to get drunk
and laid supersedes everything.

648
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,700
Okay, getting drunk and laid
is only, like, 90% of it.

649
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,980
And the rest is
brotherhood and solidarity.

650
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,500
Well, if you ask me, it's
as juvenile as spring break.

651
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,180
You ever been on spring break, Kate?

652
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,100
Yes, I have, Tony.

653
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,220
Panama City, junior year.

654
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,660
But unlike the girls
you're going to see,

655
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,420
my friends and I conducted
ourselves with complete dignity.

656
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,500
Sounds like a blast.

657
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,260
Finally. I've been
sitting here 20 minutes.

658
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,380
I'm rry, Jon.

659
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,300
I asked them to put out refreshments,
and they must've forgotten.

660
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,460
Why am I here?

661
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,860
Because killing people is illegal.

662
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,020
I didn't kill anyone.

663
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,100
Then why did you run?

664
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,500
'Cause I owed the wrong people
a lot of money when I went away.

665
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,940
Drugs?

666
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,240
And now that I'm out,
they're looking to collect.

667
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:08,180
I saw you two guys coming
at me, and I reacted.

668
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,740
He's lying.

669
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,700
Well, if he is, he's pretty good.

670
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,420
I didn't know what else to do.

671
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,260
We just wanted to talk to you, Jon.

672
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,180
Yeah?

673
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,420
Hi. What'd I miss?

674
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,820
Who dressed you?

675
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,660
Look, I chased this joker
through the car wash, all right?

676
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,940
What?

677
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,780
We came straight here.

678
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,820
This is all I had that was clean.

679
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,540
Your gym clothes were clean?

680
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,140
Well, who would have guessed?

681
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,300
Where'd you get this?

682
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,700
Same place I got the other three
Petty Officer Jordan's P.O. Box.

683
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,420
She never got them?

684
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,980
That why you killed her?

685
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,140
Because she wouldn't respond to you?

686
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,780
I didn't kill her.

687
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,460
I loved her.

688
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,780
Where were you Saturday
between 12:00 and 1:15 p.m.?

689
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,185
I was there.

690
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,980
I was at the contest.

691
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,780
You're not helping your
cause much here, Johnny boy...

692
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,820
I went there because I
wanted to talk to her,

693
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,220
tell her how much she means to me!

694
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,060
Why didn't you tell her that
when you delivered the flowers?

695
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,500
'Cause she wasn't home.

696
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,500
So, I left them at the door.

697
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,460
I didn't see her at the contest, either.

698
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,620
I waited, but she never came out.

699
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,100
Did you go by yourself?

700
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,500
Yep.

701
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,460
I showed up about a
half-hour before it started.

702
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,460
I stood right in front of
the stage until it was over.

703
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,820
I didn't kill her.

704
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,860
I just wanted to be a part of her life.

705
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
You have to believe me.

706
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,820
What's the problem, Abbs?

707
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,220
I'm not really sure.

708
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,780
The picture was crystal
clear when I tested it.

709
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,860
There we go.

710
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,660
What happened?

711
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Tony forgot to rewind.

712
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,820
Thanks, Abbs.

713
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,980
You already watched this?

714
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,940
I glanced at it.

715
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,860
He took it home.

716
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,660
What is wrong with you?!

717
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,180
It's like you have
some sort of a sickness.

718
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,140
I had a hunch there
might be something on it.

719
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,620
Yeah, like ten half-naked women.

720
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,780
Cue it up from the beginning.

721
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,180
Got it. It was a two-camera shoot.

722
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,860
One was on the stage and the other
was on the crowd, for reactions.

723
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,500
Fast-forward to around noon.

724
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,300
Stop.

725
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,820
Zoom in on "B."

726
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
That's him, right there.

727
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,580
Keep running it.

728
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,740
He's where he said he was.

729
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,820
Yeah, but he still has
until 1:15 to slip away.

730
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,060
Speed it up, Abbs.

731
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,700
It's past 1:15, boss.

732
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,300
He's telling the truth.

733
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:55,380
Jonathan Redding did not
kill Petty Officer Jordan.

734
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,280
Where's Gibbs?

735
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,840
I don't know, but we do
report to him, remember?

736
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,240
I think I find us a lead.

737
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,040
Where?

738
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:14,720
Honestly Tony, you need help.

739
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,200
You'll sing a different tone
when I show this to Gibbs.

740
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,360
Show me what?

741
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:22,543
I was standing through
petty officer Jordan's layout

742
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:24,840
and I found something I
thought you should see.

743
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,800
These two photos weren't taken by
the magazine. They got'em from her.

744
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,480
Why?

745
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,080
Something GSM likes to do: gives the reader or
voyeur let's take a look another girls lifes.

746
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,640
Who do you think took the photos?

747
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,520
Probie, back up a little bit.

748
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,320
Sorry.

749
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,200
In the article, petty officer Jordan
said they were taken by a boyfriend.

750
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,440
But she didn't date.

751
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Well, she was pregnant Mcgee.
There's only one way that can happen.

752
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,520
Did you contact GSM?

753
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,160
I did. They said that the photos were taken
by a local photographer named Jason Kaplan.

754
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,560
He's a freelancer they work with a lot.

755
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,720
Check it out.

756
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,520
Okay. Don't worry boss,
I'll keep it professional.

757
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,400
Yeak, I know you will
because Kate's going with you.

758
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,000
I am?

759
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,000
It seems like a in and out job boss,
are you sure that's really necessary?

760
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:12,160
He's sure.

761
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,000
This guy has the life. He spends all
day photographing world hottest women.

762
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,360
I'm sure his mom is proud.

763
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,480
What's that supposed to mean?

764
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,240
Those pictures are demeaning. They
make women look like sex objects.

765
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,360
You need to listen up. Human body's a
beautiful thing. It should be admired.

766
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,240
You're right Tony. Human
body is a beautiful thing.

767
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,360
Gorgeous, don't move an inch.

768
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
I feel nauseous.

769
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,120
Great. Okay guys, let's take a five. Tod,
you wanna make sure to keep'em warmed up.

770
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,120
Sorry, I keep you waiting but I
didn't want to... break the zone.

771
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,960
I take it this isn't for GSM.

772
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,600
No, this is for Sports Monthly. You're looking
at three members of the US waterpolo team.

773
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,560
Great uniforms.

774
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,160
Is there anywhere else
where we could talk?

775
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
I think we could talk in my office.

776
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,760
That'll be great.

777
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,880
Tiffany Jordan. I couldn't
believe when I saw her on the news.

778
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,000
Such a cute girl.
Kaplan really loved her.

779
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,680
We were wondering about the two small photos at the
bottom of her layout, and they were taken by her boyfriend.

780
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,560
That's between her and the magazine. My job is just to
send in the pictures and get consent from whoever took'em.

781
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,200
Do you have their release on file?

782
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,920
Sure, I keep records of everything.

783
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,920
Personally, I find it insulting that
magazines publish amateur photos.

784
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,520
I spent four years in photography classes.
It took me months to get published.

785
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,320
Kevin Holt is Lisa Kerr's fianc.

786
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,960
Why would he have any reason to
photograh Tiffany in the bedroom?

787
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,320
Lisa might be wondering the same thing.

788
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,080
What do you have, Abbs?

789
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,640
A serious hatred of wax.

790
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,960
I think you look stressed.

791
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,040
I compared old victim's wax to
over hundred different products.

792
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,040
Each was just one molecule
different to the next.

793
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,440
Do you know small moleculars

794
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:37,880
I do.

795
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,720
Shup up McGee.

796
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,760
I really like this new Abby.

797
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,280
And after many fun-packed hours of
nothing but wax, I found a match.

798
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,560
Does that say "sex wax"?

799
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,520
Yeah, it does. It comes
in cool warm and tropical.

800
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,960
How does it work?

801
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,960
Don't worry about it, probie. Pretty
sure you still need a girl first.

802
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,520
It's not like that. Mr Zogs sex wax
is a brand name. It's made for surfers.

803
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,600
Surfers?

804
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,440
Yeah. They put it on their board to help with fraction.

805
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,960
Hello, Kevin.

806
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,320
Oh, my friends from NCIS.

807
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,840
What do you know, boys?

808
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,360
More that you'd like us to.

809
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,920
Come again.

810
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,240
We know about your relationship
with Tiffany Jordan.

811
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
What relationship?

812
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,880
Her and Lisa were
friends. I barely knew her.

813
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Yeah well, enough to take intimate photos ever.
You do that with all of Lisa's friends.

814
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,400
You lie need a work.

815
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,920
Look, fellas, it's not what you think.
Her and I, we hung out a couple of time.

816
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,640
You know, it was totally innocent. She asked me to help
take some photos for this magazine, so I helped her out.

817
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,000
Generous of you. Lisa
know about the photos?

818
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,200
No, she didn't even know that
Tiffany and I were friends.

819
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:56,360
Well, if nothing going
on, why the big secret?

820
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:05,680
Look, Lisa's very insecure. Okay, I come home from a
weekend surf tournament, she'd smell my clothes for perfume.

821
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,720
I even got her going through
my email a couple of times.

822
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,920
Look at that, boss. She's suffocating him and all
he's doing is take a lingerie shots of her girlfriends.

823
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,000
It's not what you think. I
wasn't sleeping with Tiffany.

824
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,800
Good. Then you won't mind
submitting a DNA sample.

825
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,640
Why? You have the killer's DNA?

826
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,800
Allright, fine. You want me to take your test,
I'll take your test. I got nothing to hide.

827
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,840
We have a winner. Tony,
tell us what he's won.

828
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,760
Well Abby, he's won all the expensive 
vacation on the suny Leavenworth. 

829
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,120
Keep your day job.

830
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,360
May not be an option.

831
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,400
What about his prints?

832
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,880
I compared them to the prints that Tony and McGee
got from the beach rest room. They didn't jive.

833
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,520
He must have left it hundreds of prints.

834
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,120
You sure you ran them all?

835
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,720
No, McGee, about midway through, I
got tired, so I just like, "Screw it."

836
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,000
Just thought I'd check.

837
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,720
Okay, so he didn't leave any prints-
all that proves is that he's more

838
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,640
careful at a crime scene
than he is in the bedroom.

839
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,640
I agreed to take a test.

840
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,160
I didn't agree to spend the
whole night in this ny room.

841
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,800
This is a luxury suite compared
to what you're looking at.

842
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,040
What are you talking about?

843
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,800
You lied to us, Kev.

844
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

845
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,520
I didn't lie to you about anything.

846
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,920
You told us that you and Tiffany...

847
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,680
What's going on?

848
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,240
What is Kevin still doing here?

849
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,120
Evidence leads us to believe he
was involved in Tiffany's murder.

850
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,520
Oh, no, that's ridiculous.

851
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,560
He's not capable of killing anyone.

852
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,720
I got good news and I got bad news.

853
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,080
Which do you want to hear first?

854
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,120
Tiffany was pregnant...

855
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,720
and there is a 99.98% probability
that you are the father.

856
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,320
Tiff was pregnant?

857
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,200
I decided to go with the bad news.

858
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,280
He...

859
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,000
I had no idea.

860
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
He cheated on me?

861
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,400
I can't believe he cheated on me.

862
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,560
I... I've given him everything.

863
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
You never suspected?

864
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,080
Why would I?

865
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,920
She's my friend.

866
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,240
It'll be okay.

867
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,440
Get her a glass of water, McGee.

868
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,200
You bet.

869
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,600
I still don't believe he killed her.

870
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,000
I thought you said
there was some good news.

871
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
Right, I almost forgot
there is a, uh,...

872
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,480
chance that you're
gonna walk out of here.

873
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,200
Hey, look, I... I screwed up, okay,
I admit that, but I am not a killer.

874
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,560
The-the-the last time that I saw
Tiff was right before we left,

875
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,480
and we both decided
that we'd end it then.

876
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,640
You're not a very reputable guy, Kev.

877
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,600
Why should we believe you?

878
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,640
Because I'm telling you the truth.

879
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,480
You didn't have anything to do
with this, why'd you avoid us?

880
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,400
What are you talking about?

881
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,040
I- I never avoid...

882
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,600
We've been calling you for two days.

883
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,080
I left four messages on your cell phone.

884
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,080
He's lying.

885
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,400
He never left him any messages.

886
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,520
How do you know?

887
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,120
Sure you don't want to call your lawyer?

888
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,480
I didn't do ything wrong.

889
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,160
I just...

890
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,160
want to get this over with.

891
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,760
It must've been a shock when
you heard Tiffany's message.

892
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,480
No one would blame you for being angry.

893
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,240
I didn't listen to any message.

894
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,920
Okay? I wouldn't invade
Kevin's privacy like that.

895
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,760
You didn't have any problem
searching through his e-mail.

896
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,000
He told you that?

897
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,360
We lifted your fingerprint
from this glass.

898
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,800
It matches a print we found a
few feet from Tiffany's body.

899
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,120
I think I'd like to call my lawyer now.

900
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,640
I think that's probably a...

901
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,520
a good idea.

902
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,400
I thought you were leaving.

903
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,560
I'm on my way.

904
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,720
See you next week.

905
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,080
Try not to embarrass yourself, Tony.

906
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,280
Come on, Kate, I'm way
too grown-up for that.

907
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,120
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

908
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,040
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

909
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,920
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

910
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:45,960
You're pretty.

911
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,200
You're pretty.

912
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,040
I'm pretty.

913
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,480
I'm going to the head.

914
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:00,120
I love this place.

915
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:04,337
Ah... yeah.
