00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Hi, Mr. Poole, my name is Julie,
and I'm calling on behalf...

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,680
Hi, this is Allison, and I'd like to
tell you about a special new program...

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,200
Hello?

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,040
Hi, Petty Officer Lambert.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,640
Yeah?

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,920
Hi, my name is Roland Kesta.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,360
I'm calling on behalf of
Thrifty Phone Services.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,800
I've thought it over and I don't think
I want to change my phone service.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,000
That's what most people
say until they hear

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,800
how much we can save them
on long-distance calls.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,400
I don't make long-distance
phone calls, okay?

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,600
Did you hear that?

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,840
What?

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Sounded like glass
breaking in the kitchen.

15
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,800
No.

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,480
Our long-distance service
is exactly the same as AT&T,

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,200
- Sprint, SBC, except we can save you...
- Who the hell are you?

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,160
The man who's going to save you 40%
on your long-distance calls, sir.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,560
Um, there's no contract to sign...

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,360
Uh, Petty Officer Lambert?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,880
Last time I'm going tell you, Tony.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,640
Don't answer my phone, use
my computer, read my mail,

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
look through my purse, scan my
PDA or touch my cell phone ever.

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,880
And an extra side of hash browns.

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,200
Just so we're clear, Kate, I
didn't do any of those things.

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,360
Zero. Zip. Nada.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,200
Then how did you know
where I went to breakfast?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,760
Logo on the coffee cup
in your wastebasket.

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,080
Anyone invite you into
this conversation, probie?

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
You looked through my trash?

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,760
Did you say it was
off limits?... Did ya?

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,560
Why do you do these things?

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,520
Sharpening my investigative skills.

34
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:12,160
Grab your gear.

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,920
- What's up?
- A dead sailor.

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,560
We didn't get any calls.

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,880
Saw it on the news, huh, boss?

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,160
Hey, DiNozzo, for once, you're right.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Come on. Let's go.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,320
Who's in charge here?

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,320
Lieutenant Cheney, sir.

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,440
We'll finish this in ten.

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,280
Lieutenant Cheney?

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,000
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
You must be psychic, Gibbs.

46
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,560
I just put in a call to NCIS.

47
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,520
Not psychic.

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,520
Just watch the news.

49
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,160
They monitor our radio calls.

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,480
Chief says cooperate
with the news media.

51
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Budget hearings time.

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,400
You got it.

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,280
What do we have here?

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,640
Not sure yet.

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,680
News said a sailor was murdered.

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,600
Maybe kitchen door's broken in, and
judging from the blood, it could be murder.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,520
No body.

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,640
No body.

59
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,920
- Miller.
- Yeah, boss.

60
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,280
Right away, boss.

61
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,160
We got a 911 from a telemarketer.

62
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,400
Said he was talking with a
Petty Officer Dion Lambert

63
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,160
when he heard a struggle
and the line went dead.

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,720
Call was traced here.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,240
Lieutenant, your ex-wife just called.

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,080
Which one?

67
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,000
The nasty one.

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,600
You're going to have
to be more specific.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,000
This is too weird.

70
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,880
Definitely.

71
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,920
Good weird.

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,160
You want me to call her back?

73
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,440
No. Next time one of my
exes calls, get her name.

74
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,280
Lieutenant.

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,400
Unless you object, this is yours.

76
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,080
No objections.

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,200
Let's go, Rachael.

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,480
Hey, Rachael, I'm Tony.

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,520
If you want to get
together and compare notes.

80
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,720
What's your shoe size?

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,680
Twelve.

82
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,920
You wish.

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,280
No, it is.

84
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,560
It really is.

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,280
You can measure it if you want.

86
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:20,960
DiNozzo.

87
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,560
Yeah, boss?

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,880
Trace evidence, bag and tag.

89
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,120
Kate, sketch and shoot.

90
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,040
McGee, laptop and answering machine.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,520
Right.

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,880
That was really odd.

93
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,840
Hmm. What?

94
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Well, you know, I mean,
how you and him and...

95
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,600
Never mind.

96
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,920
Tony, have you seen my sketch pad?

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah, it's in the truck under my seat.

98
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Under your seat?

99
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,800
How did it...?

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,880
Like those pants.

101
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,360
Sorry.

102
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,000
You know, your eyes are the
same color as my Porsche.

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
You've gotta be kidding.

104
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,040
What do you say we have dinner?

105
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,600
Why bother with preliminaries?

106
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Ah, now who's kidding?

107
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,960
You serious?

108
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,840
She's not, but I am.

109
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,360
Come on, Monteleone.

110
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,040
Shotgun.

111
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,160
Get in the car, probie.

112
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,520
It's deja vu.

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,720
There's no contract to sign.

114
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,600
Uh, Petty Officer Lambert?

115
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,600
How many calls a day do you make?

116
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,240
Somewhere between 300 and 400.

117
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,280
You ever feel guilty calling people
uninvited, intruding into their lives?

118
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
At first, a little.

119
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,320
When you get cursed at a couple
hundred times, you get over it.

120
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,160
Why'd you keep selling when you
knew something was very wrong?

121
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
My boss doesn't want us to
stop selling for any reason.

122
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,440
He's got the compassion
of a cluster bomb.

123
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,960
How did you get Petty
Officer Lambert's number?

124
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,080
From a list broker.

125
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,480
How'd it get on the list?

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,480
I don't know.

127
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,640
A magazine subscription, a
warranty card, supermarket charge.

128
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,080
Supermarket charge?

129
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,880
Why do you think they
give you those little

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
key tags they scan when you check out?

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,640
For discounts.

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,840
It's to collect information
they sell to telemarketers.

133
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,000
What brands you buy,
how much, how often...

134
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,200
Isn't that against the law?!

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,760
Anytime you write your
name down, it's going in

136
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,600
somebody's database and then
being sold to somebody else.

137
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,080
Okay, well, I'm going to need
your work, cell and home numbers.

138
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,080
All right.

139
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,520
But please don't call between 6:00
and 8:00, because that's usually...

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,640
You said 6:00 and 8:00, right?

141
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,400
Tell Abby I want a full
acoustical analysis.

142
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,480
Uh... uh, boss, you-you know
that she's working Petty Officer

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,240
Lambert's hard drive, answering machine
and all the crime scene evidence.

144
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,600
Then help her, McGee.

145
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,120
Yes, boss.

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,920
You really think it's a good idea
for probie to be alone with...

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,760
I was going through Lambert's papers.

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,120
Something you're very good at.

149
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,080
There's a second name on the lease:

150
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,040
George Mansur.

151
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
There's no sign of a
roommate in that house, Tony.

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,160
Well, roommates ve out, Kate.

153
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,640
16 months ago, you had a roommate...

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,440
Tony.

155
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,400
Kate, you're with me.

156
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,400
Gladly.

157
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,120
Tony, find Mansur.

158
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,720
On it, boss.

159
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,280
The only blood type at
the scene was O-positive.

160
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,080
Petty Officer Lambert's O-positive.

161
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,960
It's the most common
blood type there is.

162
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,200
I shipped a DNA sample to
the Armed Forces Registry.

163
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,600
Fingerprints we lifted his?

164
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,360
Your missing corpse is
Petty Officer Lambert.

165
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Unidentified prints.

166
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,160
I have not had time to run all
the prints that you lifted yet.

167
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Blood-spatter analysis.

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,520
Okay, Gibbs, I know you
think I'm Supergirl...

169
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,880
Actually, my hair's
more like Wonder Woman.

170
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,920
Or Isis.

171
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Or the Powerpuff girl.

172
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,760
I've always beenpartial to Xena.

173
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,400
I don't know about her.

174
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,960
No self-respecting superhero
should wear open-toed shoes.

175
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
Oh, I agree.

176
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
He erased his hard drive.

177
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,480
No problem.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,840
He used a DOD-certified wipe program.

179
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,680
"Uh-oh" doesn't sound good.

180
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,200
It's not.

181
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,360
A DOD wipe not only deletes,
but it overwrites seven times.

182
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,200
There's no way to recapture
the information, boss.

183
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,160
Why would he use something
like that on his home computer?

184
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,520
He's an information systems
tech, and it could just be

185
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,400
a matter of course, or he could be...

186
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,160
Hiding something.

187
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,920
He wipe his answering machine?

188
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,760
No. There were two calls.

189
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,160
One yesterday, from
Blockbuster Video late returning

190
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,680
Happy Gilmore and one two days
ago from Thrifty Phone Services.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,760
All right, let's hear it.

192
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,000
You!

193
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,520
Blood spatters!

194
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,840
Yo-ho, heave ho...

195
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,560
Petty Officer Lambert,

196
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
my name is Dennis Brough.

197
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm calling on behalf of
Thrifty Phone Services.

198
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,080
How would you like to cut...

199
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,400
That's it?

200
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,640
He must've picked up.

201
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
They called him two days
ago, why call him back?

202
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
Dennis Brough, Kate.

203
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:25,081
Got it.

204
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,000
Acoustics analysis.

205
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,720
Yes. On that next, boss.

206
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,760
Who was that that said,
"Always expect the unexpected"?

207
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,560
Me.

208
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,520
Well, you're right again.

209
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,680
Boss, you sure are.

210
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
McGee, you're about to
interrupt unbelievable news.

211
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,400
Abby, trust me, my news
is much more unbelievable.

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,080
Gibbs, you're never going
to believe what I found.

213
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,240
Kate, hold on one second.

214
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:31,313
Abby.

215
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:36,760
Okay, this is the blood trail found on
Petty Officer Lambert's kitchen floor.

216
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,120
Notice anything hinky?

217
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Yeah, they're passive drops.

218
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,440
Exactly.

219
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,840
Created by the force
of gravity acting alone.

220
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,040
In blood trails, the shape of drops
are affected by gravity and movement.

221
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,160
The tail always points in
the direction of travel.

222
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,680
There was no movement
when the blood dropped.

223
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,480
Nope. Somebody stood
there, dropped some blood,

224
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
took a step, dropped some blood...

225
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,160
took a step, dropped some blood...

226
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,720
McGee!

227
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,640
The acoustical analysis
of the phone call

228
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,760
indicates that the fight
sounds were unidirectional.

229
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,120
I overlaid Kate's
sketch of the crime scene

230
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,640
and found the source to be
Petty Officer Lambert's computer.

231
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,400
They were sound effects, boss.

232
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,600
Okay.

233
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,400
Kate.

234
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,520
I spoke to Dennis Brough from
the Thrifty Phone Service.

235
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,560
He's home with the flu.

236
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,560
The supervisor gave Dennis
his lead to Roland Kesta.

237
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,960
Petty Officer Lambert asked that
telemarketer to call him back.

238
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,360
Between 8:00 and 12:00 last night.

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,960
Our petty officer faked his own murder.

240
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,503
We have one advantage
over Petty Officer Lambert:

241
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,920
he doesn't know we
know he's still alive.

242
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,360
I'll flag his accounts:
bank, credit, ATM, E-mail.

243
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,200
Kate, this mojo faked his own death.

244
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,760
Left his laptop, wallet,
cell phone and car behind.

245
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,440
Do you really think he's going to swipe

246
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,840
the old charge card at
the local Drugs R' Us?

247
00:11:58,681 --> 00:11:59,240
Tony's right.

248
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,280
Thanks, boss.

249
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,240
You check it anyway, Kate.

250
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,000
You never know.

251
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,080
If Tony ever does find his
ex-roomie, check his accounts, too.

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm zoning in on him.

253
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,280
Yeah? You locate him?

254
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,560
Not yet, but... got
his driver's license.

255
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
Federal tax return, too.

256
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,120
He's a freelance computer geek.

257
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,280
Made six figures last year.

258
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,200
Wishing you were a computer geek, Tony?

259
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,320
I'd rather be homeless
than be you, probie.

260
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,520
It's an old address; same
as Petty Officer Lambert's.

261
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,680
He's depreciating a '93
Hyundai on his return.

262
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,480
How can you depreciate a car that old?

263
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,480
More important question:

264
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,960
Why would a guy pulling down six
figures a year drive a car that old?

265
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,520
Only one way to find out.

266
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,960
Find him and ask him.

267
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,760
Which I am trying...

268
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,640
...going to do.

269
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,560
McGee, you're with me.

270
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Where we going, boss?

271
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,280
Talk to Petty Officer
Lambert's shipmates.

272
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
But he's not on a ship, boss.

273
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,320
Oh, sir, you were using
a military euphemism.

274
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,760
You think?

275
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,920
So, uh, you mean Bethesda
Hospital Computer Center.

276
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
You speak their language.

277
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,040
You mean, I'm going to interview them?

278
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,960
I interview.

279
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,600
You translate. Come on.

280
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,040
Lambert's UA for one day,
NCIS is investigating?

281
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,120
You have a problem with
that, Petty Officer Wilson?

282
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,200
No, sir.

283
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,400
What was Petty Officer Lambert's job?

284
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,000
He was developing a new code base
for enterprise resource and planning.

285
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,840
The new application will be able
to supportmedical multi-processing

286
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,840
and scalable architecture up
to eight terabytes of data.

287
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,720
Whew.

288
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,920
He was writing a new computer
program as part of an overhaul

289
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,320
and update to the Naval
Medical Computer System.

290
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,400
Hmm. Anything sensitive?

291
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,040
A person's health information
is very sensitive, sir.

292
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,240
National security
sensitive, Petty Officer.

293
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,120
We have a circuit-based
gateway, sir, which applies

294
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,600
a security mechanism anytime there's
a USD-TCP connection established.

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,320
Once that connection's
made, packets can travel

296
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,880
between hosts without further checking.

297
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,960
No.

298
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,480
Petty Officer Lambert's fitreps
were above standard, sir.

299
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,920
He was just a regular guy.

300
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,080
Our definition of "regular"
might be different.

301
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,680
One man's Linux is another's OS/2.

302
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,360
- I hear that.
- Right.

303
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,360
Sorry.

304
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,840
Any recent changes in
his behavior or attitude?

305
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,920
No, sir.

306
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,520
Take that back.

307
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,560
A few days ago, he seemed jumpy.

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,640
I tapped him on the
shoulder to talk about

309
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,680
the performance degradation
in the application gateway,

310
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,120
and he about came out of his chair.

311
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,160
He was... nervous.

312
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,120
Yeah, I got that, McGee.

313
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,760
Okay.

314
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,160
Yeah, I'm going to need, I'm going
to need copies of all his stuff.

315
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
Uh, access to the source
codes, flow charts,

316
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,000
and the logical processes
involved in the application.

317
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,160
Not a problem, sir.

318
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,200
Special Agent Gibbs.

319
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,000
Karen Wilkerson, Petty
Officer Wilson's supervisor.

320
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,120
You're late.

321
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,360
We're making a software changeover.

322
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,200
It's been crazy.

323
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,200
Get copies of what we need here, McGee.

324
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:17,880
Right, boss.

325
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Tell me about Petty Officer Lambert.

326
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,400
Not a lot to tell.

327
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,560
Good guy.

328
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,840
Hard worker.

329
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
First one in in the mornings,
usually the last to leave.

330
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,680
Volunteered to work weekends.

331
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,080
You work weekends?

332
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,840
Not if I can help it.

333
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,520
Why is NCISinvestigating a sailor
who's missed one day of work?

334
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,240
He's UA, Miss Wilkerson.

335
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
It's not as if he's missed a deployment.

336
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,480
Petty Officer Wilson says
he seemed jumpy lately.

337
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,600
Well, he'd be in a better
position to know that than me.

338
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,640
Petty Officer Lambert and I didn't
have much day-to-day contact.

339
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,000
You, uh, work weekends,
Special Agent Gibbs?

340
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
If I need to.

341
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Why do I feel you need to a lot?

342
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,360
Anything else?

343
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,760
I have to get back to work.

344
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,840
Not at the moment.

345
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,040
Well, if there is, I'll
make myself available.

346
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,720
Even on the weekend.

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,800
Oh, might even be on time.

348
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,160
Enough, Tony.

349
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
I have nothing to hide.

350
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,880
Really?

351
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,960
For someone with nothing to
hide, you seem awfully concerned

352
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,320
about what other people know about you.

353
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,920
Why, because I get upset when you
go through my personal belongings?

354
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,080
Exactly.

355
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,040
Well, Tony, some people
enjoy having a private life.

356
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Unlike you, we don't go
around informing everyone

357
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,600
about the frequency of our hooking up.

358
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,600
In a slump?

359
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,680
Gibbs—Mansur withdrew
$6,000 from his bank account

360
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,680
e week before he moved out.

361
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,680
He's also moved three
times in the last six years.

362
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,760
This last time he didn't file a
change of address at the post office.

363
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,440
Thank you.

364
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,240
Whatever the hell this
is, they're in it together.

365
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,160
Yeah, but what is...

366
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,880
"whatever the hell this is"?

367
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,000
Find Mansur...

368
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,640
Yes.

369
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,000
And we'll find out.

370
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,080
I know, boss. I'm trying.

371
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,840
Try harder.

372
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,440
Right.

373
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,040
You know, Gibbs, maybe Lambert

374
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,320
faked his own death to get out the Navy.

375
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,880
You know, wanted to make a
few bucks, like his roomie.

376
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,560
Not likely.

377
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
His enlistment was up in five months.

378
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:45,960
McGee!

379
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,560
Yeah, boss.

380
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,480
Check with Abby.

381
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,040
Find out how she's doing with
that stuff you brought in.

382
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,960
Right.

383
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,240
That should help keep you awake.

384
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,280
Thanks.

385
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,400
I have looked at 100,000 lines of code.

386
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
Is it possible to die of boredom?

387
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,240
No.

388
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,720
How can you be sure?

389
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,080
Well, because I had Professor
Bernbaum for economics.

390
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,960
Believe me, his class makes staring
at a monitor seem like Mardi Gras.

391
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,800
I don't know.

392
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,320
This really sucks.

393
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
I'll tell you what sucks.

394
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,240
Working after school as a
burnt-potato-chip picker.

395
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,560
You're making that up.

396
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,040
You ever seen a burnt potato
chip in a bag of potato chips?

397
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,560
Hmm. Now that you mention it.

398
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,320
Sat next to a conveyer
belt, air choked with oil,

399
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,360
watching cooked potato chips fly by.

400
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,000
I would pick out the burnt ones while
trying not to get motion sickness.

401
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,160
Incinerator operator.

402
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,960
Burning medical waste at 2,000 degrees.

403
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,640
Body parts, body waste.

404
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Summer between freshman
and sophomore year,

405
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,720
I was a Porta Potti cleaner.

406
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,960
It was the hottest summer on record.

407
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,520
Ski-lift
operator- Alberta.

408
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,600
Negative 44 degrees Fahrenheit.

409
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,840
Cleaned asbestos.

410
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,080
Collected roadkill.

411
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,685
Tie? No? Okay.

412
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
Before I joined NCIS...

413
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,880
Is that what I think it is?

414
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,560
Depends. What do you think it is?

415
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,520
The reason Petty Officer
Lambert faked his own murder.

416
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:40,654
Petty Officer Lambert was
part of the team that was

417
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:42,489
updating the Navy's
medical computer system.

418
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:44,240
He'd been working on
it almost two years.

419
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,120
Did you tell him?

420
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,440
No. Saved the best for you.

421
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,600
Oh, thanks, McGee.

422
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,040
You know how I relish the moments...

423
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,640
Stop relishing and
start explaining, Abby.

424
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,600
Okay. Geez, Gibbs.

425
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
Five months ago, Petty Officer Lambert

426
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,080
buried a simple command in
the program to send him drugs.

427
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,160
Lots of drugs.

428
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,800
McGee!

429
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,240
Sorry.

430
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,480
For every 337 prescriptions,
one was written for him.

431
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,280
It's ingenious in its simplicity.

432
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,400
What kind of drugs?

433
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,200
Painkillers: Percocet,
Vicodin, Oxycontin.

434
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,760
Oxycontin is twice as
addictive as heroin.

435
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,560
It's more addictive than pistachios.

436
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,520
Well, have you ever
eaten just one pistachio?

437
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,880
Actually, I have.

438
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,680
Uh, potato chips, on the other hand...

439
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Uh, uh, the Navy writes
a lot of prescriptions,

440
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
so the amount that he was getting,
it's no way it was for personal use.

441
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,080
In the last five months, 18,000
Oxycontin, 12,000 Percocet, 9,000 Vicodin.

442
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,160
Legal price for an 80-milligram
Oxycontin: six dollars.

443
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,840
Street price is $65 to $80.

444
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,440
On the Oxycontin alone,
he made a million bucks.

445
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,480
Cash.

446
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,247
Petty Officer Lambert is long gone.

447
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,200
I would be.

448
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,900
Three lines of computer
code buried among millions.

449
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,620
I'm amazed you found it.

450
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,860
I didn't, really.

451
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,180
It was Abby Sciuto.

452
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,460
She's a whiz at codes.

453
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,180
You never suspected
Petty Officer Lambert

454
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,340
of abusing his access
to the Navy drug system?

455
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,180
Not until you showed up.

456
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,140
When NCIS investigates a sailor who's
been UA one day, there's something wrong.

457
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,260
After you left, I had Petty Officer
Wilson run a check on Lambert's computer.

458
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,380
I never caught this.

459
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,100
Sciuto must be hot!

460
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,100
What made you suspicious, Agent Gibbs?

461
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,180
A murder that didn't happen.

462
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,020
Your Petty Officer faked his own death.

463
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,140
He wanted us looking for
his body instead of him.

464
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,140
We'd have done it, too, if Abby
hadn't found the hinky blood trail.

465
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,700
I gotta meet this woman.

466
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,620
You know what, she's probably not your
type tats, piercings, dark makeup...

467
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,460
Goth?

468
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,220
Yeah.

469
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,420
I love Goth.

470
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,940
Thieves are just like gamblers.

471
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,620
They never quit when they're ahead.

472
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,380
Why would Petty Officer Lambert?

473
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,740
In five days, the new
software system goes online.

474
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,140
He must've been afraid
it would pick up his scam.

475
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,700
Got it.

476
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,420
He had this prescription sent to Box
781, Mail Boxes Etc, Fourteenth Street.

477
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,900
McGee, you two keep
pulling Lambert's scrips.

478
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,300
See if there are any in the pipeline.

479
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,940
Happy to, boss.

480
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,140
Lieutenant Cheney.

481
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,140
Special Agent Gibbs.

482
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:25,900
One moment.

483
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,740
So tell me more about this Abby.

484
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,780
You know what? I can't
work and talk... okay?

485
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,980
Think you'll find him?

486
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,860
Usually do.

487
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,980
Hey, Cheney. It's Gibbs.

488
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,580
Our missing Petty
Officer siphoned thousands

489
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,860
of opiates from the Navy drug program.

490
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,180
Ring any bells?

491
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,860
My office. One hour.

492
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,420
You like boats?

493
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
Sail or power?

494
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,820
Sail.

495
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,740
I love to sail.

496
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,260
This weekend?

497
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,500
Um... I'm...

498
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,140
I'm still building her.

499
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,180
Which marina?

500
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,340
My basement.

501
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,300
Of course.

502
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,900
Saturday?

503
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,620
If I can find Lambert by then.

504
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,180
Well... what are you doing
standing here, Agent Gibbs?

505
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,460
Jethro.

506
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,540
Jethro?!

507
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,140
Two black coffees.

508
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,420
And two grande triple-pump
half-caf vanilla lattes.

509
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,980
Mine's the one with the extra foam.

510
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,140
Ah! Ah! Sorry.

511
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,820
So, Gibbs, I've had my eye on this one
guy he's a lobbyist went from dealing

512
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,260
to a few friends to supplying the
beltway with illegal painkillers.

513
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,860
Well, syncs up.

514
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,100
Miller.

515
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,860
Yeah, boss.

516
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,380
- Just a second.
- You know what? Here, let me...

517
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,020
My fault.

518
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:23,740
No, it was mine.

519
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,060
No, I should've been more careful.

520
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,660
No, not a problem.

521
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,180
Not a problem.

522
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,020
McGee! Miller!

523
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,620
Sorry, boss.

524
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,460
Aaron Alan Wright.

525
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,940
Ever busted?

526
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,700
Once.

527
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,300
Dealing to his frat
brothers at Syracuse.

528
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,900
Got probation.

529
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,260
Why haven't you busted him?

530
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,660
I want the other end of his pipeline.

531
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,580
I bust him, his supplier
just finds another dealer.

532
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,740
He's soft.

533
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,860
Mind bringing him in here for a chat?

534
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,460
Have Monteleone and Rand pick up Wright.

535
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,460
Deliver him here.

536
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,180
Sure, boss.

537
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,060
Is that the 7220?

538
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,420
That's the 7230.

539
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,620
Sweet.

540
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,340
Yeah.

541
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,780
Petty Officer Dion Lambert.

542
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,500
Sorry.

543
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,300
Never heard of him.

544
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,740
A Navy computer geek.

545
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,100
eals painkillers from the government.

546
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,940
What does a swabbie stealing
painkillers have to do with me?

547
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,980
He sells them to you, you sell
them to your beltway clients.

548
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,820
This really is a waste of time.

549
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,180
I've advised my client not to
answer your questions, and he won't.

550
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,180
That is beautiful.

551
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,620
Franck Muller Conquistador.

552
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,100
$7,800 retail.

553
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,780
Yeah; you know that guy paid retail.

554
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,580
Look at him.

555
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,580
We've known you've
been dealing for months.

556
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,620
Really.

557
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,140
Then, uh, why'd it take
you this long to call me in?

558
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,300
The lieutenant wanted your source.

559
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,660
And I just gave it to him.

560
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,460
And that's the Petty Officer?

561
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,180
What was his name again?

562
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,340
Dion Lambert.

563
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,140
I'm scanning...

564
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,820
No. No hits.

565
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
This isn't a frat bust for grass, Aaron.

566
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,380
This is hard time.

567
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,940
Every night...

568
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,140
hard time.

569
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,500
Tell us where Petty
Officer Lambert's hiding.

570
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,420
We'll cut you a deal.

571
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,660
Minimum time in a Federal facility
without nightly cavity searches.

572
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,700
Aaron, if they had evidence of
you doing something illegal-

573
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,020
which I know you didn't they
wouldn't be talking deals.

574
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,780
I have to listen to my lawyer.

575
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,980
He's very expensive.

576
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,620
When I find Petty Officer Lambert...

577
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,100
And he will.

578
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,660
...he'll roll on you for a deal.

579
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,460
Really?

580
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:39,940
Yeah.

581
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,380
You want to know why?

582
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,540
'Cause he's soft.

583
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,900
Just like you.

584
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,260
What is this?

585
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,780
"Bad Cop, Bad Cop"?

586
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,900
Gibbs, we miscalculated.

587
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,420
You think?

588
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,820
Our friend here's
looking forward to playing

589
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,140
strip poker in
Marion- without cards.

590
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,180
Yeah? Is that true...

591
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,860
Air-ron?

592
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,460
Charge my client or we're walking out.

593
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,060
Now.

594
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:15,980
Bastards.

595
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,660
Aaron?

596
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,180
You won't last 48 hours at Marion.

597
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,580
Oh, I figure 24.

598
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,060
Five bucks.

599
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,620
That's a bet.

600
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,660
What are you laugh at, DiNozzo?

601
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,940
And you, Monteleone?

602
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,580
We didn't break him!

603
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,580
Made him piss his pants, though.

604
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,820
Hell, yes.

605
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,340
I'd wait until we get out.

606
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,820
Aaron.

607
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,980
Hey, how would you like to discuss
that interrogation over some...

608
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,820
Chinese food? I don't think so.

609
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,420
- Yeah, how'd you know I was going to...?
- Kate said you would.

610
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,780
Well you see, Kate's just a little...

611
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,260
Jealous?

612
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,340
Did she tell you I was
going to say that, too?

613
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,580
You have got one thinqs You're almost
as good-looking as you think you are.

614
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,780
Gibbs! George Mansur,
Lambert's ex-roommate he's online!

615
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,660
- Where? -I back-traced his I.address
to the Key Bridge Cybercin Georgetown.

616
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
Tony, McGee, you're with me.

617
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,220
Kate, phones.

618
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,580
Abby, keep tabs on Mansur's computer.

619
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,980
But...

620
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,820
Boys night out!

621
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,420
Which means girls night in!

622
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,500
Transfer your phones to my lab.

623
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,940
Look, this is illegal!

624
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,980
Your guy is on my computer!

625
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,940
It's not your computer.

626
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,860
It's the cybercafe's.

627
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,820
Yeah, well, I'm logged in on it!

628
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,860
He can see all of my trades.

629
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,380
That's an invasion of my privacy!

630
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,380
Actually, he's right, boss.

631
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:16,002
Aha.

632
00:29:16,457 --> 00:29:18,580
Then... you'll let me go?

633
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,620
No.

634
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,340
Hel...!

635
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,740
Don't... shout.

636
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Federal Agents.

637
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,020
All's well.

638
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,500
Go about your business.

639
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,940
Where's your roomie?

640
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,220
I- I don't have one.

641
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,220
Ex-roomie.

642
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:33,980
Dion?

643
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,060
I don't know. I haven't seen him
since I moved out two weeks ago.

644
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,260
Why'd you move?

645
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,820
He bought the place.

646
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,460
Didn't want a roommate anymore.

647
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,860
You didn't file a change of address.

648
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,940
I- I mailed it in yesterday.

649
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,220
You and Dion partners?

650
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,540
No. He-he works his own trades.

651
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,300
A Petty Officer Second
day trades in the market?

652
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,980
Dion's sharp.

653
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,460
Is that what this is about?

654
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,420
His inside trading?

655
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,860
Inside trading?

656
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:56,940
Had to be.

657
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,900
He makes a lot more money
than I do in the market.

658
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,100
The drug market?

659
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,420
Dion wasn't dealing drugs.

660
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,500
I'd have known.

661
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,300
Well, if he was, I didn't know, I swear!

662
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,380
Where's Dion now?

663
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,500
I don't know!

664
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,380
He's a workaholic.

665
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,700
If he's not home, he's at his job.

666
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,460
Yeah. Gibbs.

667
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,780
This is your car, right?

668
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,220
Okay...

669
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,500
You make a couple hundred
grand a year and you drive this?

670
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,540
I'm not a... car guy.

671
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,900
Don't you dig chicks?

672
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,500
Right. Got it.

673
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,540
Get McGee and Abby to do what
they do when they hook up.

674
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,900
You meant their computers.

675
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,900
Then you take him in.

676
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,740
Well, I haven't done...

677
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,260
Shut up!

678
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,180
So, what's up?

679
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,180
Lieutenant Cheney found
Petty Officer Lambert.

680
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,180
Where?

681
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,260
In a ravine in Rock Creek Park.

682
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,000
This the pretty officer who
faked his murder, Jethro?

683
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,000
Unless DNA says otherwise.

684
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,520
Yeah, well, he's not faking now.

685
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,880
Shooter put one round
into the back of his head.

686
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,640
And his hair is burned.

687
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,800
I'd say the muzzle was within
two inches of his skull.

688
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,120
Aaron Wright doesn't have the guts to
pull a trigger looking you in the eyes.

689
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,840
Neither does George Mansur,
but my gut's telling me

690
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,240
that Ducky's about to
eliminate him as a suspect.

691
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,040
What time did our boy die, Duck?

692
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,400
Patience, Jethro.

693
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,840
Mr. Palmer is at home with the flu,
so I'm my own assistant tonight.

694
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,560
Yeah.

695
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,480
Judging by the ambient
temperature, I'd say

696
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,160
he expired between
18:00 and 21:00 hours.

697
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,800
How does that jibe with your gut?

698
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,240
Well... let us see.

699
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,880
Mansur bought Argente Cosmetics
two days before it jumped 28 points.

700
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,560
Must have been when the FDA
approved androgen lipstick.

701
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,800
It increases a woman's libido.

702
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,320
Viagra for women?

703
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,120
Why is that funny, McGee?

704
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
It's not that it's funny.

705
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,960
It's, it's, you know, women.

706
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,200
Women...

707
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,000
don't need to be turned
on before they perform?

708
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,480
No, no, that's not what I mean, Abby.

709
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,560
What?!

710
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,160
Yikes, Abby.

711
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,840
What did McGee do this time?

712
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,720
He put his size ten shoe
in his size 12 mouth.

713
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,200
When did Mansur log
on at the cyber cafe?

714
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,800
16:56.

715
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,680
Four minutes before
the Tokyo market opened.

716
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,400
The longest trading
gap was eight minutes

717
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,320
until Neander-boy took over.

718
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,360
When you're done with Neander-boy,
tell him to release Mansur.

719
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,240
That might be a while, Gibbs.

720
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,480
Oh, no, wait a minute, wait a minute.

721
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,040
No, no, no, no, no.

722
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,720
I've never paid for it in my life.

723
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,240
Well, I was 15 and my cousin
Anzo paid Maggie O'Brian

724
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,000
for the both of us,
but that doesn't count.

725
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Yes it does, Tony.

726
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,600
I'm Primo.

727
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,000
Sorry. Couldn't tell
the two of you apart.

728
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,160
Look at this.

729
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,760
Someone's been chain smoking here.

730
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,920
Do you smoke, Aaron?

731
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,320
All right, you got me, all right?

732
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,080
I lit up in your elevator.

733
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,000
What's the big...?

734
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,240
Oh, geez.

735
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,320
How's it going, Ducky?

736
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,800
Slow, with no assistant.

737
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,080
This the killer?

738
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,360
I didn't kill anybody.

739
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,160
I don't even own a gun.

740
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,400
You want to see what your bullet did?

741
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,000
No.

742
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,000
Did Aaron just acknowledge he shot him?

743
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,120
Sounded that way to me.

744
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,200
No. I don't want to see this.

745
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,480
I can assure you, it will
be very instructional.

746
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,120
Your slug penetrated the occipital
lobe, instantly blinding the poor boy.

747
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,240
Death, of course, was so sudden,
I doubt that he'd notice it.

748
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,640
It then entered the corpus callosum.

749
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,400
Oh, God, just stop. I gotta barf.

750
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,800
During the 18th century, the corpus
callosum was believed to house the soul.

751
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,400
It wasn't till the mid-20th
century that scientists determined

752
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,080
that it's a thick bundle of nerve
fibers to transfer information

753
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,120
between the right and left
hemispheres of the brain.

754
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,400
Fascinating.

755
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,960
I didn't kill Dion.

756
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,960
Dion?

757
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,440
Definitely someone he was
on a first-name basis with.

758
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,360
Is that deal you offered
still on the table?

759
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,440
Hell, no.

760
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,600
I know who killed him.

761
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,240
Do I get the deal?

762
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,720
Not if it was you.

763
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,520
I can live with that.

764
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,320
I picked up the drugs
from a blind mailbox.

765
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,800
I sent the cash by return mail.

766
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,440
The last shipment came in two days ago.

767
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,600
I dropped 50 grand in
the mail that night.

768
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,280
He made a million and got
whacked waiting for 50 grand.

769
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,280
You cops always inflate.

770
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,000
They never made anywhere near a mil.

771
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,560
They?

772
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,440
Dion and his partner.

773
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,000
What partner?

774
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,000
I don't know his name.

775
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,960
I only worked with Dion.

776
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,000
Hey, wait-wait.

777
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,760
Just... hear me out. Please.

778
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,725
Sorry. His partner is a...

779
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,240
a computer geek where Dion works.

780
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,400
He picked up on the
scam and he threatened

781
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,000
to report it unless
Dion cut him in on half.

782
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,520
Find the partner...

783
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,360
you find his killer.

784
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,200
I don't believe him.

785
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,680
If two of my people were
ripping off the system,

786
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,120
I should be fired for incompetence.

787
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,560
They weren't both doing it.

788
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,240
Petty Officer Wilson
caught on to the scam.

789
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,760
Well, if he caught on, I should have.

790
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,800
They sat next to each other.

791
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,160
You're not very
computer-literate are you, Jethro?

792
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,440
Boss?

793
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,600
He's got a Trojan horse on
Petty Officer Lambert's computer.

794
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,280
He could access his programs.

795
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,920
I didn't insert that.

796
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,120
Just once, boss, I wish one of
these guys would say "You got me."

797
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,880
"I did it."

798
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,600
McGee.

799
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,120
Sorry, man.

800
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,280
Ma'am, you know me.

801
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,360
I love the Navy.

802
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,360
I wouldn't steal from it.

803
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,760
I believe you, Niles.

804
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
How could I have missed this yesterday?

805
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,560
Nobody gets everything right
the first time, McGee...

806
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,520
except Gibbs.

807
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,040
I just can't believe that Niles did it.

808
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,200
McGee, you're so...

809
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,160
trusting.

810
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,400
What's wrong with that?

811
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,960
Well, it's great in a relationship.

812
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,160
Kind of sucks for an investigation.

813
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,040
Aw...

814
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,160
Poor baby.

815
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,520
Familiar with this new
advance in technology called...

816
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,800
power tools?

817
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,400
Close your eyes.

818
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,280
You feel the wood?

819
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,240
You don't get a sensation
like that from a power tool.

820
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,640
Something is hinky here, McGee.

821
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,040
These are the butts that
Kate found at the crime scene.

822
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,840
Looks like identical twins.

823
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,880
All from the same pack.

824
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,720
Now, these are Aaron Wright and
Petty Officer Wilson's Triboros.

825
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,200
Twins, but not identical because
they came from different packs.

826
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,240
Correct... but not my point.

827
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,720
The killer didn't smoke Triboros.

828
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,760
The butts that Kate found were Llamas.

829
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,960
Okay, I gotta call Gibbs.

830
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
You just proved that Petty
Officer Wilson isn't the killer.

831
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,400
Or Aaron Wright?

832
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,600
You ruled out both suspects.

833
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,400
No, I didn't.

834
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,640
Either one could still be the murderer.

835
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,000
All I proved is that someone
smoked Llamas at Rock Creek Park.

836
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,240
Yeah. Gibbs.

837
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,160
Boss, uh...

838
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,600
I- I don't know if this
is important or not.

839
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,920
McGee, this had better be the most
important phone call you ever made.

840
00:39:00,802 --> 00:39:01,360
Yeah.

841
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,600
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

842
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,600
Come on, what's wrong?

843
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
Your petty officer won't
admit to any involvement.

844
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,680
Well... I don't believe he was.

845
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,160
You got a smoke?

846
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,280
Well, that surprises me.

847
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,360
Thank you.

848
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,520
Ever been to Sicily?

849
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,880
Interesting segue.

850
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,760
No.

851
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,520
Capaci's a town outside Palermo.

852
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,560
In '91, there was a Mafia don
sitting in a hillside orchard

853
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,520
chain-smoking, watching the road below.

854
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,880
Two cars in a tight formation
came around the corner.

855
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,080
The don hit a switch.

856
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
The road exploded.

857
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,800
It killed the chief
magistrate prosecuting

858
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,280
the Sicilian Mafia, his
wife and three bodyguards.

859
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,760
The Italian carabinari, they found
the cigarette butts in the orchard.

860
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,400
Sent them to our FBI crime lab.

861
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,840
They matched the DNA from the
saliva on the filters to the don.

862
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,480
It's the first time that DNA was ever
used successfully to prosecute a killer.

863
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,320
You are a very strange man.

864
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Yeah. Yeah...

865
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,360
It's about to get stranger.

866
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,440
Karen.

867
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,520
I hope that the DNA on
this cigarette doesn't match

868
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,240
the butts found where Dion was executed.

869
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:43,040
Oh, I really do.
