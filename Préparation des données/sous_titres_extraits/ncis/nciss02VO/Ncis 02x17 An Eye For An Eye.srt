1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,500
It's always about him.

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,940
He called me at 7:30 last
night, and expected me

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,140
to drop whatever I was doing,
just because he was available.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:17,860
Hi.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,220
No, I didn't have any plans,
but that's not the point.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,820
I'm not crazy about his friends, either.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,780
None of them are married.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,900
Point is, I know where this is leading.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,500
Nowhere.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,740
Yeah, I guess so.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,940
Give me a half hour to wash
up, I'll meet you there?

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,900
No, I'm listening.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,580
Somebody sent me a package.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,980
Whatever it is, it's cold.

15
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,100
My, my, you are hypnotic, aren't you?

16
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,300
No thank you, Mr. Palmer.

17
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,580
Better to poke around with these.

18
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,180
Did you know the word
"autopsy" comes from the Greek,

19
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,820
Meaning "to see for one's self?"

20
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,540
They didn't offer
Greek in my high school.

21
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,660
Oh, perhaps we should try Latin, then.

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,500
Are you familiar with
the term "keratoplasty"?

23
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,100
Uh, cornea transplant surgery.

24
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,620
Oh, then your education did paid off.

25
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,620
My mother will be pleased to hear that.

26
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,420
What do we know, Duck?

27
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,180
Oh, I just started, Jethro.

28
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,340
How did these come into our possession?

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,700
They were in a package
delivered to a petty officer.

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,220
Mailman put them in the wrong box.

31
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,660
Neighbor opened them up, and
scared the hell out of her.

32
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,300
Yeah, I should imagine so.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,460
Oh, these have been
enucleated and preserved

34
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,300
with skill and care by a surgeon.

35
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,700
Assuming they're as
healthy as they appear,

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,980
transplantation would be
thinevitable conclusion.

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,860
We don't necessarily need your body
to discover what happened to you.

38
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,340
They say that the eyes are
the windows to the soul.

39
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,340
Wow. I'm impressed.

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,780
You can actually sleep
with your eyes open.

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,100
Yeah, I'm meditating.

42
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,540
Yeah, on how much you drank last
night, or trying to remember her name?

43
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,500
I don't kiss and tell, Kate.

44
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,780
Since when?

45
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,220
I know more about your sex
life than I do my own, Tony.

46
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,860
Well, that's not hard to believe,
Probie, considering you don't have one.

47
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,820
Gibbs wants to know
everything there is to know

48
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,820
about this package, and if I were you,
I wouldn't let him catch you napping.

49
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,260
Thanks for the advice,
but I got it covered.

50
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,100
Anybody, talk to me.

51
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,340
Well, I'm checking with
eye banks and the MTCs

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,900
that handle tissue and organ donation.

53
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,580
Any of them missing a set of blue eyes?

54
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,460
Well, I haven't heard
back from them yet.

55
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,020
Uh, no return address on the package,
boss, but I did contact the post office.

56
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,820
Yeah. And?

57
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,100
They are running the tracking
number from the barcode.

58
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,140
Yeah, I'm gonna call
them back right now.

59
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,140
Package was addressed to a Petty
Officer Second Class Benjamin Horlacher.

60
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,780
Stationed at Dam Neck.

61
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,300
Currently on a 72, due back tomorrow.

62
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,260
Now that's a 72-hour...

63
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,900
leave there, Katie.

64
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,540
He's a student at the Navy and Marine
Corps Intelligence Training Center.

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,460
Been living at that address
since last September.

66
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,060
Military records are clean.

67
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,140
Only things that stand
out are a speeding ticket

68
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,940
two months ago, and, uh, he didn't
pay his cable bill last week.

69
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,820
Good to know somebody
is working around here.

70
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,500
Uh, thank you.

71
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,220
So far, no one's reported missing
a pair of cobalt blues, Gibbs.

72
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,260
The package was shipped two days
ago from Ciudad del Este, Paraguay.

73
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,060
Paraguay?

74
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,940
The
T- B-A.

75
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,700
That's the Tri-Border Area.

76
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,020
That's where Paraguay,
Argentina and Brazil meet.

77
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,460
It's a base of operations for
smugglers, drug trafficking,

78
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,980
illegal-organ trafficking.

79
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,780
And Hezbollah and Al Qaeda cells.

80
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,620
All right.

81
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,900
We'll meet you out front, boss.

82
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,500
We're going to Dam Neck.

83
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,940
You didn't move all morning.

84
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,900
How did you know that?

85
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,620
Work smarter, not harder, Katie.

86
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,700
You'll live longer.

87
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,740
Probie, I want to know who shipped

88
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,220
that package from Paraguay
as soon as I get back.

89
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,860
You got it, boss.

90
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,660
Uh, Tony.

91
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,940
Let's move it, Kate.

92
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,300
Believe me, this isn't the first time

93
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,700
that fool mailman put
stuff in the wrong box.

94
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,540
I got a video of some
college girls just last week

95
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,180
flashing their you know whats.

96
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,740
When's the last time you saw
Petty Officer Horlacher, ma'am?

97
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,740
Couple days ago.

98
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,180
What can you tell us about him?

99
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,220
He's quiet, he keeps to himself.

100
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,140
He's got a girlfriend.

101
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,980
They live together?

102
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,460
Who knows, these days?

103
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,620
She comes and goes.

104
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,100
Think he made her a key.

105
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,180
It's a violation of the lease,
but, uh, I look the other way.

106
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,180
We'd like to look at
Horlacher's apartment.

107
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,260
Is that a problem?

108
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,380
Considering what was in that package?

109
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,420
Please do.

110
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,340
I see you're not wearing a
wedding ring, Agent Gibbs.

111
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,820
Maybe you'd like to inspect that video

112
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,220
with me when you're done.

113
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,460
He is single.

114
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,500
Now, how does a fine man
like that stay single?

115
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,500
Well, he didn't.

116
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,780
He's been married three times.

117
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,180
Let you know when we're
finished, Miss Robinson.

118
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,540
I'll take the bedroom.

119
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,260
This guy's already in trouble.

120
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,300
Girlfriend's taken over.

121
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,420
Maybe not.

122
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,460
Killing Fields, Undercover Agent.

123
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,060
There's makeup in the bathroom.

124
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,100
There's women's clothes in his closet.

125
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,220
But I can't say much for her taste.

126
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,100
Let's see if we can find out her name.

127
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:24,820
Right.

128
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,660
Who the hell are you?!

129
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,180
Petty Officer Benjamin Horlacher?

130
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,940
NCIS.

131
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,300
What's going on, sir?

132
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,340
We're here to investigate a package

133
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,620
delivered to you, opened
by mistake by your neighbor.

134
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,580
Sent from Ciudad del Este, Paraguay.

135
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,180
It contained human organs.

136
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,260
A pair of eyes.

137
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,500
Eyes? You got to be kidding me, sir.

138
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,100
Where've you been the last
couple of days, Petty Officer?

139
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,060
On a 72.

140
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,500
Visiting my family in New Jersey.

141
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,540
You training to be an
intelligence analyst at Dam Neck?

142
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,540
Yes, sir.

143
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,220
What area of the world do you
cover there, Petty Officer?

144
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,420
Central and South America.

145
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,860
You ever been to Paraguay?

146
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,340
Never. Look, I don't know what's
going on here, but I'm sure...

147
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,220
Maybe your girlfriend does.

148
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,260
I don't have a girlfriend.

149
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,820
So what woman is keeping all
of her clothes in your bedroom?

150
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,020
We broke up...

151
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,820
a month ago.

152
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,260
She hasn't come back
yet to pick up her stuff.

153
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,860
I'm telling you, I don't
know anything about eyes.

154
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,580
Shouldn't you have a warrant
or something to be in here?

155
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,340
You keep yourself
available, Petty Officer.

156
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,100
We'll have more questions for you.

157
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,740
Yes, sir.

158
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,660
There was an open
lipstick in the bathroom.

159
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,260
The girlfriend's still
living there, Gibbs.

160
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,020
Definitely hiding something.

161
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:50,980
Oh, yeah.

162
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,740
So why are we letting him walk?

163
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,100
We're not.

164
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,540
You two are staying here.

165
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,020
Watch him.

166
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,660
I want to know what he does next.

167
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,900
Yeah, Abbs?

168
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,860
Jethro, can you hear me?

169
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,300
Oh, he can hear you.

170
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,300
What did you got?

171
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,300
Well, I...

172
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,660
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,300
Ladies first.

174
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,780
That is so sweet.

175
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
Oh, it's a pleasure, I'm sure.

176
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,820
Today, Abby.

177
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,300
Okay.

178
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,340
So I ran the DNA through AFDIL.

179
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,900
I didn't get a match,
but we can definitely

180
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,700
start calling Old Blue Eyes a Jane Doe.

181
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,380
Those babies are female.

182
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,500
And I think you'd like to know

183
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,380
that Ms. Doe gave up
her eyes unwillingly.

184
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,380
How do you know?

185
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,460
Well, at first blush,
the eyes seemed flawless.

186
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,940
But careful dissection showed
large intraorbital hematoma.

187
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,740
Meaning?

188
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,700
Well, Jethro, if you slice into an eye

189
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,940
like you would, say, an egg, you
risk nicking the blood vessels.

190
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,020
But if you gingerly peel apart the eye,

191
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,860
layer by layer, like an
onion, then you can be sure...

192
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,700
Uh, Ducky, the short version.

193
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,900
Cardiac arrest.

194
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,500
I found abnormally
high levels of potassium

195
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,780
in the vitreous and
choroids of both eyes.

196
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,420
I'd say she was most likely poisoned.

197
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,060
Jethro, did you know that corneal
transplantation dates back to 1905...?

198
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,940
One source of tissue back then
were prisoners on Death Row, who...

199
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,260
Jethro?

200
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,660
He's not there.

201
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,180
Oh, we lost the connection?

202
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,580
No, he hung up.

203
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,580
But you can tell me
the rest of the story.

204
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,100
Go back to the part where you're
peeling the layers off the eyeball.

205
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,740
Oh, God...

206
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,300
Wake up.

207
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I am awake.

208
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,780
Could you turn the heat up, please?

209
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,500
I'm freezing.

210
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,300
Can't.

211
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,060
Smoke from the tailpipe
will give away our position.

212
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,300
Great. I can't feel my legs here.

213
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,180
We can do what the
Eskimos do to keep warm.

214
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,620
What's that?

215
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,180
They press their bodies together.

216
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,580
Of course, the effect is
greatly improved if you're naked.

217
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,340
There's not enough liquor on the
planet to make that happen, Tony.

218
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,260
I wasn't suggesting the naked part.

219
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,100
But if you want to freeze...

220
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,460
freeze.

221
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,220
Oh, I need a vacation.

222
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
Where would you go?

223
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,060
Ooh, someplace warm, somewhere where
there's no cell phone reception.

224
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,340
The tropics.

225
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,580
Oh, yes, the tropics would be nice.

226
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,860
Horlacher's light just went off.

227
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,980
Well, he's probably going
to bed; it's midnight.

228
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,580
Oh, God...

229
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,020
do you think we're going to
have to stay here all night?

230
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,540
Why don't you call Gibbs and find out?

231
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,540
Why don't you call Gibbs and find out?

232
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,020
Because I know the answer.

233
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,940
Oh, I need a vacation!

234
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,700
What the hell was that?

235
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,540
Get back in your apartment.

236
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,020
(Let's say you're just
taking out insurance.)

237
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,780
(I haven't any money)

238
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,300
(Not the kind you want.)

239
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:15,740
(No?)

240
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,060
(No!)

241
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,420
(But your adopted family has.)

242
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,860
(You think I'd ask
them for money for you?)

243
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,740
(You don't ask.)

244
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,020
(You're a woman, aren't you?)

245
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,660
(Use your head.)

246
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,260
(No.)

247
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,380
Clear.

248
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,380
(No, I won't do it.)

249
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,860
(Kid would have a pretty rough time...)

250
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,420
He had a secret, all right.

251
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,660
What do you have, Duck?

252
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,690
Well, it's a sad situation, Jethro.

253
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,370
Even in today's enlightened age,

254
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,930
transexualism is terribly misunderstood.

255
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,210
His identity as a male...

256
00:11:59,330 --> 00:11:59,650
Doctor...

257
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,210
Yes, Mr. Palmer?

258
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,850
I think Agent Gibbs was referring more
to the forensic aspect of, the, uh...

259
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,850
situation... maybe.

260
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,490
Has head-slapping been
effective for you, Jethro?

261
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,410
Yeah. Look at the way
DiNozzo turned out.

262
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,250
The pattern of gunpowder
residue and the exit wound

263
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,410
on his back suggests the weapon
was held directly over the heart.

264
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,210
Death was instantaneous.

265
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,330
In all probability,
he took his own life.

266
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,730
Boss, don't most suicides
shoot themselves in the head?

267
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,770
Men. Not women.

268
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,890
Guess he didn't think
of himself as a man.

269
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,330
Well, she must've known that
her secret was going to come out.

270
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,210
Don't you mean, he must've known
that his secret was going to come out?

271
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,090
Psychosexually speaking, Tony, Horlacher
was a woman trapped in a man's body.

272
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,450
And when she killed
herself, she freed herself.

273
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,690
Thus the note.

274
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,930
Hey, you know what this reminds me of?

275
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,570
Pacci's suspect that we
were staking-out last year.

276
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,450
That's right.

277
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,810
Yeah, the beautiful pre-op
transsexual that seduced Tony.

278
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,610
She didn't seduce me.

279
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,490
I was undercover.

280
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,530
Yeah, well, didn't you
stick your tongue down...

281
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,530
Okay, I took one for
the team, all right?!

282
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,090
Someone had to keep her occupied.

283
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,610
Don't you mean him?

284
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,530
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,090
Sorry, boss.

286
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,210
Uh, I'm sorry.

287
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,090
Uh, I'll get you a fresh one.

288
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,170
It was black, right?

289
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,930
Black it is.

290
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,130
You didn't see anyone
else enter or leave?

291
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,250
No, she was here alone.

292
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,290
All right, check his phone records.

293
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,110
Maybe he made some other phone calls

294
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,490
while he was deciding to off himself.

295
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,850
Already on it.

296
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,210
I'll have them tomorrow.

297
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,170
I'm thinking there was
no girlfriend, Gibbs.

298
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,650
That he was just living a double life.

299
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,690
Puts a whole new spin on
"don't ask, don't tell."

300
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,490
I am much more interested
in the "cross-dressing sailor

301
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,610
who's getting body
parts in the mail" spin.

302
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,890
Get he-she's laptop to Abby.

303
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,210
Hey, Gibbs, you're just in time.

304
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,210
Okay, from the outside, it
looks like a normal laptop.

305
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,850
But on the inside?

306
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,410
Voila.

307
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,250
Fortified with the
kind of data encryption

308
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,290
that only someone with
something to hide would have.

309
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,530
A petty officer's protocol
far more sophisticated

310
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,890
than any PGP or DES software I've seen.

311
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,610
At first, we didn't even understand
his obfuscation algorithm.

312
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,770
Really hardcore stuff.

313
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,730
Very, very hardcore.

314
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,170
Did you get in or not?

315
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,210
Yeah.

316
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,330
And no.

317
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,690
There's just one layer
we haven't cracked yet.

318
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,210
But we did get Petty
Officer Horlacher's blog.

319
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,210
It's a personal Internet journal.

320
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,490
Web-log... blog.

321
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,930
Get it?

322
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,690
Pig Latin.

323
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,690
Actually that would be "Ebway Oglay."

324
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,170
Pig Latin adds a "way" to
words starting with vowels,

325
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,890
and "ay" to words starting with
consonants after moving part of the word...

326
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,050
I'm sure you knew that already.

327
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,170
The blob say anything useful?

328
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,290
It's mostly men are from Mars stuff.

329
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,810
He was very interested in the
differences between men and women.

330
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,810
Men are from where?

331
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,690
Mars, Gibbs, and women are from Venus.

332
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,490
It's a famous book about relationships
and communication between the sexes.

333
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,130
There was that TV show and a board game
and the guy wrote like ten sequels...

334
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,050
I'm beginning to understand why
you were married three times.

335
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:21,650
Abby!

336
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,650
Come look at it for yourself.

337
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,530
"Inside every good man
there is a better woman."

338
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,330
"LOL"?

339
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,610
That's "laughing out loud."

340
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,490
Which, of course, can be topped by...

341
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,410
"R-O-T-F-L-O-L."

342
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,050
"Rolling on the floor
laughing out loud."

343
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,610
Keep looking.

344
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,850
Horlacher was leading
two different lives.

345
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,010
I want to know everything there is
to know about both of them. A-S-A-P.

346
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,970
Onway itway, Ibbsgay!

347
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,930
There was a time I would have
killed for a pair of eyes like that.

348
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,930
Think she was a blonde or a brunette?

349
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,130
What difference does it make?

350
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,290
I love brunettes.

351
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,170
I bet she was beautiful.

352
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,570
Are you telling me that you're attracted
to a disembodied set of eyeballs?

353
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,210
Weird, huh?

354
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,490
More like disturbing.

355
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,930
It's kind of like that movie Laura.

356
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:07,970
Laura?

357
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,010
Yeah. Old movie by Otto Preminger.

358
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,650
It's about a cop who falls
in love with the painting

359
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,570
of a girl whose head's
been blown off by a shotgun.

360
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:17,810
Sounds romantic.

361
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,010
You have no idea.

362
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,930
Gene Tierney was a goddess.

363
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,290
What do we have?

364
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,250
Well, I called Petty
Officer Horlacher's family.

365
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,450
He lied about paying them
a visit over the weekend.

366
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,650
They hadn't heard from
him in over a year.

367
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,250
Still can't find a
connection to Paraguay, boss.

368
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,410
He's never deployed overseas.

369
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,290
Doesn't even have a passport.

370
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,450
Yeah, and what I want to know
is how a suicidal transvestite

371
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,090
attended a top-secret intelligence
school without anybody noticing.

372
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,850
You contact his faculty advisor yet?

373
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,770
I was just about to.

374
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,290
Name's Lieutenant Commander
Guyman Purcell, Retired.

375
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,930
Got his PhD in South American studies.

376
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,210
I think we should interview him.

377
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,810
Yeah? Why's that?

378
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,450
According to Horlacher's phone records,

379
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,930
he called the Commander right
before he killed himself.

380
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,010
That's good work, Tony.

381
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,490
Get the car...

382
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,610
Kate.

383
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,210
Okay, now that we've learned a little
bit about recruiting double agents,

384
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,010
let's take a moment to consider
some of the risks involved.

385
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,330
Anybody?

386
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,170
DiNozzo.

387
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,570
Would you like to become left-handed?

388
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,650
You going for your
brown-nose badge this week?

389
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,490
You're just jealous 'cause it's working.

390
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,930
Yes, Miss Ellsworth.

391
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,450
What kind of a risk
does a double agent pose?

392
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,290
He could double-cross you back, sir?

393
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,290
Exactly.

394
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,370
You have just convinced someone to
betray that which he holds dearest.

395
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,690
His country. His family.

396
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,410
Perhaps even himself.

397
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,170
These are weak-minded individuals.

398
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,650
If your recruit proves
untrustworthy, he must be

399
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,810
either coerced or abandoned, but
nothing can jeopardize the mission.

400
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,930
Petty Officer Horlacher
is a decent student.

401
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,170
That's all I know about him, really.

402
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,850
You cover Ciudad del Este in your class?

403
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,370
The Tri-Border Area. Of course. Why?

404
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,290
Horlacher got a package from there.

405
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,650
Inside were a pair of human eyes.

406
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,010
Cut out of a woman's head.

407
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,170
God. that's horrible.

408
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,890
What did the Petty Officer say about it?

409
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,730
Claims to have not
known anything about it.

410
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,930
Did you ever spend any personal time
with him outside of class, Mr. Purcel.

411
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,410
No, in my field, the students tend

412
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,090
to see their instructors
as larger than life.

413
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,090
It's best not to get too attached.

414
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,010
So that would be a "no"?

415
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,250
Am I being interrogated for some reason?

416
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:24,970
Depends.

417
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,930
On what, Agent Gibbs?

418
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,290
Why he called you last night.

419
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,170
Many of my students call me at home.

420
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,690
Last night, Benjamin
wanted to know if I'd give

421
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,250
him an extension on
a paper due this week.

422
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,090
Did you give it to him?

423
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:34,530
Yes.

424
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,730
Good. He could use it.

425
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:37,970
He's in trouble?

426
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:38,890
He's dead.

427
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,330
He killed himself last night.

428
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,210
Right after he got
off the phone with you.

429
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,570
I don't know what to say.

430
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,170
Why don't we start with
what you said to him?

431
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,050
Well, this wasn't the first
time he asked for an extension.

432
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,410
I was hard on him.

433
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,890
I told him if he couldn't keep
up, I'd drop him from the course.

434
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,130
It would ruin his career.

435
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,010
I was trying to motivate
him, Agent Gibbs.

436
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,130
Hold his feet to the fire.

437
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,370
I never thought he'd...

438
00:18:59,530 --> 00:18:59,890
Jump in?

439
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,290
The retired Lieutenant
Commander's got his own

440
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,650
consulting business,
Purcell Security Group.

441
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,730
They specialize in...

442
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,610
Intelligence work, boss.

443
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,290
They've got several high-paying
government contracts.

444
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,130
The biggest one is...

445
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:16,610
Southcom.

446
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,930
He's traveled back and
forth to Paraguay ten times

447
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,330
in the last six months, and
the area he's been working...

448
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,690
Ciudad del Este.

449
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,890
I'm thinking this guy's a spook.

450
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,090
Or working for spooks.

451
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,610
Everything concerning
his consulting work

452
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,090
has been flagged way above my clearance.

453
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,650
Great.

454
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,210
Because I hate spooks.

455
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,890
Yeah. Gibbs.

456
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,090
I might know who the
eyes' former owner was.

457
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,090
Okay, we're on our way.

458
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,330
Abby thinks she's found the
body that goes with those.

459
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,330
Business in Central
and South America comes

460
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,170
with its own special set of problems.

461
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,250
Are you working in a
hostile environment?

462
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,850
Are you dealing with corrupt or

463
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,250
untrustworthy local officials?

464
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,250
My course can make the difference

465
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,511
between success and
failure, and death...

466
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:03,090
There's about four hours of
online instruction classes

467
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,650
Associated with this website.

468
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,050
They were bookmarked on Petty
Officer Horlacher's hard drive.

469
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,410
And after watching them,
I can say with certainty

470
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,010
Purcell needs a charisma bypass.

471
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,690
What does this have to do
with the eyeballs, Abby?

472
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,930
Well, Horlacher accessed this
jpeg file 22 times last week.

473
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,450
Look familiar?

474
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,090
Oh... I was right.

475
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,770
She is beautiful.

476
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,130
How can you be sure it's her?

477
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,930
Because- iris patterns are more
distinctive than fingerprints.

478
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,250
More accurate, too, boss.

479
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,690
The video is grainy, and
the es aren't perfect.

480
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,490
The lighting...

481
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,770
Abby, is it her or not?

482
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,410
It's an 80% match, Gibbs.

483
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,850
I think we've got our girl.

484
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,390
A dead transsexual sailor, his spook
instructor, and a pair of human eyes...

485
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,390
walk into a bar what's
the punch line, Kate?

486
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,990
Whatever it is, it involves
this girl and Paraguay.

487
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,190
That's true, but not very funny. Probie.

488
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,870
Make me laugh.

489
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:08,910
Okay.

490
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,430
Oh, uh...

491
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,710
Yeah, the bartender doesn't believe it,

492
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,710
so he asks the spook instructor,
"What the hell is going on?"

493
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,870
And the guy says, uh, "What, guy
can't have a drink with his pupils?"

494
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:24,750
Nothing?

495
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,190
Oh, come on, that was pretty funny.

496
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,870
You think this is a joke, McGee?

497
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,030
Uh, no. No, I don't, boss.

498
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,190
Good answer.

499
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,150
Tony, you're with me in MTAC.

500
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,710
Kate, get Purcell in
here; we need to talk.

501
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,510
He hates me, doesn't he?

502
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,990
Well, "hate's" a pretty strong word.

503
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,990
More like a mild dislike.

504
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,230
You did spill his coffee.

505
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,110
Today, DiNozzo!

506
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,430
Gibbs'll get over it.

507
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,310
When?

508
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,430
Well, let's see, uh, last year
Tony spilled his coffee, and, uh,

509
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,950
he warmed up to him about, I don't know,

510
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,510
an hour ago, so roughly,
eight to ten months.

511
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,990
I got your e-mail, Special Agent Gibbs.

512
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,910
To tell you the truth, I was shocked.

513
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,230
When did you learn to use a computer?

514
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,310
Well, times change, Colonel.

515
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,670
That they do, Gunny.

516
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,550
I got two grandkids now.

517
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,070
I heard you got remarried again.

518
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,950
That didn't work out.

519
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,870
Well, then, again, some
things don't change.

520
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,590
How can the Southern
Command help you today?

521
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,710
I'm investigating a civilian contractor

522
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,270
working out of the
Tri-Border Area, Paraguay.

523
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,470
Name?

524
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,470
Guyman Purcell.

525
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,750
Yeah, I heard of him.

526
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,790
Oh, yeah, he's part of a TAT, Tactical

527
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,070
Analysis Team, we have
in Ciudad del Este.

528
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,350
What's your interest in him?

529
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,870
One of his students committed
suicide after receiving

530
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,870
a pair of female eyeballs
in the mail from TBA.

531
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,790
We think Purcell knew the victim.

532
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:03,470
Body parts in the mail generally
denote a kidnap, but eyes?

533
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,910
Well, yeah, it, uh, does
send a hell of a message, sir.

534
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,070
Someone's putting pressure
on Purcell? Uh, why?

535
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,790
That's what I want to find out.

536
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,950
Our TATs work with a few other
agencies, and they're not always

537
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,870
as forthcoming with
information as I would like.

538
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,750
But, uh, when's that ever stopped us?

539
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,150
To old times, Gunny.

540
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,190
Old times, Skipper, old times.

541
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,550
What's that supposed to mean?

542
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,390
You ask me again in seven years.

543
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,350
Why seven years?

544
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,390
That's when the Freedom of
Information Act kicks in.

545
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,150
You know that doesn't work with me.

546
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,430
I always know...

547
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,190
when you're there!

548
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,190
Gibbs?

549
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,790
That's weird.

550
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,990
You looking for me?

551
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,790
You are getting sneakier
the older you get.

552
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,110
Not to mention better-looking.

553
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:03,670
What do you got?

554
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,150
Well, I'm still hacking
the Petty Officer's files,

555
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,270
but I uncovered some e-mails
you'll be interested in.

556
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,990
I back-traced the ISP
they were sent from.

557
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,510
It's a Web server in
Puerto Iguazú, Argentina.

558
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,350
The Tri-Border Area.

559
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,150
Sí.

560
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,750
Escopeta 794.

561
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,510
It's the originator in Argentina, boss.

562
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,470
"Escopeta" means "rifle" in Spanish.

563
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,870
And Shadegirl is one of Petty Officer
Horlacher's private e-mail addresses.

564
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,630
You be the transsexual;
I'll be the rifle.

565
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,390
First exchange was three weeks ago.

566
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,710
"I want the hundred
thousand for the girl."

567
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,150
Shadegirl says her controller will
pay only $60,000 and wants proof.

568
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,150
"One hundred thou..."

569
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,310
Escopeta repeats his demand for
$100,000, swears a bunch in Spanish.

570
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,710
Shadegirl insists on $60,000 and proof.

571
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,110
Swear, swear, swear, threat... swear.

572
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,430
And finally Shadegirl goes up to
$75,000 and says his controller

573
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,110
wants proof before the money is sent.

574
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:05,230
Escopeta expresses his displeasure...
colorfully and slips up he uses a name.

575
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,110
"A hundred was the price.

576
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,430
"Tell Purcell his proof's on the way."

577
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,390
Petty Officer Horlacher
was bearding for Purcell.

578
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,750
How does a transsexual beard, Probie?

579
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,630
Proof of life by ripping out her eyes?

580
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,390
I don't buy it.

581
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,470
Escopeta's running a
kidnapping ring, boss.

582
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,510
They set examples.

583
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,990
You either meet the
price or the person dies.

584
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,510
Yeah. Gibbs.

585
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,590
Purcell's gone, Gibbs.

586
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,430
Where?

587
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,910
Well, according to one of his students,
he was recalled back to Paraguay.

588
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,630
You find out what flight he's on.

589
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,270
Already did; his flight
landed at the Guarani

590
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,150
International Airport 20 minutes ago.

591
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,670
Pack your gear.

592
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,790
You're going to Paraguay.

593
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,550
Alone?

594
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,750
Take one of 'em with you.

595
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,190
I'll start prepping the op from here.

596
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,830
Yes! I've always wanted
to go to Paraguay.

597
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,510
Ha-ha!

598
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,470
Ay! Arriba!

599
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,990
Okay, which way to the Tactical
Analysis Team's headquarters?

600
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,470
¿El derecho o izquierda?

601
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,910
Right.

602
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,830
Derecho.

603
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,430
Aw, I should've brought more cash.

604
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,030
Look at that.

605
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,910
Hey, look at these guys.

606
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,230
Buenos dias.

607
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,110
It's the local bridge club.

608
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,590
Well, it's not the tropics,
but at least it's warm.

609
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,350
Actually, it is the tropics, Tony.

610
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:18,870
Really?

611
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,110
The Tropic of Capricorn, to be exact.

612
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,790
Tropics smell kind
of funny to you, Kate?

613
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,030
It's not the tropics, Tony.

614
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,390
It'd be the plumbing.

615
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,470
How come we never get sent
to, like, Paris or Hawaii?

616
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,230
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

617
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,670
And the best part?

618
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,830
No Gibbs checking up on us.

619
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,390
What the hell are they doing?

620
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,350
They're stopped about 50
feet from the TAT building.

621
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,950
Well, yeah, I can see that, McGee.

622
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,190
Get them on the satellite phone.

623
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,110
Check it out, Kate.

624
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,190
iPod for 30 bucks.

625
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,390
First of all, it says
"L-Pod" on the back.

626
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,470
And second- there's
nothing in here.

627
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,750
DiNozzo.

628
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,950
What's your location?

629
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,070
We're looking for the
TAT building right now.

630
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,750
Town's kind of hard to navigate.

631
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,310
It's 50 feet right in
front of you, DiNozzo.

632
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,510
Found it.

633
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,150
I take it the GPS chip in
the phone is working well?

634
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,310
Well, yes, it is.

635
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,590
Will you quit screwing
around and get moving?!

636
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,950
You're not on vacation.

637
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,670
On it, boss.

638
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,470
Patch me into Colonel Bushnell.

639
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:29,950
On it.

640
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,790
Switch over to Southern Command.

641
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,390
Colonel Bushnell, our
team's at the linkup point.

642
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,350
Their in-country guide is Joe Tabarez.

643
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,270
He's the watch officer for
the Ciudad del Este TAT.

644
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,390
Former Marine. Good man.

645
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,630
Any word on Purcell?

646
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,950
Not since he came through customs.

647
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,710
He hasn't checked in
with any of our people.

648
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,990
He's not in Paraguay
on Southcom business.

649
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,830
What about somebody
else's business, Colonel?

650
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,630
Now, that's possible.

651
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,190
I'm checking that angle now.

652
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,470
I know somebody higher up in the chain

653
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,150
of command is not
making this easy, Jethro.

654
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,350
Yeah.

655
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,550
Agents DiNozzo and Todd?

656
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,710
I'm Joe Tabarez, Tactical Analysis Team.

657
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,230
Welcome to the middle of nowhere.

658
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,150
Nice to meet you.

659
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,670
What's the chain for?

660
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,830
Ciudad del Este anti-theft device.

661
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,910
Let's get inside.

662
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,230
Don't want to get
shot on your first day.

663
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,270
Maldito perro.

664
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,190
This is the Wild West.

665
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,550
If there's a profit in
something, it's for sale.

666
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,390
Bootlegs, drugs, guns, you name it.

667
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,350
It's also Al-Qaeda's front
line in South America.

668
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,830
What about body parts?

669
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,070
Well, there's folks
down here who'd sell you

670
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,950
a kidney if it meant
putting food on the table.

671
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,550
Of course, there's
also folks who'd gladly

672
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,230
take yours for the
same reason, Agent Todd.

673
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,150
Tell us about Purcell.

674
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,310
His intelligence work is first-rate.

675
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,550
Man's developed a lo
of contacts down here.

676
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,670
Well, what do you think of
him personally, Mr. Tabarez?

677
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,390
Oh, it's Joe, and I try not to.

678
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,510
Off the record, Purcell's
one creepy son of a bitch.

679
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,230
What's he supposed to have done?

680
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,070
Shipped a pair of women's eyeballs to
a transsexual sailor who killed himself.

681
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,870
And here I thought I'd seen it all.

682
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,430
You recognize the girl on the right?

683
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,430
I do.

684
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,990
It's Purcell's wife.

685
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,040
We ID'd the girl in the photo, boss.

686
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,320
Name's Anna Real.

687
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,160
Purcell married her
last year in Paraguay.

688
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,760
How old is she?

689
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:45,720
Seventeen.

690
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,800
And he's been "dating"
her for about three years.

691
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,240
The bastard's a pedophile, Gibbs.

692
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,240
Tabarez knew this?

693
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,600
Well, he's the one who told us.

694
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,920
I want to talk to him.

695
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,600
He's out trying to find Purcell.

696
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,160
Or he's having coffee with him.

697
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,000
He looked the other way while
Purcell was molesting a 14-year-old.

698
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,080
What's that tell you two?

699
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,280
Get me Bushnell.

700
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,840
On it.

701
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,520
You two find me Purcell.

702
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,500
I wasn't having coffee with him.

703
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,820
But I know who was.

704
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,820
Did you report him to Southern Command?

705
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,260
Yes, Agent Todd, I did.

706
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,260
Look, if I had my way, he'd by lying
in the garbage there on the street.

707
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,940
But he's being protected.

708
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,060
By who?

709
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,740
Need to know.

710
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,020
I don't.

711
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,580
Welcome to the wonderful
world of spooks.

712
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,060
Who was he having coffee with?

713
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,860
Are you ready to see the seedy
underside of Ciudad del Este?

714
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,540
Can it get any worse?

715
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,780
You believe I would look
the other way, Gunny?

716
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,220
No, Skipper, but someone
in Southern Command did.

717
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,340
Well, I'll find out who,
and I'll get back to you.

718
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,140
I'm gonna take him down, Colonel.

719
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,100
Just make sure you don't
get taken down, Jethro.

720
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,740
Special Agent McGee here's got my back.

721
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,660
Yeah, right.

722
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,420
Thank you.

723
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,220
Thank you, boss.

724
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,500
What the hell are you doing?

725
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,420
Wha... I thought that
you were giving it to me.

726
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,420
To refill it, McGee!

727
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,300
Sorry, I'll get you another one.

728
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,380
Estas arestado.

729
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,780
Da la vuelta despacio.

730
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,780
Ah, Joe!

731
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,020
Why you always doing this to me?!

732
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,220
Practicing, Iggy.

733
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,540
I've got some friends here
who want to talk to you.

734
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,020
Oh, sure, you like movies, eh?

735
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,140
Movies? No habla Ingles?

736
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,500
I have DVDs.

737
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,980
Only five American each, huh?

738
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,700
$5 for a DVD?

739
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,180
You drive a hard bargain, man.

740
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:14,980
Only four for you.

741
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,460
Four bucks? Any Hitchcock?

742
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,860
I have everything, my friend.

743
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,220
I have action, I have the comedy.

744
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
I have whatever you want.

745
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,420
Actually, we're more
interested in information, Iggy.

746
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,340
You like handbags, Miss?

747
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,380
Louis Vuitton!

748
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,700
Wow, looks so real.

749
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,300
$20. Or two for $40.

750
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:33,900
Really?

751
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:38,060
Like the lady said, we're more
interested in information, Iggy.

752
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,820
Seen the girl on the right before?

753
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,260
Ah, sí.

754
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,860
Tell me about her.

755
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,500
Hey...

756
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,900
I heard she passed.

757
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,820
By "passed,"

758
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,300
you mean she had her eyeballs
ripped out of her skull?

759
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,940
Yeah, Iggy, she passed.

760
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,580
We want to know who did it and why.

761
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,700
Life is so cheap here,
Miss, oh, who can say why?

762
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,860
Purcell can.

763
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,540
Seen him around lately?

764
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,860
Señor Purcell, he's...

765
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,620
he's a good man.

766
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,060
That's not what he asked, Iggy.

767
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,780
He wants to know if you've seen him.

768
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,180
No.

769
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,660
Why, is he in trouble or what?

770
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,700
Todd.

771
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,580
Es un satellite phone?

772
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,420
Oye...

773
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,260
Great.

774
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,340
Thanks, McGee.

775
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,020
He found us a hotel.

776
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,300
Good. We need to find Purcell.

777
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,140
You help us, we'll help you.

778
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,180
How much for the phone?

779
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,180
Phone's not for sale.

780
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,500
Come on. Okay.

781
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,140
We trade, no?

782
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,180
All of this, plus $50 U.S. Come on!

783
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,780
It's government property
issued to me, not for sale.

784
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,580
I'll tell you what, Iggy.

785
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,500
I'll give you the phone if you promise
to tell me when Purcell contacts you.

786
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,420
What?! You're not authorized
to give him my phone.

787
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,300
Agent Todd, you are
interrupting my negotiation.

788
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,740
Deal?

789
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,660
Sí. If Purcell contacts me,

790
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,260
I tell you.

791
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,980
Phone number's on the back.

792
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,980
It's a great idea, Tony.

793
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,260
GPS in Kate's phone is
reading loud and clear.

794
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,020
I'll call when Iggy moves.

795
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,100
Roger that, Probie.

796
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,140
So you want me to say
sorry or something?

797
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,660
You could have given
him your phone, you know?

798
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,820
The lead agent never gives
up his line of communication.

799
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,580
Oh, when did you become the lead agent?

800
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,460
I thought we were a team.

801
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,340
We are. I'm the team leader.

802
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,500
What, so I'm the follower?

803
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,460
I don't think so.

804
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,580
Oh, yeah, I've seen that look before.

805
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,260
Bosnia.

806
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,700
When we returned to Brcko, two
days after NATO ordered us out.

807
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,660
I can still smell it burning.

808
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,700
I have been given a direct
order to protect Purcell

809
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,060
as a valuable intelligence asset.

810
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,740
Regardless of what he's done?

811
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,780
Regardless of what he has done.

812
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,500
With all due respect, Colonel...

813
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,940
You don't have to say it, Gunny!

814
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,580
There are only two things a Marine
can do when he receives a direct order:

815
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,940
obey or resign.

816
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,580
You're resigning your commission?

817
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,780
I will never have another
Brcko on my conscience.

818
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,020
Can you find out who's protecting him?

819
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,260
Someone at the farm, but I have
no way of knowing who it is.

820
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,020
Sir, how do you contact him?

821
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,620
Encrypted teleconference like this.

822
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,940
You've seen him?

823
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,940
No. He's always in shadow.

824
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,460
Very corny, like some Cold War film.

825
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,060
That's corny, but it's effective.

826
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:35,940
Yeah.

827
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,060
Boss, if...

828
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,860
if-if the Colonel can get him on

829
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,100
a teleconference, his
encrypter can patch him to us.

830
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,140
Skipper.

831
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,300
Where the hell are we, McGee?

832
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,660
San Gusta Street, near
the heart of the city.

833
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,460
Okay, he's turning left.

834
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,980
I know he turned left.

835
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,740
I have a visual.

836
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,300
He's stopping up ahead.

837
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:05,900
Who's he with?

838
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,460
Purcell!

839
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,740
Okay, it's Purcell.

840
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,660
Shall we bring him in, boss?

841
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,460
No.

842
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,380
What?

843
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,380
No, DiNozzo. You heard me.

844
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,860
Just tail him.

845
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,940
Gibbs wants us to follow him.

846
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,860
Why?

847
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Does it matter?

848
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
They're heading into a hotel, boss.

849
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,420
Follow.

850
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,220
Don't engage unless you have to.

851
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,740
Iggy's altitude is increasing.

852
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,140
He's in an elevator.

853
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,180
Third floor, DiNozzo.

854
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,780
Going somewhere, Iggy?

855
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,540
To find you, my friend.

856
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,620
Señor Purcell, he contacted me.

857
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,500
Did he, now?

858
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:11,860
Sí.

859
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,660
What's he doing here, Iggy?

860
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,300
Well, it's a hotel.

861
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,700
He's staying here.

862
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,900
Wrong answer.

863
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,100
First I want you to know
that I loved my wife...

864
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,820
even if I couldn't trust her.

865
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,260
I paid $75,000 American.

866
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,980
That's a fortune down here.

867
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,060
Why are you not dead?

868
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,180
Escopeta confused me
with my little sister.

869
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,140
He killed her.

870
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,340
She would still be alive if you
hadn't threatened to betray me.

871
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,340
Good-bye, Anna.

872
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,780
Do it!

873
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,980
I'd rather be dead than spend one
more day with a monster like you!

874
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,100
Close you eyes, Anna.

875
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,060
Close you eyes.

876
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,140
Drop the weapon!

877
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,420
Now, look at that, Kate.

878
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,860
He's actually thinking about trying it.

879
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,140
You double-tap the head,
I'll double-tap the heart.

880
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,660
Deal.

881
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,700
All right, stand by.

882
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,660
My farm contact's
coming on the system...

883
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,020
now.

884
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,500
He's all yours, Gunny.

885
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,220
Patch me in, McGee.

886
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,140
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

887
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,780
You either give up Purcell...

888
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:54,260
or I will personally compromise the
identity of this man, Ari Haswari.

889
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,980
Our link to Al Qaeda...

890
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,340
or a child molester?

891
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,260
Your call.

892
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,300
What next?

893
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,180
Now we wait, McGee.

894
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,020
According to your... "wife,"

895
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,140
you're not just getting intel on rackets

896
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,540
in Ciudad Del Este, you're
running some of them.

897
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,140
Drugs, organ harvesting,

898
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,260
child prostitution rings?

899
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,380
It's my mission to infiltrate
these organizations.

900
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,020
I'm very good at it.

901
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,020
And having sex with underage children?

902
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,540
Once she testifies, you're gonna spend

903
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,420
the rest of your life
in Leavenworth, Purcell.

904
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,580
No, no, you misunderstand,
Agent DiNozzo.

905
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,340
Anna wasn't threatening
to tell our government.

906
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,420
She was threatening to tell hers.

907
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,860
What difference does that make?

908
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,780
You should have shot him while
you had the chance, DiNozzo.

909
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:06,620
What...

910
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,340
You know what he is, what he did.

911
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:08,980
How could you?

912
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,180
Same way you do.

913
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,740
Following orders, Agent Todd.

914
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,620
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I have a job to do.

915
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,340
Boss, there's another encrypted
transmission coming over the system.

916
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,540
Put it up on the screen.

917
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,260
Bring our people home.
