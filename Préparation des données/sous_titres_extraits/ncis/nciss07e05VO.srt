2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,473
Here we go!

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,065
Nice!

4
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:12,251
- Dude, give me another one.
- Hey, let me get this.

5
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:16,582
He's gonna be cleaning
this up for days.

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,652
Somebody's coming!
Run! Run!

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,223
Man! Let's go!
I got the bag!

8
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:25,756
Come on, come on,
get down, get down.

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,026
- Looks like we're clear.
- I love Halloween.

10
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:29,821
Me. Too.

11
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:35,792
Isn't that Korby's car?

12
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:37,189
Sounds like he's rockin' out.

13
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:38,204
It's late.

14
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,373
GI jokester must be getting
lit up in there.

15
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:43,751
You guys thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

16
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,337
Let's crash his party.

17
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:54,387
- Is he asleep?
- Dude must be baked out of his mind.

18
00:00:58,692 --> 00:00:59,676
What is this?

19
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:02,967
He's not smoking.

20
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:03,960
What?

21
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:10,528
Mr. Korby?

22
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:19,120

Now listen, no gerrymandering.

27
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:50,862
If I win this thing,
I want to see the money.

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,197
That's not a personal insult, Jerry.

29
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,700
Just keep the competition clean,
you know what I'm sayin'?

30
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,619
You'd better add 42...

31
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,986
destruction-of-property,

32
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,898
one arson and...

33
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,141
let's make it
two indecent exposures.

34
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:07,418
That's my final tally.

35
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:09,267
And I will talk to you tomorrow.

36
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,587
- Who was that?
- Old buddy of mine from Baltimore PD.

37
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,497
Doing a little larceny lotto.

38
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:18,730
- Larceny lotto?
- It's an old Halloween tradition.

39
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,265
Everyone throws 200 bucks
into the kitty.

40
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:23,743
Tries to guess the number
of disturbance calls on mischief night,

41
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:25,478
which is the night before Halloween.

42
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,649
- And then, of course, Halloween itself.
- Tony, you hate Halloween.

43
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:32,360
Anyway, it's a lot of money,
and I like money.

44
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:34,779
That is why someone kept ringing
my doorbell and running off.

45
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:38,407
When I was a kid on base at Alameda,
we called it "devil's night".

46
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:42,161
One year we put the base Commander's
bedroom furniture on a tarmac.

47
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,288
It takes less than a tenth
of a second for the engine

48
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,499
of an F-18 to move
a barcalounger 300 feet.

49
00:02:46,754 --> 00:02:49,352
Good memories.
Ring-n-runs, dine-n-ditch...

50
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,461
Lock-n-load.

51
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:51,838
Got a dead marine.

52
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,050
Agent David, you're driving.

53
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:03,496
Victim is Marine
Lance Corporal James Korby.

54
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:06,393
He just got back from his third tour
of Afghanistan three days ago.

55
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:07,354
Family?

56
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,427
Lives here with his wife
and stepdaughter.

57
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,581
Local LEOs are trying
to track them down.

58
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:13,602
No obvious signs
of struggle inside the car.

59
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:15,694
No blood.
Looks like a suicide.

60
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,155
Looks can be deceiving.

61
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:23,493
There's no way that man
killed himself in that car, Jethro.

62
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:25,829
Jacking that one up
from beyond the yard, Duck.

63
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,331
I can barely see that far.

64
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,406
Carboxyhemoglobin
does not require closer inspection.

65
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,759
If carbon monoxide had been
the cause of that man's death,

66
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:36,048
his skin would be cherry red,

67
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:38,407
which it isn't, ergo...

68
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,886
Body was staged.

69
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:41,762
To look like a suicide.

70
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:43,055
Yeah.

71
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,173
Korby lived for mischief night.

72
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,895
He was the king of practical jokes.

73
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,425
I guess that makes you the...

74
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:52,189
princes of pranks.

75
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:53,551
Are we in trouble?

76
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,066
Not unless you killed him.

77
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,112
I'll handle the questions here,
probie. Thank you.

78
00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:00,072
We were talking about Korby.

79
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:01,813
Guy was awesome.

80
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:04,702
Came up with new practical jokes
every Halloween.

81
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,463
Nothing dangerous.
I mean, no razor blades.

82
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:10,670
He'd freeze all kinds of stuff,
blow things up.

83
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,002
- It was funny.
- And illegal.

84
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:14,295
And you are?

85
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:16,856
Ted Rodgers.
Live across the street.

86
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:20,258
First he drove us crazy with his pranks.
Now he dies in the driveway.

87
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,832
It sounds like you got a problem
in your neighborhood, Mr. Rodgers.

88
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:24,432
That's a nice sweater, by the way.

89
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:26,349
Boys, we are going
to need that videotape.

90
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,789
Yes, you can use it to document
what these punks did last night.

91
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,730
We're only interested in what happened
to Lance Corporal Korby. Thank you.

92
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,675
You got a time of death, Duck?

93
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,235
This can't be true.

94
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:42,323
I mean, the heat from the exhaust fumes
should raise his body temperature,

95
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,149
but he's curiously cold.

96
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:45,826
Frigid, in fact.

97
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:49,948
It's a mystery to be solved
by examination later.

98
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,917
It must be Korby's joke lab.

99
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,248
And possibly our crime scene.

100
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,284
Signs of a struggle.

101
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,486
How can you tell?
This place is a mess.

102
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,875
Pranksters don't break
their own stuff.

103
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:16,171
- Well, he's certainly in rigor.
- Guess we should lay him down.

104
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:18,050
Unless he's going to drive.

105
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:19,777
Zombie.

106
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,195
Halloween.

107
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,863
- Come on!
- I'm sorry.

108
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:29,996
What was that?

109
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:32,039
Sounded like it came
from inside the body.

110
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:33,541
Push him down flat.

111
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,547
No idea.

112
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,843
Even if he was in full rigor,

113
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,112
he wouldn't be brittle.

114
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,586
Forceps, Mr. Palmer.

115
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,535
It's odd indeed.

116
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,754
Thank you.

117
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,738
Let's see now.

118
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,371
- Is that glass?
- No, it's part of his throat.

119
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,498
Look, it's frozen solid.

120
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:16,876
What could get something that cold?
Dry ice?

121
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:18,461
Or liquid nitrogen.

122
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:21,240
Either way,
I think you found your cause of death.

123
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:31,098
67 on the tally of disturbances.

124
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,518
How about we focus
on a crime in our jurisdiction?

125
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,932
Thrill me, McGoblin.

126
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:42,280
Lance Corporal James Korby.

127
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:45,029
A joker with no criminal record
and one big blemish

128
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,397
on his service record.

129
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,905
Bumped back in rank
for dereliction of duty.

130
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:51,452
Explains
why he's a 37-year-old Lance Corporal.

131
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,747
This is his wife Sara Korby.

132
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,794
He didn't kill himself.

133
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,797
- How do you know?
- Because nobody married to her...

134
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:05,769
kills themselves.
She's way too attractive for him.

135
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,886
- The wife did it.
- Should we even bother investigating

136
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,181
- or just go ahead and arrest her?
- I like where you're going with that.

137
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:15,976
Do you have any idea
where the wife was last night, Tony?

138
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:19,638
No. Do you?

139
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,573
Yes.
I just got off the phone

140
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,955
with the Seabright hotel and spa
in Virginia Beach

141
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:25,811
where Korby's wife was checked in.

142
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:26,871
And?

143
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:30,671
And she and Korby's stepdaughter are
on their way in to I.D. the body.

144
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,558
- And?
- And what?

145
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,537
She spent the night alone in a hotel

146
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:37,209
three days after her husband
gets back from the Middle East?

147
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:39,419
Probies.

148
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:40,960
The wife did it.

149
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:42,545
You always say that.

150
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,464
- Well, it's almost always true.
- Excuse me.

151
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,621
I'm Sara Korby.

152
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,202
Yes, you are.

153
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:56,350
Now, Mrs. Korby, your...

154
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:58,894
husband was alone last night,
is that right?

155
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:01,316
Yes.

156
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,247
Halloween was
his favorite time of year.

157
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:06,235
Practical jokes were his passion.

158
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:13,315
I was in Virginia Beach.

159
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:17,483
I spent the night at a friend's.

160
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:20,832
- Until the police broke it up.
- Party was over anyway.

161
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:23,311
Right.

162
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,793
I noticed you have quite
the setup in your garage.

163
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:29,034
James would spend days
in there this time of year.

164
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:31,530
A couple years back, we made a deal:

165
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,137
he would spend Halloween working

166
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,380
on his projects and...

167
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:37,558
I would spend the night at a spa.

168
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:39,684
I didn't want to go this year,

169
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,539
'cause he'd just gotten back, but...

170
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,528
James didn't mention
any problems, did he?

171
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,937
Fights, disagreements,
that kind of thing?

172
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:54,148
Everything seemed fine.

173
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,224
He had a car pick me up,

174
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,193
drive me to Virginia Beach.

175
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,081
Rachel,

176
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,251
he was your stepfather?

177
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,544
James and Sara are both
my stepparents.

178
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,026
My mom died when I was little.

179
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,650
I married Rachel's father
five years ago.

180
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,136
He was killed in Iraq.

181
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:17,860
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,433
Everyone liked James

183
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,728
even if they didn't get
his sense of humor.

184
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,866
Speaking of no sense of humor,

185
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,817
what about your neighbor
Ted Rodgers?

186
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:32,063
A few days ago,
when he realized that

187
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:35,292
James was back from Afghanistan,
they had some words about...

188
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:37,576
my husband's idea of fun.

189
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,464
- Ted complained about everything.
- Yeah,

190
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:43,207
I picked up on that.

191
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:46,089
Interesting date
for such a ghoulish demise.

192
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:48,420
It's a cool way to go.

193
00:09:50,563 --> 00:09:52,341
Cool as in "cold".
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:55,872
You're not taking pleasure out
of the method of our victim's death,

195
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:57,221
are you, Mr. Palmer?

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,427
No, of course not.
It's just like what you said. Very...

197
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:04,332
Halloween-y. Just reminds me
of a few pranks I'm not too proud of.

198
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,231
Then perhaps you should refrain
from discussing them.

199
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:09,201
Then what can we discuss, Duck?

200
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:12,027
Confirmation
of my earlier hypothesis,

201
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:13,106
to wit...

202
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:15,637
courtesy of Abby...

203
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:19,743
Manner of death was indeed
the ingestion of liquid nitrogen:

204
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,622
a colorless, odorless substance
which is so cold that when it comes

205
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,917
into contact with warm
organic material, it literally...

206
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:27,963
boils.

207
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:29,837
Yeah. You see here for instance.

208
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,339
This is our stomach stand-in.

209
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,381
Mr. Palmer?

210
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:35,919
With pleasure, Doctor.

211
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:53,067
What's also important to note
is that Korby's throat

212
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,322
had previous scar tissue
from before he was killed.

213
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,881
- Meaning?
- No idea.

214
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,742
Abby's working on that now.

215
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,121
What we do know is that Korby
ingested enough nitrogen to freeze

216
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,999
his internal organs, but technically

217
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,625
that was not the cause of death.

218
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:10,544
- What was?
- Breathing.

219
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:14,352
The nitrogen gas entered his lungs,

220
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,966
essentially suffocating him.

221
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,424
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

222
00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:19,136
So, he didn't die right away.

223
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:21,055
He lived on for several minutes.

224
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:23,849
Based on the rate of thaw
and the condition of the body,

225
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:28,187
I'd estimate that the time of death was
somewhere between 10:00 and midnight.

226
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,241
Sorry. That's cold.

227
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:34,485
I got it. I got it.
I'll just clean this up.

228
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:37,154
How much did he ingest?

229
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:39,481
A single gulp would suffice.

230
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:41,825
Likely he was force-fed.

231
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:45,120
- Or he was caught off guard.
- Either way, it was no accident.

232
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:48,749
Certainly not a suicide.

233
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,385
Look at this.

234
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,656
Two-ply, double roll top tuck
with a 30-foot vertical climb.

235
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,674
That kid has got an arm.
Perfect drape age.

236
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,687
It's good trunk to top ratio as well.
It's very impressive.

237
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,860
I do not see the humor or the art.

238
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:06,610
It's a...

239
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,894
cultural thing.
Tony will tell you.

240
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:11,616
Who are you calling?

241
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:12,572
Right.

242
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:13,854
Thanks.

243
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,317
Having the wife's file sent over.

244
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,530
Does your gut ever give
you a stomachache, Tony?

245
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:22,150
Keep snickering while I'm over here
breaking the case.

246
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,882
Everyone is breaking the case.

247
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:27,054
You brought us coffee?

248
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:33,168
- It's apple cider.
- Yep.

249
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:34,686
Happy Halloween.

250
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:37,297
Break's over.

251
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:40,209
Run it.

252
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:41,526
Yes.

253
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,304
We are still scrubbing
the video from the kids.

254
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,916
Multiple neighbors have filed
complaints against Korby.

255
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:49,263
But only one neighbor has filed
multiple complaints.

256
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:51,288
Ted Rodgers lives across the street.

257
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:54,580
I still think the wife is...
This has got some back bite.

258
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:55,964
A little peppery,

259
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,651
a hint of clove, and really...

260
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,335
Rodgers... You two... go.

261
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:09,288
<i>There's no candy here!</i>

262
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:11,656
We don't want candy!

263
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:13,857
Speak for yourself, David.

264
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:15,411
Open up,

265
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:17,415
or we'll send the kids in.

266
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,036
Very convincing nerd outfit.

267
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:26,555
This is how I dress for work.

268
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:28,599
You're going to work now?

269
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:30,073
I work at home.

270
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,512
I'm a commodities trader,
Asian markets.

271
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,562
This is the start
of my business day.

272
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,190
Your porch light's on.

273
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:39,114
Means you have candy.
That's standard Halloween etiquette.

274
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:43,270
That's better.

275
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:46,158
Now let's talk.

276
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,327
About what?

277
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:50,954
About the three police reports
you filed against James Korby.

278
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,461
Over the years, his antics have cost me
a lot of time and money.

279
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,836
Shaving cream in my mailbox,

280
00:13:58,051 --> 00:13:59,722
food coloring in my pool.

281
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,401
I don't care if he was
a hero in Afghanistan.

282
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,426
On this block,
he was a pain in the ass.

283
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:07,804
Girlfriend in college got
a restraining order against you.

284
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:10,516
So I'm guessing there's a temper
under that cardigan.

285
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:14,728
We have a witness who says
you confronted Korby yesterday.

286
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:16,584
Given the history between you two...

287
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:18,740
Are you accusing me of murder?

288
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,557
No, we're just asking you
really nicely if you did it.

289
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:24,112
So, Mr. Rodgers,
did you kill your neighbor?

290
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:30,369
Where were you last night
between 10:00 PM and midnight?

291
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:32,762
Online, live,

292
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:35,999
in front of the camera on my computer
with our office in Shanghai.

293
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:37,584
Every minute.

294
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:40,420
I don't trust a guy
who doesn't give candy to kids.

295
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,840
Trick or treat.

296
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:46,969
Great.

297
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:02,021
Energy drinks.
Just what this holiday needed.

298
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:04,987
Their parents are going
to love that.

299
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,331
Hey, Abby...

300
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:20,168
Welcome to the random factory,
Gibbs.

301
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,836
Most of Korby's prank stuff...

302
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:25,757
It's motion sensor activated, so
until I get a chance to process it all,

303
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,551
you need to move very...

304
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,883
slowly.

305
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,185
No costumes this year, Abs?

306
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:41,736
After last year's
Jonas brothers debacle,

307
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,338
Vance banned the costumes.

308
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,027
McGee... skinny jeans...

309
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,403
- It didn't work.
- What do you got?

310
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,114
A car,

311
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,588
at the scene of the crime.

312
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:53,869
It's only a glimpse,
but the time stamp indicates that

313
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,495
it's taken around the time of death.

314
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:58,290
- 11:13 PM.
- You get a plate?

315
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,751
No visual on the driver.

316
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:02,794
But when I enhance the image,

317
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,921
I did manage to get this.

318
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,320
It's a livery number.

319
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:11,770
From the Quantico
Marine base motor pool.

320
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,140
- Vehicles can only be signed out...
- By a Marine.

321
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,234
- Nice work, Abs.
- Wait, wait.

322
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,145
There's more.

323
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:28,384
Sample
from our dead Marine's stomach.

324
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:31,015
I expected to find liquid nitrogen,
of course,

325
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,076
but I did not expect to find
traces of turpentine,

326
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,244
acetone and benzene in his flesh.

327
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:38,471
- Paint thinner?
- Yeah.

328
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:41,541
Liquid nitrogen
killed him last night,

329
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,169
but it wasn't the cause
of his ulcerated stomach ling.

330
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,213
Someone tried to poison him
before last night.

331
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:47,771
When?

332
00:16:48,183 --> 00:16:49,703
According to the chemical levels,

333
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:52,188
he ingested the paint thinner
two months ago.

334
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:54,096
While he was still overseas.

335
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,279
Whoever tried to kill
Lance Corporal Korby in Afghanistan...

336
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,101
Finished it here.

337
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:12,842
What's the matter, McGee?
No one come to your door?

338
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:14,431
I think I deserve a treat.

339
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,868
Why is that?

340
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:19,215
Because the wife did it, probie.

341
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:22,490
The stepdaughter, Rachel...
is from a previous marriage.

342
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:25,001
But Sara Korby has been married

343
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,545
three times.

344
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:28,839
All Marines, all dead.

345
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:30,947
All with juicy life
insurance payouts.

346
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:33,440
Once is a tragedy,
twice a coincidence,

347
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:35,375
three times is a pattern.

348
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:37,764
We're talking
about a black ops widow.

349
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,009
Tony, the first two husbands
died in the line of duty.

350
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:42,864
Giving you no reason to suspect

351
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:44,980
she had anything to do
with the third one's death.

352
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:47,023
- Well, I got...
- Evidence?

353
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:50,277
- Not to speak of, Boss.
- Then stop speaking.

354
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,864
According to base records,
the car we're looking for

355
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,741
is still missing from the livery.

356
00:17:56,197 --> 00:17:59,035
No sign of anyone checking it out.
Boss, I am going to find that car.

357
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,922
Korby's tour in Afghanistan...
His file, where is it?

358
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:07,151
Central Command hasn't declassified
the after-action report yet.

359
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:09,128
Unit's only been back 72 hours.

360
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:11,840
- Just waiting for the report.
- Wait faster.

361
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,770
Thanks.

362
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,536
Korby's squad leader
just arrived at the gate.

363
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,655
All right, come on.
You're with me.

364
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:21,095
It says here you're up for a promotion,
Sergeant Barnes.

365
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:22,344
Yes, Sir.

366
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:24,897
So was Lance Corporal Korby.

367
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,272
You did not give him
a very good recommendation.

368
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:31,100
"Korby has, at times,
proven to be difficult to discipline."

369
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,278
"A detriment to unit
cohesion and morale."

370
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:36,972
I also say Korby was a dedicated,
courageous, hard-working Marine.

371
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,159
Even in battle,
he was a practical joker, no?

372
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:40,202
Yes, Ma'am.

373
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:42,587
Right. What's funny in boot camp...

374
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,164
isn't always funny
in a live fire zone.

375
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,131
Two schools of thought in battle.

376
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:49,718
Some Marines like to keep their focus...
Head on a swivel.

377
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:52,422
Yeah, some like to keep it loose
to keep from cracking.

378
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:54,125
Half the guys loved Korby.

379
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,478
The other half,

380
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:56,885
not so much.

381
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,428
What about you?

382
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,681
As their squad leader it was my job
to keep the peace between the two.

383
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:05,711
Well, someone got mad enough at Korby
to slip him a dose of paint thinner.

384
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,428
Almost killed him.

385
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:10,398
Korby was ill a few days.
Thought it was a stomach virus.

386
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:12,538
Never said anything
about being poisoned.

387
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:14,110
Where were you two nights ago?

388
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,072
Finishing up debriefing paperwork.
Never left the base.

389
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:19,434
Who in the unit had
the biggest problem with Korby?

390
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:24,204
No one in particular, Sir.

391
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,833
Then we investigate them all.

392
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:32,991
Put a hold on all promotions.

393
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:37,192
It's gonna get ugly.

394
00:19:42,173 --> 00:19:43,473
Private David Singer.

395
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:47,797
He and Korby had a falling out.

396
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:49,915
Didn't come from me.

397
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,405
One, two, three.

398
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,360
- One.
- One, two, three.

399
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:57,710
- Two.
- One, two, three.

400
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,698
- Three.
- One, two, three.

401
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:02,018
- Four.
- Let's do it! Go, go, go!

402
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:05,078
- Private David Singer?
- Yeah.

403
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:10,916
Why don't you take a break.
Maybe take a shower.

404
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,504
We hear that you
and Lance Corporal Korby had a...

405
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,094
falling out in Kandahar?

406
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,255
Korby showed me the ropes.

407
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,046
We had some laughs at first,

408
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:22,759
but things aren't so funny
in Afghanistan and I told him as much.

409
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:23,977
That's all.

410
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,183
Well, not quite all.
Korby's dead.

411
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:30,812
Where were you two nights ago?

412
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:33,368
In Norfolk, visiting a friend.

413
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,265
Does this friend live
on a street corner

414
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:37,694
and deal pharmaceuticals out
of paper bag?

415
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:40,322
I'm not on the juice,
if that's what you're implying.

416
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:43,825
It's all natural.
Don't let it scare you.

417
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:47,118
Alibi have a name?

418
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,335
Things on the side of your head work?
The man asked you a question.

419
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,712
Although short-term memory loss
and shrunken testicles

420
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,714
- are a sign...
- Have you ever been shot at?

421
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,444
- Once or twice.
- People were getting blown up there

422
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:02,427
and Korby's saran-wrapping guys
into their cots.

423
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:03,725
What's your point?

424
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:06,513
Some of us didn't appreciate it...

425
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:08,291
His stupid pranks.

426
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:10,518
But none of us killed him.

427
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,379
No one would have taken it
that far...

428
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:15,231
Yeah? How far did it go?

429
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:20,968
Chris Norton...

430
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:22,737
High school buddy.

431
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,199
That's who I was
with the other night.

432
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,126
Still working on getting
those paper files,

433
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:36,562
but I did have a chat with Central
Command in Afghanistan up in MTAC.

434
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,442
Don't brag, McGee, it's unbecoming.

435
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,232
Talk.

436
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:43,875
I was able to put together a brief
history of Korby's unit. It's not good.

437
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,235
It had multiple transfer requests,
complaints.

438
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:48,769
They were deemed "not combat ready"
two different times.

439
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:49,974
Unit was in chaos.

440
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:52,797
Korby's distractions were more serious
than his squad leader

441
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:54,938
- lead us to believe.
- This started 2 months ago.

442
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,611
After Korby was poisoned.

443
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:59,067
Before that,
only exemplary remarks about the unit.

444
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,665
Citations. Promotions.
They were on their third tour.

445
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:02,904
A well-oiled machine.

446
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,333
What would make
a Marine unit fall apart?

447
00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:06,908
Lack of discipline.

448
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:08,686
Yep. Or too much.

449
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,575
18,000 breaths a day.

450
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,418
It's hardly surprising
what ends up in one's lungs.

451
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,872
Bacteria, insects...

452
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,715
Guess we'll have to wait and see
what our dead Marine inhaled.

453
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,053
Take those up to Abby,
would you please?

454
00:22:25,113 --> 00:22:25,969
Yes, Doctor.

455
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:27,512
I'm glad you're here.

456
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:28,785
Body was beaten, doc.

457
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:32,392
I found evidence
of multiple contusions and abrasions.

458
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:37,111
Usually, I do my autopsies
from the outside in,

459
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:40,613
but, due to the frosty
circumstances here,

460
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:42,736
I was forced to reverse the process.

461
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:43,702
When?

462
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:47,309
Well, based on the healing
of this rib fracture here,

463
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,161
I'd say that those injuries
were probably sustained

464
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:54,499
before he was poisoned
the first time.

465
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,533
Afghanistan.

466
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:58,334
Attackers avoided vital organs.

467
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:01,365
Correct. There were no blows
on the kidneys or spleen.

468
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,072
Tried to teach him a lesson.

469
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:05,133
Tried to hurt him
without really hurting him?

470
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,109
You've seen this before, I presume?

471
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:08,380
Yeah. Code red.

472
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:11,931
Somebody gave Korby a beat down
before moving on to poison.

473
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,456
Someone?

474
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:16,269
There are traces of bruising
on his wrists and ankles.

475
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:19,981
Additionally,
subdural contusions suggest

476
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,780
that at least four assailants

477
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,162
delivered a myriad of blows.

478
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:29,199
These patterns tell me
that this was more than just someone.

479
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:32,013
Whole squad wanted
this guy gone, Duck.

480
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:42,231
Where are we going?

481
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,650
Mobile campfire.
DiNozzo <i>leçon du jour</i>:

482
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:46,208
think on your feet.
Go.

483
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:48,591
- Still looking for the mystery car.
- Stop.

484
00:23:50,114 --> 00:23:53,098
Probies, talk louder.
I can't hear you in there.

485
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,521
Tony, McGee has been here
for six years.

486
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,454
I have been here for four.

487
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:03,582
I know you are enjoying this,
but we are agents.

488
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,493
So, could you please
stop calling us...

489
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:06,986
Problem, probie?

490
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:09,197
You've been an agent
for all of one week.

491
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:11,376
Your Mossad liaison days are over.

492
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:13,933
Mobile campfire.

493
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:18,108
Dead Marine prankster whose, mischief
sparked a beat down in Afghanistan,

494
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:19,622
courtesy of his entire squad.

495
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:22,293
Our only evidence
is a vehicle from the Quantico

496
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,211
motor pool
at the scene of the crime.

497
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,576
We haven't found it,
or any record of who signed it out.

498
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:31,319
We were able to track down the addresses
of each Marine who was on Korby's unit

499
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:33,263
in the area the night of the murder.
Six hits.

500
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:36,627
Take Ziva with you.

501
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:39,310
This guy was a genius.

502
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:43,773
He chronicled all of his exploits on
his phone, it's like a master's course.

503
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,525
600 pizzas delivered
to the Battalion CP.

504
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:49,248
He reassembled a Humvee
inside the Officer's club.

505
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:52,639
If only I had the appropriate time
and space to use

506
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,910
- the bounty of ideas in front of me.
- The case, Abs. The case.

507
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,539
I finished processing
everything from Korby's garage.

508
00:24:59,684 --> 00:25:02,500
Still no murder weapon.
Which means the killer either kept it...

509
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:03,710
Or they dumped it.

510
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:07,255
And probably nearby.
And certainly with traces of nitrogen.

511
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:11,092
I alerted local waste management to be
on the lookout for hazardous materials.

512
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,560
And the Fire Department's Hazmat team
is searching the entire neighborhood.

513
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,805
A lot of manpower.

514
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,391
A four block radius
and more than 60 homes.

515
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,752
Can I have my Caf-pow! now?

516
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:24,159
No more refills.

517
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:26,850
I just came to return
the surplus nitrogen.

518
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,532
It's the results from the substance
that you and Ducky

519
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,159
found in the dead Marine's lungs.

520
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:38,203
That's odd.

521
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:41,360
Traces of chicken stock,
coffee beans, cocoa...

522
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:42,874
Lunch.

523
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:46,517
Yeah, but I didn't find traces
of any of this food in his stomach.

524
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:49,242
The nitrogen gas must have carried
the particles into the lungs.

525
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,705
There could have been food residue
on the inside of the container

526
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:55,970
the killer used to administer
the liquid nitrogen.

527
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,347
Like, a lunchbox?

528
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,600
Thinking, like, a thermos.
You know, perfect size. Insulated.

529
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:02,268
It's discreet.

530
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,229
Palmer, you're a genius.

531
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,726
The killer probably used
Korby's coffee thermos to poison him.

532
00:26:07,786 --> 00:26:09,816
Now I can tell the Hazmat team
what to look for.

533
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:10,984
That's great work.

534
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:12,363
Both of you.

535
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:22,588
Ladies.

536
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,409
Cleaning up the crime scene?

537
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:28,276
Sweeping away old memories.

538
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,142
You sure you want
to throw these away?

539
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,681
What can I do for you,
Agent DiNozzo?

540
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,426
I was just wondering...

541
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:47,920
if your husband ever talked
about what happened overseas?

542
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:52,011
You know,
other Marines in his squad?

543
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,410
No? Never talked to you
about getting beat up or poisoned?

544
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:04,664
That's interesting.
I guess you two didn't talk much, then.

545
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,920
What are you implying?

546
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:09,919
You've lost 3 husbands.
All 3 had life insurance policies.

547
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:11,753
- Meaning...?
- You seem to be

548
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,215
attracted to men who have
a hard time staying alive.

549
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:16,830
I'm attracted to men
with dignity and honor

550
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,970
who put themselves
in harm's way for their country.

551
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:21,382
I grew up in a military family.

552
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:24,424
I fell in love with men who served.
Two of them died doing it.

553
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:27,649
I've given a lot.
I've taken very little.

554
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:31,149
Well, half a million dollar payout
on the two previous policies,

555
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,638
plus another $250,000 from Korby's.

556
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:37,477
You can understand
my skepticism, it's adding up.

557
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,195
My husband didn't complain.

558
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:41,882
He didn't dwell on negative things.
He chose to celebrate life.

559
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:44,015
He tried to make others smile.

560
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:46,663
I loved him for that.

561
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:49,010
Excuse me.

562
00:27:53,353 --> 00:27:54,361
Private Singer.

563
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,385
Do I need to make introductions,

564
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,220
- or you two...
- Just paying my respects.

565
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:03,999
- That a problem?
- No.

566
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:08,936
Me and your husband,
we had our issues.

567
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,285
But we served together.

568
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:12,582
He saved my ass a time or two.

569
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:14,025
I'm sorry.

570
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:16,319
Thank you, Private.

571
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,995
Are we finished?

572
00:28:24,524 --> 00:28:25,497
Excuse me.

573
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:36,339
Sky falling?

574
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,638
Wife might be telling the truth.

575
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:39,801
So, yeah.

576
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:41,761
Your killer instinct was wrong?

577
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,386
Temporarily misguided.

578
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:45,223
What did my probie
sandwich find out?

579
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:47,862
Well, we interviewed every member
of Korby's squad,

580
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:49,234
including two in Bethesda.

581
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,895
They all admit Korby's pranks
caused problems...

582
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,273
But denied having knowledge
of the code red

583
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,941
or the poisoning in Afghanistan.

584
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,303
- They were covering for each other.
- Taking a break, DiNozzo?

585
00:28:59,475 --> 00:29:01,447
No, boss.
Just looking at the sprinkler system.

586
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:04,072
The sign-out log
from the Company Command post on base.

587
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,160
- That's a nice job, boss.
- Page 28.

588
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:11,202
Korby's squad leader,
Sergeant Barnes, lied to us.

589
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:13,500
He did sign off the base
the night of the murder.

590
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,138
That's not all Barnes lied about.

591
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:17,463
I just the after-action reports
from Kandahar.

592
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,328
The promotion Barnes was looking
forward to was already denied.

593
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:21,968
"Unsatisfactory leadership."

594
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:23,263
When?

595
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,555
Three months ago.
While serving in Afghanistan.

596
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,433
- Just before Korby was poisoned.
- And the unit went bonkers.

597
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:29,392
Find him.

598
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,263
Germans.
Fun-loving bunch.

599
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,987
- Care to oom-pah?
- There's Barnes.

600
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:43,263
- Yes, there he is.
- <i>Herr </i>Barnes.

601
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:44,991
We need to speak to you.

602
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:46,865
Excuse me one second.

603
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:50,887
Can we do this some other time?

604
00:29:51,986 --> 00:29:53,124
Let me check. Ziva?

605
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:55,960
No. See, we can't do it another time.
<i>Achtung</i>, baby.

606
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,212
This is important.
I need to talk to these guys.

607
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:04,886
NCIS.
Settle down, gentlemen.

608
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,285
Well done, probie.

609
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:12,727
<i>Fraulein.</i>

610
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,794
<i>Danke Schoen.</i>
Beer's on him.

611
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:18,706
Sorry about that.

612
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:21,317
You certainly made an impression.

613
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,931
Korby cost you a promotion.

614
00:30:33,428 --> 00:30:34,915
So you poisoned him.

615
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,696
When that didn't work,
you finished the job here.

616
00:30:38,774 --> 00:30:39,759
Company log.

617
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:42,034
Night of the murder.
You signed out.

618
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,381
Man up, Marine.

619
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:52,724
I did it for him.

620
00:30:52,822 --> 00:30:54,392
- Who?
- Korby.

621
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:56,811
- He was a great Marine, but...
- What happened?

622
00:30:57,437 --> 00:30:59,920
We had incoming fire
in a warehouse outside Herat,

623
00:31:00,003 --> 00:31:02,317
when I turn to see
Korby's flak jacket on fire.

624
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:04,861
Gave away our position.
Barely got out of there.

625
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:06,268
One of his jokes?

626
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:08,641
Faulty flare casing.
An accident.

627
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:11,630
Nobody saw it that way.

628
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:14,385
Thought one of his gags
almost got us all killed.

629
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,498
They sent him a message.

630
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,192
I knew about the code red.

631
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:24,381
Thought it would help
put Korby straight. For his own good.

632
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:25,965
But...

633
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:27,968
he was still Korby.

634
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:29,754
So you poisoned him?

635
00:31:32,284 --> 00:31:35,183
I put a drop of paint thinner
in his coffee.

636
00:31:35,345 --> 00:31:36,142
A drop.

637
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,020
I wanted to get him
shipped home on medical leave.

638
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:40,867
I did it for him.
For the unit.

639
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:43,756
Before someone really got hurt.
I did it to save him.

640
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,236
Somehow the guys found out
what I'd done and...

641
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:47,988
They lost respect for their leader.

642
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:49,827
The unit fell apart.

643
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:53,577
Night of the murder.

644
00:31:55,528 --> 00:31:57,362
A barmaid at a club in Fairfax.

645
00:31:57,422 --> 00:32:00,126
She'll confirm I was there all night.
Getting face time with my seniors.

646
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:02,503
Trying to get
my promotion back on track.

647
00:32:04,326 --> 00:32:05,793
That's not gonna happen.

648
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:16,021
Listen, is there any more
of that apple cider?

649
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:18,404
'cause I found it
de-cider-ly delicious.

650
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,504
Barnes' alibi checks out.

651
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:25,859
He was at the strip club till 2:00 am,
they have him on security cameras.

652
00:32:26,086 --> 00:32:28,903
I still maintain
that the wife's holding something back.

653
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,261
Marine vehicle was at the scene,
DiNozzo.

654
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:34,791
- That does suggest a Marine.
- None of the motor pool logs

655
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:37,322
have a record of which Marine
checked out the car.

656
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:38,747
Just that it left the base.

657
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:43,582
Boss, well, it's not about the car
but I have been running financials

658
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,338
on every member of Korby's unit looking
for inconsistencies.

659
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,605
- Yeah, and you got one?
- Yep. Private David Singer.

660
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:52,211
He told us he was in Norfolk
with a friend the night of the murder.

661
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,221
Yeah, well, he's got a credit card
charge in Virginia Beach that night.

662
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,461
Charge was for a room-service
delivery of champagne and caviar.

663
00:32:58,544 --> 00:32:59,544
Where?

664
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:02,639
The Seabright hotel and spa.

665
00:33:02,973 --> 00:33:05,473
That's the hotel
where Korby's wife was staying.

666
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,540
Private Singer.

667
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,613
Sorry to keep you out of the gym.

668
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,230
You'll have plenty of time
to work out when you're in prison.

669
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:19,709
- The hell you talking about?
- Keeping somebody like Mrs. Korby happy

670
00:33:19,986 --> 00:33:21,370
takes a lot of reps?

671
00:33:21,629 --> 00:33:23,269
You both licking champagne off

672
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:25,251
each other's toes down there
in Virginia Beach.

673
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:28,278
Then you took a little detour,
decided to kill Korby.

674
00:33:29,872 --> 00:33:33,795
The hotel valet has the car you borrowed
from Quantico checked out all night.

675
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,403
You did bring it back
in the morning, though.

676
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:40,463
Innocent man usually
explains himself.

677
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:41,967
And the guilty ones object.

678
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,226
You might even fall
into the third category.

679
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,225
The guy who covers for his lover.

680
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,248
If Tony's right about the wife,
I will never live it down.

681
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,997
It's getting pretty ripe
in that room.

682
00:34:08,383 --> 00:34:10,269
But he's about to flip on the wife.

683
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:11,537
He doesn't have to.

684
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:13,650
Pulled Korby's credit card records.

685
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:16,326
According to Abby, the garden hose
and duct tape were brand new,

686
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,755
but there's no record of Korby
actually purchasing them.

687
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:20,724
- Cash?
- The wife's credit card

688
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:23,847
was used one week ago at a hardware
store to purchase two items.

689
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,603
Garden hose and a roll of duct tape.

690
00:34:27,723 --> 00:34:28,974
Well, bring her in.

691
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:30,639
I cannot believe it.

692
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:44,581
Know about your affair
with Private Singer.

693
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:47,543
He told you?

694
00:34:47,828 --> 00:34:49,044
No, he didn't have to.

695
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:50,744
Fancy hotel.

696
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:52,380
Sounds of the ocean.

697
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,962
Caviar and champagne.

698
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:57,711
Singer thought he was in for a treat,
but you tricked him.

699
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:58,998
You used him.

700
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:04,142
You gave Singer the hose and tape,
told him to make it look like a suicide.

701
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,770
He drove from the hotel to your house,
he killed your husband.

702
00:35:10,669 --> 00:35:12,810
David wasn't
at the house that night.

703
00:35:14,023 --> 00:35:14,861
I was.

704
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:18,198
You drove Singer's car to your house
and killed your husband?

705
00:35:18,498 --> 00:35:19,325
No.

706
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:25,745
I couldn't go through with it,
the affair. I couldn't cheat on James.

707
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,493
I didn't have my own car,

708
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:30,835
I'd been dropped off by the service
at the hotel so I borrowed David's.

709
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:35,765
I drove back home to tell
my husband the truth, but I just...

710
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:39,799
Sat in front of the house
and I lost my nerve.

711
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:41,763
So, I left.

712
00:35:42,847 --> 00:35:45,760
I went back to the hotel
and I broke it off with David.

713
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,379
Yeah, well,
I don't think he got the message.

714
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:52,273
So, you admit to being at the scene
of the crime at the time of death?

715
00:35:52,422 --> 00:35:54,425
I did not kill my husband.

716
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:57,328
It's the truth.
I swear to you.

717
00:35:57,416 --> 00:36:00,406
Well, now you get to convince
a jury of your peers.

718
00:36:00,646 --> 00:36:02,576
That would be a jury of tall, leggy,

719
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,449
blonde bombshells.
Why don't you stand up?

720
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,623
You're under arrest for the murder
of Lance Corporal James Korby.

721
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:11,043
You're not.

722
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:14,499
Evidence garage, now.

723
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:18,206
- Hey, McGee.
- Yeah, boss.

724
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:19,878
Footage of the Marine car.

725
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:21,366
Let me pull it up.

726
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:27,809
Rewind it.

727
00:36:34,507 --> 00:36:35,747
There, freeze it.

728
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:38,194
Can you clean that up?

729
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,113
Let's see.

730
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:44,306
It's a car parked on the street.

731
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,521
Boss, that's Korby's car.

732
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:48,882
Nice.

733
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,836
You don't have to say anything.

734
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:54,581
About me being right.
About the wife.

735
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,421
Okay.

736
00:36:58,095 --> 00:36:59,591
DiNozzo, driver's side.

737
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:00,678
Come on.

738
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:03,387
Get in.

739
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:05,504
Okeydokey.

740
00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:10,596
- The seat is too far forward.
- Exactly.

741
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:13,183
The seat has been in that position
since the murder.

742
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:15,679
Car was parked in the street
when the footage of the Marine car

743
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:17,274
was captured by those kids.

744
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:19,788
But when Korby
was found dead in the car...

745
00:37:19,848 --> 00:37:21,487
The car was parked in his driveway.

746
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:25,720
Pull all financial records from
the death of Sara's second husband.

747
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:30,311
Sara?
I got your text.

748
00:37:31,746 --> 00:37:33,599
I was just gonna go for a run.

749
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,736
She couldn't make it.

750
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,563
- Well, then why did she text me?
- She didn't.

751
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:48,530
What's that?

752
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:50,873
The thermos we found
in your friend's trash can.

753
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:53,478
The friend you were with
the night of the murder.

754
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,480
Traces of liquid nitrogen in there.

755
00:37:56,865 --> 00:37:58,650
I don't understand.

756
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:01,410
While everybody was so drunk
at the party, they didn't see you

757
00:38:01,493 --> 00:38:03,576
slip out for a little while,
did they?

758
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:05,114
Found your prints.

759
00:38:05,804 --> 00:38:07,348
We also know that,

760
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:10,620
you bought the hose and the tape
using Sara's credit card last week.

761
00:38:10,718 --> 00:38:11,913
Clerk ID'd your photo.

762
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:14,560
You tried to frame Sara
for your stepfather's murder.

763
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:18,348
Dutiful daughter delivers
a thermos of "cocoa" to stepdaddy.

764
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:21,873
But he's too preoccupied to notice
what's in it until it's too late.

765
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:25,565
No. Why would I do that?

766
00:38:26,495 --> 00:38:28,575
James and Sara were all I had.

767
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:30,415
Except for your trust fund.

768
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,726
Your biological father left it to you
when he died in Iraq.

769
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:38,928
Sara has control of the trust fund
until your 25th birthday,

770
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:42,059
but, if she's behind bars,
then you would get your inheritance

771
00:38:42,974 --> 00:38:45,475
a little earlier?
All 200,000 of it.

772
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:47,654
Add Korby's life insurance policy.

773
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,530
That's another 250 grand.

774
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:50,850
You're all set.

775
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:52,965
Go to college,
buy yourself a fast car,

776
00:38:53,596 --> 00:38:55,209
maybe a little pad on the beach.

777
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,761
But wait five years? That's an eternity
to a pretty little party girl like you.

778
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:06,719
With them, it was an eternity.

779
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,030
You have no idea.

780
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:13,508
A stepfather who acts
like a juvenile delinquent.

781
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:16,333
A stepmother who marries
anything in a uniform.

782
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:17,801
You saw her.

783
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:19,480
She uses men.

784
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:22,714
She used my dad.

785
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,272
That dad died serving his country.

786
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:34,757
What's going to happen to my money?

787
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:37,342
It's yours in five years.

788
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,538
It's gonna go a long way
in the prison gift shop.

789
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:43,587
Morning, Ziva.

790
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:45,402
Good morning.
Coffee?

791
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:49,052
Thank you.

792
00:39:55,442 --> 00:39:56,585
All right.

793
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:01,216
My keyboard is not working.

794
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:07,642
I love Halloween.

795
00:40:08,648 --> 00:40:10,877
And what's not to love?
Pranks...

796
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:15,406
Halloween is officially
my favorite holiday.

797
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:16,871
And you are looking

798
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:19,910
at this year's larceny lotto winner.

799
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,608
So, you're buying us lunch today,
or...?

800
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:24,457
I didn't keep the money, Mcnopoly.

801
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:26,812
Gave it to charity.
Urban youth group.

802
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,620
My gut is not-for-profit.

803
00:40:29,452 --> 00:40:31,426
You know, Tony,
I've been thinking and,

804
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,825
I would like to acknowledge my place

805
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:37,321
as a new agent and your place as...

806
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,954
Your superior in every way?

807
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,882
Yes.

808
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,899
But, for my sanity,
could you not call me "probie"?

809
00:40:45,118 --> 00:40:46,371
I say it with love.

810
00:40:48,561 --> 00:40:49,933
And if I refuse?

811
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:54,652
You are senior field agent
and I am...

812
00:40:55,355 --> 00:40:56,424
entirely...

813
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:57,984
at your mercy.

814
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:02,667
As you should be.

815
