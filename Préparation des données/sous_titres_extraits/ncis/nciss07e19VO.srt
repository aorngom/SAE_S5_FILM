00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,550
Brett Lee, the quarterback,
is dating Stacy Miller?

3
00:00:10,712 --> 00:00:13,513
I swear to God, I saw his hand
on her butt, walking to French.

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,996
Can we please talk about something else?
How about anything else?

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,306
Look at this picture
I found on her Facebook page.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,394
She's so nasty.

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,021
Skanky and ugly.

8
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,721
- Skugly.
- Look out!

9
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:30,238
I swear, I barely hit him.

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,729
Oh, my God.

11
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:35,286
- Let's go check.
- I can't believe this.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,581
Oh, my God. Did I do that?

13
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,835
- He's been stabbed.
- Call 911.

14
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:45,876
Get off Facebook and dial!

19
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:26,648
Good morning.

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,080
Is it, Tim?

21
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,054
I don't see why it wouldn't be.

22
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,132
- What's wrong?
- You stood me up last night.

23
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:33,644
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

24
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,845
No, I did not, Tony.
What is today?

25
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,749
Today is the day after the night

26
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,767
when you were supposed to meet me
at the bar at the Air and Space Museum.

27
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,061
- Are you two dating now?
- No. Tony is using me as his pimp.

28
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:46,616
I went to college with a girl
who works at the museum.

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,608
Ms. Lunar Modules.
That's her specialty.

30
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,110
Tony wants me to introduce them.
To fix them up.

31
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:53,237
Tony needs help with a woman?

32
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,150
I need a geek wingman.

33
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,701
- McGeek qualifies.
- See that, Tony?

34
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:02,330
This shows that tomorrow night is
when we're supposed to get together.

35
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,295
I sent you 15 texts.

36
00:02:04,614 --> 00:02:06,006
I sat there for three hours.

37
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:07,710
I waited for you.
I called.

38
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,629
I was in the bathtub.

39
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:12,949
Why do you do that?

40
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,512
Every morning I come in, you get one
of the donuts with the sprinkles on it,

41
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:19,013
and you spend half an hour
picking all those sprinkles off.

42
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,431
What's your point?

43
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,225
Why just buy
one without the sprinkles?

44
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,479
Stay out of my business.
It's part of my ritual.

45
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:25,895
What do you care?

46
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:30,024
And the little huffing and puffing...
Are you trying to blow the coffee down?

47
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,901
Why not one long blow?

48
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:39,012
DiNozzo. It's McGee.
Listen, I have to cancel tomorrow night.

49
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:40,242
Have a good day.

50
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,997
- Not answering.
- Answer it.

51
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,587
You and me, McGee...

52
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,333
we're done.

53
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,715
No argument here.

54
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,621
You know what, you two?
I have actually heard of this.

55
00:02:57,705 --> 00:03:00,596
You two are having
a seven-year bitch.

56
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:01,863
Itch.

57
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,912
- And yes, we are.
- You two are like a married couple.

58
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:07,103
No, they're not.
They're still speaking.

59
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,730
Let's go. Grab your gear.
Got a dead sailor in Norfolk.

60
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,389
Victim is
Navy Lieutenant Justin Moss.

61
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:22,759
Worked for the Office of Public Affairs.
Married, no children.

62
00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:24,059
This is his house.

63
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:26,831
First he gets stabbed, then hit by car.
That's a rough day.

64
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,594
Yeah,
whoever stabbed him used a big knife.

65
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,169
Like a combat knife or a kukri.

66
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,629
- Kukri?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,090
It's a weapon used
by the Gurkhas to great effect.

68
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,232
Though I doubt a Gurkha had
anything to do with this.

69
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,154
Well, the kids in the car said
that Moss wandered into the street.

70
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:44,180
- You check his house?
- Ziva's in there now.

71
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:46,391
Looked clean. No blood.
Wife's not at home.

72
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:50,271
Blood drop pattern does indicate
that he was walking toward his house.

73
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,858
Well, severe loss of blood
can lead to disorientation.

74
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,309
It's well documented.

75
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:58,112
There was a case in New York,
the victim of a car crash.

76
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,072
He staggered home, went to bed,

77
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,992
and he woke the next morning
to find his left hand missing.

78
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,745
- Maybe he was a righty.
- He bled to death, Duck.

79
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,203
Yeah. Not here.

80
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,139
Our lieutenant
was stabbed elsewhere.

81
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:12,001
His clothes are soaked,
but there's no blood on the road.

82
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,087
- It's not our crime scene, huh?
- No, afraid not.

83
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:16,797
Blood trail heads up the hill.

84
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:17,798
Go.

85
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:21,010
Hey, McGee. Go.

86
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,888
- Together?
- Yeah, together. Go.

87
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:30,436
Why'd the dead guy cross the road?

88
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:32,656
To get home.

89
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:37,031
You were funnier
when you were fatter.

90
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,320
Well, well.
What do we have here?

91
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:44,191
I guess we've found our crime scene.

92
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:45,242
Got I.D.'s?

93
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:49,942
Thanks.

94
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,709
Here's our blood trail all the way
through the forest

95
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:55,371
to a motel...

96
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,669
I was wondering
when you were going to show up.

97
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:01,842
Dispatcher said
NCIS wasn't far away.

98
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:03,722
Detective McCadden.

99
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:05,471
We got a body
if you got a crime scene.

100
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,389
"Quid pro quo, Clarice."

101
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:09,838
<i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

102
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,342
Nice movie reference.

103
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,094
And a nice Chianti.

104
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:16,327
We're going to need everything
you've processed so far.

105
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:17,733
He knows the drill, Tim.

106
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,694
- What do you got, McC?
- Follow me.

107
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:24,281
McC...

108
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,412
Looks like
something out of <i>Kill Bill</i>.

109
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,844
- Volume 1.
- Volume 1.

110
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:31,660
Nice.

111
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,542
Room was rented to Justin Moss.

112
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:36,485
That's our victim.

113
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,606
Housekeeping called it in
when they found the mess.

114
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,160
Found a few hair samples.

115
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,743
No prints, but...

116
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,343
got a wine bottle
and a couple of glasses.

117
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,163
Dead guy had company.

118
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,807
Ma'am, this is a secured area!

119
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,530
- Ma'am, stay back.
- Justin?! Oh, my God!

120
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:56,516
We're going to ask you to step back.
This is a crime scene.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,607
I'm Emily Moss.
Where's my husband? What happened?

122
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:00,985
Your husband is
Lieutenant Justin Moss?

123
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,064
Yes. I was supposed to come pick him up.
He was meeting someone here.

124
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:06,032
- Do you know who?
- Of course.

125
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:07,616
He was with a prostitute.

126
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:18,121
I just don't understand
how this could have happened.

127
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,348
If that tramp touched my husband,
I'm going to kill her.

128
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,847
But you knew
he was meeting with an escort.

129
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,302
Justin...

130
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:28,527
was a reporter for the Navy Herald.

131
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,348
He was doing a piece
on high-priced call girls in Norfolk.

132
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:35,224
So, he was interviewing
escorts for his story.

133
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,814
Justin wanted to write about
how they lived, how they worked, how...

134
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,276
Norfolk's Navy population
influenced their business.

135
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:44,459
He was very professional about it.

136
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:48,407
Did he, by any chance, give you the name
of the woman he was interviewing?

137
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,118
No, but he'd spoken
with her a few times.

138
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:54,246
It was an ongoing assignment?

139
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:57,292
Justin would never cheat on me.

140
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,126
If that's what you're implying...

141
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:00,848
No, Ma'am.

142
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:02,588
Absolutely not.

143
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:07,384
Navy Lieutenant Justin Moss.

144
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,687
Clean service record,
no criminal activity,

145
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,430
worked as a journalist for the...

146
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,325
Navy Herald as well as his assignment
at Norfolk Naval Air Base.

147
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:18,079
- How about the woman he was with?
- She's still unidentified.

148
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:21,816
According to Moss's banking records,
he made a $1,000 cash withdrawal

149
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,402
- before meeting her in the motel room.
- Journalists don't pay for interviews.

150
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,364
Two more withdrawals were made
in the same amount in the last month.

151
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,488
Wonder what a grand buys you
these days.

152
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,786
Anyway... I'm looking
at Moss's date planner here, Boss.

153
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,038
The dates of his cash withdrawals
correspond to days he met her.

154
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,910
All previous meetings have been at a bar
in Norfolk called The Liberty Square.

155
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,934
Check the security cameras from the bar.
We need an I.D. on this woman.

156
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:46,202
Maybe the wife put an end
to her husband's investigative

157
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:47,687
probing with a steak knife.

158
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:50,010
The bad stuff is easier to believe.

159
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:51,954
That's a line from <i>Pretty Woman</i>.

160
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,512
I have a call in
to Justin's editor at the Navy Herald.

161
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:56,201
Take McGee with you.

162
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,813
Look any similar homicides in the area
in the past 12 to 18 months. Will do.

163
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,302
Go with McCadden.
I want you two working together on this.

164
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,317
I like that.

165
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,775
Murdered?!

166
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:14,021
I'm surprised your newspaper's not
already covering it.

167
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,605
Lieutenant Moss was writing
a story on escorts in Norfolk?

168
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,461
Yeah. Justin was fascinated.

169
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,995
He had this grand idea to turn
the article into some in-depth exposé.

170
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,272
- We need a copy of the story and...
- He hadn't turned anything in yet.

171
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:27,715
Did you know that he was paying
to spend time with her?

172
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,580
It's not uncommon for a reporter to
throw around a few bucks to get a story.

173
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:33,275
Moss paid $1,000
every time they met.

174
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:39,101
The lines between business
and pleasure can sometimes get blurred.

175
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:42,436
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to get back to work. Deadlines.

176
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,961
Yes. Lieutenant Moss met his.

177
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:53,418
No time for small talk.
There's way to much to tell.

178
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:56,103
- I only said "Abby", Abby.
- Well, now you've said it thrice.

179
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,080
I have been scrubbing
through the motel security footage.

180
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:03,042
It's grainy and it's from far away,

181
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,711
but you can see
a female-ish hunk of pixels coming...

182
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,298
and then going, an hour later.

183
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,886
Lot of time for a hanky-panky with our
dead journalist before she killed him.

184
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,412
If she did it. And by "did it",
I mean "if she killed him",

185
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,891
- not "did it" like "if she did it".
- You got her name?

186
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:21,812
Okay, motel footage?
Not so hot.

187
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,873
But the footage
that McGee got from the bar...

188
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,107
<i>muy caliente</i>.

189
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,647
Using Moss' calendar,
I was able to match a previous date and

190
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:31,570
time of a meeting between the Lieutenant
and our mystery woman, thus...

191
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:33,446
<i>Voilà.</i>

192
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:34,782
Her face on file?

193
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,032
Charlotte Cook.

194
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,410
She was busted for prostitution
two years ago.

195
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,027
If you get me a DNA sample,

196
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,342
I could match that to the hairs
found in the motel,

197
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:44,088
and we can put her
at the crime scene.

198
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,252
She's been arrested before
and her DNA's not on file?

199
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,963
Yeah. She must have had
a really good lawyer.

200
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,298
She was bailed out in a heartbeat
and charges were dropped.

201
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,594
Guess who she used to work for?

202
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,808
Holly Snow.

203
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,518
The former DC madam.

204
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,978
You should talk to her, Gibbs.

205
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,794
Look, she's giving seminars
on sexual harassment

206
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:08,898
to government employees
as part of her plea deal.

207
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,431
- Right. Community service.
- I guess she...

208
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,399
she would know a lot about sex, huh?

209
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:15,206
And harassment.

210
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,411
I don't think I could be an escort.

211
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:21,328
I'm really friendly and-and I'm a really
good listener and I like men, but...

212
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:25,582
- Yes?
- Find Charlotte Cook.

213
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:26,826
Right.

214
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:31,771
<i>Bullitt.
Escape from Alcatraz.</i>

215
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,982
I'm tempted to go with <i>Dirty Harry</i>.

216
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:39,159
But I'm going to say the best film set
in San Francisco is...

217
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:40,597
<i>Vertigo</i>.

218
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:44,309
Phil. Finally, somebody gets it.

219
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:47,224
They're showing a restored print
of <i>Road Warrior</i> in Norfolk on Friday.

220
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:48,230
Want to go?

221
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:52,506
"Just walk away. I'll spare your lives
for that tank of gas."

222
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,791
"Humungus."
Yes, we're going!

223
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,615
- Detective McCadden...
- You can call him "McC".

224
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,377
These show that you have

225
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:04,080
unsolved homicides
of a similar nature to this one.

226
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,541
Three previous murders
in Norfolk in the past six months.

227
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,309
All males, all stabbed in the back.

228
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:11,343
And all
with the same wound patterns.

229
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,132
You have a multiple offender.

230
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:15,080
We have a multiple offender.

231
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:22,567
Now, the only pertinent news
I have for you is that...

232
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,497
our reporter did not have relations

233
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:27,717
with his escort before his death.

234
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,172
- He wasn't paying for it, Duck?
- Her time, yes,

235
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:33,609
her body, no.
He was telling his wife the truth.

236
00:11:33,704 --> 00:11:36,366
Our missing woman
could be killing off her clients.

237
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,383
- Why?
- Robbery, revenge, resentment.

238
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,573
I don't think
you can rule out fetish.

239
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:42,144
Yeah, McGee.

240
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:45,247
<i>Boss, Charlotte Cook moved out of
her apartment</i> eight months ago.

241
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,743
There's no credit card trail,
no phone in her legal name.

242
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:49,407
<i>She is off the grid.</i>

243
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:53,275
Women interpret things
differently than men.

244
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,463
A glance...

245
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:56,757
a smile...

246
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:59,102
can all be taken in different ways.

247
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:03,581
We have to be careful
what we say and how we say it...

248
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,433
as some of my former clients
could easily attest.

249
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:09,812
However the...

250
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:14,066
the importance of maintaining a...

251
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:17,717
comfortable workplace
cannot be downplayed.

252
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,827
Something I've always taken seriously,
regardless of...

253
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,408
what line of work I was in.

254
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:25,369
Why don't we go ahead and take a,
um, ten-minute break?

255
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:29,540
That was interesting.

256
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:31,564
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

257
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,171
Agent Gibbs.

258
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:39,216
Are you checking up on me?

259
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:40,121
No.

260
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,462
You know I never did
thank you for the jewelry.

261
00:12:43,904 --> 00:12:46,139
I usually prefer Tiffany's, but...

262
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:48,978
I can wear this in the bathtub.

263
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:51,274
Well, I wouldn't complain, Holly.

264
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:53,491
Suspended sentence, no prison time.

265
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:54,986
You got off pretty easy.

266
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:58,234
You try not being able to go more
than two miles from your home someday.

267
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:01,730
I did. Little beach shack in Mexico
called "retirement". I liked it.

268
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,965
- And why'd you jump back in?
- Not here to talk about me.

269
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,560
Why are you here?

270
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:11,861
I need to find Charlotte Cook.

271
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,172
Sorry. I can't help you.

272
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,882
Part of my sentence was to stay away
from my former employees.

273
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,472
- Why, is she in trouble?
- Yeah, she's a suspect in four murders.

274
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,433
No, it's not possible.

275
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:32,326
I know women.
I used to work with.

276
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:34,975
Well, then...

277
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,815
you know where she is.

278
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,651
Gibbs, if you couldn't find her,
what makes you think that I can?

279
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:45,032
Although...

280
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,203
Although...

281
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,464
it's gonna cost me?

282
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:54,494
My rates have always been
very reasonable, Special Agent Gibbs.

283
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:59,296
I'm just looking for...
a little change of pace.

284
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:03,828
And this...

285
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:15,958
That's a deal-breaker.

286
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:18,236
You need me, Gibbs.

287
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,367
Use me.

288
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,424
How do we find her?

289
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:35,639
Put me back in business.

290
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:38,536
She'll find me.

291
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,182
You want to do what?!

292
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,302
Don't want to.
Need to.

293
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:55,602
A lot of important people
worked very hard

294
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:58,793
to get Holly Snow her plea deal
so that she would go away.

295
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,289
Well, she's back.

296
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:03,203
They buried Holly
and they buried her little black book,

297
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:05,046
and you want to put her back
in business?

298
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,446
Holly gets us Charlotte.

299
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,039
So you think that
when word gets out,

300
00:15:10,372 --> 00:15:12,202
Charlotte's gonna
magically call her?

301
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,631
No, nothing magic about it.

302
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:16,264
Holly's departure
was pretty high-profile.

303
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,209
- People are gonna buy that she's back?
- Think they'll want to.

304
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,505
- All right, then what?
- Holly arranges a date.

305
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,131
We bust Charlotte for solicitation.
We bring her in.

306
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,568
Which gives us
the right to test for DNA.

307
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:29,303
If it matches the hairs
found in the motel room...

308
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,066
We have our killer.
Or we might have someone that saw him.

309
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:35,061
Either way, you have leverage
on Charlotte, and she has to cooperate.

310
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:36,124
That's the plan.

311
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,266
Well, that's easier said than done.

312
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:40,141
It's sex, Leon.

313
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:42,660
Ain't nothin' easy about sex.

314
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,518
- Am I interrupting?
- No,

315
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:56,078
we have hit a lull.

316
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:59,249
Miss Snow's been back
in business for one hour.

317
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:01,815
We received 16 calls,
and none of them are Charlotte.

318
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,796
You know, you would think United States
Senators would use blocked numbers.

319
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:08,558
Excuse me.
I have to drop these off to Autopsy.

320
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,178
I'm Abby Sciuto.

321
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:18,540
I've been, um, following your...

322
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,728
career.

323
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,497
Am I flattered or offended?

324
00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:24,566
Both.

325
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:28,109
- Love your shoes.
- Love your shoes.

326
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,512
Thanks.
They're Manuel Aris... Milan.

327
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:32,866
Makes 'em by hand.

328
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,243
Gothic Sole, made by some big

329
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:38,705
heavy loud piece
of machinery in, like, Malaysia.

330
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,458
Is something on your mind, Abby?

331
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:45,879
You have a problem
with my line of work.

332
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,299
Do you have legal, moral or...

333
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,134
women's issues with it?

334
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,015
All of the above.

335
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,389
Yeah, me, too.

336
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,557
And now I'm paying for it.

337
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,230
This is a pre-paid cell.

338
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:08,298
<i>I'm sorry,
I must have the wrong number.</i>

339
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,781
- It's me. How are you?!
-<i> I'm just fine!</i>

340
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,982
- <i>I'm doing well.</i>
- Oh, good, good.

341
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,268
<i>So the rumors are true.</i>

342
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,636
Actually, I have somebody who would be
interested in meeting with you.

343
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:24,876
light KB,
possible M-O-X, half around.

344
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,713
- <i>Sounds fun. Where?</i>
- The Adams House Hotel.

345
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,923
6:00, Room 1126.

346
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,056
Ask for Eddie at the concierge desk.
He'll give you the key.

347
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,364
- <i>It's good to have you back.</i>
- It's good to be back.

348
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:38,129
-<i> I'll call you later.</i>
- All right. Bye.

349
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,838
It was nice to meet you,
Miss Snow...

350
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,017
I think.

351
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,375
Miss Snow,
can I ask you a quick question?

352
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:59,638
When you told Charlotte what the client
wanted, you mentioned a couple things:

353
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:02,867
"KB, M-O-X, half around."
What does that stuff mean?

354
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,281
Check the Internet.

355
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,920
Not there.
She'll look.

356
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,669
- You've taught 'em well.
- This is DC, Agent McGee.

357
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:23,022
Everybody's looking for dirt
on everybody else.

358
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,584
- What in the world did you do in there?
- Just freshening up.

359
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:36,005
Actually cut myself shaving,
if you can believe it.

360
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,391
They got a nice aftershave in there,

361
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:40,989
jasmine and ginger.

362
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,622
You're not compensating
with the jacket and everything?

363
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,129
I saw a photo of this girl.

364
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:48,001
She's used
to the upper-echelon clientèle.

365
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:50,879
Picked this up down
in the gift shop. It's classy.

366
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,334
Take it off, Hef.

367
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,591
And...

368
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,246
mess up your hair a little.
Sweat.

369
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,251
- Sweat?
- This place smells like a setup.

370
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,014
A john acts like a john.

371
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:04,838
At these prices,
he's not looking to impress the girl.

372
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:06,235
He wants to be impressed.

373
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,855
This will kill the mouthwash smell,
please drink it.

374
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,004
That's rich, instructing a DiNozzo
how to act around women.

375
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:13,395
What's the matter with you?

376
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:16,862
You act like you don't know what you're
doing, and she's gonna leave.

377
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:20,075
Pretend
like you've done this before.

378
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,327
What makes you think
I haven't done this before?

379
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,413
Because you're wearing underwear
straight out of the package.

380
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:31,497
You know, that could have fallen out
of the jacket

381
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:33,747
'cause it's new from the gift shop.

382
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,175
- Who do you think I am?
- A businessman pressed for time

383
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,770
looking to have a little fun before
you get on the train back to Wilmington.

384
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:43,390
She's here to make you forget
that she's an escort.

385
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,175
She's faking, you're not.
Got it?

386
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,393
A woman's never been able
to tell when I was faking.

387
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,550
Ask for something off-menu, something
spontaneous that I didn't approve.

388
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,449
She'll call me.
She won't be able to reach me,

389
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,089
and rather than refuse the job...

390
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,885
- Right.
- Right.

391
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:00,851
So what exactly am I asking for?

392
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,708
- Here's you earwig.
- I'll let you know.

393
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,298
<i>Testing...
this is Very Special Agent DiNozzo.</i>

394
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:16,420
- We're good.
- This had better work.

395
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,006
Is that a threat?

396
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:23,179
<i>Come on in.</i>

397
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:29,144
Guess you're not room service, huh?

398
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,141
Now, listen...

399
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:35,125
Shut up!

400
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,362
- It's fun to watch.
- <i>You've been a bad boy.</i>

401
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:46,178
<i>Tony,</i> tell her you want
to change the menu.

402
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:49,915
I want to change the menu.

403
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,749
You want the spicy <i>Canton</i>.

404
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:57,130
- The what?
- Pardon?

405
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:01,801
<i>I want the spicy Canton.</i>

406
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:05,696
Please?

407
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,038
Let me make a call.

408
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,605
Okay, put the envelope
on the table <i>and go into the bathroom.</i>

409
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,207
I'm just...

410
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:20,817
Daddy's gonna make wee-wee.

411
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,125
Did he just really say that?

412
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,450
Yeah, that's him improvising.

413
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,673
<i>You've reached my voicemail.
Please leave a message.</i>

414
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:44,177
Okay, she's taking the money.

415
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,016
Charlotte Cook,

416
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:53,519
NCIS.
You're under arrest.

417
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,564
- It's not what you think, Char.
- Then what is it, Holly?

418
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:00,370
I trusted you.

419
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:02,280
I know.

420
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:05,117
Char, I'm sorry.

421
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,162
I guess she'll never know
what she missed.

422
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,605
Or how lucky she is.

423
00:22:13,724 --> 00:22:15,522
I'm just going to take
a cold shower, Boss.

424
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:27,164
<i>Special Agent Gibbs,
your little sting was entrapment.</i>

425
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:30,348
- <i>Come on. We're leaving.</i>
- Sit down, Dwight.

426
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:32,558
Ms. Cook did nothing wrong.

427
00:22:33,661 --> 00:22:34,853
She's a prostitute.

428
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,437
Was a prostitute.

429
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,455
She thought the envelope
that she found was lost.

430
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,190
She intended on turning it back in.

431
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:42,124
You have no grounds
to hold my client.

432
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:43,820
How about murder?

433
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,199
Four murders to be exact.

434
00:22:54,815 --> 00:22:58,334
I've also got your client meeting
with Lieutenant Justin Moss.

435
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:00,698
Hair, found at the motel
where he was killed,

436
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:01,921
matches your client's.

437
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:04,902
- You were the last one to see Moss.
- So she was there.

438
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,009
Circumstantial.

439
00:23:07,817 --> 00:23:10,554
These three were clients,
but not the reporter.

440
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,851
We just talked.

441
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:14,149
He was nice enough,
so I didn't mind.

442
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,854
No one had ever wanted to know
my story before, and I just wanted...

443
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:20,607
- Stop talking.
- What happened at the motel?

444
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,235
- You say something to Moss?
- Don't.

445
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:26,696
I didn't kill anybody.

446
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:29,032
You know what?
We're gonna need a few moments, please.

447
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:32,483
Who charges more,
Dwight, you or her?

448
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:36,956
You can take all the time you need.
She's staying.

449
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:39,807
- On what charges?
- No charges.

450
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:41,911
Material witness.

451
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:52,771
Hey... coffee?

452
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,387
Cream, two sugars.

453
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,053
I can't be bought, Gibbs.

454
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,956
I'm sorry.
Judge's orders.

455
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,198
Charlotte's not your killer.

456
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:14,262
- How do you know that?
- I know people.

457
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,098
That's what I get paid for.

458
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,382
Were paid for.

459
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,339
I've been with the violent ones.

460
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:23,137
She's not one of them.

461
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:29,345
So aren't you going to ask?

462
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:32,678
How'd a nice girl like me,
blah, blah, blah?

463
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:38,021
Come on, you know you want to.

464
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,610
I don't care.

465
00:24:41,471 --> 00:24:43,042
He doesn't care.

466
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:47,276
Somebody approached me
when I was at Wellesley.

467
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,596
I was an art history major.

468
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,770
Big student loans.

469
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:55,503
No family.

470
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:59,247
And I was working three jobs.

471
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:03,874
Then I found out
how much I could make...

472
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:05,912
in another line of work.

473
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,533
And they say you can't make money
with a liberal arts degree.

474
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:16,049
I didn't know
you had a sense of humor.

475
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:19,526
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You just...

476
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:21,418
think you do.

477
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,035
I know Charlotte's innocent.

478
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:32,540
Yeah, Gibbs.

479
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,741
Boss, just got another call
from McCadden.

480
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,077
Norfolk PD found another body.
Same M.O., same murder weapon.

481
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,700
Same killer.

482
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:42,290
<i>Yeah, but the time of death
was two hours ago,</i>

483
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:45,084
while Charlotte Cook
was in our custody.

484
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:51,600
Well, you were right, Holly Snow.

485
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:04,306
All right, favorite film,
finale set in a factory, Phil.

486
00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:06,970
<i>Terminator.</i>

487
00:26:07,054 --> 00:26:09,355
Evil Arnie gets crushed
by the industrial press.

488
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,238
I like <i>Terminator 2</i>,
where the T-1000

489
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,616
falls into the vat of molten steel
and then heroic Arnie follows suit.

490
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,743
- Might be better.
- Well, if it isn't T-Cad.

491
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:20,452
- What?
- T-Cad.

492
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:23,331
It's what I'm calling you guys now.
You know, the cute couples contraction?

493
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,084
TomKat, Bennifer, Brangelina?

494
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,752
Yeah, we got it, McBitter.

495
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:31,328
You two are wearing
the same suit even.

496
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,486
Nice.

497
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:37,062
Building security found the body.

498
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,679
No blood.
Like he was dumped.

499
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:42,264
Multiple stab wounds to the back.
We've definitely got a fifth victim.

500
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,935
Wounds on his arm, chest.

501
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:46,116
Guy wasn't easy to take out.

502
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,169
- Put up a fight.
- Killer had to be strong.

503
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,713
- We're probably looking for a male.
- Or Ziva.

504
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:54,947
Your victim's got a rap sheet.

505
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,948
Busted for solicitation.

506
00:26:57,364 --> 00:26:59,325
You know,
one of Charlotte's clients.

507
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,536
Call that into Gibbs.
Come on, Phil.

508
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:04,455
- Let's get something to eat.
- Yeah, sounds good.

509
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,708
You ever see <i>Diner</i>?

510
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,362
It's a nicer room this time.

511
00:27:13,587 --> 00:27:15,842
You recognize your mistakes,
Agent Gibbs?

512
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:18,757
No mistake.
Just being thorough.

513
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,322
This won't take long.

514
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,850
It's going to take as long
as I say it's going to take.

515
00:27:26,193 --> 00:27:28,312
Another one of your johns,
Charlotte.

516
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:30,690
This is ridiculous.

517
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,317
She's innocent.

518
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,609
You're her alibi.

519
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:35,862
Five men are dead.

520
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,157
The only thing in common is you.

521
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:41,367
You need to tell us
everything you can.

522
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,536
Wait.
She has no authority here.

523
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,787
She's here to help your client.

524
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,798
Somebody's following you.

525
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:59,761
If you keep seeing clients,
he will keep killing.

526
00:28:03,606 --> 00:28:05,244
So you really got out, huh?

527
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:08,214
Took a bunch of courage.

528
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:10,705
I couldn't do it.

529
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,382
Give us a name.

530
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,111
Someone who's gotten physical.

531
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:25,762
Honey, you can trust me.

532
00:28:25,846 --> 00:28:29,279
She is not giving you the names
of men that can testify against her.

533
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,334
- Nice try, though.
- Am I talking to you?

534
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,462
Your stupidity is gonna get
somebody else killed.

535
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:42,030
Charlotte, this is about you.

536
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,221
Do you think
that he's gonna stop with them?

537
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:49,513
He gets mad at you,

538
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:52,397
you'll end up the same way.

539
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,334
Nicholas.

540
00:28:57,383 --> 00:28:58,945
I'm not sure what his last name was.

541
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,012
50's, bald.

542
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,827
Said he worked
for the State Department.

543
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,786
I met him right
after you got arrested.

544
00:29:07,343 --> 00:29:08,593
He plays rough.

545
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,662
Crazy jealous.

546
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,083
He wanted me
to stop seeing other men.

547
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:16,295
Make them think
they're the only ones?

548
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:18,779
Sometimes they believe it.

549
00:29:29,298 --> 00:29:30,868
Nicholas...
you know him?

550
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:33,759
But you'll never believe how.

551
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,823
Okay, slow it down.

552
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,400
I always remember the clingy ones.

553
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,565
Lots of questions.
Not enough personal space.

554
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:43,370
There.

555
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:45,972
- That's him.
- Freeze it, McGee.

556
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:50,344
All right, name tag.
It's a lot easier than a BOLO.

557
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:53,100
Did you get my Nutter Butters?

558
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:56,376
Hey, slim Tim.
Forgot about that. Sorry.

559
00:29:56,516 --> 00:29:59,196
I'll bet you did.
You used to get my Nutter Butters.

560
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,840
You taking a little break, are you?

561
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,427
Just a little low blood sugar.
Just grabbing a snack, Boss. I'm back.

562
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,803
Already got a hit on him.

563
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:09,931
Nicholas Everett?

564
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:12,546
That's what you're going to find out,
and I want everything.

565
00:30:12,987 --> 00:30:14,415
Let's go, Holly.

566
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:17,024
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you home.

567
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:18,816
And tucking me in?

568
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:24,971
Holly Snow in person.

569
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,061
Best call girl movie ever?

570
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:29,827
- Klute.
- Sutherland, nice.

571
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:35,021
<i>Leaving Las Vegas.</i>

572
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:37,418
So you heard about T-Cad?

573
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:40,472
Tony's new bromance.

574
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,174
Honey, don't worry.

575
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,785
It'll be over soon.

576
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:48,513
I don't care when it's over.

577
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:51,239
It can go forever
as far as I'm concerned.

578
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:53,851
Somebody needs a hug.

579
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:56,150
- I need a lead.
- Oh, really?

580
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:59,147
'Cause I found our killer's blood.
How's that for a case-cracker?

581
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,392
Guess where?

582
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,013
No, really.
Like, I want you to guess.

583
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,154
- On the knife?
- No. Guess again.

584
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,408
I found trace amounts inside

585
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,997
- the stab wounds of our latest victim.
- You got a name?

586
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:15,056
I ran the DNA through the database.
Nothing in the system.

587
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:17,208
But... guess what McGee found?

588
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,751
Abby, no more guessing.

589
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:21,109
Nicholas Everett's credit cards...

590
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:24,416
two months ago he purchased a hunting
knife called a Sultan Slayer 150.

591
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,591
Murder weapon.

592
00:31:27,326 --> 00:31:31,122
The bevel point and serrated spine
of the Sultan Slayer 150

593
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,850
matches the wound patterns
of all five victims.

594
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,893
How'd the killer's blood
get inside his victims?

595
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,838
I've been dying for you
to ask me that.

596
00:31:37,922 --> 00:31:40,231
This knife lacks a prominent hilt.

597
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,859
So if it gets slick, like say,
if you were stabbing someone,

598
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,143
it's hard to grip.

599
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:47,441
The killer's hand must have slipped
down the handle.

600
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:48,961
Cut himself with his own knife.

601
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:51,742
As he continued stabbing,
bled into the victim's wounds.

602
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:56,402
Our killer is going to have a slice
on the heel or the palm of his hand.

603
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:57,969
- It's good to work.
- Wait.

604
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,836
Could you give McGee my hug today?
Because he really needs one.

605
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,531
I'm good, Boss. Thanks.

606
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:16,707
Hey, dug into Nicholas Everett.

607
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:17,687
Okay, go.

608
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:21,614
Multiple complaints filed by family,
neighbors and work associates

609
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:23,218
for volatile erratic behavior,

610
00:32:23,302 --> 00:32:25,681
and he was also arrested
for domestic abuse.

611
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,939
Pick him up.

612
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,127
- Probie does a lot for me.
- Really? Seems like such a geek.

613
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:34,686
You deserve better.

614
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:36,565
There is no better.

615
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:39,027
I doubt that, <i>compadre</i>.

616
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:42,680
Now Ziva... I'd get
that cupcake a cookie anytime.

617
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:46,597
Let's wait for him in the lobby like
Ness at the steps in<i>The Untouchables</i>.

618
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:50,002
It was a train station, Phil.
Remember <i>The Battleship Potemkin</i>?

619
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,850
Whatever.

620
00:32:58,404 --> 00:33:00,728
Hold it! Freeze!

621
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,105
Back it up!
What's the matter with you?

622
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:05,379
Hands in the air.
You got him?

623
00:33:06,405 --> 00:33:08,831
- What the hell is this?
- Dead johns, Nicky.

624
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:09,987
I work here.

625
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:11,572
People are gonna see this.

626
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:15,685
What?

627
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:17,745
Hands.

628
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,165
Killer had to have some kind of cut.

629
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,756
Everett didn't do it.

630
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,259
Okay. Thank you, Abby.

631
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,806
Nicholas Everett's Sultan Slayer knife
was as clean as his injury-free hands.

632
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,684
His alibi checks out, too.

633
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,496
Everett was in a court-ordered anger
management program

634
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,979
- when two of the murders occurred.
- So, you've got nothing.

635
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:49,151
Phil, I think it's more
like we've got nothing.

636
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:52,385
Except five dead bodies,
all killed by the same person,

637
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,219
- with the same knife.
- The only connection between our...

638
00:33:55,303 --> 00:33:58,748
five victims is
our high-priced escort Charlotte.

639
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:01,997
No. No. Actually,
there is another connection.

640
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,226
The person that introduced her
to the clients...

641
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,876
- Charlotte's old boss.
- Where is Miss Holly Golightly anyway?

642
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:10,256
That's a good question. She's not home.
She's not answering her cell phone.

643
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:12,897
- Couldn't have gone far.
- Track her ankle monitor.

644
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,843
Tracking.

645
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:15,928
Got her signal.

646
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,643
- Yep, she's moving, Boss.
- She's breaking parole.

647
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,267
- McGee, MTAC, now.
- Got it, Boss.

648
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,395
We'll take it from here, Phil.

649
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:26,147
I think you can hit the road.

650
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:28,065
You sure?

651
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:30,943
Very.

652
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:45,220
Where is she going, Gibbs?

653
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:48,029
- I have no idea.
- Get one... she's your responsibility.

654
00:34:48,113 --> 00:34:50,171
I didn't chain her to my leg, Leon.

655
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,494
Why not?

656
00:34:52,729 --> 00:34:54,570
Other men have paid money to do it.

657
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,154
I want a BOLO out on her car.

658
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,851
Already done. GPS signal shows her
heading towards Alexandria.

659
00:35:07,768 --> 00:35:10,274
Holly's ankle monitor
just went off line.

660
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,535
- Maybe her battery's dead?
- Or she disabled it.

661
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:13,944
She's got no reason to.

662
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,238
- That we know of.
- Track her cell, McGee.

663
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:18,274
It's turned off.

664
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:21,860
But I bet I can retrieve her most
recent text messages from the carrier.

665
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:26,473
Okay, last message Holly received was
from Charlotte less than an hour ago.

666
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:27,651
Put it up.

667
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,373
She went to help her.
You got Charlotte's cell?

668
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:33,509
Tracking it.

669
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:38,092
No signal.
Did get a hit on her name, though.

670
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,881
Charlotte Cook's been admitted
to a DC emergency room.

671
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:43,057
Here name was registered
in the DVP alert system.

672
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:45,267
Domestic Violence Protocol.

673
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:58,602
Charlotte...

674
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:01,610
We need to talk.

675
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:12,583
Who did this to you?

676
00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:14,341
I try to be careful.

677
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:18,225
All these years, I've been lucky.

678
00:36:20,154 --> 00:36:22,721
I guess I just thought
if anything happened,

679
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,518
then it would be one of them.

680
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:28,394
But I don't want to make him
angrier because...

681
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:30,413
Who did this?

682
00:36:34,264 --> 00:36:35,995
Other people are going to die.

683
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:39,818
And then he's going to turn on you.

684
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:43,826
My boyfriend.

685
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,103
He just gets so jealous.

686
00:36:47,187 --> 00:36:49,022
I tried to confront him
about the killings.

687
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,541
Who is your boyfriend?

688
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:52,791
My lawyer.

689
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,388
DiNozzo,
put out a BOLO on Dwight Kasdan.

690
00:36:55,472 --> 00:36:58,256
He's a Georgetown lawyer.
And get additional security up here.

691
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,440
On it, Boss.

692
00:37:01,064 --> 00:37:02,469
Where is Holly Snow?

693
00:37:03,446 --> 00:37:04,670
I don't know.

694
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:06,347
You sent her a text.

695
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,731
No, I didn't.

696
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,954
Dwight took my phone,
and told me if I...

697
00:37:11,434 --> 00:37:13,418
if I talked to anybody,
he'd kill me.

698
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:15,566
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

699
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:19,949
Metro PD's sending units
to his house and office,

700
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:21,787
and McGee's got
a BOLO out on his car.

701
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,158
McGee, cell phone records
for Dwight Kasdan.

702
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,618
Yep. Already pulled 'em.

703
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:26,750
Go. Track him.

704
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:33,584
He's currently in an office complex...
in Alexandria.

705
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,588
<i>It's a foreclosure.</i>
Kasdan reps the former owner.

706
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:39,276
You stay with her.

707
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:41,472
Anyone tries to get in here,
you shoot 'em.

708
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,831
Happy to.

709
00:37:46,853 --> 00:37:48,294
You don't have to do this.

710
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,090
Well, if she's not going
to stop seeing other men, Holly,

711
00:37:53,942 --> 00:37:55,767
I'm gonna make sure
they can't see her.

712
00:37:58,495 --> 00:38:00,235
You know what she did for a living.

713
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:02,221
Did for you, Holly.

714
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:05,449
I mean, you're the one
that got her into this.

715
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,972
It's your fault.

716
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:08,702
Now I'm gonna get her out.

717
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,831
So, what,
are you gonna stab me in the back, too?

718
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:16,321
What's the matter, Dwight?

719
00:38:16,654 --> 00:38:18,479
Afraid to look a woman in the eye?

720
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,354
It's okay.

721
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:05,926
Hey, McCadden.

722
00:39:07,436 --> 00:39:09,221
Oh, really?
Was that tonight?

723
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:11,848
Yeah, it slipped my mind.
I got tons to do, you know?

724
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,462
Us NCIS geeks,
just closing out the case.

725
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:18,919
No, I don't think
there's gonna be a next time, Phil.

726
00:39:23,173 --> 00:39:24,286
That was McCadden?

727
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,655
Did you dump him, Tony?

728
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,354
Has your man-mance come to an end?

729
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:32,077
- I never had a man-mance.
- You had a fling.

730
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:36,316
Guys don't have flings.
We hang out.

731
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,749
Things were hanging out?

732
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:40,085
That is disgusting.

733
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,133
Cookie, McG?

734
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:48,844
Nutter Butter.

735
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:51,255
That was very nice.
A peace offering.

736
00:39:52,066 --> 00:39:53,389
Feel guilty, don't you?

737
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:56,101
Well, you should.

738
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:58,604
I won't apologize.

739
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:00,217
I don't expect you to.

740
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,735
You're doing that thing again.
You're huffing on your coffee.

741
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,444
I'm just sipping from the cup.

742
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,447
- You're annoying.
- You're juvenile.

743
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:11,727
Why do I even try?

744
00:40:23,577 --> 00:40:26,677
Okay, this has got to be
the best steak I've ever had.

745
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:29,259
Please tell me what is your secret.

746
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:31,348
It's all about the touch.

747
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:33,848
When it's ready...

748
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:38,403
I pour a little beer on it.

749
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:41,938
Waste of beer.

750
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:47,500
Well...

751
00:40:48,473 --> 00:40:50,675
thank you for a wonderful evening.

752
00:40:52,343 --> 00:40:54,324
And for delivering on my little,

753
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:55,933
deal-breaker.

754
00:40:58,499 --> 00:40:59,790
Really? It's that special?

755
00:41:01,703 --> 00:41:04,350
All I wanted was dinner
without expectations.

756
00:41:06,442 --> 00:41:07,520
With a friend.

757
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:09,891
We're friends?

758
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:14,871
Excuse me.

759
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:23,856
Tonight.

760
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,041
What time?

761
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,529
All right, I'll see what I can do.

762
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:32,992
Me, too.

763
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:34,896
All right, bye-bye.

764
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,609
I can explain.

765
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:46,628
No. You don't have to.

766
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:49,222
No,
I know what you must be thinking.

767
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:53,870
I doubt that.

768
00:41:58,425 --> 00:41:59,475
I gotta go.

769
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:13,071
Friends?

770
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:18,454
I don't have many.

771
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,660
Me, either.
