2
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:08,062
See? Shortcut through the park
will be working.

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,711
You just doubled your tip.

4
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:14,974
It's Kirkland.

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,428
No, my car broke down.

6
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:18,525
I had to take a cab.
I should be there in 20.

7
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,358
Have Bob start the presentation.

8
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:21,316
Yeah,

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,986
use the laser pointer.

10
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:25,297
The GAO guys are distracted
by shiny things.

11
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:26,801
That'll keep them busy.

12
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:27,844
Be there soon.

13
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:31,322
Through no, no.
Be passing us, already.

14
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:32,742
What the hell?

15
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:34,006
Come on, come on.

16
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,208
Go, go.

17
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:11,769
Team-NCIS.com presents:

NCIS Season 5 Episode 8
Designated Target (Version LOL V1.0)

00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:18,974
Synchro : Akazab, Kasius.
Capture : Swsub.com

20
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:45,619
No, no, no, it is not you, it's just...

21
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:47,565
well, you know,
these things run their course.

22
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,365
And, well, you

23
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:51,913
- you must accept it...
- Personal call, David?

24
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:52,877
Yes.

25
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:54,307
Go away.

26
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:55,504
Somebody being dumped?

27
00:01:57,715 --> 00:02:00,204
How do you tell someone you no longer
want to see him?

28
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:01,267
Easy.

29
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,993
Listen, dirtbag, this is Ziva's husband.

30
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,933
I have your phone number now.
I can find your address.

31
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:09,860
if you ever try to contact her again,
I will reach down your throat,

32
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,273
grab your intestines,
rip them out and drive over your head!

33
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:13,831
Lose this number or lose your life.

34
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:15,811
You're welcome.

35
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:17,504
That was my Aunt Nettie

36
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:18,987
from Tel Aviv.

37
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,533
She was trying

38
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,503
to stop seeing her 86-year-old
mahjong partner.

39
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,227
Why didn't you stop me?

40
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,604
Too stunned.

41
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:28,590
Where do I send flowers?

42
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:31,526
If you ever communicate with her again,
I will kill you.

43
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:33,942
Is it always this bright in here?

44
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:37,134
Wait a second.
I recognize that look.

45
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:39,187
You had sex,
and I'm guessing it was with a girl.

46
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:40,151
No.

47
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,461
No, it wasn't a girl?

48
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:43,456
No, it's none of your business.

49
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:46,366
If the probie was probing last night,
I demand details.

50
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,588
Actually it was this morning.

51
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:51,333
And it wasn't sex, it was coffee.

52
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,007
And it was good.

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,559
The coffee or the sex?

54
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:57,124
It wasn't sex.
I met a nice girl,

55
00:02:57,217 --> 00:02:58,666
we're hitting it off, that's all.

56
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,036
Where do you meet?

57
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:02,871
Moved into my building
a few days ago right across the hall.

58
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,612
Proximity, that's convenient.

59
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:05,830
Very?

60
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:08,622
McGee is getting some.

61
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:10,477
Get it out of your head, DiNozzo.

62
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:12,469
And gear up, we got a dead one.

63
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,126
You know, repeated head
trauma causes brain damage!

64
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:16,472
Explains a lot.

65
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:18,585
Is this side of my head bigger?

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,707
Yes, but so is the other side.

67
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:25,792
<i>Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

68
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:28,540
Who and what?

69
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:29,617
It's a movie.

70
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:31,424
1967,

71
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:33,158
Warren Beatty.

72
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:34,344
Faye Dunaway.

73
00:03:34,553 --> 00:03:37,008
It's a classic tale
of crime and punishment.

74
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,136
Focus on this crime scene, DiNozzo.

75
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:41,670
Nine millimeter cartridges.

76
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,301
It's not a robbery.

77
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,046
Cash box is still under the seat.

78
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:47,574
Credit cards are here, too.

79
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:50,395
Rear Admiral Kenneth Kirkland.

80
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:52,863
Worked at the Pentagon.

81
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:55,895
The driver's name...

82
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,380
"A-tife"?

83
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,410
Atif Nukunda.

84
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:00,731
Gesundheit.

85
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:02,773
Address is listed as DC.

86
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:06,516
Tire tracks.

87
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,790
Single alignment,

88
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,068
looks like a motorcycle.

89
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,595
Top choice of assassins

90
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,686
who often dump their weapons.

91
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:13,971
Look, Ziva.

92
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:16,811
Duck?

93
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:19,119
Well, this was no traffic accident.

94
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,268
No kidding.

95
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,197
Little doubt they were killed here.

96
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:25,271
Cause of death, multiple gunshots.

97
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,964
Any one of which could have been fatal.

98
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,226
- Time?
- That's not gonna be a problem.

99
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:33,066
Onboard digital surveillance camera,
probably time-stamped.

100
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,284
Let's see it, DiNozzo.

101
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,901
- What? There a problem?
- Well, I...

102
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:39,517
- McGee has the cable...
- McGee.

103
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:42,371
Normally I have the cable,
but McGee has the other bag.

104
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:51,346
Recorded straight onto a flash drive,

105
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,497
probably on a 15 minute loop.

106
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,257
Let's see the last recorded images here.

107
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,484
At 9:23, first shot was fired.

108
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:03,540
Cab crashed seven seconds later.

109
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,145
A turkey shoot.

110
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:06,399
Fish in a barrel.

111
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:09,040
DiNozzo, find out where the admiral was
coming from,

112
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:10,570
headed to, who knew about it...

113
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:12,664
and if any of those files are missing.

114
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,018
All right, I'll take care...

115
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:16,493
That lipstick

116
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:17,909
on your collar, McGee?

117
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:21,482
Well...

118
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:23,667
Good for you, Tim.

119
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:25,687
Good for you.

120
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:27,384
Just don't ever get married.

121
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:34,189
Hello?

122
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,351
I didn't order a sofa.

123
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,782
Yeah, that's my credit card number.

124
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,785
Rear Admiral Kirkland's credited

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,377
with several innovative
efficiency programs at the Pentagon.

126
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,220
He was involved in developing
the Ready-Rapid

127
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,347
Deployment model for moving massive
amounts of assets with minimum delays.

128
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:53,941
Possible target for terrorists?

129
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,358
Admiral hasn't left dry land since 02.

130
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:58,585
Not exactly a high-value
al-Qaeda target.

131
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:00,728
Any admiral is a high-value target.

132
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,631
Taxi?

133
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,381
Kirkland was heading from home
to attend a budget meeting at the GAO.

134
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:06,412
No government car?

135
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:07,759
Broke down on 14th Street.

136
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,821
His aide stayed with the car,
Admiral called a cab.

137
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:11,018
Why go through the park?

138
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,500
Three car pile-up on Connecticut.

139
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,683
The cabdriver was probably trying
to make up time.

140
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:15,699
Sabotage?

141
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:17,653
No, we checked the Pentagon
surveillance tapes.

142
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:19,705
Nobody touched the car
before it left to pick him up.

143
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:20,474
Files?

144
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:22,250
Staff checked his briefcase.
Nothing was missing.

145
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,225
Personal?

146
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:25,486
No enemies, loving family, devoted wife.

147
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:27,412
No large insurance policies.

148
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:28,448
No motive.

149
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,159
Every murder has a motive, McGee.

150
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,359
Not this one.

151
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,291
I though you have quit.

152
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:44,638
I did.

153
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,164
It's no caffeine.

154
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:47,814
No kick.

155
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:50,812
I can suck down, like an half dozen
of these babies, no ill effects.

156
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:52,067
Gibbs,

157
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:53,521
I'm steel.

158
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:58,805
No, I am okay.
I'm better than okay.

159
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,575
Way better.
From the taxi.

160
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:01,596
Bullets,

161
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:03,915
the slug on the right
is a nine millimeter,

162
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,067
full metal jacket, high velocity,
you can see by its

163
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,977
deformation that it went
through metal, glass,

164
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:09,737
- whole she-bang.
- The other one?

165
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:11,160
Also nine millimeter.

166
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:12,638
but just a standard hollow-point.

167
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:15,400
The striations on the rounds
indicate that they were using silencers.

168
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,411
Casings?

169
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:17,610
Ejection port marks

170
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,102
show that you're looking for
a Glock or a Beretta.

171
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:21,982
You should really try this, Gibbs.

172
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,167
It'll change your life.

173
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:24,209
Motorcycle?

174
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,376
The tread on the bike
was only offered as an option

175
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,804
on the Yamaha R-six series.

176
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:33,611
No hits on sales records yet,

177
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:36,102
indicating that the bike
may have been purchased overseas

178
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:37,632
and then brought across the border.

179
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:38,792
All that,

180
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,402
- no caffeine.
- Crime scene?

181
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:42,493
I'm working on some fresh oil drops

182
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:44,113
that were found near the tire tracks.

183
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:45,314
Cab took a detour.

184
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:46,531
Must have followed them.

185
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,488
Or they could've hacked into

186
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:50,938
the taxi's onboard navigation system
and were waiting.

187
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,019
Ambush.

188
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:56,385
Okay... can I just have one little
teeny-tiny baby booster sip? Please?

189
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:57,224
No.

190
00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:58,694
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome.

191
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,425
McGee, garage.
Now.

192
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,731
Boss, the navigation system
was definitely hackable.

193
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:08,392
All they would've need was the car's
VIN number and the owner's address.

194
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,336
They could have requested
a diagnostic test,

195
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:11,936
then captured and cloned the signal.

196
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,834
- Who hacked it?
- No way to tell.

197
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:15,925
The signal doesn't ghost,
and there's no recording

198
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:17,826
GPS markers after the fact.

199
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:20,176
Does anyone have any answers?

200
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:21,855
- Ziva?
- No.

201
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:23,517
Ziva doesn't have any answers, boss.

202
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:26,555
Yeah, Duck.

203
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,578
I'm on my way up.

204
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,881
You look into the cab company.

205
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:44,538
Hey, I can't really talk right now.

206
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:46,877
Sure you can, probie.
You can talk right now.

207
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:48,209
Go away.

208
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:49,576
Put her on speaker, probie.

209
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:50,838
Get out of here!

210
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:52,911
Probie...

211
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,383
Look, there's something...
Ah, look at him.

212
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,445
He's all grown up having
his first fight.

213
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,324
Now,

214
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,322
where did you get
my credit card number?

215
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:02,027
You opened my mail?

216
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:05,458
Listen, I need to go,

217
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:07,762
but we'll talk about this later, okay?

218
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:09,939
You, too.

219
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:11,819
I'll see you later, Bumby.

220
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:14,867
"Bumby"?

221
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,591
Well, we can't all be called "probie",
can we?

222
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,111
What have you got, Duck?

223
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:25,754
Bullet from the frontal lobe

224
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,664
of your rear admiral.

225
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,654
Yeah, both bodies received
multiple rounds

226
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,907
from a variety of ranges and angles.

227
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,221
Indicating?

228
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,485
The first projectiles struck them after

229
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,656
deflected off metal or glass.

230
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,247
And they were followed by two

231
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:44,454
close contact wounds with stippling,

232
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:45,753
indicating

233
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:47,942
that they were shot execution style.

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,267
Okay. That's it?

235
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,311
No, no, no.

236
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:51,334
Come here.

237
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,805
Take a look at this.

238
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:56,013
What am I looking at?

239
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,310
Between the second bicuspid
and second molar, lower left.

240
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:00,534
Missing tooth?

241
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,415
Freshly extracted.

242
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,783
And the lack of bleeding
around the gum tissue

243
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:06,479
indicates that it was postmortem.

244
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,587
There was no tooth in his throat

245
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,658
or in his stomach,
so he didn't swallow it.

246
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:13,794
And there was no tooth
at the crime scene.

247
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:15,584
They pulled his tooth?

248
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:17,622
Well, they could have used
a pair of pliers.

249
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:20,029
It's a crude if effective means
of extraction.

250
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:21,986
Anything taken from our admiral?

251
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:24,018
No, no, no, no, but I found something

252
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:27,240
really interesting
on the driver's right hand.

253
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,070
What is that?

254
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:42,247
Abby ran the analysis.

255
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:43,750
It's a fingerprint salve.

256
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:46,697
Invisible until it's pressed on paper.

257
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:50,019
Fingerprints and tooth pulp DNA.

258
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:51,898
Two of the best ways to identify a body.

259
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,462
Yeah, your rear admiral
wasn't the target, Jethro.

260
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,412
No.

261
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:57,810
The cabdriver was.

262
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:09,430
Dead driver name was Atif Nukunda.

263
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:12,884
Immigrated here seven years ago
from Burundi, in East Africa,

264
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,090
after his name was found
on a death squad list.

265
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,475
A political refugee.

266
00:11:16,865 --> 00:11:18,955
Employment records
show he worked two jobs

267
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:22,811
Cab and pizza delivery driver,
about 85 hours a week.

268
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:25,151
- Land of opportunity.
- Check his address.

269
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,593
Metro Police have been there, done that.
Vacant lot.

270
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:29,693
Attacks on other cabdrivers
in the past 60 days?

271
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,979
Already working on it.

272
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:33,222
DiNozzo, check out the cab company.

273
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,402
Go to, boss.

274
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,599
"Go to".

275
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,738
It's the new "on it."

276
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,398
New catchphrase, just came up with it.

277
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,811
- You like it?
- No.

278
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,336
Cab company?

279
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:45,633
On it, boss.

280
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:46,906
Go, too.

281
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,350
McGee, what do you got?

282
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,910
Well, boss,
the time-stamped footage of the killings

283
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,954
enabled us to track all cell calls made

284
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:58,090
from the park in the two minutes
after the shooting.

285
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,104
Ten calls in all.

286
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:02,641
One that stands out was
a high-density bandwidth transmission,

287
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:04,303
almost certainly a video file.

288
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,397
Someone filmed the execution.

289
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:07,785
Proof of death?

290
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:10,353
Call was made from
a pre-paid cell phone,

291
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:12,102
then sent through a router
in East Africa.

292
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,161
Lost it there.

293
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:14,184
Find it.

294
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,839
Well, it went to a series
of public pay phones,

295
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:18,134
all of which were answered.

296
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:21,163
Impossible to tell which line
was actually the intended number.

297
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:24,311
Whoever these guys are,
boss, they're very good.

298
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:28,712
But so are we.

299
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:32,135
Nukunda is dead, Mr. Bayliss.

300
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:33,396
Oh, my God.

301
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,422
Really dead?

302
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,701
What happened?

303
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,919
Have you not missed him?

304
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:39,884
No, he works the morning shift, so,

305
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,627
usually he's sleeping all day long.

306
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,803
Where, in his cab?

307
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,642
In his apartment.

308
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:46,477
- Fake address.
- Really?

309
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:48,380
That is weird.

310
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,431
You know, I can't figure out if you're

311
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:53,321
DeVito in <i>Taxi</i> or
De Niro in <i>Taxi Driver</i>.

312
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:56,389
- What?
- You're acting.

313
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:59,126
I worked transit detail
in Baltimore for two years.

314
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:00,146
Come on.

315
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:02,270
Okay, Nukunda was off book.

316
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:03,294
Off book?

317
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,507
Off book.

318
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:07,242
Means he worked for himself,
not just the cab company.

319
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,471
It also means he required

320
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:11,626
an illegal hack license.

321
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:13,194
Cause there's a lot of places

322
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,044
that cabdrivers won't go in the city,

323
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:17,972
so we let the gypsies work those areas,

324
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:19,480
service the public.

325
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:20,662
Everybody wins.

326
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:22,697
The dead cabdriver was not a gypsy.

327
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:24,464
What?

328
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,566
No, "gypsy" means a cabdriver

329
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,168
who works for himself off book.

330
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:30,332
It's also a great way to take advantage
of immigrants

331
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,706
desperate for work, isn't it?

332
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:35,046
Dude, look, all I know is that the guy
worked his ass off, okay?

333
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:36,795
He never invited me to his house,

334
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,225
so I don't know where he lives.

335
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,388
I just can't help you out.

336
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:41,889
Listen, dude,

337
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,713
every dispatcher knows

338
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,037
every driver

339
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:46,977
and everything about them, so...

340
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:52,216
I could have the Taxi Commission
come down here and talk to you guys

341
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:55,169
cause I know they'd like to meet
each and every one of you and...

342
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:57,007
- Wait.
- Look, okay,

343
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,023
the Burundi drivers,

344
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:00,821
they hang out at a little café.

345
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:02,753
on 18th Street, Northwest.

346
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:04,980
Little tip: lime juice.

347
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,829
It cuts that just-barfed-on
backseat smell,

348
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:09,075
smelly guy.

349
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:12,652
How long have you been in this country?

350
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:14,055
Why?

351
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,620
Well, you never heard of gypsy cabs?

352
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,075
You don't use contractions.
Assimilate already.

353
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:20,915
What are contraptions?

354
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,589
Never mind.

355
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:25,502
There's definitely a photo missing.

356
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:27,794
Any way to tell what was there?

357
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:30,716
Would I have you down
here to watch me fail?

358
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:36,066
Silver bromide particles
on any positive print leave

359
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:38,205
minute traces on any surface

360
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,224
when they're combined
with compression and heat,

361
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,422
like, say,

362
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:43,631
a wallet being sat on

363
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:46,196
for ten hours a day in a hot taxi.

364
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,105
Abby-cadabra,

365
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:50,396
your picture from the cadaver.

366
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:54,124
That's sad.

367
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,008
Why would they take the family photo?

368
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:58,445
More proof they got the right guy.
Any good news?

369
00:14:58,473 --> 00:15:00,153
Yes, the oil,

370
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:02,294
not from the taxi
but from the motorcycle.

371
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:05,570
I was able to determine the exact
viscosity and degradation,

372
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:07,612
and I found microscopic metal
shavings in it.

373
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:08,644
Trace the bike?

374
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:09,893
Well, not exactly.

375
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,644
Well, actually, not at all,

376
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,474
but if you find the motorcycle,

377
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:15,557
then I can positively place
it at the murder scene.

378
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,890
Unless they change the oil.

379
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:19,735
Unless they change the oil.

380
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:24,302
This is a gift for you.
It's decaf.

381
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:26,582
I sleep at night.

382
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:28,253
I actually eat food.

383
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:30,418
It is so weird, you've got to try it.

384
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:32,641
Abs.

385
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,648
Don't let that hurt your feelings.

386
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:54,686
You speak Burundi?

387
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:57,146
The official language
is Kirundi and French.

388
00:15:58,246 --> 00:15:59,746
But these people speak English.

389
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:02,305
They just don't want to speak
it with us.

390
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,339
NCIS.

391
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:07,402
Federal agents.

392
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:15,350
Looking for anybody who knows this man,

393
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:16,687
his family,

394
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:18,118
where he lives.

395
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:22,257
I take it this is the hack section.

396
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,054
I'm just guessing,

397
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,135
and your work visas are in order,

398
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:28,208
cause I hate paperwork, so...

399
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:29,727
how about a little help here?

400
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:31,544
May I see the photograph, please?

401
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,627
I know the man you're looking for,

402
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:40,242
but his name is not Nukunda.

403
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:43,547
You must forgive them.

404
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:45,290
Where they come from, agents

405
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,285
of the government seldom
bring good news.

406
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:49,432
Well, we have questions.

407
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:50,591
Even worse.

408
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:52,688
These are delicious.

409
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,432
Then I won't tell you
what they are made from.

410
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:00,814
Mr. Abaka,

411
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,030
you say you're a professor?

412
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,886
At Waverly University.

413
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:06,624
I teach African Studies there.

414
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:09,769
How long have you been in this country?

415
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:10,800
Seven years.

416
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,828
Same as our dead cabdriver.

417
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,874
The same as many people in here.

418
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:17,351
It was a time of unrest

419
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:19,340
and upheaval in the region.

420
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,191
Thousands of us came here

421
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,988
looking for freedom and safety.

422
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:25,093
It is unfortunate

423
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:28,526
that this man and his family
only found death.

424
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:31,035
Someone must know where his family is.

425
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:32,845
If they are in hiding, no.

426
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:36,150
What's his real name?

427
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:37,213
I don't know.

428
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,834
We keep secrets

429
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:42,300
because secrets keep us alive.

430
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,493
We don't put people in jail
for cooperating,

431
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,479
but we do put them in jail
for not cooperating.

432
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:50,083
I have been tortured in prison.

433
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:52,691
I am not afraid of your legal system.

434
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,084
How do you feel about deportation?

435
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:55,945
Tony.

436
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:58,246
I will ask,

437
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:00,738
but it is not

438
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:03,178
in their culture to cooperate
with the government.

439
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:04,474
They are too afraid.

440
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:11,037
He is lying about something.
He looked suspicious.

441
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,859
They all looked suspicious.

442
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:15,065
I'm surprised you could

443
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,370
understand him, Ziva.

444
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:18,491
He spoke perfect English.

445
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:22,398
You are xenophobic.

446
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:23,825
I am not Xena-phobic

447
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,447
it's one of my favorite shows.

448
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:26,751
Leather skirts,

449
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:28,749
lesbian sword fighting,
female empowerment.

450
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:31,223
Maybe I'm a little Ziva-phobic.

451
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:33,691
Do you see what I see?

452
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:35,496
A crazy Israeli chick with

453
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:36,662
impulse issues?

454
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,283
The reflection.

455
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:42,434
We could go ask him who he's calling.

456
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,260
Or we can have McGee ask for us.

457
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,635
Okay, triangulating all traffic

458
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,746
from the towers closest to Café Butu,

459
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,741
narrowing it down to all outgoing calls

460
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,258
the time Abaka made his call.

461
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,502
Less narration, McGee.

462
00:18:58,644 --> 00:18:59,744
Tracing.

463
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,204
Look at that.

464
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:04,267
It's incredible.

465
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,706
Probie's lips are still moving
while he's working.

466
00:19:08,642 --> 00:19:12,068
He's like one of those Romanian
orphans who can't stop rocking.

467
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,708
You are so prejudiced.

468
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:15,686
I am not.

469
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:17,864
I'm not.

470
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:20,148
By the way, that's a contraction: "I'm."

471
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:21,711
You should try it sometime.

472
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:23,044
Got it.

473
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,926
Beat my old record by two seconds.

474
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,796
Cell number is listed to Delphin

475
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,148
Abaka of Georgetown.

476
00:19:32,324 --> 00:19:33,330
Who'd he call?

477
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:37,450
The Wilmont Hotel, room 234.

478
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:40,309
Currently occupied by a Sayda Zuri.

479
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:41,814
African.

480
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:43,382
Accessing immigration files.

481
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:44,739
Probably Burundian.

482
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:46,373
Cabdriver's wife maybe?

483
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:50,225
She came through Customs
two days ago from

484
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,338
Burundi.

485
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:52,590
Restricted travel visa.

486
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,623
DiNozzo.

487
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,831
Picking her up, boss.

488
00:19:56,937 --> 00:19:57,943
Found her.

489
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:04,439
I have come to claim my husband's body.

490
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:08,887
His name is Thomas.

491
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,127
Thomas Zuri.

492
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:13,984
Did he change it when he got here?

493
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:15,434
Many times.

494
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,895
I don't know what he calls himself now,

495
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,203
but he'll always be Thomas to me.

496
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:24,268
You said he came from
Burundi seven years ago?

497
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:25,422
Yes.

498
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,718
But according to immigration records,

499
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,692
this is the first time
you have been here.

500
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:30,852
Why?

501
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,917
The situation in Burundi
is very complicated, Miss.

502
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:38,167
I have not been free to come before now,

503
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,142
but it seems I am too late.

504
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,367
I am sorry for your loss.

505
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:50,255
Who told you to come to us?

506
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:52,039
A friend called me.

507
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:54,302
Professor Abaka?

508
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:57,531
He has been helping me to try
and find Thomas.

509
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,141
We are soul mates,

510
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:03,682
Thomas and I.

511
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:09,125
Have you met your soul mate, miss?

512
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,506
You will know

513
00:21:16,063 --> 00:21:17,188
the minute you do.

514
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,525
Ziva.

515
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:23,324
Ready.

516
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:38,448
No,

517
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:41,380
this is not Thomas.

518
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:42,824
Yes, well, there's

519
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:44,859
- considerable swelling...
- May I see his body?

520
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:53,102
Thomas was tortured.

521
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,528
This man has no scars.

522
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:56,486
No.

523
00:21:57,298 --> 00:21:58,866
This is not my husband.

524
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:01,642
You gotta be kidding me.

525
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,767
$15,000?

526
00:22:04,002 --> 00:22:04,939
$25...

527
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:07,720
Something wrong, McGee?

528
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,453
Computer glitch.

529
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:13,717
Better?

530
00:22:14,303 --> 00:22:15,144
Much.

531
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:17,923
- Where's Ziva?
- Right behind you.

532
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:20,087
There have been 11 attacks on cabdrivers

533
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:22,686
in the past 60 days in the DC
and Maryland area.

534
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:25,495
- Three of them are very interesting.
- DiNozzo, put them up.

535
00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:27,687
All three were shot with
a nine-millimeter.

536
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:30,296
And all three autopsies
showed a tooth missing.

537
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,608
Enlarge the photos.

538
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:37,980
Come on. Tell me you just didn't lose
all that information.

539
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,027
McGee!

540
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,869
I hit the space bar.

541
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:44,163
Just push the buttons
I tell you to push, monkey.

542
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:45,884
Love is not treating you well,
my friend.

543
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:47,111
Yeah, no kidding.

544
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,160
Bring up our John Doe from the morgue.

545
00:22:57,196 --> 00:22:58,628
Anybody see what I see?

546
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,143
Black males.

547
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,562
All in their mid to late 40s.

548
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:02,920
All local cabdrivers.

549
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,845
None of them work
for the same company, though.

550
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:05,867
Vitals.

551
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,416
Similar age, similar height,
similar weight...

552
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,007
they all have shaved
heads and facial hair.

553
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,078
Bad guys don't know exactly
what their target looks like now.

554
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,658
They only have a general description.

555
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:18,841
Seven years.
Long time. People change.

556
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:21,162
Would explain the teeth
pulling and the videos.

557
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:23,240
DiNozzo. How many cabdrivers in DC

558
00:23:23,255 --> 00:23:24,629
fit this general description?

559
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:28,193
I'd say dozens.

560
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:38,969
Thomas was a storekeeper.

561
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:41,675
He had no interest in politics.

562
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:44,571
But his words were so eloquent,

563
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:45,900
so passionate,

564
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:49,054
that his message spread
from village to village.

565
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,757
He became a symbol of hope

566
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:53,458
against a system of injustice
and corruption.

567
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:56,748
Extremists saw him as a threat.

568
00:23:56,941 --> 00:23:58,808
Privately, many in the government

569
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:00,405
did not care if he died.

570
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:01,930
That was seven years ago.

571
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:03,522
What's changed?

572
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:06,133
There is a growing movement
against the old ways.

573
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:09,351
Some people are openly
calling for him to return

574
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:11,464
and lead the new people's party.

575
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:14,498
His enemies fear
he will do exactly that.

576
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,918
I have been told they have sent
people here to kill him.

577
00:24:18,932 --> 00:24:19,932
Came to warn him.

578
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:20,920
Yes.

579
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:23,027
How did your husband get here?

580
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:26,093
He was smuggled out of the country
by your embassy in Burundi.

581
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:27,567
Our government brought him here?

582
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:28,480
Yes.

583
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:31,348
You see, Thomas was pro-American.

584
00:24:31,924 --> 00:24:33,544
That is why the extremists hate him.

585
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,182
Why did you stay?

586
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:37,294
I could not leave my family, Miss.

587
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,493
My father was dying.

588
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:42,414
Thomas felt that if he left,

589
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:45,036
the extremists would no longer
be threatened by him.

590
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:46,618
He was right.

591
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,479
They left me alone.

592
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:53,931
A year after he left,

593
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:55,963
I received this.

594
00:24:58,937 --> 00:24:59,947
No postmark.

595
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,319
It was smuggled to me by the embassy.

596
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:05,680
He writes that he's working
in Washington,

597
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:07,252
driving a taxi.

598
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,430
That he misses me.

599
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:14,053
That he wants me to join him in America.

600
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,945
- And then?
- And then there was another civil war.

601
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:18,865
I never received another letter.

602
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:20,731
The embassy could no longer help me.

603
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,980
And now they have come for him.

604
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,696
I know men like these.

605
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:29,705
They will not stop until they are sure
my husband is dead.

606
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,343
We need something from you.

607
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:32,513
Anything.

608
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,798
The name of the embassy official

609
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:36,234
who helped him get away.

610
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:41,544
Are you aware that I no longer work
for the State Department, Director?

611
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:44,043
Mr. Choyce, are you aware
that the State Department

612
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:46,392
and NCIS are part
of the same government?

613
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,916
I doubt if there's anything
I can do to help you.

614
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:52,244
You smuggled Thomas Zuri
out of Burundi seven years ago.

615
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:54,259
You set him up in DC.

616
00:25:55,182 --> 00:25:56,832
Gave him a new identity.

617
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,499
Don't know what you're talking about.

618
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,350
Talking about saving a life.

619
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,365
Maybe several.

620
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:04,184
I wish I could help.

621
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:06,258
Sit down.
You're not done yet.

622
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:12,471
You're a consultant now

623
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:14,048
with an Asian-based oil company.

624
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:18,422
What do you think would happen
to your value in the private sector

625
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:21,519
if I were to call ZNN,
and tell them you refused to help us

626
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:24,211
solve a murder
of a United States Naval Officer?

627
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:25,829
An admiral.

628
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:27,027
Off the record.

629
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,027
Zuri walked away.

630
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,909
Happens all the time.

631
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,907
Once we get a political asset
into the country,

632
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:37,492
we hold onto them in case
we need them in the future.

633
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:39,828
Zuri was very helpful.

634
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:42,546
But often the assets don't
like the restrictions,

635
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,016
so they leave the program.

636
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,949
We have no control over that.

637
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:48,116
Zuri left.

638
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:50,499
That was five years ago.

639
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:52,497
How do we find him?

640
00:26:54,268 --> 00:26:55,761
Anything I tell you

641
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:58,799
is a violation of the agreement
we had with him.

642
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,043
I am sure he'll understand.

643
00:27:02,336 --> 00:27:03,827
I don't know where he is.

644
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:09,038
Last known address.

645
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:10,814
Look,

646
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:13,114
he changed his address often.

647
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:15,678
All I can give you is
where I know he lived

648
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,546
five years ago.

649
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:19,626
Do you understand?

650
00:27:19,746 --> 00:27:21,424
Stop laughing. It's not funny.

651
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:22,782
What's not funny, McGee?

652
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:25,564
- Nothing. Personal...
- Well, don't tell me about it.

653
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,775
I want you to visit the State
Department's strategic analysis unit.

654
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,207
Visit?

655
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,376
I'm going to need clearance.

656
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:34,765
- Visit.
- Visit.

657
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:36,541
Visit, that kind of visit.
Okay.

658
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:39,054
- What exactly am I looking for?
- Oil...

659
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,267
in Burundi.

660
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:43,688
- Don't think there's oil in Burundi.
- That's why I want you to look.

661
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,132
And run this.

662
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,416
Last known address for Thomas Zuri.

663
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:54,434
Okay, multitasking, boss.

664
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:57,066
Take my money, take my money.

665
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:59,217
Take my money.
Give me my candy.

666
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:04,761
You cannot buck the system, Tony.

667
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:07,194
Trade bucks with me?

668
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,858
If you stop forcing things,
they will come to you.

669
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:17,039
Thank you, <i>Obi-Wan</i>.

670
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:19,560
Why don't you like immigrants?

671
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:20,886
What?!

672
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,413
My great-grandparents came
through Ellis Island,

673
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:31,416
not the first-class lounge at El Al.

674
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:35,730
I came here in the jump seat
of a C1-30 with turbulence.

675
00:28:36,026 --> 00:28:37,521
Whatever.
My point is,

676
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:40,188
you're here on a weekend fun pass.
I'm the immigrant.

677
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,709
My family came here with nothing.

678
00:28:42,914 --> 00:28:44,463
Just loads of charm, talent...

679
00:28:44,602 --> 00:28:45,874
and great looks.

680
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:47,604
My great-grandfather

681
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:50,003
drove a truck for two dollars a day.

682
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,636
Took him 20 years to start
his own transportation company.

683
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:55,548
And now their great-grandson,
he's an NCIS agent.

684
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,147
So don't tell me
about the immigrant experience.

685
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:01,123
Until you are one.

686
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:02,745
Any of that true?

687
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:04,923
Parts.

688
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:08,296
Is this stuck to my teeth?

689
00:29:09,263 --> 00:29:10,471
Nothing sticks to you.

690
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:22,980
Do you ever think about soul mates?

691
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:25,062
They were on Decca, right?

692
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,290
Big hit, mid-'70s.

693
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,596
Sort of a disco thing?

694
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,673
Sing a few bar, I'll get it.

695
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:32,499
You'll never get it.

696
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,466
Boss.

697
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,034
- I did what you told me to do.
- You don't have to whisper.

698
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:41,380
I don't care who hears.

699
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:43,095
- You want me to tell you...
- Nope.

700
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:44,869
'Cause I can give you the short...

701
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,875
Forget I asked.

702
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:48,888
Classified satellite recon photos

703
00:29:49,008 --> 00:29:51,507
of a petroleum exploration firm
linked to China,

704
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,104
doing drilling in the Dajee region
of Burundi.

705
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,109
Find anything?

706
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,615
Considering the money they're poured
into the region I'd say yes.

707
00:29:57,616 --> 00:29:58,620
Oil.

708
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:01,338
Guess who still has top-level clearance
in the State Department?

709
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:03,660
Choyce.
Still working for them.

710
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:05,842
Not as an employee,
but as a consultant.

711
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:07,476
Plausible deniability.

712
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,225
You run that address Choyce gave us?

713
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,473
Yeah, construction site.
New condos.

714
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:13,704
Original building was demolished
two years ago.

715
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,297
Guess Zuri moved on,
found a new place to live.

716
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:18,625
Four drivers,
four different cab companies.

717
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:19,870
Nothing in common?

718
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,706
All attacked
at different times of the day.

719
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,642
Time of death of the first driver?

720
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,560
2:30 in the morning.

721
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:30,371
Which was 90 minutes
after he clocked out.

722
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:31,745
Second driver?

723
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:34,840
9:45 in the evening.

724
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:36,684
Two hours after he logged off.

725
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:38,955
None of them were {\officially}working
when they were attacked.

726
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:42,137
Boss, in two of the attacks,
the cabs had passengers.

727
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,904
In each case, including the admiral's,
the passengers called for a cab.

728
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:47,575
They didn't just hail it on the street.

729
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,309
Meaning someone had
to have dispatched it.

730
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,732
Even if they was off the records.

731
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:53,133
Meaning Bayliss,
the cab company dispatcher.

732
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:56,483
He was working
when every attack happened.

733
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,132
Probably used a bypass
to channel the calls.

734
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:01,812
Bayliss did not report to work today.

735
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,120
Address.

736
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,325
Yeah, got it.

737
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,854
NCIS!

738
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:19,167
Warrant!

739
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,405
Clear.

740
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:31,916
Clear.

741
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:34,853
DiNozzo. McGee.

742
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:45,165
Ziva, pick it.

743
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:46,416
No problem.

744
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,741
Fives and tens. Curb cash.

745
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,166
What's curb cash?

746
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,426
Fares.
Small denominations.

747
00:31:58,478 --> 00:32:00,136
- Street money.
- Kickbacks.

748
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:01,514
Lollipop for McLoverboy.

749
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:03,540
Those real?

750
00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:09,199
Fakes.

751
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:11,869
But they're really good fakes.
Guy's a regular cab coyote.

752
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,029
Is that like a wolf in sheep's clothing?

753
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,082
Coyote's a person who exploits people
who come to this country illegally.

754
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:19,697
As opposed to outsourcing,
which is what you are.

755
00:32:35,173 --> 00:32:36,195
That's Bayliss.

756
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:42,214
Attic space.
He must have been hiding.

757
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,236
Been shot.

758
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:46,416
Still warm, boss.

759
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,910
Boss, MPD shut down a 12-block perimeter
around Bayliss's apartment. Nothing.

760
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:09,931
Got a BOLO out on the Yamaha.

761
00:33:09,935 --> 00:33:10,935
Traffic cams?

762
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,485
Lost the bike after three blocks.
He took side streets.

763
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:15,131
How did they know about Bayliss?

764
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:17,834
McGee, Choyce's bank records
and personnel file from State.

765
00:33:18,106 --> 00:33:20,827
And find out who the hell
Choyce called after he left here.

766
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:22,262
- DiNozzo?
- Boss.

767
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:23,774
Bring him in.

768
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:28,109
Get Sayda.

769
00:33:34,474 --> 00:33:35,362
Yes?

770
00:33:36,888 --> 00:33:38,895
No, I told you I don't want
to give you her name.

771
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,874
I just want to cancel my credit cards.

772
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:42,053
<i>58, 59.</i>

773
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:43,045
60...

774
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:46,167
Well, why would you send the IRC
after me? I haven't done anything.

775
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:54,051
Did you know that it's 365 steps
from my lab to your desk?

776
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:58,286
Trying to get my blood pumping.

777
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,837
What's wrong with you?

778
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:01,051
Nothing.

779
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:04,594
Okay, this is the new, caffeine-free,
non-jittery Abby.

780
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:06,649
Still waters. Deep.

781
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,796
You're hiding something, and I seek it.

782
00:34:08,972 --> 00:34:09,801
Speak.

783
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,980
I've been seeing this girl.

784
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:15,685
That's nice.

785
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:17,903
No, actually, it's not nice.

786
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:19,813
She stole my mail,

787
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:23,247
and took out $65,000
in pre-approved credit cards in my name.

788
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,274
You have really good credit.

789
00:34:25,614 --> 00:34:27,081
FICO score's 750.

790
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:28,199
Well, was.

791
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:31,370
So, this is, like,
the best worst love story ever?

792
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:33,059
Abby, what do I do?

793
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:37,004
It's like I'm nuts for this girl,
you know, and she's just...

794
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,137
nuts.

795
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:40,646
She stole your heart,

796
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:42,085
she stole your money.

797
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:43,184
Arrest her.

798
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:44,992
That's the thing.
That's what she wants.

799
00:34:44,993 --> 00:34:46,903
She admitted everything to me.

800
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:53,495
That is a check for $65,000.

801
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:56,343
Yeah, her father's Earnest Leonard.
He's worth billions.

802
00:34:56,943 --> 00:34:58,351
She does this for fun.

803
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,184
She's been arrested twice.

804
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:02,736
She steals people's money,
she buys things.

805
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:04,398
The crazy ones are the best.

806
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:08,836
See, the weird thing is...

807
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,346
I kind of dig it, you know?

808
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:13,287
Love is never having to read her
her Miranda rights.

809
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:15,854
But she's going to do this
to somebody else.

810
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:18,234
Throw her psycho ass in the brig.

811
00:35:18,862 --> 00:35:19,999
I love you, McGee.

812
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:22,846
That should be enough.

813
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:27,439
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

814
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,773
Shall we try this again?

815
00:35:30,222 --> 00:35:31,534
Has something changed?

816
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:32,896
You might say that.

817
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:35,434
Recognize these?

818
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:39,297
My banking details.
This is outrageous.

819
00:35:39,298 --> 00:35:40,550
How did you get these?

820
00:35:40,551 --> 00:35:42,371
Warrant, and this is what we found.

821
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:44,982
Two deposits.
One for $100,000.

822
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:47,205
The second for $150.000.

823
00:35:47,206 --> 00:35:48,833
From a bank in Burundi.

824
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,742
Now, we're still following

825
00:35:50,743 --> 00:35:53,541
the paper trail, but I think
we all know where it's going to take us,

826
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,658
don't we, Mr. Choyce?

827
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,271
To Burundi political extremists.

828
00:35:58,558 --> 00:35:59,950
With well-oiled pockets.

829
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:02,968
You sold them information about Zuri.

830
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,617
I want a deal
before I say anything else.

831
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:08,871
First the truth.

832
00:36:09,143 --> 00:36:11,437
- Then a deal.
- Look, I didn't sell them

833
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:12,866
anything useful.

834
00:36:13,022 --> 00:36:14,838
It was information from years ago.

835
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:17,384
Old addresses and phone numbers,
that's all.

836
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:19,567
He was paranoid!

837
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:21,747
He moved six times in the first year!

838
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:23,339
There's no way they could find him!

839
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,923
Was one of these old phone numbers

840
00:36:24,924 --> 00:36:27,642
used by a taxi dispatcher named Bayliss?

841
00:36:28,172 --> 00:36:32,108
Zuri only drove cabs for a couple
of months years ago.

842
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,257
Then he quit.

843
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:36,599
Wrong. He went gypsy, off the books.

844
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:39,090
You gave them Bayliss's name.

845
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:40,846
Bayliss is dead.

846
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:43,447
Got to believe he told them
where to find Zuri.

847
00:36:43,927 --> 00:36:45,122
My God.

848
00:36:45,264 --> 00:36:47,414
How did you communicate with them?

849
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:48,870
They contacted me.

850
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:50,239
By phone?

851
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:52,372
Pre-paid cell.
They called me.

852
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,247
Non-traceable.

853
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:55,370
I tried.

854
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:56,528
Name.

855
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:02,897
Tie him to Burundi terrorism.

856
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:04,241
Send him to Gitmo.

857
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:06,091
No lawyer, no phone.

858
00:37:07,213 --> 00:37:09,898
- Good luck with that deal.
- Delphin Abaka.

859
00:37:13,255 --> 00:37:14,374
Delphin Abaka.

860
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:16,759
No luck, boss.

861
00:37:16,836 --> 00:37:17,983
Abaka's off the grid.

862
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,251
He's a damn teacher at a university,
McGee.

863
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:23,423
Also served in the Burundi army
20 years ago

864
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:25,355
and hasn't been teaching
since last semester.

865
00:37:25,406 --> 00:37:27,933
Guess when he realized we were
involved, he tried to use Sayda

866
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:29,743
to find out what we knew.

867
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,662
We probably know less than he does.

868
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:34,284
The DMV needs a thumbprint
to get a driver's license.

869
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,561
Means Zuri's in the system.

870
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:39,344
If we can match his prints
to DMV records,

871
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:40,867
we can get his current alias

872
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:42,581
- and an address.
- That's a nice try.

873
00:37:42,591 --> 00:37:45,206
If Zuri's still out there, he's got
his fake hack license with him.

874
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:46,724
I'm sorry, boss.
I already looked.

875
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:48,860
I think I know
where we can get a fingerprint.

876
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:50,433
Sayda's locket.

877
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:54,586
Scanning.

878
00:37:59,288 --> 00:38:00,839
Let's see what we got.

879
00:38:02,662 --> 00:38:04,745
It's a partial right thumb.

880
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,834
Degraded by age, but...

881
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:09,616
I have enough whirls and deltas
to get eight points.

882
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:11,677
How long is this going to take, madam?

883
00:38:12,043 --> 00:38:14,371
- You know what? It's hard to tell.
- Tell, Abby.

884
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,457
Somebody needs to switch to decaf.

885
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:18,409
Could be seconds, could be hours

886
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,305
if he used his other thumb
for his driver's license.

887
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:26,321
He's not in the DC system,
or Virginia or Maryland.

888
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:27,977
Do you want me to run all 50 states?

889
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:33,557
It's getting really late.

890
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:35,294
Not that I'm...

891
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:38,036
tired or anything from a lack
of caffeine, 'cause I'm not.

892
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:39,464
At all. Really.

893
00:38:40,715 --> 00:38:43,976
My meter is running full blast, Gibbs.

894
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:52,687
Relax, Abs.

895
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:54,592
I think you just solved the case.

896
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:56,807
I did?

897
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:58,512
Meters.

898
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:00,778
A form of measurement
used extensively in Europe.

899
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,357
Taxi meters, DiNozzo.

900
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,050
Bayliss keep meter records
for gypsy drivers?

901
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:07,924
Sure. Without records, he wouldn't
be able to keep track of kickbacks.

902
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:09,182
Bayliss's laptop.

903
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:12,319
Every driver who hasn't reported
to work for the past 72 hours.

904
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,655
I'm only interested in meters
that are not running.

905
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:17,887
I don't follow.
But I'm willing to give it a try.

906
00:39:18,658 --> 00:39:19,661
I get it.

907
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:22,836
Zuri heard about other cabdrivers being
attacked. He knows they're after him.

908
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:25,281
So he would have stopped driving
after the first attack.

909
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:26,365
Put it up.

910
00:39:26,384 --> 00:39:28,658
Dumping all females,
non-African-Americans,

911
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:30,706
everyone over 50 and under 30.

912
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,210
Match the rest
against our victims' stats.

913
00:39:35,779 --> 00:39:36,993
Five left, boss.

914
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:39,105
Sayda?

915
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,298
That is Thomas.

916
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,619
That is my husband.

917
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:47,641
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

918
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:50,221
- Give me the address, McGee.
- I want to come with you.

919
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,436
I want to see him.
Please.

920
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:55,406
Please.

921
00:40:09,756 --> 00:40:11,689
Yamaha's on the side.
Engine's still hot.

922
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,124
McGee, you're out front.
DiNozzo, you're with us.

923
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,742
<i>I will not have a...</i>

924
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:19,272
<i>to ruin my country...</i>

925
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:21,204
<i>It's time for you to die.</i>

926
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:24,393
If you're going to do this, do it,
but do not harm my wife.

927
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:27,116
Shut up, shopkeeper.
Be still.

928
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:29,682
<i>Be still,
or she will end up dead like you.</i>

929
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,193
<i>If you think I would let you return
to my country, you are wrong...</i>

930
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,873
NCIS!
Drop your weapons!

931
00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:53,340
You.

932
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,061
Hello again, Professor Abaka.

933
00:40:59,142 --> 00:41:00,169
Thomas Zuri?

934
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,203
Yes.

935
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:02,731
You're a hard man to find.

936
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:04,994
Perhaps...

937
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,324
not hard enough.

938
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:09,966
My wife...

939
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:27,025
- He is okay.
- Thank you.

940
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:31,719
Seven years is a long time.

941
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:34,517
Thomas.

942
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:37,326
Sayda.

943
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,835
I have missed you so much.

944
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:44,560
You have been in my heart every moment.

945
00:41:45,645 --> 00:41:46,513
Sayda.

946
00:41:50,924 --> 00:41:51,928
I wrote to you.

947
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,901
So many letters. Hundreds.

948
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,164
But I just received one letter, Thomas.

949
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:01,260
And then I heard that the army had...

950
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:04,117
- killed everyone in our village.
- I survived.

951
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,765
We both survived.

952
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:16,901
I thought...

953
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:19,781
I would never see you again.

954
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:28,252
I'm so sorry, Sayda.

955
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,053
I am so very sorry.

956
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:41,466
It's okay, Thomas.

957
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:47,255
I understand.

958
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:55,072
I am just glad you are safe.

959
00:42:59,565 --> 00:43:00,375
Sayda.

960
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:09,820
Sayda.

961
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:22,183
Let's go in.
