1
00:00:03,126 --> 00:00:06,417
It's a great neighborhood.
Very quiet, very private.

2
00:00:06,418 --> 00:00:09,214
There's an oversized
backyard, that's a big plus.

3
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:12,100
Whole house has been newly renovated.
There are upgrades all over the place.

4
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:15,734
Stainless appliances,
air purification system,

5
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:18,492
total move-in condition.

6
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:23,246
The furniture is rented, but if you like
it,I can have the company make you a deal.

7
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,301
Amy, you are going to love the kitchen,

8
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,602
but first I'm going to show
you guys the living room.

9
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:33,169
It has a wall-mounted flat
screen and a gas log fireplace.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,354
You won't believe how easy this is.

11
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:38,000
One push of a button...

12
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,316
Isn't that cozy?

39
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:42,056
Make sure you capture
the back of his head, too.

40
00:01:42,057 --> 00:01:44,421
- If you would be so kind.
- You got it.

41
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:46,034
-Sorry.
- Sorry.

42
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:47,786
There's no rush, gentlemen.

43
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:50,721
Our patient isn't going anywhere.

44
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,595
I don't know, Ducky,
the old Gibbs is back.

45
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:56,319
The old Gibbs?

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
McGee, over here.

47
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,675
Hands and knees. On the floor.

48
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:02,736
Okay, um...

49
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:04,826
You're not going to step on me, are you?

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,331
Footprints.

51
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:09,261
Footprints...

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,136
It's a pretty tight weave.

53
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:14,371
Looks like sisal.

54
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:17,649
It's a naturally stiff fiber woven
from the leaf of a cactus plant.

55
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,286
It doesn't mat, trap dust, build static.

56
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:21,884
Makes it ideal for carpeting.

57
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:25,500
Personally, I prefer a good shag.

58
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:31,805
From a criminal-investigative
standpoint.

59
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:33,396
I don't see any dirty footprints.

60
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:36,173
I think it's safe to
assume that our friend

61
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:39,300
didn't stroll in here on his own.

62
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:43,552
You look happy to see me, boss.

63
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,687
Oh, the coffee.

64
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:50,921
Ran the military ID our
local LEO's got off the body.

65
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:53,708
Lance Corporal James Finn.
Stationed at Quantico.

66
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,477
Went UA when his unit was
shipped to Iraq six months ago.

67
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:59,104
Looks like he's got a pretty
good reason for not showing.

68
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:00,601
Find out where he was buried.

69
00:03:00,602 --> 00:03:02,014
DUCKY: It won't be far, McGee.

70
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,726
Had the trip been longer, some
bits would have fallen off.

71
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,463
Okay, I'll check the backyard.

72
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,386
Scene's not going to sketch itself.

73
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,325
Ow!

74
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,372
Perhaps it would be better if you
fetched the gurney, Mr. Palmer.

75
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:19,481
I've seen all I need to see here.

76
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:20,728
Yes, Doctor.

77
00:03:24,793 --> 00:03:26,243
It's a tidy crime scene.

78
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:27,118
Quite.

79
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,040
It appears to be a body drop.

80
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,283
A tertiary crime scene,

81
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:32,900
or quaternary, or
quinary... I could go on.

82
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:34,713
Oh, you did.

83
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:38,456
It's an odd decorating choice.

84
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:41,413
Although the corpse does give
the place a certain lived-in look.

85
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:44,873
You can see he brushed
the dirt off his face.

86
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:48,400
Oh, geez!

87
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,666
Hello.

88
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,452
Sorry...

89
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:52,600
<i>Nicrophorus americanus.</i>

90
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:55,542
Also known as "the carrion beetle."

91
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:58,469
In here, you little monkey.

92
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,429
Yes.

93
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,485
A reminder that
Shakespeare got it wrong.

94
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:07,930
We are not food for worms. It's the
flies and beetles that feast upon us.

95
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,190
I'm more interested in why
someone did this, Doctor.

96
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:13,815
Then I'll have to research
the predatory, manipulative,

97
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,198
grandiose nature of this behavior.

98
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,081
But my first impression is that
we're dealing with a complete loon.

99
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,376
That Masters in psych is
starting to pay off, Ducky.

100
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,092
Merciful God in Heaven.

101
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,892
I have seen a lot of
things selling real estate,

102
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,472
but can you imagine
walking in, seeing that?

103
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:33,025
When was the last time you were here?

104
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:35,446
Yesterday morning. First showing.

105
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:37,179
And everything was normal?

106
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,460
There was no rotting corpsein the
living room, if that's what you mean.

107
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:42,053
Who else had access?

108
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:44,012
A couple of dozen real estate women.

109
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:46,649
The keys are in a lock
box on the front door.

110
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,337
Who's the owner?

111
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:49,365
A local contractor...

112
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:50,721
...and me.

113
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,726
Uh, I buy and Bob fixes.
We split the profits.

114
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:54,499
Bob?

115
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,612
Robert Whitehead, the contractor.

116
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,346
A number where he can be reached?

117
00:04:58,347 --> 00:04:59,414
Yeah.

118
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,276
So who put the body here, you or Bob?

119
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,184
Neither of us.

120
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:07,197
Though it is an empty house. If you're
looking to ditch a body, that's a real plus.

121
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:08,458
Jody.

122
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:10,502
I came as fast as I could. You okay?

123
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:11,829
That's my husband I called him.

124
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,813
Just...

125
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:14,684
... duck under the tape, Rick.

126
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:15,756
Stop.

127
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:17,282
It's a crime scene.

128
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,616
- Crime scene? Honey, you all right?
- She's fine.

129
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:23,257
I am not fine. I had to
cancel my 1:00 showing.

130
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,352
<i>MCGEE: Think I found
where he was buried.</i>

131
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:28,779
Checked for footprints, but it rained last
night, so everything's pretty washed out.

132
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,571
You got access?

133
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:31,596
There's side access at street level.

134
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,665
Chain link fence around the yard, but
any one with gloves could have scaled it.

135
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,214
Wait for me!

136
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,939
The real estate agent
solve the big mystery?

137
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,424
No, but she owns the
property with a contractor

138
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,164
and every real estate
agent in town had access.

139
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:47,988
I meant the mystery of how they
expect to sell a house for 600 grand

140
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:50,257
when it only has two
and a half bathrooms.

141
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:53,147
Well, you know what they
say: location, location...

142
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,777
location.

143
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:57,603
So, judging from the
marks around the edges,

144
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,806
looks like the digger
used a garden spade.

145
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:04,254
The soil's not real packed, so it would have
been easy digging for a male or a female.

146
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:05,240
You see that?

147
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,671
Black plastic bags.

148
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:07,555
Garbage bags.

149
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:09,038
Body bag.

150
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:11,163
Get it back to Abby, and a soil sample.

151
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,961
I want ground-penetrating radar.

152
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:16,300
Uh, boss, those techs are
booked weeks in advance.

153
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,997
I'm going to tell them it's an emergency
and I will not budge until they show.

154
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:21,645
- Who's staying with McGee?
- I can.

155
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:23,754
If you want Tony to check out
the other real estate women.

156
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:24,611
Fine with me.

157
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:27,000
Tony, stay with McGee.

158
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:31,527
You shouldn't have licked
your chops like a hungry wolf.

159
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:43,520
Much better.

160
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:45,496
Before I smelled like dirt and sweat.

161
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:47,475
Now I smell like dirt, sweat...

162
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:49,193
and sandalwood.

163
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:50,431
ZIVA: Good morning.

164
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:51,854
What are you doing at my desk?

165
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:53,567
Couldn't find my
deodorant, so I used yours.

166
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:54,735
No, you didn't.

167
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:56,308
Yeah, we're partners.
What's the big deal?

168
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:57,782
A hair!

169
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,195
TONY: Come on, you attach
electrodes to men's testicles.

170
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:03,003
You getting squeamish about a hair?

171
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,114
I'm not going to feel bad.

172
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,770
Those ground radar techs
didn't show till dawn.

173
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:09,232
McGee and I watched
the sunrise together.

174
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,700
<i>It was very Brokeback Mountain.</i>

175
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,547
He had me at "howdy."

176
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:14,927
How romantic.I'm sorry I missed it.

177
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:17,565
Well, I can show it
to you on my new phone

178
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,087
it takes video.

179
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,672
Behold the majesty of the sun.

180
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,200
ZIVA: On a two-inch screen?

181
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,400
Are we all getting those?

182
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,202
Nope. I bought it.

183
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:28,483
Expensive?

184
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,074
Not really.

185
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:32,034
Yeah, really.

186
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,737
You've been dropping a
lot of cash lately, McGee.

187
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:36,373
New phone, new watch,
new teeth. What's up?

188
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:37,692
GIBBS: Ducky matched the dental records.

189
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:40,367
The body downstairs
is Lance Corporal Finn.

190
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:42,200
Ziva, when did you...?

191
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:43,652
McGee...

192
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:46,598
... how long does it take
to put on a clean shirt?

193
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,601
Ten seconds.

194
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:49,809
With buttons, a little longer.

195
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:52,906
Rhetorical question.

196
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,051
Contractor's off the hook.

197
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:55,400
He's been out of town for a week.

198
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:57,458
Going to check on the real
estate agents this morning.

199
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,588
That's all you did?

200
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,452
No. While you and McGee
were watching the sunrise,

201
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:03,959
I was pulling Lance Corporal Finn's SRB.

202
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,303
And I would have to say it was spotty.

203
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:08,368
He was Unc' on the range
and failed his swim qual.

204
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:09,965
So they made him a supply clerk.

205
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,886
Right. Six months ago, he signed out

206
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:14,004
on a three-day pass
before deploying to Iraq

207
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:15,247
and never returned home.

208
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:17,568
- Get me his C.O.
- He's in Iraq.

209
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:20,824
I'll contact MTAC.

210
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:23,099
I put in a request for
Finn's bank records,

211
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,036
earning statements and medical records.

212
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,219
TONY: Night wasn't a total loss.

213
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,834
ground radar picked up a shovel
about ten feet from the gravesite.

214
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,502
Already sent it to Abby.

215
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,183
Yep !

216
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,339
The old Gibbs is back.

217
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,222
GIBBS: You see something, Abs?

218
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,714
Beauty.

219
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:41,204
I mean, it's tragic, but if you
were to see this tableau in a museum,

220
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:44,007
you'd swear it was a brilliant
commentary on the human condition.

221
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,283
What? Corpse staring at a TV set?

222
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:49,674
- It says it all.
- Well, it doesn't say who put him there or why.

223
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:51,475
That's for us to find out.

224
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,675
You shaved your mustache.

225
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,996
I liked you with a
little hair on your face.

226
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:58,528
Still got my eyebrows. Good point.

227
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:01,573
I found Finn's blood, hair and
fingerprints on the plastic.

228
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,869
So he was probably wrapped in it.

229
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,252
But I didn't find any other prints
on the plastic or the shovel.

230
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:09,493
No chance of grabbing the
gravedigger's sweat off the handle?

231
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:11,978
After being underground, it's unlikely.

232
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,538
Strange case, huh?

233
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:16,357
I had this friend once that used to
display roadkill in his living room.

234
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:18,708
- He had an NEA grant...
- Abby.

235
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,037
Um, next I analyzed the soil.

236
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:23,832
It's compost material.

237
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,972
Rocks and small sticks.

238
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:27,366
Nothing's over an inch long.

239
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,424
It would indicate that it was
processed through a screen.

240
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:31,330
Pretty clean for dirt.

241
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:32,641
It's a commercial product.

242
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:35,490
But the house was just
re-landscaped, so it's not surprising.

243
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,871
I sent the acidity levels to Ducky.

244
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:40,449
I then inventoried
Finn's personal items.

245
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,548
Got anything with a date on it?

246
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:42,671
Nope. Sorry.

247
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:45,927
No credit card or purchase
receipts. I guess he was a cash guy.

248
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:49,974
I mean if you can call a
guy with $31.71 a cash guy.

249
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:52,739
His clothes were Dockers
from Sears. No judgments.

250
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,151
The shirt is a large,
the shoes are off-brand.

251
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:57,210
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.

252
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:58,921
Like you wear, Gibbs.

253
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,205
You're fishin', Ab

254
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,827
Are they regular boxers?

255
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:05,051
Trunks? Bikinis?

256
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:06,355
Nothing?

257
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:08,931
Mr. Palmer,

258
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:13,169
have you finished the chromatographic
analysis of his volatile  fatty acid?

259
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,042
Yes, Doctor.

260
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:15,030
Well, let's ...

261
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,583
...plug the numbers into the computer

262
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:20,697
and let's how long our friend
has been leaking into the topsoil.

263
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:23,266
Agent Gibbs will be here
soon and he will ask...

264
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,241
How'd the lance corporal die, Doctor?

265
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:27,758
"How he died" may take me a while.

266
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,221
Try, "When did he die?"

267
00:10:29,222 --> 00:10:30,639
That's my next question.

268
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,900
That, I can answer.

269
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,103
It's....a.........

270
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:36,777
... tricky calculation.

271
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:40,785
One has to factor in temperature,
soil acidity, and the ...

272
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:42,518
...variety and volume of insects

273
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,428
who now call Lance
Corporal Finn their home.

274
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,776
Give me a round number.

275
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:49,648
92 days, with a
three-percent margin of error.

276
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:57,711
It would appear you
deserted before you died.

277
00:10:57,832 --> 00:11:00,190
Gibbs, Lance Corporal
Finn's fiancée's upstairs.

278
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:03,039
She saw a report on the
local news last night.

279
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,995
How, Doctor?

280
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,108
As soon as I know, you'll know.

281
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:11,614
Her name is Siri Albert.
She's 25, lives in Manassas,

282
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:12,734
and works as a physical therapist.

283
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:15,101
- Finn's fiancée is here. I put her in the conference room.
- You did?

284
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,088
I did.

285
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,106
No, I did.

286
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:18,229
His fiancée?

287
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,722
Yeah, his fiancée.

288
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:20,528
Tall ?

289
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:21,772
Like brown hair ?

290
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:22,910
Red hair.

291
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:40,202
Someone has made a huge mistake.

292
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:43,774
James isn't dead. He's been
writing me letters from Iraq.

293
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:44,746
It's a common name.

294
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:47,836
The news said he was born
in Jackson, Pennsylvania.

295
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,252
It's a small town.

296
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,196
That James Finn has
been dead three months.

297
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:53,299
He left for Iraq three months ago.

298
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,507
I saw him the morning he went away.

299
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,603
And I just got a letter
from him last week.

300
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:03,208
He says he misses me
and he's working a lot.

301
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:04,052
We'll need those.

302
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:06,615
Okay, but I want them back.

303
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,034
It's his handwriting. I recognize it.

304
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,420
They've been coming for months.

305
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:12,236
Now I want to know who
that other woman is.

306
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:13,675
We're not here to talk about that.

307
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:16,592
Is she saying that she's
engaged to Jimmy, too?

308
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:21,008
'Cause if that's true, he better
hope he's dead, or else I'll kill him.

309
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:25,778
James and I connected on
a deep, spiritual level.

310
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,305
From then on, any time he
was in town, he was with me.

311
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:30,616
How often did you see him?

312
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,215
He would come and go a
lot. But I understood.

313
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:35,483
That's how it is with Special Ops.

314
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:39,289
Lance Corporal Finn's record does not indicate
he was involved with Special Operations.

315
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,474
He said his missions were top secret.

316
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:45,732
He wanted to tell me more, but he
didn't want to put me in danger.

317
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,819
When'd you last see Lance Corporal Finn?

318
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,040
Six months ago.

319
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,299
Before he left for Iraq.

320
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,391
How'd you meet?

321
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,650
At a bar.

322
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,712
Two years ago.

323
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,197
I was there with some girlfriends,

324
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:57,601
and when I got up to
go to the ladies' room,

325
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:00,100
he blocked my path,

326
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:02,024
said he couldn't keep his eyes off me.

327
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,162
And that worked?

328
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:04,458
What worked...

329
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,252
... is that when we talked, ...

330
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,518
...he had something to say.

331
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,600
Most guys won't shut up
about their online war games,

332
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,056
but this guy, he had seen real action.

333
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:14,503
And I was...

334
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:16,349
... feeling patriotic that night,...

335
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,761
... so I invited him
to come home with me.

336
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,173
The sex was fantastic.

337
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,122
When did you two get engaged?

338
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,141
About a week before he left.

339
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:29,371
James wanted to borrow $30,000.

340
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:30,999
Did he tell you what the money was for?

341
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,499
Gambling debts.

342
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,392
And if he didn't pay,
they were gonna hurt him.

343
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:36,265
Who?

344
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:38,361
He said it was better if I didn't know.

345
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,500
Because of the danger.

346
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:43,560
Look, I didn't give him the money.

347
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:45,226
I loaned it to him.

348
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:47,600
So you drew up a legal document?

349
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:49,438
No.

350
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,820
But we had an oral agreement.

351
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,892
I mean, he promised to pay me back.

352
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,444
With interest.

353
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,757
I mean, I maxed out all of my cards,

354
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,920
so you better find that money.

355
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,143
What was he like the
last time you saw him?

356
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,087
He was sweet.

357
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,825
We made love right before he left.

358
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:11,114
He use a condom?

359
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,907
I'm on the pill.

360
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:19,712
We were engaged.

361
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:25,039
Abs, can DNA still be recovered
from Lance Corporal Finn's skivvies?

362
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,069
It would take the cooperation
of weather and protection.

363
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,804
He was wrapped in
plastic and it's been cold

364
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:32,477
, so there's a decent chance.

365
00:14:32,478 --> 00:14:33,525
Well, run the tests.

366
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:35,243
We'll do a cheek swab on his fiancées.

367
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:37,602
Wait, did you say "fiancées?"

368
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:38,921
Like plural?

369
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:42,575
Huh. Kinky.

370
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:46,200
Is that it?

371
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,248
For now, Siri.

372
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,545
I need to follow you home
and pick up his belongings.

373
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:52,575
I want them back when James returns.

374
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:55,281
He's dead.

375
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:57,685
He can't return.

376
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,262
LookI know he's not dead.

377
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:03,329
I would feel it in my
heart. We're soul mates.

378
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,124
No.

379
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:22,393
Agent Lee.

380
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:25,521
I need legal help. We have a
suspect who's refusing a cheek swab.

381
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,653
I'll file for a DNA search
warrant. What's the name?

382
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:29,952
Rebecca Kemp.I'll e-mail you the info.

383
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:31,127
Listen...

384
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:32,566
you miss working with us?

385
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,483
I think the legal
department is more my speed.

386
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,292
Why, do you miss me?

387
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:39,000
Uh, sure.

388
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:39,801
Boss...

389
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:42,221
Agent Lee is getting us our cheek swab.

390
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,650
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?

391
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:47,398
Might just be angry.

392
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,722
At Finn, us, the world.

393
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:51,765
Go back with her to her
apartment, get Finn's stuff.

394
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:54,200
And, no, I don't want to
wait for a search warrant.

395
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:02,210
- I'll grab my coat .Wait at the elevator.
- Okay.

396
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,284
Hey, you.

397
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:07,552
Where's my money? Yeah, you.

398
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:09,263
Did you and Jimmy spend it?

399
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:11,395
Please get away from
me. I don't know you.

400
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,134
I am Jimmy's fiancee.

401
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:14,772
James loved me.

402
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:15,901
He used you.

403
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:17,431
You liar!

404
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:18,967
Chick fight!

405
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,700
He loved me!

406
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,316
Get off of me!

407
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,042
Stop it!

408
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,420
Hey! Get off her! Get off her!

409
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:39,572
Get up.

410
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:49,588
How'd this guy die, Doctor?

411
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,858
As I told you, when I know, you'll know.

412
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:54,418
Know faster.

413
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,399
Shaving off your moustache has
brought back your usual impatience.

414
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,311
Good. Means I'm doing my job.

415
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,678
I do have a potential cause of death.

416
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,840
But it's by no means airtight.

417
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,204
See this fracture?

418
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:08,857
Well, yeah, you're pointing right at it.

419
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:11,562
The brain revealed
an epidural hematoma,

420
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,416
verified by this CAT scan.

421
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:14,870
Though it's far from massive.

422
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:18,932
Statistically, it's only
fatal in about 17% of cases.

423
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:19,919
Blunt-force trauma?

424
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,906
Most likely.

425
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,568
We're looking at a
baseball bat or a golf club,

426
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,680
perhaps wielded by a
disgruntled fiancée.

427
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,391
You tell me how;

428
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:31,500
I'll figure out who.

429
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:38,399
Intelligence has placed
La Grenouille in Nairobi.

430
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
That might mean a shipment to Somalia.

431
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:45,442
We'll continue to monitor these
activities. Just do your best.

432
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:47,099
Mission trouble?

433
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,547
It's need-to-know.

434
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:52,692
Initiate the video conference
Special Agent Gibbs requested.

435
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:56,022
Have you figured out why
somebody would unbury a body?

436
00:17:56,023 --> 00:17:57,492
That's need-to-know.

437
00:17:57,892 --> 00:17:59,999
You can't pull that one with me, Jethro.

438
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,463
I'm your boss.

439
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:03,408
Iraq standing by, ma'am.

440
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,997
I got your e-mail concerning Lance Corporal
Finn. I assume you've been over his SRB.

441
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:09,172
Yeah, we have, Skipper.

442
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,275
We'd like to know
what's not on the record.

443
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:14,304
Finn wasn't one of my stronger
Marines. Wasn't surprised he went UA.

444
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:16,037
He have any enemies in the company?

445
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:19,428
He was well-liked. Played poker.
Not well, but covered his debts.

446
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:23,987
Liked to talk about his sexual exploits
in detail. You know how marines love that.

447
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:28,078
How does a dead marine, stateside,
send letters home from Iraq ?

448
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,435
Wondered about that myself.

449
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:30,189
Get over here, marine.

450
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,078
Sir.

451
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:35,012
Meet Lance Corporal Hagan,
soon to be Private Hagan.

452
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,702
Before deployment, Finn gave him...

453
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:41,357
...a couple hundred bucks to pop
letters in the mail to two women.

454
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:43,271
The first batch started six months ago.

455
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:44,529
The second, three months later.

456
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,896
Got enough to last the
rest of our deployment.

457
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:48,011
Gonna need those.

458
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:49,752
Send 'em on the next flight out.

459
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:54,337
Two fiancées...

460
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:55,874
That a marine thing?

461
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:59,863
That's need-to-know,
too, Director.

462
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:04,920
- Do you see it yet?
- No.

463
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:06,162
Keep looking.

464
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:08,085
Abby, I've been staring at
this thing for five minutes.

465
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:10,571
I don't see anything that
I would consider to be art.

466
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:11,822
But you took the picture.

467
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:13,978
Just because Ducky told me to.

468
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:14,784
I'm sorry.

469
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:15,899
That's okay.

470
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,964
I'm sure you find
other things beautiful.

471
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:19,886
Like Gibbs breaking up a chick fight.

472
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:22,169
I can't believe I missed that.

473
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,450
Well, I've got good news.

474
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:25,793
Guess what is now playing on McGee TV.

475
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:27,964
I hug and kiss technology.

476
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:30,677
You liar!

477
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:34,053
Mee-yow.

478
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:35,070
Which one's Siri?

479
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:37,278
The one that Gibbs is
pulling off the other girl.

480
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,780
It's always good to have a face
to put with genetic material.

481
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:41,672
You get a match on her
off Finn's clothing?

482
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:43,374
Yeah. But not just her.

483
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,700
There was a party in Finn's pants.

484
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:48,898
I found genetic material
from two distinct females.

485
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:49,841
Siri and...?

486
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:51,588
A mystery woman.

487
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,097
That would explain why
Rebecca refused the cheek swab.

488
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:56,584
Told us she hadn't
seen him in six months.

489
00:19:56,585 --> 00:19:57,800
Play it again.

490
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,563
Plus, Rebecca's got
a lot of anger in her.

491
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:02,808
Oh, I wouldn't assume Siri is innocent.

492
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:03,682
Why not?

493
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,046
Look at the fight.

494
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:06,719
Siri initiates it.

495
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,980
She may not be as sweet as she looks.

496
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,165
This is my favorite part.

497
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,439
Which part?

498
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:17,463
I was lucky to get out of
Rebecca's apartment alive.

499
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,133
She threw this at my head.

500
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,791
Wow. Finn was reading Moby Dick?

501
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,783
No, she was throwing it. I
took it so she couldn't re-arm.

502
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,210
Okay, let's see what
he had at Siri's place.

503
00:20:26,211 --> 00:20:29,020
-Razor and a toothbrush.
-Razor and a toothbrush.

504
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,814
Three pairs of white underwear.

505
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:33,527
Three pairs... pinkish underwear.

506
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,102
One black sock with a gold toe.

507
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,665
Don't you hate it when you leave
one black sock at one fiancee's house

508
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,081
and the other one at the other's house?

509
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:40,738
One pair of blue jeans.

510
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,587
And one black mesh T-shirt.

511
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:44,936
Do women really like these?

512
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:46,134
Depends on who's wearing it.

513
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:47,890
-So if I...
-No.

514
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:50,015
Not much to go on.

515
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:53,000
Only one place left to check.

516
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,637
Ha, ha.

517
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,169
Tony just put his hand
in another man's pocket

518
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,729
and it made him very happy.

519
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,198
I found a pre-paid calling card.

520
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,072
That's it?

521
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:02,562
Yes.

522
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,099
No engagement rings?

523
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:05,592
You want those, too?

524
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:10,136
I'll go to Siri's and get the ring and
any other gifts Finn might've given her.

525
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:12,096
McGee, you've got Rebecca.

526
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,487
How could they have been so clueless?

527
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:18,700
Well, he's dead, so maybe they weren't.

528
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:21,817
Officer David.

529
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:23,211
This is Jody Carvell.

530
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:25,366
I am standing outside
of the Larson Lane house.

531
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,431
Are you aware that the
police tape is still up?

532
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:29,800
Yes, it's an ongoing investigation.

533
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:31,186
It's the real-estate agent.

534
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:32,339
Okay, for how much longer?

535
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,599
It costs me money every
day I can't show this house.

536
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,434
- Yes, but I...
- This is outrageous.

537
00:21:36,435 --> 00:21:37,010
No, I...

538
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:39,822
I would like to speak to
your supervisor, if I could.

539
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:42,500
She wants to have a
word with my supervisor.

540
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,433
Miss Kemp ?

541
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,146
It's NCIS. We need to
speak with you again.

542
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,658
Rebecca? Rebecca, what happened?

543
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:13,446
Did you call 911?

544
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:15,400
Hold on.

545
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:21,490
Yes, I've got a woman here who's
shot, need immediat medical attention.

546
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,925
Why would someone unbury body ?

547
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:32,288
I can answer that.

548
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:35,168
To send a message. Like, "Hi, I'm dead."

549
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,903
"Never get engaged to two
women at the same time ?

550
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:40,533
It would be easier to
just rent a billboard.

551
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:42,123
Second question.

552
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:43,901
Where's the money

553
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:44,896
Ah !...

554
00:22:45,493 --> 00:22:48,069
...maybe in Siri's engagement ring.

555
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,186
I got to bring this down to Abby.

556
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,057
I can save you an elevator trip.

557
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:57,029
Oh, that's nice.

558
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,799
It's creating condensation.

559
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,362
On a real diamond, it
evaporates immediately.

560
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:03,399
It's, uh, staying.

561
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,634
Because it's a fake.

562
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,370
Give it one more try, just to make sure.

563
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:10,224
I'm not blowing on you again.

564
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,897
Question three.

565
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:15,709
"Why buy a shovel?"

566
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,442
Oops. No. Sorry.

567
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:19,492
"Why bury a shovel?"

568
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:21,052
I have no answer to that.

569
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:23,192
But here, how about this one?

570
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,610
Who is Darkman ?

571
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:30,049
That is the question.

572
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,643
Liam Neeson in the 1990 cult classic

573
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:37,141
directed by Sam Raimi about a mentally
unstable scientist who seeks revenge.

574
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:39,078
You left out "Who shot Rebecca?"

575
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,196
That was my next question.

576
00:23:41,197 --> 00:23:44,692
Siri claims she was out walking at
the time of the shooting. No witnesses.

577
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:46,373
GSR tests came back negative.

578
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:49,229
Even if Siri shot Rebecca, I
don't think she killed Finn.

579
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,655
I saw her face when she saw his body.

580
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:54,285
If Siri's innocent, she'd
assume that Rebecca's guilty

581
00:23:54,286 --> 00:23:55,741
and she'd seek revenge.

582
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:58,379
Shooting someone in broad
daylight is just dumb.

583
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,152
You're not thinking like
a jealous woman, Ziva.

584
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:03,382
They're keeping Rebecca
in the hospital overnight.

585
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:05,937
She lost a lot of blood,but the
wound was through and through.

586
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:06,901
Anything on the shooter?

587
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:08,914
Said she didn't get a good look at her.

588
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:09,848
How'd she know it was a her?

589
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,878
Rebecca said she heard a
female voice at the door.

590
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:14,333
When she opened it, bang.

591
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:15,493
Siri ?

592
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:16,699
Maybe not.

593
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,847
When I went back to
search Rebecca's place,

594
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:20,919
I found this between the couch pillows.

595
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,434
Rebecca shot herself.

596
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:23,474
I think so.

597
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:26,074
She lost a lot today: her
fiancee, her life savings.

598
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:27,600
Her respect.

599
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,777
Could have been a
failed suicide attempt.

600
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:31,051
Or a bid for sympathy.

601
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,573
Or an attempt to escape discovery

602
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:35,100
that she had sex with
Finn the day she died.

603
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,022
What's your gut tell you, boss?

604
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,594
Take your shirt off.

605
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:39,973
Here we go.

606
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:42,174
I know it's kind of messy.

607
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:44,675
The shirt, McGee, take it off now.

608
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,620
Take it down to Abby.

609
00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:08,621
Or would you rather wait
for a search warrant?

610
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:11,500
Rebecca's DNA.

611
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,914
I need to borrow one of your shirts.

612
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:20,295
You afraid all that white
might burn out Abby's corneas?

613
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:22,888
Do not make me walk around like
this all day. Come on. Help me out.

614
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:23,655
All right.

615
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,690
I can't resist a damsel in distress.

616
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,986
Here, take this !

617
00:25:26,987 --> 00:25:28,592
I get a fresh one.

618
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:31,749
Wow, it's just like Chippendale's...

619
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,803
...without the bow ties or muscles.

620
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:38,399
Give me a second.

621
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,108
I just have to finish
this e-mail to Kofi Annan.

622
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,645
Kofi can wait.

623
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,185
What is it, Jethro?

624
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:47,400
- The Finn case.
- Yes?

625
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:53,353
You're lost on this one?

626
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:54,483
Puzzled.

627
00:25:54,484 --> 00:25:56,291
They barely knew Finn, ...

628
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:59,969
...yet they let him move
in, loaned him money.

629
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:02,463
They trusted a man who
took advantage of them.

630
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:04,362
If you're in a relationship
and the other person

631
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,955
is keeping secrets, how would you know?

632
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:08,522
You'd know.

633
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:09,796
I didn't.

634
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:11,534
Who lied to you?

635
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:12,840
You did.

636
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:16,842
Not exactly lied, but you just
didn't tell me the whole truth either.

637
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,599
You're comparing me to Finn?

638
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,284
I'm just saying that you can be involved

639
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:22,600
with someone without fully knowing them.

640
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,055
How could you not tell
me about your family?

641
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,482
Finish your e-mail.

642
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:30,798
You wanted my advice.

643
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,199
Just don't be too hard on the fiancees.

644
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,653
Finn duped them.

645
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:38,703
And I shouldn't have
brought up the past.

646
00:26:38,704 --> 00:26:41,785
I know you had your reasons for
not wanting to talk about it.

647
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,123
We're talking about it now.

648
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:47,077
Now is not Paris.

649
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:49,247
Your priorities were clear on Paris.

650
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:51,900
I had a job to do in Europe.

651
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,696
If I had told you about my first wife,

652
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:57,092
would it have made a difference?

653
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,276
We'll never know, will we?

654
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:19,299
Yeah. Gibbs.

655
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,648
You went home early.

656
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:22,125
Stayed until 2130.

657
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:24,198
That's early for you.

658
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:27,299
You called to talk about
my work hours, Dr. Mallard?

659
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,419
No, Agent Gibbs.

660
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,917
I had a hunch which led me to trim
Lance Corporal Finn's nose hairs.

661
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,570
I don't think he'd
done it for some time.

662
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,981
I discovered something
under the microscope.

663
00:27:38,982 --> 00:27:41,129
Among the keratin proteins,

664
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,098
I found translucent fibers of glass.

665
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,544
- Fiberglass?
- Exactly.

666
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:47,752
He must have inhaled them in.

667
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:51,400
I'd say, most likely from insulation.

668
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,501
Maybe the house wasn't just a body drop.

669
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:55,265
He's speaking softly,

670
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:58,837
but Lance Corporal Finn has more to say.

671
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:05,534
Would you mind clearing up, Mr. Palmer?

672
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:06,214
Not at all, Doctor.

673
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:08,976
I know you've been putting
in long hours recently.

674
00:28:08,977 --> 00:28:10,558
Just doing my job.

675
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,234
I appreciate the can-do
attitude. Good night.

676
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,525
Night, Doctor.

677
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,299
Agent Lee, you're working late.

678
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,185
Still organizing paperwork on
the Wheaton case, Dr. Mallard.

679
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:22,061
I need the autopsy report.

680
00:28:22,062 --> 00:28:24,917
What happened to the one I
sent up to Legal yesterday?

681
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:27,487
I'm afraid I shredded it by mistake.

682
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:28,730
You must be more careful.

683
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:30,499
I know. I'm sorry, Dr. Mallard.

684
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,760
No worries.

685
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:34,179
I'm sure Mr. Palmer will
give you what you need.

686
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,716
Okay. Thank you.

687
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,843
That's about how it
looked three months ago.

688
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,968
The living room floor was
the last thing we closed up.

689
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:10,289
We ran the AC ducts under this section.

690
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,023
The damn inspector was weeks late.

691
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:13,499
You have security at night here, Bob?

692
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,173
Not on a job this size.

693
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:18,820
We use standard fiberglass
insulation, CDX subfloor.

694
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,211
You see something?

695
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,463
Well, yeah, your joist,
24 inches on center.

696
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:26,099
I would have built them on 16.

697
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,900
Then you wouldn't make a profit.

698
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:31,856
That joist there look discolored to you?

699
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:34,896
Could be mold.

700
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:37,006
Mold spreads from the bottom up.

701
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,353
Need a black. On it, boss.

702
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:41,754
We'll be there soon.

703
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:43,367
Boss,

704
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:46,637
Abby ran the prepaid phone
card we found in Finn's pocket.

705
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:47,729
Had only one call in it.

706
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,697
It was to a self-storage
company in Dale City, Virginia.

707
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:51,941
- Good. Call the storage...
- I...I did.

708
00:29:51,942 --> 00:29:53,999
I was just taking a breath.

709
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,146
I called the self-storage place.

710
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:59,232
Finn paid for the unit in
cash, only signed in once,

711
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,505
so I figured that ...

712
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:02,895
...Ziva and I should probably
get down there and check it out.

713
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,472
Sorry about the breath.

714
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:09,242
<i>Kind of reminds me of Pacific Heights.</i>

715
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:10,810
Don't tell me. A movie?

716
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:11,894
Yeah, interesting plot.

717
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,924
Yuppie couple buys
their dream house then

718
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:17,297
the tenant from hell
tries to destroy it.

719
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:19,257
Michael Keaton's best work.

720
00:30:23,225 --> 00:30:25,334
Looks like organic material.

721
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:27,964
Would a two by six
match Finn's head injury?

722
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:30,029
Ducky thinks the blunt
object hit his temple.

723
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,966
Or maybe his temple hit a blunt object.

724
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:34,634
Which would have landed him
nose-first in this insulation.

725
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,668
Get a sample of this wood back to Abby.

726
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:38,575
Oh, my God!

727
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:41,300
Bob, why are you letting
them destroy our property?

728
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,268
- They're cops, Jody.
- What is she doing here?

729
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:45,047
I called her. She should
know what's going on.

730
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:46,396
Well, it's coming out
of your profits, Bob.

731
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:47,435
Wait a minute, Jody.

732
00:30:47,436 --> 00:30:48,814
That sisal's expensive.

733
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:50,963
You need to calm down, Mrs.arvell.

734
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:51,912
Calm down?

735
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:55,190
I just found a dead guy in the living
room and I am losing money every day.

736
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:59,146
Oh, and my father just died of leukemia,
so don't you tell me to calm down.

737
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:11,701
I'm thinking before we open this up, maybe
we should rub some Vick's under our noses.

738
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,682
I don't think we'll find a body.

739
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:14,918
Hope not.

740
00:31:15,424 --> 00:31:16,700
Hate that.

741
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,570
Nothing?

742
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:26,321
Well, whatever Lance Corporal Finn
was planning on putting in here,

743
00:31:26,322 --> 00:31:28,129
he didn't get a chance to.

744
00:31:31,643 --> 00:31:34,076
McGee, give me your flashlight.

745
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:35,975
You didn't bring your own?

746
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:38,439
It's too heavy. It pulls my pants down.

747
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,750
Now close the door.

748
00:31:56,612 --> 00:31:59,099
- To the right. To the right.
-Yeah.

749
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:02,056
Just, more to the
left. More to the left.

750
00:32:02,057 --> 00:32:02,448
Okay.

751
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:04,423
- Okay, hold it.
- Yeah.

752
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:12,788
Too small to hold a body.

753
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:14,717
Big enough to hold a head.

754
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,271
Is that what I think it is?

755
00:32:24,272 --> 00:32:25,612
Oh, yes.

756
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:27,346
Gold.

757
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:33,357
Hey, got another DNA sample
to test. it's a rush job.

758
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:36,386
So, should I put it in
front of my other rush jobs?

759
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,434
Yes.

760
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:39,701
Okay, I'll make it a
rush-rush job, right on it,

761
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:41,170
unless I get a
rush-rush-rush job.

762
00:32:41,171 --> 00:32:41,886
Thanks Abs.

763
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:43,484
Hey, um, could you tell Gibbs

764
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:45,895
that I got the results
back from Rebecca's DNA?

765
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:49,384
It does not match the genetic
material in Finn's shorts.

766
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,206
That means we're...

767
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:51,969
Looking for a third one.

768
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:03,571
Since you revisited the crime scene,

769
00:33:03,572 --> 00:33:06,134
I decided I want to revisit the body.

770
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:08,355
Something's troubling me.

771
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:09,033
Me, too.

772
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,457
Uh-huh. What's that, Tony?

773
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,811
Well, Finn had two entrees
and still had room for dessert.

774
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:16,222
Makes me wonder if there
was anything, you know,

775
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:18,498
- special about him.
- Like what?

776
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,332
Oh... like that.

777
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:28,428
Did he have extra women because he
had something extra for the women?

778
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:29,031
Well,

779
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:31,254
take a look for yourself.

780
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:34,851
Sadly,

781
00:33:34,852 --> 00:33:38,484
the first thing the maggots
eat is the soft tissue.

782
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:40,300
Still, you've given me an idea.

783
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:41,475
To vomit?

784
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:44,957
No, to reexamine the soft tissue.

785
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:46,758
Thanks, Tony.

786
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:48,348
I do what I can.

787
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:52,399
Ducky, is there any way to...

788
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,378
psychologically un-see something?

789
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,587
Finn's bag contained 120 ounces of gold

790
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:02,475
worth about $78,400 at
today's conversion rate.

791
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:03,560
Mint numbers?

792
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:04,750
Tracing 'em now

793
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,027
the coins were purchased over
the Internet in three batches.

794
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,323
I should have the
dates here in a moment.

795
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,448
We figured $60,000
came from the fiancees,

796
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,700
and Finn must have tossed in the rest.

797
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:14,498
Officer David.

798
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:17,008
Okay, first batch of gold
purchased nine months ago

799
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:18,591
and paid for with a money order.

800
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:20,181
- The second batch...
- That was Abby.

801
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:23,165
She was searching non-standard
databases with the third woman's DNA.

802
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,711
She got a hit on a
bone marrow donor bank.

803
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:26,796
Pull it up.

804
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:31,844
That's not what I expected.

805
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:33,593
Her father died of leukemia.

806
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:34,467
Pick her up.

807
00:34:34,468 --> 00:34:36,223
Take DiNozzo with you.

808
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:44,538
You interrogated her

809
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:46,520
and didn't pick up
she had sex with Finn?

810
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:48,755
It was an interview,
not an interrogation--

811
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:51,241
and excuse me if my brain
didn't go to the sex place.

812
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:51,799
Mine would.

813
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,128
I'm sure that's why you have a
leg up on other investigators.

814
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:57,277
See? You say "leg up," I
instantly went to the sex place.

815
00:34:58,341 --> 00:34:59,199
Hey!

816
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, stop!

817
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:03,314
Stop!

818
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,299
I'm sorry, I need to
go. I have a showing...

819
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,033
At NCIS.

820
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,678
RICK: What's going on?

821
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,629
Hey.

822
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,609
Hey!

823
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:17,299
Stop pointing a gun at my wife.

824
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,526
She tried to rat on us.

825
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:19,392
She means rabbit.

826
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:20,734
Rabbit. Yes.

827
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,829
I was in a hurry for a showing.

828
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,200
Are you arresting her?

829
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:26,663
Taking her to NCIS to
answer a few questions.

830
00:35:26,664 --> 00:35:27,590
Well, I'm coming too.

831
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:30,266
- Rick, you don't have to...
- Jody, I'm your husband.

832
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:33,785
So why didn't you tell us
you knew Lance Corporal Finn?

833
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:35,895
I was afraid that my
husband would find out.

834
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:37,301
That you killed him?

835
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:39,163
I didn't kill James.

836
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,022
It was an accident.

837
00:35:40,023 --> 00:35:42,312
He fell, he hit his
head; I did not kill him.

838
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:43,541
I loved him.

839
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:45,486
Swear to God.

840
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:48,199
Do you have any idea how many murderers
swear to God they didn't do it?

841
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,028
I come from a good Catholic family.

842
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:52,176
When we swear to God, we mean it.

843
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:54,459
Room for one more?

844
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,757
I haven't seen you in
Observation for a while, Ducky.

845
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:59,463
I've learned as much
as I can from the dead.

846
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:02,281
It's time to listen to the living.

847
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:03,346
You met in a bar.

848
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:04,270
Yes

849
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:05,366
How did you know that?

850
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:06,011
When ?

851
00:36:06,012 --> 00:36:07,209
Nine months ago.

852
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,498
You sleep with him that night?

853
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,719
No!

854
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:13,720
That's right-- I forgot you're
from a good Catholic family.

855
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,725
Did you sleep with him the second night?

856
00:36:18,077 --> 00:36:19,523
Your husband never knew.

857
00:36:19,524 --> 00:36:23,664
I would tell him that I had a late showing,
and I'd meet James at the house on Larson Lane.

858
00:36:23,665 --> 00:36:26,429
I know that that sounds immoral,
but it is not what you think.

859
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,262
Well, let me guess. You had
a deep spiritual connection.

860
00:36:29,263 --> 00:36:30,695
Exactly.

861
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,334
I had already decided I
was gonna leave my husband.

862
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:35,399
I just had to wait for...

863
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,452
Your father to die.

864
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:38,042
When you say it, it sounds horrible.

865
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:38,946
Oh yeah. It is.

866
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,915
If Dad knew I was getting a
divorce, he'd have disowned me.

867
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:45,314
She inherited $2 million
last month when Dad died.

868
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:46,881
Ah...

869
00:36:48,487 --> 00:36:50,378
How about if you were a murderer?

870
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:52,201
I didn't kill James.

871
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:53,339
You buried him.

872
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,115
No.

873
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:56,339
I did not even know that he was dead.

874
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,961
I will admit that we had a fight.

875
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,508
James wanted to borrow money...

876
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:04,402
and I refused, and he got angry, and...

877
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:07,137
and he said that we were through.

878
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:08,984
He got up to leave.

879
00:37:08,985 --> 00:37:11,387
I just wanted him to stay.

880
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,603
I, uh...

881
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,939
took his cigarettes.

882
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,299
Give 'em back! No!

883
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,400
Now! No! Not unless you promise...

884
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,100
James!

885
00:37:24,844 --> 00:37:27,722
I just got in my car,
and I drove for hours.

886
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:31,051
I came back to-to check on him,
to see if he was okay, but...

887
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:32,834
He was dead, so you buried him.

888
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,558
No. James was gone.

889
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,749
I thought that he was fine,

890
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,724
until I went to that house
for the showing the other day.

891
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,473
And there he was.

892
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,444
And I could only think
of one explanation.

893
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:49,174
It was the hand of God.

894
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:52,053
- Can Gibbs arrest God?
- I don't know.

895
00:37:52,054 --> 00:37:54,758
It's like the Thing trying
to bring in the Hulk.

896
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,499
She's telling the truth.

897
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,533
TONY: Where you going?

898
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,342
To tell Gibbs.

899
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,461
<i>ZIVA: What do you think?</i>

900
00:38:05,462 --> 00:38:07,700
I'm glad the glass is bullet-proof.

901
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:14,810
Excuse me, uh, could
I have a word?with you?

902
00:38:16,031 --> 00:38:17,198
Working.

903
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:20,491
It's related and important.

904
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,822
She's telling the truth.

905
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:29,600
God put the body there?

906
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:31,439
No. Someone who was playing God.

907
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,157
She didn't bury him.

908
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:34,528
Your gut telling you this?

909
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,714
I've been watching her.
She feels guilt, ...

910
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:37,776
...empathy, remorse.

911
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:39,781
That doesn't fit the
psychological profile.

912
00:38:39,782 --> 00:38:43,088
She's deceitful, conniving,
an adulterous, which does.

913
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:45,477
I'm trying to give you
my professional opinion.

914
00:38:45,478 --> 00:38:49,065
Then tell me after I have
finished interrogating the suspect.

915
00:38:52,857 --> 00:38:53,956
Timothy ?

916
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,019
do you have a moment?

917
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,227
Uh, actually, I'm watching
Jody Carvell's husband.

918
00:38:57,228 --> 00:38:59,601
Yes, I know... I want
to have a word with him.

919
00:38:59,602 --> 00:38:59,932
Sure.

920
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:03,700
And for you to tape it with
that new cell phone of yours.

921
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,581
Tape you ?

922
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:06,782
No, no, no, no. Not me. Him.

923
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:08,928
Surreptitiously, of course.

924
00:39:08,968 --> 00:39:10,188
Of course.

925
00:39:12,652 --> 00:39:13,954
Here you go, Mr. Carvell.

926
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:14,716
Thank you.

927
00:39:14,717 --> 00:39:17,496
Uh, this is our medical examiner,

928
00:39:17,497 --> 00:39:19,569
Uh, call me Ducky. Everyone does.

929
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,872
Uh, Rick.

930
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:21,919
Strange, isn't it, Rick,

931
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,700
someone committed
a murder... standard.

932
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,334
But then they
covered it up...

933
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:28,235
standard.

934
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,460
And then... they uncovered it.

935
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:33,600
Far from standard.

936
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:35,672
You think my wife was involved.

937
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:36,765
No.

938
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:39,154
And that's the problem.

939
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:41,037
James was
a big man--

940
00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:43,816
there is no way that I could've
picked him up and buried him.

941
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:45,099
Oh, that's easy.

942
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,426
You roll him onto the
plastic and you drag him out.

943
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,061
Without ruining these nails?

944
00:39:49,062 --> 00:39:51,337
Look at them--
they are so perfect.

945
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:55,556
DUCKY: I tried to convince Agent Gibbs

946
00:39:55,557 --> 00:39:58,850
that your wife was telling the truth.

947
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:02,022
I'm afraid he doesn't believe me.

948
00:40:03,342 --> 00:40:05,800
Tell me, Rick, why does that please you?

949
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:06,943
What?

950
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:10,552
Well, you just flashed
a slight, reflexive smile

951
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:13,332
when I said that Gibbs
didn't believe your wife

952
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,394
I did not !

953
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:15,593
Timothy ?

954
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,157
<i>I'm afraid</i>

955
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:28,034
<i>he doesn't believe me.</i>

956
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,153
I don't know if God was watching
your wife and Finn that night,

957
00:40:34,154 --> 00:40:35,547
but you were.

958
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:37,296
My-My wife and the dead guy?

959
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:40,928
Yes, when your wife ran out of
the house, you buried the body.

960
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:42,383
My God, man, why would I do that?

961
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:44,372
Because you wanted the money.

962
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,934
Well, you had to wait
until her father died

963
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:49,702
before you could implicate
her in the murder.

964
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,513
But once she got her inheritance,

965
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:55,339
you disinterred the body.

966
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,826
<i>You-you have a vivid
imagination, Ducky.</i>

967
00:40:57,827 --> 00:41:00,403
But, uh, imagination
doesn't prove anything.

968
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:02,299
No, you're quite right there.

969
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,231
But evidence does.

970
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:05,625
DUCKY: Ah, good.

971
00:41:05,626 --> 00:41:06,756
Abby

972
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,215
have you lifted the DNA
from the shovel handle yet?

973
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:13,847
You know, from the sweat
we discovered on the handle.

974
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,617
Oh. Yeah, uh, right.

975
00:41:15,618 --> 00:41:18,541
I-I've got it running. I'm ready
to check it. I just need a sample.

976
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,853
Well, then...

977
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,758
test it against the saliva on this.

978
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:28,700
You're right.

979
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,964
I tried to cover up

980
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,494
her murder.

981
00:41:31,745 --> 00:41:33,297
But I didn't kill him.

982
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:35,964
That cheating bitch did.

983
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:39,303
Boss, , Mr. Carvell here admitted
to Ducky he buried the body.

984
00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:40,569
Oh, my God.

985
00:41:40,818 --> 00:41:41,766
It was you ?

986
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,424
Who else cleans up your messes?

987
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:45,158
I was watching the two
of you from the window.

988
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,717
You watched us make love?

989
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:48,277
That's not what I'd call it.

990
00:41:48,534 --> 00:41:49,490
Then what happened?

991
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:50,462
They had a fight,

992
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:53,362
- ...she hit him on the head, and she ran.
- Rick !

993
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:55,653
All I did was bury him.

994
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:58,342
Well, I'm afraid you
did a bit more than that.

995
00:41:58,455 --> 00:41:59,381
Right

996
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:00,662
I unburied him.

997
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:01,966
Sit down.

998
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:05,583
A reexamination of the
conjunctival and facial tissues

999
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:09,508
revealed petechial hemorrhages
suggesting asphyxia.

1000
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:13,599
So I looked for
atelectasis in his lungs,

1001
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,964
...which results...

1002
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:19,350
... from shallow breathing due
to an obstruction such as plastic.

1003
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:21,468
And there it was.

1004
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:25,934
Lance Corporal Finn was buried alive.

1005
00:42:25,935 --> 00:42:27,662
He was dead!

1006
00:42:27,663 --> 00:42:29,078
I know he was dead.

1007
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,626
You bastard, you killed him!

1008
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:33,773
Ziva,

1009
00:42:33,774 --> 00:42:34,964
get her out of here.

1010
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:36,886
McGee.

1011
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:38,860
Handcuff him and get a sworn statement.

1012
00:42:38,861 --> 00:42:40,148
I hope you fry!

1013
00:42:40,149 --> 00:42:41,573
Go to hell!

1014
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:43,833
RICK: Go to hell.

1015
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:46,351
Wow.

1016
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,814
I got to come up here more often.

1017
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:51,972
Gibbs, I screwed up.

1018
00:42:51,973 --> 00:42:54,120
Well, yeah. You almost
spilled my coffee.

1019
00:42:54,121 --> 00:42:57,639
When Tony and I ran out to pick up Jody,
I left Finn's bag of gold on my desk.

1020
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,747
Mm-hmm.

1021
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:01,052
I know I should've taken it to
evidence, but we were focusing on...

1022
00:43:01,053 --> 00:43:02,600
Here's the inventory.

1023
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,877
<i>You took it to evidence.</i>

1024
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:11,436
It says here the bag contained
$18,000 worth of gold.

1025
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:13,509
We are $60,000 short.

1026
00:43:15,363 --> 00:43:18,407
You gave Siri and Rebecca back
the money they loaned Finn.

1027
00:43:18,747 --> 00:43:21,135
I thought I'd save the
courts some paperwork.

1028
00:43:21,136 --> 00:43:22,582
You wouldn't be getting soft?

1029
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,775
Of course not. You
shaved your moustache.

1030
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:27,435
Uh, boss, reception called this
morning, they said that someone was here

1031
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:29,273
with information
about-- sorry--

1032
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:32,107
about a case. I went
to meet her, and, um,

1033
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:33,960
this is Jessica Coleman,

1034
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:36,063
James Finn's fiancee.
