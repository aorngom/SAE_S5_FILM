1
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:08,521
These Marines sure take
this stuff seriously.

2
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:13,030
Might as well get comfortable;
this could take some time.

3
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,159
Check the ID, check the trunk.

4
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:20,682
No dogs. Hate dogs.
Dogs are a pain in the ass.

5
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:23,316
Never met a dog that didn't
want to try to bite me.

6
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:26,157
Looking for bombs or bin Laden, I guess.

7
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:27,238
Clear.

8
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,682
Finally.

9
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:30,176
Proceed.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,654
Good morning, sir.

11
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:35,129
- Photo ID and pop the trunk, please.
- Sure thing.

12
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:39,595
Drop off?

13
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:42,590
Guy says he wants to see someone at NCIS.

14
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,316
Clear.

15
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:49,127
Lower the window, please, sir.

16
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,412
Hey, buddy, lady needs to see some ID.

17
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:58,577
Photo ID, please, sir.

18
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:01,255
Sir?

19
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:03,435
Step out of the vehicle, please.

20
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:12,143

These files have to be
reviewed by Friday.

26
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:02,681
I'll get to them.

27
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:04,752
Tomorrow's Friday.

28
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:09,802
Had a wife like you once, Cynthia.

29
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:12,636
- I divorced her.
- Beat her to it, did you?

30
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,659
You didn't read it.

31
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,946
Scoletti case.
I know the case agent.

32
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:31,206
Jeff Gillman. He's a good man.

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,437
Director doesn't want
Justice not going to trial

34
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,887
because of a procedural error.

35
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:39,308
Well, then the Director should be here
instead of shopping in Paris all week.

36
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:42,489
An Interpol antiterrorist
conference isn't shopping.

37
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,503
Yeah.

38
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,968
You know him, too?

39
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,321
Yep.
Don't worry.

40
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:50,122
Justice has its own procedural problems.

41
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,323
Who's Special Agent Grisham?

42
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,512
Transferred in from San Diego.

43
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:58,512
Hollywood Special Agent.

44
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:01,539
- Rejected.
- You have to give a reason.

45
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:08,223
It's her private line.

46
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,913
Hello, Cynthia.

47
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:20,766
Cynthia?

48
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,562
No...

49
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:24,589
Jethro.

50
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,601
I should have recognized
the heavy breathing.

51
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:29,702
Is the Agency intact?

52
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:33,666
I cut it up into small bitsy pieces
and sold it to the three-letter boys.

53
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,809
I take it walking my heels
has presented a challenge.

54
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,435
Well, I accepted some
speaking requests for you.

55
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,154
<i>Which speaking requests?</i>

56
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,705
Women for Women,
St. Paul, Minnesota chapter.

57
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:47,516
The eighth grade class of Hondo
Middle School in Hondo, Texas.

58
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:50,099
The teacher, she's an admirer.

59
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,375
<i>Society of Preservation
for Barbershop Quartets.</i>

60
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:55,106
You're not serious, Jethro.

61
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:57,769
Well, about the barbershop
quartets, no, no, I'm not.

62
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,329
But I did accept six, seven... eight,

63
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,768
nine others for you.

64
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,359
- Put Cynthia on.
- Hey, how's the frog...

65
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:07,911
<i>legs?</i>

66
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,081
<i>You always enjoyed them
sauted in butter.</i>

67
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:12,256
Cynthia. Now!

68
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,731
Yes, Director.

69
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:19,394
Tell me you didn't send out acceptances
for speaking engagements.

70
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:21,206
Of course not, Director.

71
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:22,642
Thank you, Cynthia.

72
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:25,052
You have just earned yourself
a Hermes scarf.

73
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:26,554
Thank you, Director.

74
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:29,948
C'était un grand plaisir, madame.

75
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:31,957
Au revoir.

76
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,552
Put him back on.

77
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:39,570
Yes...?

78
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,396
Is there any serious business
I should know about?

79
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,594
<i>Well, the...</i>

80
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:47,257
Buy America toilet paper doesn't fit the
metric fixtures, and we got a truck...

81
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,536
She hang up on me.

82
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:52,803
Shocking.

83
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,796
You call back to apologize?

84
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,154
I don't know what you heard, boss,

85
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:03,845
but I was not the one
who started that pool.

86
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,645
What pool is that, DiNozzo?

87
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:11,897
- On the case.
- What case?

88
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:15,209
"There's a dead body in the taxi
at the main gate" case.

89
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,838
I'll be right there.

90
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,377
The case files?

91
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,005
Leave them on my desk.

92
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:21,481
They are on your desk.

93
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:28,614
It's not often we get to walk to a crime
scene, if this is a crime scene.

94
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:33,644
There's no blood, no bullet
holes, no knife punctures,

95
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:37,711
no obvious signs of bruising,
no ligiture marks,

96
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,647
no petechial hemorrhaging
on the eye or eyelid.

97
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:42,960
Natural causes?

98
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:46,982
There's nothing natural about a man
of his age keeling over in a taxicab.

99
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:50,524
Maybe he died of embarrassment
when he couldn't pay the cab fare.

100
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,155
Alas, death by embarrassment

101
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:57,552
is not a certifiable cause,
however intriguing the notion.

102
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:00,195
Excuse me, Ducky.

103
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:03,904
It's about time that boy fell in love.

104
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:06,275
I found a house.

105
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:08,588
House? Thought we were
renting an apartment.

106
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:10,589
No, we're buying a house.

107
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,039
<i>Buying?</i>

108
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,703
It's the most adorable
little bungalow, Tony.

109
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:17,793
Only Hollywood has bungalows, Jeanne.

110
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:20,454
You don't want to buy a house with me?

111
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:22,260
I love playing House with you.

112
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:23,816
Not the same thing.

113
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,789
Can I call you back tonight?

114
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,650
My boss is on his way over and he
doesn't look very happy.

115
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:30,565
I thought you ran things over there.

116
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,449
I do. Just not all the time.

117
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:35,010
We'll play house tonight.

118
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:37,747
Hey, I win the pool!

119
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:39,214
Wait a minute.
How do you figure that?

120
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:42,948
I predicted that Gibbs would
last four days as Director

121
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:45,028
before reverting to working a case.

122
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,891
This is Thursday.
Four days!

123
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,534
He's not working on case. He's just...

124
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:52,008
curious.

125
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:56,215
Every time he's been at the crime scene,
he's been there to investigate.

126
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,779
- How is today different?
- He is in the Navy Yard

127
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,280
because that's where the
Director's office is located.

128
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:02,477
Let's ask him.

129
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,256
So you would have Gibbs give up
his post as Acting Director

130
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,157
just to win a $50 pool?

131
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:08,713
Yes.

132
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,412
Guess it's true what they say about
the Scotsmen.

133
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:21,319
I trust that if Gibbs is more than
just curious, you will inform me?

134
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,855
Scout's honor.

135
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,795
You said you were never in the Boy Scouts.

136
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:32,559
I was an Alpha Chi Delta
wet T-shirt spring-break talent scout.

137
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:34,115
Does that count?

138
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,528
Give me some love.

139
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:40,829
You gave that man too much
to swallow in one bite, Dr. Benoit.

140
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,091
It's a house, Carly, not a steak.

141
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:47,655
From rental apartment to buying a house
in one phone call, are you crazy?

142
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:50,468
You got to take these things slow.

143
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,718
Toss a few home magazines around.

144
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,157
Leave the real estate section
of the Sunday paper next to the toilet.

145
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:58,468
Well, he does crossword puzzles in there.

146
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:01,123
Okay, talk to him about it
when he's vulnerable.

147
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,532
Tony's never vulnerable.

148
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:06,804
Not even when you put on
your best bedside manner?

149
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,130
Driver's name is Joe Kelly.

150
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:13,345
He says the victim hailed him on 25th
Street and told him to bring him here.

151
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:14,941
- To see?
- Us.

152
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:17,269
He did not specify a particular agent.

153
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:20,959
Mr. Kelly,
did you ever see your fare before?

154
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,973
Never.

155
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:25,437
He seem injured or ill
when you picked him up?

156
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,650
Not really.

157
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:28,533
He was kind of out of breath.

158
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:29,614
Like he was running?

159
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:32,264
Yeah, and he kept looking
back over his shoulder

160
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,710
like he thought someone
might be following us.

161
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:34,711
Were they?

162
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,721
Good luck tailing anyone in D.C. traffic.

163
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,097
Did he speak to you?

164
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,345
Not a word.

165
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,411
As usual, I did all the talking.

166
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:42,846
Passes the time, you know?

167
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:46,213
I passed the time,
he passed away, poor guy.

168
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:48,801
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- SecNav is holding, sir.

169
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:50,060
SecNav? Tell him I'm...

170
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:52,972
<i>I already told him you on the
Navy Yard and available, sir.</i>

171
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:55,763
Cynthia, don't ever tell
anybody I'm available

172
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:57,850
until I tell you I'm available, okay?

173
00:08:57,851 --> 00:08:59,231
- Yes, sir.
- Put him through.

174
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:01,474
- That the Director on the phone?
- SecNav.

175
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:04,612
- Wonder what Gibbs did wrong.
- Slipped into Jenny's heels.

176
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:07,413
Ziva, take the driver's statement.

177
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,913
I already did.

178
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:11,664
McGee crime scene photos, finish 'em.

179
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:13,565
- Yeah, I finished them.
- You get an I.D.?

180
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:17,973
Yeah, the photo on the Yemeni's
driver's license matches the victim's.

181
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,633
"Hamal Farhan".
No buzzers.

182
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:22,395
- Bells.
- What else?

183
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,724
List, seven names on it,
Farhan is number five.

184
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:28,751
Obviously, whatever he wanted to tell us
had something to do with this list.

185
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:29,981
Find everyone on it.

186
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:31,902
So, Director, does that mean you're...?

187
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,414
I'm heading the investigation.

188
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:37,401
Hey, Duck, you win the pool.

189
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,559
Yes !

190
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:40,095
Thank you, Jethro.

191
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:42,502
And I didn't do anything wrong, McGee.

192
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:53,149
Black Rose has countered
our ejection-seat bid.

193
00:09:55,976 --> 00:09:59,969
How does the POB hope to maintain
a classical ballet company

194
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,291
if there are no classical
works scheduled?

195
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:04,499
I have no idea.

196
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,664
Black Rose, Rene?

197
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:08,335
What is La Dame's bid?

198
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,461
20,000 Euros per seat.

199
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:15,050
Double it.

200
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:19,085
I know you want to corner the market
on F-14 components, Rene,

201
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,330
but even if the Iranians pay top Euro

202
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,863
by the time we split the shipment
for transport...

203
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,793
We're not splitting the shipment now.

204
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:29,128
It's all going on La Tortue.

205
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:32,356
She sails for Hormuz on the 23rd.

206
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:36,905
If the Americans stop her, you risk losing
not only the components, but the ship.

207
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:39,125
$68 million and change.

208
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:43,747
Regine, the U.S. Navy will seize La Tortue
after she enters the Persian Gulf.

209
00:10:43,748 --> 00:10:46,765
Don't you know Americans pay more
to keep their F-14 parts

210
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:50,229
out of Iranian hands than
Iranians pay to get them.

211
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,542
So...

212
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:53,283
just double it

213
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,450
Nice in 20 minutes.

214
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:59,278
Time to refresh.

215
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,799
A friend in the GRU informs me that
NCIS nipples is quietly trying

216
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,989
to locate a former
Colonel-General Dimitri Borov.

217
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:16,341
Elle commence à me gonfler.

218
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:22,114
She is relentless.

219
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,797
Does that surprise you?

220
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:27,689
She is the first female director
of an armed Federal Agency.

221
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,412
Have they located

222
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:33,325
Colonel-General Dimitri Borov?

223
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,385
Not yet.

224
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:38,476
Perhaps they should.

225
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:53,014
I've been hacking cabs for 22 years.
Never had a fare die on me.

226
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:57,190
Couple of heart attacks, a suicide attempt
or two, but none of them died.

227
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:58,204
Till now.

228
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,948
Anyone who does something
for 22 years must love it.

229
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:03,337
You kidding?
It's the best job in the world!

230
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:06,138
So now you think I'm crazy, right?
But here's the thing.

231
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,413
My best friend, I met him in the cab.

232
00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:10,943
The guy who does my tax,
I met him in the cab.

233
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:14,965
Poker buddies, met'em in the cab.
I even met my wife in the cab.

234
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,771
Well, three out of four ain't bad.

235
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,589
This is your statement.

236
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,779
Read it. If you agree, sign it.

237
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,740
I think we should, call for a recount.

238
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:29,397
- On what?
- Ducky winning the pool.

239
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,952
Gibbs is up in the Director's office
directing, right?

240
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:34,326
We're working the case.
He's not.

241
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:40,207
Because he's waiting for me
to give him an update.

242
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,579
Which I'm gonna do, as soon as Mr. Kelly
signs his statement and leaves.

243
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,901
I can go?

244
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,264
You can go to the head
or our conference room.

245
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:49,206
He said I could leave.

246
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,717
Well, what I say doesn't count
when the boss is here.

247
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:54,657
Like me when the wife is around.

248
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:56,702
- Mr. Kelly.
- Lead the way.

249
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,266
Follow me.

250
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:01,061
- Update?
- McGee.

251
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:05,402
According to Immigration, Hamal Farhan

252
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:09,260
applied for a student visa twice
and was turned down twice.

253
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:11,992
Granted a six-month tourist visa.
That was a year and a half ago.

254
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:14,520
Even if he had it extended for a year,
he's here illegally.

255
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:17,326
Should we notify Immigration
and deport him?

256
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:20,765
That's a good one, boss.

257
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,395
Actually,
his visa was extended indefinitely.

258
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:25,954
Yemen added Farhan
to their Embassy personnel.

259
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,859
What are you trying to do,
make me look bad?

260
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,016
I just read it.

261
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,820
Added as what?

262
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:34,440
A gardener.

263
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,710
In here.

264
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:41,983
Anything I can get you, Mr. Kelly?

265
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:43,974
My cab so I can leave.

266
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,475
To eat or drink?

267
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,717
Philly cheesesteak
and a beer would be nice.

268
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:49,545
No alcoholic beverages allowed.

269
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,590
I will work on your sandwich.

270
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:53,768
You gonna lock me in?

271
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:57,500
No, but there will be
an escort outside the door.

272
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,762
Is that another name for a guard?

273
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:13,645
Thelma, you're never gonna
believe where I am.

274
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:16,740
No, I'm not at Kelsey's Bar.

275
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:21,930
How did he die, Duck?

276
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:25,725
Quickly, Jethro, as the meter ticked over

277
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:28,991
and without the driver even noticing.

278
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:33,314
And whatever caused his demise
is not evident from my autopsy.

279
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:39,024
There's no sign of violence,no lumps,
bumps, punctures or holes.

280
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:40,086
Drug overdose?

281
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,343
Well, I can't say for certain
till I receive Abby's report.

282
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:48,203
But he didn't die of a cardiac infarction
which is how most overdoses kill.

283
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:51,007
His heart shows no sign
of coronary artery disease.

284
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:53,495
In fact, it's in excellent condition,

285
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:56,742
as can be said of all your organs.

286
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,911
Pity they couldn't all have been donated.

287
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:00,962
They were all so healthy.

288
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,359
Poison?

289
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:06,195
It's the most likely culprit,
but again, I wait Abigail.

290
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,017
I thought you were supposed
to solve these riddles, Duck.

291
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:10,790
Abby and I like to share.

292
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:12,673
Right.

293
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:19,672
That wouldn't have been your assistant,
would it, Director?

294
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:21,402
I do hate a nagging woman, Duck.

295
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:24,355
She's only doing her job, Jethro.

296
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:26,797
Ah, Abby.

297
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:28,657
Any news on the tox screen?

298
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,813
Abby, Abby, are you there?

299
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:34,352
Oh, I guess she must have...

300
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:38,931
gone.

301
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:43,507
Oh, this cab is bringing back
memories:

302
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:46,818
cheap vinyl, plastic divider,
dirty floors.

303
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,001
Actually, these floors are pretty clean.
The ones I remember were dirty.

304
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:55,078
Let me guess.
Short-lived career as a cabbie?

305
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,266
Ah, a short-lived encounter.

306
00:15:58,026 --> 00:15:59,945
Ships in the night.

307
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,090
My first time.

308
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:03,541
For what?

309
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:05,767
Front seat or back?

310
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:08,665
Back. Well, both, kind of.

311
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:12,882
My first time was in a weapons carrier.

312
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,934
Of course it was.

313
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,277
Where was the cabbie
when this encounter took place?

314
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,030
He was the cabbie,
putting himself through school.

315
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:23,467
It was his first time, too.

316
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:26,489
- First time for what?
- Seeing a curling match, Gibbs.

317
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,938
Have you ever seen a curling match?

318
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:30,330
The pristine ice and those
little brooms that sweep...

319
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:31,530
That's a clean cab.

320
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:34,331
So, what killed him, heart attack?

321
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,337
No, Ducky ruled out a heart attack.

322
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:38,660
Poison looks better all the time.

323
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:42,765
Well, Major Mass Spectrometer
is working as fast as he can.

324
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,937
Make him work faster, Abby.

325
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,153
Yes, sir.

326
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:50,477
Running shoe.

327
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:53,279
Yeah, that impression
matches Farhan's left foot.

328
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,684
The cab must have been cleaned
before he was picked up.

329
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:59,080
After he hailed the cab,
like most passengers

330
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,381
he didn't sit directly behind the driver.

331
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:03,093
Crossed his leg like this.

332
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:04,094
Then he died.

333
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:05,745
In a very relaxed position.

334
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,156
May have been a natural death, Gibbs.

335
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:12,183
I know he was healthy and
young, but it does happen SADS.

336
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:14,486
No, sad. No S.

337
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:17,961
No it is SADS.
Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome.

338
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:19,029
Right. Sorry.

339
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,854
It can leave the heart
looking perfectly normal.

340
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,999
McGee, you check out our cabbie?

341
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,948
Not yet. That is my next task.

342
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:26,950
Hey, boss.

343
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:34,847
Five of the seven names found on the list
in Farhan's wallet are dead.

344
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:36,533
- A hit list?
- When?

345
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:38,506
First died three weeks ago.

346
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:40,783
The last... not including
Farhan... Monday.

347
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,695
Kind of rules out your SADS theory, Ziva.

348
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,089
- SADS?
- Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome.

349
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,098
I know what it is, Ziva.
It's number two on the list.

350
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,635
Sean Price, 24, died of SADS.

351
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,586
- The others?
- Heart attack.

352
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,734
- Or a blown autopsy.
- No autopsy. He was 79.

353
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:58,284
One car crash, one drowning.
One list, five people.

354
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,910
You and Ziva find the two live names
on this list. Look for a connection.

355
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:04,597
David Brown and Robert Smith.

356
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:05,976
There'll be dozens of them.

357
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:08,424
I read the obits.
If there's a connection, I didn't see it.

358
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:09,782
There's a connection.

359
00:18:09,783 --> 00:18:11,791
- What?
- They're all dead.

360
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:17,234
Relax, Thelma, they won't
keep me here overnight.

361
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:19,551
I'll be out of here soon.

362
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:21,014
Right, boss?

363
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:22,263
I'm not your boss.

364
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:23,920
Right now it sure feels like it.

365
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:25,399
When'd you have the cab cleaned?

366
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,289
I got it that way from dispatch.

367
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,036
How many fares before Farhan.

368
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:31,680
- He was my first.
- He was looking over his shoulder?

369
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:35,840
Till he was sure we weren't being tailed.
Then he relaxed.

370
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:39,442
Maybe I just thought
he relaxed, seeing how he was dead.

371
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:42,307
Can I get my cab and go now?

372
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,728
Not yet.

373
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,727
<i>I am very relieved</i>

374
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:49,022
that none of the deceased
are your friends or relatives.

375
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,549
Hi, may I speak with David Brown?

376
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,110
- Yes, I am certain they are dead.
- Thanks.

377
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,363
Oh, no, no, I wouldn't send flowers.

378
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,352
May I speak with David Brown?

379
00:18:58,353 --> 00:19:02,735
If you wish to send a sympathy card,
I am sure it would be very appreciated.

380
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,672
Well, you have a good life, too.

381
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:09,711
I wouldn't normally ask you this,
but since you don't know the deceased,

382
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:12,853
I was wondering if you'd be interested
in subscribing to our DVD club.

383
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:16,598
It's mostly East German films.
Because I have a very special...

384
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:20,234
Gets them off the line fast every time.

385
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:24,395
Hey, boss, 32 David Browns in the metro
area. So far I've talked to four.

386
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,146
41 Robert Smiths, two.

387
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,061
And I notified the Yemen embassy of...

388
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:30,606
Director Gibbs!

389
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:34,380
- Your cell phone is off.
- Because I shut it off.

390
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,231
The Yemen embassy has been calling
for the Director.

391
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:40,159
- Did you tell them she's in Paris?
- Yes.

392
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,290
Good.

393
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,454
I also told them you were Acting Director.

394
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,874
They're sending an attache
to identify the body.

395
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,232
Yes, that is him, Hamal Farhan.

396
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:56,667
When will the body be released?

397
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:59,785
- When we know how he died and why.
- You suspect murder?

398
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:03,543
I always suspect murder when a healthy
young man dies of no apparent cause.

399
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:07,098
Finding the cause of death
could take several days.

400
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:08,564
Weeks.

401
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:15,030
It is our request that Mr. Farhan
be turned over to the embassy immediately.

402
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:17,397
Kid must have been a hell of a gardener.

403
00:20:18,438 --> 00:20:20,447
He had no family in America.

404
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,045
We take care of our own.

405
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:24,224
This time of night,
the embassy sends an e-mail,

406
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,734
not a cultural attache, Dr. Temani.

407
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:30,108
You are Acting Director
of NCIS, I believe?

408
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:34,212
Director will be back at the end of
the week if you want to wait around.

409
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,235
Mr. Farhan wanted to attend
an American university,

410
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,896
but was repeatedly denied a student visa.

411
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:42,597
So he took up gardening?

412
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:44,111
Only on paper.

413
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:48,477
He stops at the embassy every Friday
just to pick up a paycheck.

414
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:51,144
- He was connected.
- Yes.

415
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:53,783
The son of one of
the Prime Minister's advisors.

416
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:58,232
Hamal wanted to learn English
and study American culture,

417
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,501
nothing more.

418
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:03,223
- Did I say there was?
- No, but I know what you're thinking.

419
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,548
Hamal was not the type to
be involved with terrorism.

420
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:09,426
He asked to be brought
to NCIS for a reason.

421
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:10,991
I cannot imagine why.

422
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:16,331
The last person from your country
who asked to talk to NCIS was killed.

423
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:19,305
- When was that?
- October 10, 2000.

424
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:22,416
Two days before the terrorist
attack on USSCole.

425
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:34,925
Do you know Maury Goldberg,
Thomas West, Adam Zeileg, Sean Price or

426
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,595
Hamal Farhan?

427
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,695
- Adam West?
- No, not Adam West.

428
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,387
Adam Zeileg or Thomas West.

429
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:44,152
- You know Burt Ward?
- Yeah, I do.

430
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:46,297
Really? Holy molars!

431
00:21:47,094 --> 00:21:49,814
No kidding.
On The Simpsons? Which one?

432
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:52,248
Is that the one with
the Muslim guy on the bike?

433
00:21:52,555 --> 00:21:56,092
Thanks for your help, Mr. Brown.
Tell Burt, Tony says hi.

434
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:58,697
I know, boss. This isn't TV trivia.

435
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:02,083
A dead man was left
on our door step clutching a hit list.

436
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:04,865
Well not exactly clutching, but
with a hit list in his wallet,

437
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,866
and we have to find
the two names on the list

438
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,843
that haven't been hit yet
before they are hit.

439
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,281
- No, DiNozzo.
- No?

440
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:16,939
We have to find the dirt bag
that killed the other five!

441
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:19,346
- Agent Gibbs?
- What?!

442
00:22:19,864 --> 00:22:21,676
Justice called on the Scoletti case.

443
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:25,242
They've granted the defense permission
to do their own ballistics test tomorrow.

444
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,018
Tell Special Agent Gillman
this is his case.

445
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:31,187
As Acting Director,
You have to sign off on it.

446
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:39,359
We still have those case files to review.

447
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,691
We can do them later.

448
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:46,754
Joe Kelly.

449
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:48,130
Uh, legit.

450
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,948
He's had a IC licence
in D.C. for 22 years.

451
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:53,802
Other than a couple of minor
traffic violations, he's clean.

452
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:56,178
He has been here a while.
Should we release him?

453
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:58,811
- If I wanted him released, McGee...
- You would have told me.

454
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:02,297
Scoletti's lawyers have a hired gun
coming into check Abby's ballistics.

455
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,298
Tell Abby.

456
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,905
- I'd really rather not.
- It wasn't a request.

457
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,192
- When is the Director returning?
- Sometime tomorrow.

458
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:10,961
I don't think Gibbs
is going to last that...

459
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:13,929
- Hello?
- Yes. Mister Smith.

460
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:16,861
I'm calling from NCIS.

461
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:20,842
Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

462
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:24,788
They're questioning the validity
of my ballistics?!

463
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,874
Scoletti's lawyers are desperate.

464
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,869
They're desperate.
They're like drowning men grasping...

465
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,127
At thin polystyrene tubes?

466
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:34,556
I was going to say straws,
but I do like that idiom better.

467
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:38,907
Because mine's more accurate. I mean,
does saying, "grasping at straws"

468
00:23:38,908 --> 00:23:42,829
tell you if they're made out of paper
or glass or metal or polystyrene? No!

469
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,288
I pride myself on the accuracy
of my forensics,

470
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:48,682
and lawyers... lawyers are questioning it!

471
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:51,285
Abby, they don't know
you like we know you.

472
00:23:51,286 --> 00:23:54,037
Okay? They're hoping
that you made a mistake,

473
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:56,058
but when their ballistic experts
don't find any,

474
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,913
that makes your forensics
all the more damning in court.

475
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:01,803
So please do not let
desperate lawyers grasping

476
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:06,030
at thin polystyrene tubes
upset you, please?

477
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:10,495
I love you, McGee.

478
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:12,721
Not like love you,
love you.

479
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:15,557
Not that l don't love you,
because I do, kind of.

480
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:19,013
You know, like...
like the way I love puppies.

481
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:22,308
I could have done without
that comparaison.

482
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:25,420
But I love puppies.

483
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,382
You'll just have to wait.
They can't hold me here overnight.

484
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,923
My wife doesn't believe
I'm being held by Navy cops.

485
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:35,301
He's a material witness.

486
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,750
Thanks, pal.

487
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:41,250
You know how wives are...they don't
trust you as far as they can kick you.

488
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:43,180
Wouldn't know.
Never married.

489
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,791
How did you get away?

490
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:47,850
After a while, women...
they just don't like me.

491
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:51,141
- What do you do, leave the toilet lid up?
- I know when they're lying.

492
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:53,621
Men, too.

493
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:58,687
From the top.

494
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,687
The guy was my first fare.

495
00:25:02,688 --> 00:25:05,335
Flagged me down outside
Kelsey's Bar on 25th.

496
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:10,211
Done.

497
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:12,309
I have a dozen Smiths left.

498
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,012
Want to take half of them?

499
00:25:15,126 --> 00:25:16,450
I don't think so.

500
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:20,751
- Will make it worth your wow.
- While.

501
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,448
- Not wow.
- Wow makes more sense.

502
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:25,819
You're right. Wow would be better.

503
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:27,854
Then you'll help me?

504
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:29,284
No.

505
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:32,439
Did you call to apologize?

506
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:33,940
Yeah.

507
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:36,153
You're right.
I was in a rush.

508
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,879
<i>I should have taken more time.</i>

509
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,841
Me, too.
I sprung that house on you.

510
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,759
It was a surprise.

511
00:25:43,013 --> 00:25:45,369
You willing to look at it with me?

512
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:48,189
Look?
Yeah, when?

513
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,493
Saturday.

514
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:51,701
Deal.

515
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:54,199
I got to go.

516
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:55,649
I love you, Tony.

517
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,549
Love you, too, Jeanne.

518
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:03,503
<i>Come on.
You can tell us what you're feeling.</i>

519
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:05,326
Stop nagging my baby

520
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:08,779
or you can plot the mass spectrum
on a graph yourself, McGee.

521
00:26:09,632 --> 00:26:10,682
Perfect.

522
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:13,690
You know what they say about
the watched pot, right?

523
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:15,067
Don't you have something to do?

524
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:18,871
No. Not until Major Mass Spec
tells me if Farhan was poisoned or not.

525
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:22,309
Be a good boy and go get me Scoletti's
weapon out of the evidence locker.

526
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,380
You gonna run another ballistics test?

527
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:26,505
No, I've already quadruple-checked that,

528
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:29,329
but the serial number was
filed off of the weapon.

529
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:33,175
I used an acid-etching
solution to lift it up.

530
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:35,549
I'm going to quadruple check that now.

531
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,064
Abby. You did not make an error.

532
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:41,179
By the time you get back,
the kettle will be whistling.

533
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:45,285
If not sooner. Saxitoxin?

534
00:26:45,286 --> 00:26:47,990
- Never heard of it.
- It's a neurotoxin.

535
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:51,819
It's found in most cases of
paralytic shellfish poisoning.

536
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:53,758
He ate a bad clam?

537
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,131
I don't know.

538
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,946
What are you looking for?

539
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,421
Gibbs.

540
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:08,183
He has this uncanny way of just showing up
whenever I make a discovery.

541
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:11,383
He's a little bit off his game since
he's been playing Director.

542
00:27:11,384 --> 00:27:13,787
Is that so, McGee?

543
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:16,822
Both of you, get down here.

544
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:22,389
Saxitoxin is produced

545
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,319
by a single-cell organism
that flourishes in the warm months.

546
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,917
It is eaten by oysters, clams,
mussels, and is responsible

547
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:32,525
for the deadly phenomenon
known as "red tide".

548
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:36,986
The poison disrupts the electrical
impulses to the brain,

549
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:40,320
and the body basically forgets
how to breath, how to live,

550
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:42,615
and it's practically undetectable.

551
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,909
Good work, my dear.

552
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,969
- Thank you, Ducky.
- You're welcome

553
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,672
Whenever you two are done.

554
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:51,384
Yes, well,

555
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:54,262
six-tenths of a milligram
could kill an adult.

556
00:27:54,263 --> 00:27:56,573
That level is consistent with, well,

557
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,583
for example, improperly prepared fugu.

558
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:03,549
It's a blowfish.
Japanese delicacy.

559
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,142
Perhaps death was accidental?

560
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,386
Not likely.
His stomach was empty.

561
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,950
And even if it wasn't,
the saxitoxin levels were

562
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:13,354
a hundred times higher than he could have
possibly consumed by eating shellfish.

563
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:16,387
There's nothing in nature with
that high of a concentration.

564
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:18,345
During the 50s,

565
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:23,757
a suicide pill was synthesized
using contaminated butter clams.

566
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:27,075
- By who?
- Our old friends, The CIA.

567
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:35,731
Shepard.

568
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:37,832
Colonel-General Borov.

569
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,822
Who is this?

570
00:28:39,823 --> 00:28:41,675
I have located him.

571
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,440
Place de la Concorde.

572
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,561
Circle the obelisk.

573
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:52,767
I will be waiting where
Marie lost her head. Ten minutes.

574
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:57,514
Place de la Concorde.
And hit it.

575
00:28:57,515 --> 00:28:58,984
Yes, Director.

576
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,610
There he is. Pull over.

577
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:52,207
After Pulp Fiction,

578
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:56,255
a gun aimed my way in
a car makes me nervous.

579
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:58,554
Put it away, Hektor.

580
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:02,595
And turn around, Hektor.

581
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:05,653
This is to be a private conversation.

582
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:11,554
- Colonel-General Borov.
- No foreplay?

583
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,020
No time.

584
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,789
So American.

585
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,421
Is La Grenouille in Paris?

586
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:21,294
That's better.

587
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,919
No. He is in Nice.

588
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,392
I'm joining him later tonight.

589
00:31:26,393 --> 00:31:29,469
Why is the CIA helping me?

590
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,199
Perhaps we believe in righting a wrong.

591
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,242
Colonel-General Borov's address.

592
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,464
He's in a hospital?

593
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,690
Dying of lung cancer.

594
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,080
Pull over by the bridge.

595
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:51,486
There's an e-ticket in your name
with a visa at Charles de Gaulle.

596
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:55,959
Aeroflot Flight SU 252 to Moscow.

597
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,932
It departs in three hours.

598
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:05,299
Au revoir, Chérie.

599
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:57,060
We are trying to establish a timeline
of Farhan's final ride, Gibbs.

600
00:33:57,061 --> 00:34:00,703
Taxicab's on board computer
tracked his movements with a GPS,

601
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:03,555
and determined the fare based
on how many zones it crossed.

602
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:06,651
Our cabbie did not take the most
direct route from the Embassy.

603
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:08,679
This is America, Ziva.
Land of opportunity.

604
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,402
No cabbie ever takes the quickest route

605
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:13,025
He dropped down along the river,
circumvented the city center.

606
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:14,095
How much?

607
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,244
$27.65.

608
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:23,592
Hope you guys are on overtime.

609
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:27,063
Is this the route you took
to the Navy Yard this afternoon?

610
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:29,726
- More or less.
- More.

611
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:32,513
The fare was $27.65.

612
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:35,094
It does not match the distance
you said you traveled.

613
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:37,341
There was traffic.
I was trying to avoid it.

614
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,029
Got jammed up.
He wasn't complaining, you know?

615
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,003
Because he was dead.

616
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:49,355
The wife. I'm going to take this because
she scares me more than you guys.

617
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:50,995
Thelma?

618
00:34:50,996 --> 00:34:53,530
I made the switch.
Now get us the hell out of here.

619
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:55,314
I'm trying, Thelma, I'm trying.

620
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:57,977
Yeah, well, try harder, sweet pea.

621
00:34:57,978 --> 00:35:00,095
I'm pretty sure they're going
to let me go soon.

622
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:03,593
Well, they'd better, or you're
going to end up like your fare.

623
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:08,136
Love you, too, sweetheart.

624
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,030
Thelma's really getting worried.

625
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:11,245
The route.

626
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:15,216
Okay, so maybe I took the long way around.
What cabbie doesn't now and then?

627
00:35:15,217 --> 00:35:18,406
Report me to the commission.
I'll report myself to the commission.

628
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,936
Just tell me we're done.

629
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:22,549
Tell me I can get my cab
and go home to Thelma.

630
00:35:25,097 --> 00:35:28,579
Abby's done with the taxi
and he's been here all the day.

631
00:35:30,783 --> 00:35:31,794
Call the front gate.

632
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:33,656
Thank you.
Thank you...

633
00:35:36,495 --> 00:35:38,214
Just go home to your wife.

634
00:35:38,215 --> 00:35:42,285
Did I tell you Thelma and I are going
to take a cruise to the Bahamas?

635
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:54,484
Bingo.
So how did it get there, Abigail?

636
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,644
What are we watching?

637
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,142
It's an NSA decryption program scanning

638
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:08,284
all possible connections
between people on the list.

639
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:10,841
There's a five and a three
in all their Social Security numbers.

640
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:13,623
Except for Farhan, who didn't
have a Social Security card.

641
00:36:13,624 --> 00:36:15,787
I have the numbers three and five in mine.

642
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:17,829
- Me, too.
- That's it? No other connections?

643
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,724
- Nope.
- No common churches, social clubs,

644
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:22,423
schools, fraternities, nothing.

645
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:25,978
The only place these people
ever met was in the obituaries.

646
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:29,824
Pull up the full pages of the obituaries.

647
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,815
Where're your eyes go to?

648
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,160
The photos.

649
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,473
You think their names were randomly
picked from the obits?

650
00:36:38,474 --> 00:36:42,724
Gives the appeance of a hit list.
The only one actually murdered was Farhan.

651
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:44,725
- Why?
- To distract us.

652
00:36:44,726 --> 00:36:46,253
Gibbs.

653
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:50,036
Unless this foam grew legs,
something weird is going on.

654
00:36:50,037 --> 00:36:53,725
Not that polrethane foam growing
legs isn't weird in the first place,

655
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:56,949
but this is the foam that we found
on the floor of the taxi,

656
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,845
- and this foam is exactly the same.
- The point.

657
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:03,912
Well, I just found this foam
inside the evidence lock-up.

658
00:37:07,188 --> 00:37:08,618
David.

659
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:12,858
Too late, he's gone.

660
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:19,304
- Speed it up.
- 15's the limit.

661
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:22,090
Never had my ass give me orders.

662
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:24,728
- What?
- Main gate's coming up.

663
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,787
Hi, NCIS call about me?

664
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:31,073
They did, sir.

665
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,096
Both hands on the wheel.

666
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:35,756
Okay, okay, whatever you say.

667
00:37:35,757 --> 00:37:37,228
Step out of the taxi.

668
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:39,663
Hands on the wheel or step out?
I can't do both.

669
00:37:39,664 --> 00:37:40,989
Guess.

670
00:37:42,141 --> 00:37:43,444
Oh, man.

671
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:47,227
Both hands on the hood.

672
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:48,892
What is this, Baghdad?

673
00:37:50,216 --> 00:37:52,211
Gibbs! Thank God you're here.

674
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,505
Tell these GIrines I can go.

675
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,809
- Clear.
- Clear? It's empty.

676
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,781
- Front or back?
- What?

677
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:00,995
Which seat?!

678
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:02,978
Which seat?
What are you talking about?

679
00:38:02,979 --> 00:38:05,731
The accomplice you smuggled
into the evidence lock-up.

680
00:38:05,732 --> 00:38:07,421
Accomplice?

681
00:38:07,422 --> 00:38:10,979
Thelma looks like you when she's pissed,
only she doesn't have a gun, thank God.

682
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,541
Front or back?

683
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:14,441
Front, front.

684
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:15,744
Name?

685
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:18,043
Mario Vincetti.

686
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,167
Mario!
Special Agent Gibbs. Come out.

687
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:22,996
Slowly, hands first.

688
00:38:22,997 --> 00:38:24,697
There's no sense in getting...

689
00:38:25,313 --> 00:38:27,413
Don't shoot. I'm coming out.

690
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,961
I said drive faster.

691
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:38,404
And to think I pitied a murderer.

692
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:41,454
Murderer?
That guy was murdered?

693
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,804
I didn't know.
I ain't no murderer.

694
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:48,469
Mario told me the guy was a stiff they
got from a funeral home. Tell them.

695
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:51,174
Let Scoletti's lawyers
do the talking, dummy.

696
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:53,559
Scoletti's lawyers got us into this mess.

697
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,590
Shut up!

698
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,912
Honest, I didn't know they killed the guy.

699
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,618
I was going to get ten grand,

700
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,161
take Thelma on a Princess
cruise to the Bahamas.

701
00:39:01,162 --> 00:39:02,279
A second honeymoon.

702
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:05,094
We never had a first.

703
00:39:08,331 --> 00:39:11,285
Tell her enough with the evil eye.
It reminds me of my mother.

704
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:13,087
You're comparing me to your mother.

705
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:15,892
Just the eyes,
maybe a little around the mouth.

706
00:39:15,928 --> 00:39:18,643
Permission to shoot?

707
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:31,387
And you come all the way from
America to see my grandfather?

708
00:39:31,388 --> 00:39:34,701
Actually, I was in Paris
when I found out he was ill.

709
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:36,787
He is dying.

710
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:39,661
This week, perhaps next.

711
00:39:40,103 --> 00:39:41,271
Lung cancer.

712
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,156
I'm sorry.

713
00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:46,533
Still, you must have flown
half the day to get here.

714
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,943
I'm writing my father's biography.

715
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:51,850
He and the Colonel-General
were close friends.

716
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:53,704
They were adversaries, yes?

717
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:56,566
Sometimes adversaries
make the best friends.

718
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:02,259
Most days the morphine affects his memory.

719
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:06,104
Let's hope this isn't one of them.

720
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:30,324
Stuff the crocus.

721
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:31,853
Do you have a cigarette?

722
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:34,613
Cigarettes put you here.

723
00:40:34,614 --> 00:40:38,749
Oh, what are they going to do?
Kill me twice?

724
00:40:49,607 --> 00:40:52,901
It appears to be a good day.
I will find a vase.

725
00:40:58,607 --> 00:41:01,222
Do you have a cigarette?

726
00:41:26,322 --> 00:41:28,784
Your father and I swapped

727
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:32,748
Cuban cigars for American cigarettes.

728
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:40,699
Like vodka.

729
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,115
It does not burn so much the second time.

730
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:52,123
You... did not come all this way...

731
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:55,623
to watch an old man die.

732
00:41:55,624 --> 00:41:57,111
No.

733
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:04,098
I came for your signature.

734
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:06,595
What does it say?

735
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:11,666
That you verified the destruction of
Warsaw Pact weapons

736
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,838
that were in fact acquired

737
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,084
by an arms dealer known as La Grenouille.

738
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:21,984
Are you angry at your father?

739
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,877
No. Why would you even think that?

740
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:32,554
We had to mutually verify.

741
00:42:33,113 --> 00:42:36,572
La Grenouille paid him, too.

742
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:38,113
That's a lie.

743
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:41,464
A dying man does not lie.

744
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,561
Ask your father.

745
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:47,534
My father's dead.

746
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:51,277
He beat me to it.

747
00:42:52,615 --> 00:42:55,158
- When?
- 12 years ago.

748
00:42:57,964 --> 00:42:59,713
The old fox.

749
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:05,748
One last move on the game, huh?

750
00:43:07,229 --> 00:43:11,284
My father has been dead since '95.

751
00:43:18,364 --> 00:43:21,737
He stood where you stand...

752
00:43:22,864 --> 00:43:25,239
three weeks ago,

753
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,570
smoking a cigar.

754
