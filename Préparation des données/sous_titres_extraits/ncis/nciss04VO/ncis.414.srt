www.Team-NCIS.com

7
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,812
"TV drama." Eight letters. Down.

8
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,705
Uh...St. Elsewhere.

9
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:28,693
Morning, sunshine!

10
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:32,100
Where am I?

11
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:33,886
Tenerife.

12
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:36,875
Which is, uh,
the Canary Islands.

13
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:38,802
We're almost there.

14
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,128
Where?

15
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:44,294
Hey, what kind of clubs
do they have in Morocco?

16
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:45,857
We're not going to Morocco.

17
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:46,420
Come on.

18
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:47,090
On the way back?

19
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:49,233
On the way back
from where?

20
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:51,777
Oh, I'm sorry, they only
gave you a one-way ticket.

21
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,589
Who "they"?

22
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:55,960
Here's the deal:

23
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:57,885
We jump into Casablanca,

24
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:00,922
hit Rick's Cafe for a little,
uh, cocktail.

25
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:02,995
I could tickle the ivories.
"Here's looking at you, kid."

26
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:05,296
And then we're back
to D. C., nobody knows.

27
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:06,772
Who are you people?!

28
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:08,671
Couriers.

29
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,826
Delivering a package as a favor
to our Israeli friends.

30
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:14,726
Package, huh?

31
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:16,607
Don't take it
personal...

32
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,608
Goliath.

33
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,672
Yeah, can I ask
you about that?

34
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:21,172
Every arms dealer
I meet, they have

35
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:23,008
the cheesiest
code names.

36
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:25,610
I mean, "Goliath"
did you choose that?

37
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:26,906
You are CIA, yes?

38
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,515
Oh, this should
be interesting.

39
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:37,830
Goliath, I'd like you to meet
one of our Israeli friends.

40
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,058
You are a traitor,

41
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,989
to our country and our people.

42
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:44,573
I have never sell weapons to
Hamas or Hezbollah!

43
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,059
You sell to people who do.

44
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,988
You're lucky she doesn't
have her slingshot.

45
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,863
Still waiting for
clearance to take off.

46
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:55,549
The pilot says we'll
only be on the ground

47
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,549
for a couple of minutes
when we reach Zaire.

48
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,801
It's much too dangerous
to stay there any longer.

49
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:01,802
Zaire?

50
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:04,177
You're taking me to Zaire?

51
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,308
You sold a shipment
of RPGs to their army.

52
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:10,240
They were very disappointed with
the quality of the merchandise.

53
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,291
I believe the President
of Zaire himself

54
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,741
is eager to discuss
how you stiffed him.

55
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:17,114
He, in turn, has some
information Mossad needs.

56
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:18,740
And we owe Mossad
a little favor

57
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,740
'cause they told us
you were in D. C., and...

58
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:21,916
so here we are.

59
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,927
We deliver you to Zaire,

60
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:25,803
the President gives the Israelis
whatever information

61
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:28,109
they want, and everyone is happy.

62
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:31,162
Well, not everyone.

63
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:33,565
We've been cleared for takeoff.
Fasten your seatbelts.

64
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:37,481
Please, I-I am very wealthy.

65
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:38,923
I have diamonds.

66
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:41,762
You, uh, had diamonds.

67
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:43,693
This jet is very
expensive,

68
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,624
and somebody had to pay for it.

69
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,739
I know things.

70
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:48,618
Yeah.

71
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,764
How to trade weapons
for diamonds, we got that.

72
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:54,086
I'll trade information.

73
00:04:56,744 --> 00:05:00,529
And what could you know
that would interest the CIA?

74
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,006
He thinks we're the CIA?

75
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,315
Why not?

76
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:11,152
CIA, FBI, NSA
what difference does it make?

77
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,540
I have information to trade
for my life.

78
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:20,307
ARES.

79
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,306
Cancer.

80
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:23,182
Virgo.

81
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:24,183
Scorpio.

82
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,996
No, your Navy's encrypted
satellite system.

83
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:29,997
Not my Navy.

84
00:05:30,557 --> 00:05:31,745
The American Navy.

85
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:35,121
They use it to send target
coordinates to cruise missiles.

86
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:37,712
Did you get that
out of Jane's, Goliath?

87
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:39,517
What if Iran
possessed it?

88
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,555
Or North Korea?

89
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:42,684
In the war,

90
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:45,496
they could intercept and change
cruise missile coordinates,

91
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:47,622
send them to Tel Aviv, Seoul,

92
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,265
or even return to sender.

93
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:52,933
But they don't have ARES.

94
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:53,934
Sit back, relax,

95
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:56,975
and try to enjoy the rest
of your miserable life.

96
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:58,981
ARES is for sale.

97
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,575
I know who's selling it.

98
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,435
The guy we're after
is Charles Harrow.

99
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:11,310
There should be an e-mail from
him on Goliath's computer.

100
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:12,851
Charles Harrow, right.

101
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,778
We have to tell him.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Tell me what?

103
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,686
Wow, Gibbs,
nothing wrong with your hearing.

104
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,499
Boss, this may take awhile.

105
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,248
Hey, McGee,
even I can download an e-mail.

106
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,811
Well, you know your user name
and password.

107
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:27,683
We haven't even
penetrated Goliath's

108
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:29,311
screen saver yet, Gibbs.

109
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:32,530
Which is a bitchin' picture
of a Greek island.

110
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,981
At least, I think
it's a Greek island.

111
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:36,937
It's definitely the Aegean Sea.
That blue is too...

112
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,938
Paragon.

113
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,939
Paragon.

114
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:42,062
Hey! I was just doing

115
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:43,502
what Gibbs would do
if he was here.

116
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,868
"Paragon" is Goliath's user name.

117
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:50,396
Okay, uh, boss, you wouldn't
happen to have...

118
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:54,083
Delta, seven, one, Zulu, three,
nine, Kilo, five.

119
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,131
Huh. We're in.

120
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,962
Gibbs, you slayed Goliath!

121
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,717
Well, Abbs, it was either him or you.

122
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:14,565
This isn't Tenerife.

123
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:17,330
Well, I told them to
take a left at Bermuda.

124
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:27,818
This is Tony.

125
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,277
Boss, found that e-mail.

126
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,350
Harrow has a villa for sale on Santorini.
That's...

127
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,067
- Greek island in the Aegean.
- Right.

128
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:37,514
And he's asking $20 million,
but Goliath

129
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:39,184
- doesn't want to pay more than...
- Fifteen.

130
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:41,713
But, uh, but I don't think
that the villa...

131
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:43,347
Is what he's selling.

132
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:44,632
Right.

133
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:48,318
So I've pulled
everything that I can find

134
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,094
on Charles Andrew Harrow.

135
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:53,133
Age 68,
civilian encryption specialist,

136
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:56,256
employed by the DOD until
he retired three years ago.

137
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:58,444
His most notable
project was...

138
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,137
ARES. Top secret
Navy encrypted satellite

139
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,038
targeting system named after...

140
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,490
Greek god of war.

141
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:04,946
Right.

142
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,195
That all?

143
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,695
No.

144
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:10,021
No, I'm also, uh,

145
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,285
running Harrow's phone
and e-mail records

146
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,259
for the past 90 days against
databases of known arms dealers.

147
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,196
No hits yet,
but I did just start.

148
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,384
205 Rosewood Drive,
Northwest D. C.

149
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:20,759
Is that address still good?

150
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,875
Far as I know.

151
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,900
DiNozzo, Ziva, go get him.

152
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:28,383
Uh, Gibbs...

153
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:35,011
McGee.

154
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:36,198
Right.

155
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:40,473
I'm telling you,

156
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:42,697
my pulse is racing, Doctor.

157
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:43,946
My heart is throbbing.

158
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:47,463
I've done a self-diagnosis here,
and, uh, it's not good.

159
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:50,152
I need some relief
from the good doctor.

160
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,199
I got to go.

161
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:55,683
I was just, um...

162
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:58,013
I got to go back to work.

163
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,201
These streets
are like a maze.

164
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:08,513
I told you I couldn't
program the navigator.

165
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,169
I'm a driver.

166
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,687
Ziva, I've driven
with you before.

167
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,395
I'd rather be
lost than dead.

168
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:17,335
205 Rosewood Drive, Northwest.
That's it.

169
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,234
It's the one with a car pulling out
of the driveway.

170
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:21,075
We could race ahead,
swerve right,

171
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:23,081
brake hard and cut him off.

172
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,283
Or we could just
wait for him to stop.

173
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:31,361
Uploading Goliath's file
into the database, boss.

174
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,079
Briefing paper?

175
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:35,201
Done.

176
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:36,639
Audio of interrogation?

177
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,885
Being transcribed.

178
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:40,952
You know, Goliath's right, boss.

179
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:42,253
Iran, North Korea,

180
00:09:42,702 --> 00:09:44,138
even some of our allies

181
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,446
would pay a fortune
to get their hands on ARES.

182
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:49,113
Do you think, DiNozzo?

183
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:01,703
Looks like McGee's got a name
match off of Harrow's e-mails.

184
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:02,704
Trent Kort.

185
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:06,466
He's on the FBI
arms dealer watch list.

186
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,330
How old?

187
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:09,453
Uh, five days.

188
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:11,944
McGee's computer.

189
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:15,449
Ah, bio's thin.

190
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:17,329
Trent Thomas Kort, 37 years old,

191
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,393
British national,
believed to have

192
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:20,639
recently joined...

193
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,212
<i>Smile was for me, dear boy.</i>

194
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:34,935
You know this guy?

195
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:37,535
No, never seen him before.

196
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:39,519
Hawaiian shirts.

197
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:43,145
Believed to have recently
joined La Grenouille,

198
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,442
an international
arms dealer,

199
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:47,020
fronting corporations in Paris,

200
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,632
Nairobi, Cape Town.

201
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,148
I know...

202
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:05,521
Uh... sorry.

203
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:07,092
Cynthia wasn't
at her desk, so...

204
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,999
So you barged in,
DiNozzo?

205
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:11,417
That should hold until you
get home, Director.

206
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,786
Thank you, Cynthia.

207
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:20,518
I broke a bra strap and I had

208
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,360
Cynthia get me a safety pin.

209
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,126
I don't even know why
I'm telling you this.

210
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,385
To ease the awkwardness
of the moment.

211
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,461
We know each other
so well, Tony,

212
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:33,532
there are no awkward moments.

213
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,288
Yeah.

214
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:36,836
May I?

215
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:43,050
Charles Harrow.

216
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:45,798
- Retired puzzle maker.
- For who?

217
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,217
Us. Literally us.

218
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,504
He designed ARES.

219
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:51,015
It's the Navy's crus...

220
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:54,031
...missile targeting system.
He come out of retirement?

221
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:56,046
In a way.

222
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:57,160
He's offering ARES

223
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,552
in a one-off to
the highest bidder.

224
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:01,678
La Grenouille?

225
00:12:01,873 --> 00:12:04,109
He's one of the bidders.

226
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,547
How did we come by this?

227
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:07,793
Mossad passed
intel on to Ziva

228
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,613
about an international
arms dealer,

229
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:10,974
code name, Goliath.

230
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,859
I've heard of him.
He's Israeli.

231
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,865
And Ziva didn't
take too kindly to that.

232
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,304
He's rumored
to be bidding

233
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,241
on a stolen Navy
weapons system.

234
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:21,929
We snatched him
this morning.

235
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,866
Got him downstairs
on a visa violation

236
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,931
and his computer's
in Abby's lab.

237
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:26,932
And...

238
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,366
We were running
Harrow's cell calls

239
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,556
and e-mails for known arms
dealers when...

240
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:34,568
...this guy popped off
an FBI watch list.

241
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,763
His name is
Trent Kart.

242
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,179
You took that picture
eight weeks ago.

243
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,806
Why are we just
getting a name now?

244
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:43,386
I have no idea.

245
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:46,448
I ran that photo against
all agency watch lists,

246
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:48,441
including the FBI and
I got nothing.

247
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:50,159
Doesn't matter.

248
00:12:52,184 --> 00:12:53,184
This is good.

249
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:54,799
And it's bad.

250
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:56,156
I had to lie to Gibbs.

251
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,232
You were on
an undercover mission.

252
00:12:58,274 --> 00:13:00,619
- He's my boss.
- And I'm his boss.

253
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,057
You leave him to me.

254
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,309
Your ass is covered.

255
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,366
I'm not worried
about my ass, Jenny.

256
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,749
Gibbs put Harrow
under surveillance?

257
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:10,843
No.

258
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
No?

259
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:14,803
He sent Ziva and
McGee to pick him up.

260
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:18,584
Cynthia, get Agent Gibbs
in here ASAP.

261
00:13:22,496 --> 00:13:24,611
You sent for me, director?

262
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:28,455
Call Ziva and McGee off.

263
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,391
Off, director?

264
00:13:31,438 --> 00:13:33,380
They are not to pick up...

265
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:35,372
Harrow.

266
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:36,687
Harrow.

267
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:42,080
Charles Harrow is
offering a top secret

268
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,817
Navy weapons system
to the highest bidder.

269
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:46,872
It could be in the hands
of Iraq or China...

270
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:49,483
Dammed Jethro !
This is an order. Call them off!

271
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,624
Just when you begin

272
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,498
to assimilate
to American culture

273
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,873
you see a grown man
getting his nails done.

274
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:01,161
There's nothing
wrong with a man

275
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:04,312
treating himself
to a manicure.

276
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,715
Don't tell me, McGee.

277
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:13,055
I have sensitive cuticles.

278
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,586
- It's Gibbs.
- Answer it.

279
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:34,626
Yeah, boss?

280
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:39,817
Yes?

281
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:41,817
Uh, sweet cheeks,
it's okay.

282
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,950
We're all set.

283
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:45,004
We are?

284
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,182
Yeah, my brother
just called to give me directions.

285
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:49,069
The Washington Monument,

286
00:14:49,128 --> 00:14:51,040
who'd have thought it'd
be so tough to find?

287
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,936
- Thanks anyway.
- No problem.

288
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,415
What just happened?

289
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,596
Change of plans.

290
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,696
Follow, do not approach.

291
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,480
You haven't been straight
with me since I...

292
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:10,546
- Quit?
 - Retired.

293
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,908
When you left on your
margarita safari,

294
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:14,445
Margarita safari?

295
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,793
This agency
didn't shut down.

296
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:19,416
New operations
were put in motion.

297
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,784
- One sent Tony undercover.
- Well, I'm back,

298
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:24,293
and I won't have a part-time
senior field agent.

299
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:25,497
It's your own fault, you know.

300
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,531
For what?
Leaving or coming back?

301
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,018
For teaching me your rules.

302
00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:32,481
Best way to keep a secret:

303
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:34,907
keep it to yourself.
Second best:

304
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:37,566
tell one other person
if you must.

305
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,130
There is no third best.

306
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:42,543
That's rule
number four, isn't it?

307
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:45,943
Number One supersedes
all of the others.

308
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,288
Never screw your partner?

309
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,625
Never screw over your partner.

310
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,000
I never screwed you over.

311
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:59,294
And I'm not your partner.

312
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:00,890
I'm your boss.

313
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:08,734
McGee's search is kicking out another bidder.

314
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:09,735
Hey, boss?

315
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,332
McGee's got something.

316
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:15,236
What is it with these
wacky code names?

317
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:16,484
Anonymity deflects

318
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:18,555
more bullets than body armor.

319
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,081
This one's a woman.

320
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:22,792
The Black Rose.

321
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:24,270
Rose O'Leary.

322
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,172
She ran guns for the IRA

323
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:27,768
until peace broke out.

324
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,422
- Who's flagged her?
- MI-5.

325
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,303
They were tracking
her in Africa.

326
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,672
Lost contact six days ago.

327
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:34,951
They think she
slipped aboard a Varig

328
00:16:34,998 --> 00:16:38,025
flight to Brazil using
the name Grace O'Malley.

329
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,520
That's funny, director?

330
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:42,914
Grace O'Malley

331
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,539
was a 16th century
Irish pirate.

332
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,725
What's her bid?

333
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,425
Less than La Grenouille.

334
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,426
Only 18 mil.

335
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:54,056
Unless her bid was in euros.

336
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:57,864
Dollars.

337
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,530
It was in dollars.

338
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,910
You think he'll ever forgive us?

339
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:06,059
Send me a hard copy
when the data's in.

340
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:09,917
Yeah, that's what I think, too.

341
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:27,983
You following me?

342
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:31,002
No. Why would I do that?

343
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,535
Just asking myself
the same question.

344
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:42,189
Want me to run some water?

345
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:45,428
No, I'm all right,
I just...

346
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,319
Ah, just say it,
DiNozzo.

347
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:48,979
I'm sorry, boss.

348
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:50,805
I, uh...

349
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:52,932
I've been wanting to tell you
for a long time,

350
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:53,994
but, the situation is...

351
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:54,995
Complicated?

352
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:57,305
Exactly.

353
00:17:57,782 --> 00:17:58,967
Director's got this
really strict

354
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,470
- rule about...
- Secrets?

355
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:03,994
Yeah.

356
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,671
The point is, I owe
you everything.

357
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:08,263
You taught me
how to do this job.

358
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,349
And I never wanted
to lie to you.

359
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:12,006
Well, DiNozzo, you were
following orders.

360
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,140
I'd have done the same thing.

361
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:14,405
- Would you?
- Yeah.

362
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,387
You would've lied
to Mike Franks?

363
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:51,178
You know, they pretend
and they do a little

364
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,296
different, you know?
But it's all the same.

365
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,893
I want to see what you
want to say about it.

366
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:58,272
Uh, look, uh, will settle
something for me and my friends

367
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,505
We really need a
woman's point of view.

368
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:01,737
Hey, go ask your mom.

369
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:03,357
It's a simple question.

370
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,749
Let go of me.

371
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:05,516
See, I told you.

372
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:07,318
All beautiful
women are bitches.

373
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:15,983
He's spoted us!

374
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,471
We've got a man down
with a heart attack.

375
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:59,339
In front of the steps.

376
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,293
You were suppose to keep Mr. Harrow

377
00:20:09,294 --> 00:20:11,652
under surveillance,
not chase him into a coronary.

378
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,451
Director, once he made us

379
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,482
we had to take him
into custody, didn't we?

380
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:17,742
No, the director is right.
We could've let Harrow escape.

381
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:18,972
If he sold ARES,
we could've caught

382
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,335
Black Rose, La grenouille,
Iran or Syria...

383
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:23,228
Don't get cute Officer David.

384
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:25,122
I'm saying there had
to be a better way.

385
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,249
Right, Tony?

386
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,702
That's right, Director.
they've could...

387
00:20:28,703 --> 00:20:29,378
...Shot him.

388
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:30,458
That's right, they could've shot him.

389
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:32,856
Of course in high octane situations,

390
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,483
 Ziva will reverse
back to her Mossad training,

391
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,241
and probably would've put
a round through his heart.

392
00:20:37,242 --> 00:20:39,026
- Three rounds.
- And McGee,

393
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:40,382
Not to be outdone would've...

394
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:41,012
Added three more rounds.

395
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,245
- Gibbs.
- See?

396
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:44,985
There you go.

397
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:47,141
Six rounds, same result:

398
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:49,687
one dead Mr. Harrow.

399
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:52,043
I signed for the body.
Cause of death

400
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,639
was most likely, uh...

401
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,480
am I interrupting?

402
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:58,401
Not at all, doctor.

403
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:00,610
We were just discussing
the various ways

404
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:02,486
NCIS could have
killed Mr. Harrow

405
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:04,557
besides chasing him to death.

406
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:08,045
- I am interrupting.
- Doctor, "death was most

407
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:09,990
likely caused by"?

408
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:11,581
A myocardial infarction.

409
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:15,161
Most probably brought on
by a combination

410
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:17,048
of a high-fat
Western diet,

411
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,612
little exercise and the mistaken

412
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,988
belief that he could
run up all those stairs.

413
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,889
Rigorous for most,
rigor mortis for him.

414
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,736
Anything else?

415
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:27,670
Not until I do the autopsy.

416
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:32,996
What is going on?

417
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,030
I think the director
is afraid Harrow's family

418
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:36,283
might sue us.

419
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:39,235
Well, whatever she's
thinking about, it's not ARES.

420
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:42,488
That's ARES?

421
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:44,345
According to McGeek.

422
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:46,729
Ziva!
Watch the road !

423
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,004
I have great
peripheral vision.

424
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:48,948
My sphincter doesn't.

425
00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:51,054
Well, at least we won't
have trouble finding it.

426
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,363
Really?

427
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,184
Tony, it's the
size of an ATM!

428
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:58,707
Well, this is the controller
console, and is...

429
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:02,349
- Your mystery woman!
- Watch the road.

430
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:04,674
Oh, yes it is, isn't it?

431
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:06,012
No, this is no one.

432
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:07,923
This is McGee's
idea of a prank.

433
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:11,361
This is the pirated part
of ARES we have to find.

434
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:13,601
$20 million for that?!

435
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:16,401
Well, size doesn't matter.

436
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:20,585
Forget I even stupidly
started to say that.

437
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:27,607
Will you tell me her name

438
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,057
if I find the pirate's
copy of ARES?

439
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:31,089
- Pirated copy.
- That was I said.

440
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,738
No, you said
"pirate's copy."

441
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,673
A pirate is a person
like Captain Jack Sparrow.

442
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,503
- A pirated copy...
- Who is Jack Sparrow?

443
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,189
- Johnny Depp.
- He's a pirate?

444
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,142
No, he's an actor.

445
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,547
- How did we get here?
- I drove.

446
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:56,234
This is going to be like looking
for a needle in a needle stack.

447
00:22:56,829 --> 00:22:58,242
Needle in a haystack.

448
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,833
I like my description better.

449
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:26,099
Sitting in the dark, staring
at photos of your enemies

450
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,237
could be considered
obsessive.

451
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,947
Kind of like building
a fourth boat,

452
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:34,330
when you haven't even
sailed the first three.

453
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:37,122
How well do you
know the Black Rose?

454
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:38,949
Well, enough to know
that I'd like her

455
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,772
if she wasn't
an arms dealer.

456
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:43,514
And the Frog?

457
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,216
La Grenouille.

458
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,249
It means "the frog."

459
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,929
I know what it means.

460
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,731
Then why don't
you call him that?

461
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,567
La Grenouille
is his code name.

462
00:23:57,613 --> 00:23:59,156
Well,

463
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:01,835
I'm going to
call him "Frog."

464
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:10,251
Spit it out, Jethro,
before it gags you.

465
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:11,536
You were out
of control today.

466
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:12,978
Why?

467
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:15,114
The deal died with Harrow.

468
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:18,483
His copy of ARES
might still be in play.

469
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:20,432
You don't want ARES,
you want him.

470
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:22,097
Damn right, I want him!

471
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:23,639
I have been trying for a decade

472
00:24:23,682 --> 00:24:25,725
to bring him down.

473
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,345
So it is personal.

474
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,078
What did he do to you, Jenny?

475
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,759
You have no need to know,
Special Agent Gibbs.

476
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:54,381
Wow, McGee, this is like
Christmas all over again.

477
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:57,473
Look at this baby.

478
00:24:57,526 --> 00:24:59,155
Firewire, USB...

479
00:24:59,223 --> 00:25:00,612
a terabyte of storage...

480
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:02,594
That's a thousand
gigabytes of fun.

481
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:04,221
No, to be accurate,

482
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:06,915
it's 1,024 gigabytes of fun.

483
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,460
And I bet you all of them
are encrypted.

484
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,056
It could take us years
to access all this stuff

485
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,034
on these computers.

486
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,697
You didn't think it was
going to be easy, did you?

487
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,704
Hoping I'd get lucky.

488
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:20,882
Guess I wasn't the only one
hoping to get lucky.

489
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,300
These have been
opened and resealed.

490
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:32,873
SD micro-drives.

491
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:34,021
Six of them.

492
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:35,402
ARES.

493
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:37,605
The software portion.

494
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:38,991
We still need to find
the circuit board.

495
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,205
It's got to be
here somewhere.

496
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:49,143
I guess everything can't
be state of the art.

497
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:51,307
That laptop's got to
be nearly 20 years old.

498
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:54,242
Hey, maybe it has
the original Donkey Kong on it.

499
00:25:56,957 --> 00:25:57,862
McGee...

500
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:01,788
how can a 20-year-old computer
have dual firewire connections?

501
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:03,432
It can't.

502
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:05,682
Firewire's only
been around about ten years.

503
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:08,245
Somebody should
have told Harrow.

504
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,970
Sure looks like
an old luggable.

505
00:26:15,435 --> 00:26:18,233
All right, should
take at least 30 seconds...

506
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,785
for this to...

507
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,516
That cunning old fox, he put
a new computer in an old skin.

508
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:27,880
I like this guy.

509
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:28,659
I mean,

510
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,980
aside from the fact that he was
about to commit treason.

511
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,958
That's the same
screensaver

512
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:34,465
that Goliath had.

513
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,780
I bet you the circuitry
to run ARES

514
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:39,939
is hardwired
into the motherboard.

515
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:42,065
Abbs, I think
we found ARES.

516
00:26:42,315 --> 00:26:44,102
Yes!

517
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,555
The software was stored on
micro-drives hidden in condoms.

518
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,821
We analyzed every detail,
the source code,

519
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,110
to the circuitry
of the motherboard...

520
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:57,301
McGee.

521
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:01,006
It's like PS-3,
you can't play "Killzone"

522
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,908
without the hardware to run it.

523
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:04,579
PS-3?

524
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:06,023
Game console.

525
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:07,163
Atari?

526
00:27:07,997 --> 00:27:09,940
Commodore 64.

527
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,147
Software is useless without the hardware

528
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:14,078
- You got it.
- Why didn't you just say that?

529
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:15,798
You found ARES?

530
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:18,018
Yes, here it is, Director.

531
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:19,842
Live from Abby's lab.

532
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:22,812
You don't seem very happy.

533
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,610
Any more bids?

534
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,087
Nope.

535
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:27,248
La Grenouille
was the high one.

536
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:28,176
Not that it matters.

537
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:29,684
Get Harrow we will arrange the drop-off

538
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:31,134
I checked his Blackberry.

539
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:32,837
This guy writes
down every appointment

540
00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:34,078
and meeting, nothing.

541
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:37,359
No phone calls or e-mails in the
last six hours before he died.

542
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,331
We were monitoring his...

543
00:27:42,157 --> 00:27:43,524
He had coffee.

544
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:48,521
The cafe had internet access.

545
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:50,104
Trimana Cafe,

546
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:51,732
35th Street.

547
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:53,058
Got it.

548
00:27:53,224 --> 00:27:54,684
ISP provider...

549
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:58,533
Can you do this to
anyone's e-mail?

550
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,974
No, because this
is highly illegal

551
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:03,264
and I'm not even
doing it now.

552
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:05,084
Okay, we're in.

553
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:09,125
At 1:40 this afternoon,
Harrow sent two emails

554
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:12,627
from that ISP,
one to Black Rose...

555
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,723
Telling her the bad
news, no doubt.

556
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:16,554
And one to La Grenouille.

557
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,036
"Congratulations on the winning
bid. Upon receipt of your funds,

558
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,334
title to the
Santorini Villa at"--

559
00:28:22,478 --> 00:28:24,608
he lists the GPS coordinates--

560
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,475
"will be transferred
at midnight, Tuesday."

561
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:28,602
That's ten minutes from now.

562
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:30,035
Same time zone as Israel.

563
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:32,610
McGee, put that email
up on the plasma.

564
00:28:38,228 --> 00:28:40,773
Those coordinates
aren't in Greece.

565
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:49,723
It's Quebec.

566
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:52,449
We've got five hours.

567
00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:53,987
Aren't you forgetting
something?

568
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:55,520
I am not going to
let a few miles

569
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:57,161
of Canadian border stop me.

570
00:28:57,353 --> 00:28:59,178
That's not what I meant.

571
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:03,125
The Frog is expecting
to meet Harrow.

572
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:05,867
And Charles Harrow is dead.

573
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:18,135
Aeroport de Sherbrooke,
southeastern Quebec.

574
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:20,064
It's 30 miles across the border

575
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,289
from New Hampshire.

576
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,342
That puts La Grenouille
right in our backyard.

577
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:27,556
Did I miss Quebec becoming
the 51st state?

578
00:29:27,604 --> 00:29:31,277
I'm not going to watch that
bastard fly away again, Jethro.

579
00:29:31,324 --> 00:29:32,344
I can.

580
00:29:32,392 --> 00:29:33,490
Why don't we snatch him
when he lands,

581
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:36,540
toss him in the back of the
trunk and drive over the border?

582
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,942
That might work where you grew
up, Ziva, not here.

583
00:29:39,005 --> 00:29:40,419
Why not.

584
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:43,403
Okay, I'm down with
the border snatch.

585
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:44,475
What do we charge him with?

586
00:29:44,518 --> 00:29:45,806
Bidding on a Greek villa?

587
00:29:45,841 --> 00:29:48,577
Tony's right, we've got
nothing on Grenouille

588
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:51,046
And since Harrow's dead,
that can't happen.

589
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:53,231
Does the Frog know
that Harrow's dead?

590
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:54,177
Probably not.

591
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:55,667
And if he never met him...

592
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:59,127
All we need is a 68-year-
old Englishman.

593
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:05,136
Is it pronounced
Harrow or Hairrow?

594
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:07,279
Harrow, Ducky.

595
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,038
Charles Andrew Harrow.

596
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:10,294
Okay, Ducky, now
pay attention.

597
00:30:10,362 --> 00:30:12,147
- ARES...
- Are you certain?

598
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:15,610
'Cause I was in medical school
with an Ian Hairrow.

599
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:17,610
He spelled it the same way.

600
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:20,430
Ducky, please pay attention,
I-I'm trying to give

601
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:22,795
of the Navy's most complex
weapons systems.

602
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:23,360
Sorry.

603
00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:25,235
You look dashing, Ducky.

604
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,597
Yes, I used to wear
a moustache in Singapore

605
00:30:27,598 --> 00:30:28,785
when I was attached to...

606
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:31,544
ARES is an encryption
decryption system.

607
00:30:31,602 --> 00:30:34,438
Means it is used to encode
and decode information.

608
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:37,845
In this case, GPS targeting information
for the Navy's cruise missiles.

609
00:30:37,846 --> 00:30:41,396
It operates by using the
algorithm known as IDEA.

610
00:30:41,722 --> 00:30:44,365
It's the same algorithm
used for all

611
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:45,974
RSA Legacy keys

612
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:47,913
generated by PGP.

613
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:49,912
It uses a variable-length key,

614
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:53,130
from 32 bits to 448 bits.

615
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,849
Questions so far?

616
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:56,918
You sure it's not Hairrow?

617
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:01,410
It's a ten-hour drive
to the Canadian border.

618
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:02,722
We're going to have to go
without a surveillan van.

619
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:04,253
I've got it covered.

620
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:06,233
She's got it covered? How?

621
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,000
Let's just say it's a favor

622
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:11,193
you and I couldn't
have called in.

623
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:16,039
I know it doesn't
look like much,

624
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,831
but inside is 20 million bucks
worth of ARES.

625
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:21,628
Guard it with your life.

626
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,394
Of course.

627
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:27,251
I find a little levity

628
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,852
at the start of
a mission relaxing.

629
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:31,983
Boss, we got a problem.

630
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,434
Just one, McGee?

631
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:36,312
Grenouille is sure to have
someone there to vet ARES.

632
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,062
You know, if
someone asks Ducky

633
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,543
to explain something,

634
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:41,688
his duck is cooked,

635
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:42,869
no pun intended.

636
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,469
Well...

637
00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:48,129
that's why you're going
to be there with him, McGee.

638
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,339
Okay, just rember, Ducky.

639
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:52,423
Charles.

640
00:31:52,754 --> 00:31:53,732
What?

641
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,833
My name is Charles Harrow.

642
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,966
Charles...

643
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,131
we've got a plane to catch.

644
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,902
Yes, and an arms dealer.

645
00:32:07,381 --> 00:32:10,345
Uh, mind if I have
the window seat?

646
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:16,006
Gulf stream Five.

647
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:18,604
Registration: 2-1-8 Echo.

648
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:20,176
Copy you, Archangel.

649
00:32:20,883 --> 00:32:23,382
They flew into Washington
on a different G-5

650
00:32:23,383 --> 00:32:25,530
- when I tagged the luggage.
- Tagged their luggage?

651
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:28,097
Oh... that's when
Jenny had you, uh...

652
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,494
under covers.

653
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:31,836
Undercover, not under covers.

654
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:36,411
218 Echo is a Sorbonne Air
Charter out of Orly Sud.

655
00:32:36,507 --> 00:32:38,633
It's been refueled and
flight plan filed.

656
00:32:38,634 --> 00:32:40,970
T. O. D.: 24:00.

657
00:32:41,174 --> 00:32:42,960
35 minutes.

658
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,875
This is your Op, Director.

659
00:32:49,194 --> 00:32:50,554
Bring Ducky online.

660
00:32:53,261 --> 00:32:54,621
Sound check, Ducky.

661
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:58,679
Now I know why they call
these wretched things

662
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:00,126
<i>earwigs.</i>

663
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:02,695
Make the exchange,
Doctor, and get out.

664
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:05,260
I don't want you caught
in the middle of a firefight.

665
00:33:05,261 --> 00:33:08,011
That's very considerate of you,
Director.

666
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:08,897
And Ducky...

667
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:10,776
thank you.

668
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:13,681
It's a pleasure.

669
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:18,773
Tally-ho.

670
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,464
Six months of undercover work,
and it all comes down to Ducky.

671
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,265
Can I help you?

672
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:35,728
Charles Harrow.

673
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:38,224
Monsieur La Grenouille 
is wating for me.

674
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,765
One moment, Monsieur Harrow.

675
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:42,829
Well, that was easy.

676
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:45,164
When this is over,
you really should

677
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:47,415
talk to somebody about security.

678
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,091
I'll take that
under advisement.

679
00:33:51,165 --> 00:33:54,039
I mean, a terrorist
could hire a car and...

680
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,923
Wait a minute. Who's this?

681
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,783
Identification, please.

682
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:02,348
Martin Quinn. He flew in
with La Grenouille's

683
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,542
advance party two months ago.

684
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:09,008
Open the
trunk, please.

685
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,366
And you wanted
to hide in the boot.

686
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,206
You didn't take me seriously,
did you?

687
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:19,985
With me.

688
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:33,308
All right,
hold it there.

689
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:46,859
Charles Harrow?

690
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:50,836
You say that as if
you're surprised to see me.

691
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:55,730
Archangel, Ducky might
have been compromised.

692
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:57,566
Archangel has him covered.

693
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:00,417
You have ARES?

694
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:02,897
You have the 20 million?

695
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:05,327
He's nature.

696
00:35:05,362 --> 00:35:06,147
Maybe, but he's making me
nervous.

697
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:07,014
Regine.

698
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:10,952
Hello.

699
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:18,619
Tell him to hand over
the damn laptop, McGee.

700
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,295
Ducky, give her the laptop.

701
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:21,589
May I?

702
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:26,940
This is ARES?

703
00:35:27,174 --> 00:35:30,484
Never judge a computer
by its shell, my dear.

704
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:33,307
Password?

705
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:34,580
Raven.

706
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,333
Satellite uplink?

707
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,755
Built into the circuit board.

708
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,674
It's built into
the circuit board.

709
00:35:39,735 --> 00:35:41,427
Follow the on-screen
instructions

710
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,930
- to lock onto a satellite.
- Just follow the on-screen

711
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,827
instructions, uh,
 to lock into a satellite.

712
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:47,864
Good

713
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:50,462
Where's
Grenouille?

714
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:52,151
Aren't you going to invite me

715
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:55,052
in out of the cold,
Monsieur Grenouille?

716
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:57,532
I would, but I'm not him.

717
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,495
Finally.

718
00:36:15,028 --> 00:36:17,328
I trust you'll forgive a rather

719
00:36:17,403 --> 00:36:19,552
operatic entrance,
Mr. Harrow,

720
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:22,290
but I love theatre.

721
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:24,218
Me too.

722
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:27,705
Hmm. Which is your 
preferred opera?

723
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,763
My opera preferred.

724
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,043
Cosi fan tutte...
undoubtedly.

725
00:36:32,716 --> 00:36:34,832
- I understand.
-And you?

726
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:38,072
Ah..."La Force du Destin", no?

727
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,135
So deep.

728
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,137
Why do they have
to speak French?

729
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:45,256
'Cause we're here
in Quebec, boss.

730
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,380
Ducky, English, please.

731
00:36:47,658 --> 00:36:48,718
Yes, well, uh,

732
00:36:49,156 --> 00:36:52,123
shall we step
out of the wind?

733
00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:53,483
Of course.

734
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:56,939
Perhaps your car ?

735
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,156
<i>Too much time with even
the most beautiful woman</i>

736
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:01,843
can be boring.

737
00:37:02,468 --> 00:37:05,368
I wouldn't know,
Mr Grenouille.

738
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:07,293
Ah, my name's warrior is

739
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:10,062
for rivals and enemies.

740
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:13,317
I choose to believe
you are neither.

741
00:37:13,721 --> 00:37:14,781
Call me Renee.

742
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:16,543
Ducky.

743
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:17,595
Ducky?

744
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:20,983
What an interesting
nickname.

745
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,700
Yes, it's a...
an unfortunate one

746
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,132
I picked up

747
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,533
as a lad, uh, during the Blitz.

748
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:29,742
- Please.
- Ah, thank you.

749
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,902
Just run the damn photo.

750
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:39,345
Where are
you going?

751
00:37:39,346 --> 00:37:41,771
Our man wants his
private cognac.

752
00:37:42,035 --> 00:37:43,346
You see anything
out there?

753
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:44,232
You kidding?

754
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:46,774
Canadians are
in bed by 9:00.

755
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:57,281
Have you ever enjoyed a glass of, uh,
"L'Esprit de Courvoisier"?

756
00:37:57,664 --> 00:37:59,722
The Spirit
of Courvoisier? No.

757
00:37:59,723 --> 00:38:01,248
I can't say I have.

758
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:04,666
Monsieur?

759
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:05,918
- Here.
-Thank you.

760
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,919
It will be a beautiful way
to consummate the transfer

761
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:13,911
of the villa, no?

762
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:16,692
Le Froggie is more
careful than Gotti.

763
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:20,889
It's why he's
never been caught.

764
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,860
Do you have children, Ducky?

765
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,076
Sadly, no.

766
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:32,982
One of life's
great gifts.

767
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,439
I have three.

768
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:40,121
And two grandchildren,
a girl and a boy.

769
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:42,922
Everything I do now is for them.

770
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:46,535
I am provider and protector

771
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:49,248
in equal part.

772
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:50,606
Napoleon ?

773
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,416
Napoleon was the first
to drink this cognac

774
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,657
at his coronation

775
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,816
in 1802.

776
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:05,840
And since then, only the very
best of vintage

777
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:09,313
has been added
to that.

778
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:13,240
200 years of empires,

779
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:16,074
revolutions,

780
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,836
and war?

781
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:21,791
Mm, history in a glass.

782
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,447
"Histoire dans un verre".

783
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:25,639
Salut.

784
00:39:33,544 --> 00:39:34,389
Kort?

785
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,105
Something wrong?

786
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:37,631
No.

787
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,350
Is it worth20 million
in diamonds?

788
00:39:40,856 --> 00:39:41,850
More.

789
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:44,525
The Iranian will give
100 for it.

790
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:48,806
Tell the pilots
wheels up in five minutes.

791
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,132
They're starting engines.

792
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:56,594
Surprising?

793
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,934
It's astonishing.

794
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,421
Regine approves.

795
00:40:04,423 --> 00:40:06,784
Excellent.

796
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:09,675
Well, it's been
a pleasure, Ducky.

797
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:11,903
Yes, for me, too.

798
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,735
Get the diamonds.

799
00:40:18,787 --> 00:40:20,240
Renee...

800
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:24,108
aren't you forgetting
something?

801
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:27,405
No. My bottle of history
is yours, my friend.

802
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:29,519
You add to it well.

803
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:32,488
I don't know what to say.

804
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,333
Give me the diamonds!

805
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:35,899
Oh, yes, well, uh...

806
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:38,439
I- I hate to be crass,

807
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:40,140
but the... the diamonds?

808
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,758
Yeah. Kort has them.

809
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:45,550
Oh, very well.

810
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:47,215
Archangel awaiting instructions.

811
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:49,929
This was to be a snatch,
wasn't it?

812
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:53,155
Or did you have something else
in mind?

813
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:55,779
Au revoir, mon ami.

814
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:56,941
Au revoir.

815
00:40:57,235 --> 00:40:58,290
A bientt.

816
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:02,656
Director SheShepardard.

817
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,235
About to lose target.

818
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:06,619
Target will be lost
in five seconds.

819
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:09,497
Archangel
requesting instructions.

820
00:41:12,863 --> 00:41:14,356
Director?

821
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:16,734
Stand down, Archangel.
Stand down!

822
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,248
Tell me you got the call.

823
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:31,520
What call?

824
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,286
Yes, I got the damn call.

825
00:41:40,054 --> 00:41:43,123
Your diamonds, Dr. Mallard.

826
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:06,666
He knew my name!

827
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,897
He's CIA.

828
00:42:08,118 --> 00:42:10,418
- So was Harrow.
- It was a sting.

829
00:42:11,117 --> 00:42:12,117
We got stung.

830
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:15,449
No. We got screwed.

831
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:17,180
One question.

832
00:42:18,742 --> 00:42:20,853
What do I do with these?

833
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,573
Oh, how many you keeping?

834
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:28,867
Did Ducky fix Harrow's time of death?

835
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:29,757
Yeah.

836
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:33,077
On the record, he will drop dead
of a heart attack tomorrow.

837
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:35,113
Good.

838
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,483
I wouldn't want Grenouille
to discover he'd met a dead man.

839
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:44,265
Harrow altered the ARES unit,
installed a Trojan horse.

840
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:47,024
If the Iranians
even try to use it,

841
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:50,744
they'll be targeting
their own defense systems.

842
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:52,700
Quite a strategic advantage.

843
00:42:54,874 --> 00:42:56,934
I didn't need to know that.

844
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,368
Neither did I,

845
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,676
but somebody thought
they could trust me.

846
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:08,381
I will get him, another time,
another deal.

847
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:11,705
I will be there,
and I will get him.

848
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:14,816
Are you sure
you want to?

849
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:19,217
Of course I want to!

850
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:22,839
Some people need have
someone to hate.

851
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:24,399
Not me.

852
00:43:24,704 --> 00:43:27,318
Then you should have
let Ziva take the shot.
