25
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,390
Missed me.

26
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,225
Is he here yet? Is he here yet?

27
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,480
Abby,do you think I'd be playing this game if he was?

28
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:41,363
I will call you as soon as he gets here,okay?I promise.

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,959
What if his plan was delayed?

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,003
Or worse. What if he missed his connecting flight?

31
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,829
Well,then,he will be here tomorrow.

32
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,839
Not good enough,McGee.

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,409
A team needs a leader.

34
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,419
He's our glue.

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,329
He's our-our spine.

36
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:56,011
Without him,we're like phylum cnidaria.

37
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,769
Jellyfish.

38
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,827
Exactly.

39
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,200
u saying I'm spineless?

40
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:04,832
Of course not,Timmy.

41
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:07,748
I'm going to check his flight.

42
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,543
Abby,you're getting powder all over my keyboard.

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,681
What's your point?

44
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,029
My point is,Abby,uh,

45
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,781
you are really,really overdoing the sugar thing again.

46
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,539
Well,I'm eating for two.

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,640
Relax.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,329
I was referring to the health food freak over there.

49
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,260
Every time I walk past her desk,

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,760
I have this irresistible urge to shove a cheeseburger down her throat.

51
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,518
I think she's kind of hot.

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,689
Oh,you think she's hot?

53
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,974
Yeah,you know,for a probie.

54
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,455
You two do realize I can hear you, right ?

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,773
We do now,

56
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,233
very Special Agent Lee.

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,769
His flight landed on time.

58
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,007
Where is he?

59
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,089
Oh,yay! You're home!

60
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,719
Welcome back.

61
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,500
I missed you.

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,089
I missed you too,Abby.

63
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,039
Oh,did you have fun?

64
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,673
Did you got to that cool bar in Dusseldorf?

65
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,204
You know,I tried,but,

66
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,166
you know,the security conference kept us pretty busy.

67
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,476
-I'm having trouble breathing,Abby.
-Oh,I'm sorry.

68
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:16,681
-See?
-McGee.

69
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,823
Look at you.

70
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,950
All grown up.

71
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,018
So what'd I miss the last two weeks?

72
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:24,749
Well,nothing I couldn't handle,boss.

73
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,575
Good,and to think the Director didn't have any faith in you.

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,399
What do you mean the Director...

75
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,403
Gather 'round,people. I come earing gifts.

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,330
For the lovely lady.

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,089
Oh! Tony,it's beautiful.

78
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,160
Not to mention,incredibly expensive.

79
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,114
Euro's stronger than it used to be.

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,474
For my senior field agent...

81
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,344
The Very Best of David Hasselhoff.

82
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:56,269
You don't like it?

83
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,220
I repeat,The Very Best of David Hasselhoff.

84
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,169
What was that for?

85
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,930
You listen to Yanni.

86
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,814
And you have an unauthorized game on your computer.

87
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,069
Okay,it's your game,Tony.

88
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,879
Yeah,you shouldn't have beaten my high score.

89
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,458
And for Ziva...

90
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,157
Das lederhosen.

91
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,956
One size fits all.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,939
Where is the,uh,

93
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,639
little Israeli? Late,sir.

94
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,257
Second time this week.

95
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,031
Agent Lee.

96
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,207
My favorite probie-slash-hall monitor.

97
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,596
I bet you're wondering what the newest member of Team DiNozzo gets.

98
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,533
Well,we saved the best for last here.

99
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,910
This was not easy getting through customs,but...

100
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,590
A stapler?

101
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:51,189
It's a German stapler.

102
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,144
But it says "Made in China,"sir.

103
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,914
Oh,yeah.

104
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:59,059
Well,German,Eurasian,China.

105
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,353
It's a global village,Lee. Get used to it.

106
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,829
She's over an hour late,sir.

107
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,207
That's unusual even for her.

108
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,575
What did I tell you about worrying,probie?

109
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,399
That it's,uh,your job.

110
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,569
See,you're learning.

111
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,131
But she's not answering her... I'm sorry,sir.

112
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,751
She's not answering her cell phone either.

113
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:19,592
Okay,there is only one thing you need to know about Officer David.

114
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:20,931
Don't make her angry.

115
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,510
So,technically,really,there's two things.

116
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:24,395
The other is ...

117
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,939
she can take care of herself.

118
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,052
I cannot wait any longer!

119
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,139
Produce Officer Bashan or

120
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,926
I start with your hands and I will not stop until-

121
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,729
Officer David,what did I tell you

122
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,630
About terrorizing my men?

123
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,470
Leave us alone please.

124
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,686
Come,Ziva,sit.

125
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,749
Okay,what seems to be the problem?

126
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,891
Why was I not told about this operation?

127
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,319
I suppose the simple answer would be,

128
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,969
your father did not want you to know.

129
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,678
And he wonders why I barely talk to him anymore,Michael?

130
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:07,008
A fact I know he regrets very much,Ziva.

131
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,160
Very much.

132
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,757
I've spent a year building relationships and trust with NCIS.

133
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:15,117
How do you suggest I explain this to them?

134
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:17,729
I realize this places you in an awkward position,but,Ziva...

135
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,548
They were sloppy,blatant.

136
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:21,071
And you should have known better.

137
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:24,406
The Americans can be quite prudish in their attitudes,Ziva.

138
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:26,369
You call what happened prudish?

139
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:27,820
That depends.

140
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,120
Did you or did you not sleep with him?

141
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,669
Who?

142
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,443
Anthony DiNozzo,your new team leader.

143
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,962
Why do you ask that?

144
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,299
Starting three months ago,

145
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:43,422
Ziva,he's been visiting your apartment at least one night a week.

146
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:51,852
My father has you spying on me?

147
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,169
I assumed that was the reason for your visit.

148
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,915
Well,you assumed wrong,Officer Bashan.

149
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:00,499
I am here because an hour ago,

150
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,421
a Mossad assassination team killed three people in Georgetown.

151
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,989
We have no active operations scheduled in Georgetown...

152
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,689
Michael,don't lie to me.

153
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,329
I was there.

154
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,653
I tried to stop it.

155
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,347
What exactly did you see?

156
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,978
Officer Namir Eschel.

157
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,301
-No. Impossible.
-I spoke to him.

158
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,142
I let him go.

159
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,250
Secure line to Tel Aviv

160
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,969
I need to speak to director.

161
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,150
Immediately

162
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,598
Tell him...

163
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,556
Tell him it concerns family.

164
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,773
Do you realize how close I came to shooting Eschel today?

165
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,334
Namir Eschel is dead,Ziva.

166
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,069
Your father and I attended his funeral six months ago.

167
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,869
Ziva,just,uh,call us as soon as you get the message.

168
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,705
We're not worried. Just give us a call,please.

169
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,588
Okay,now I'm starting to worry.

170
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,345
Think she's all right?

171
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,512
Well,if she was all right,she'd be here,McGee.

172
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,588
The question is:What would Gibbs do in a situation like this?

173
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:23,667
He'd find her,Tony.

174
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,425
I'm working on it,Director.

175
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:26,981
Work harder.

176
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,236
Metro Police just found her car on a sidewalk in Georgetown.

177
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:33,801
Actually,that's not that unusual when Ziva's driving.

178
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:37,784
Yeah,I drove all the way through Eastern Europe with her- I should know,McGee.

179
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,094
But in my experience...

180
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,205
...the FBI doesn't usually concern themselves with traffic accidents.

181
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:47,782
Tony,isn't that the guy that tried to put you away for murder?

182
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:50,319
Yes,it is,and thank you for bringing up a painful memory,McGee.

183
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,959
You knew they were coming,Director?

184
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,919
Calm down,Tony.

185
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,949
I only just got the call two minutes ago.

186
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,179
What do they want with Ziva?

187
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:57,769
We're about to find out.

188
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,460
Together.

189
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,079
Agent Sacks,Director Shepard.

190
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,284
Director Shepard.

191
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:08,669
We have confirmed your report.

192
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,280
The man you saw killed was Abdul Wazir,

193
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,640
a former Syrian Army Colonel.

194
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,330
Wanted for crimes against the state of Israel.

195
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,866
Seems I'm not the only one my father likes to keep in the dark.

196
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,991
This was not a sanctioned action,Ziva.

197
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,631
We had no hand in this.

198
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:24,585
You mean officially.

199
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:25,757
Officially

200
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:27,217
or unofficially.

201
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,259
We knew he was in American custody.

202
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:33,585
Offered protection in return for supplying information on al Qaeda cells in Iraq.

203
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:35,460
Protection from what?

204
00:10:37,824 --> 00:10:38,469
Us.

205
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,368
The two men guarding him?

206
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:41,992
FBI agents.

207
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,200
Dear God,Michael.

208
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,296
Obviously,Eschel faked his own death.

209
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,693
He's operating without orders,making his own decisions.

210
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:52,879
Or perhaps that is merely a cover my father designed for him.

211
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,019
Do you really believe he would jeopardize

212
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,879
our relations with the Americans like this?

213
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,875
There are days I don't know what to believe anymore,Michael.

214
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,394
You have not been dismissed yet,Officer David.

215
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,469
I have to contact NCIS.

216
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,247
Your orders are to remain here

217
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:12,461
until we figure out a strategy to deal with this.

218
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:13,939
Eschel murdered two Americans

219
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,304
and a man in their custody.

220
00:11:15,354 --> 00:11:17,965
Our strategy is simple. Find him and kill him.

221
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,609
There are complications.

222
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,429
Which NCIS can help us with.

223
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,458
You left your car at the crime scene this morning.

224
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,729
It was disabled. I was trying to prevent the attack.

225
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,002
The Americans do not see it this way.

226
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,090
Director Shepard will.

227
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,650
Ziva

228
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,118
The FBI has already issued a warrant for your arrest.

229
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,624
On what charges?

230
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,210
Espionage

231
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,470
and murder.

232
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,704
This is a political nightmare.

233
00:11:57,771 --> 00:11:59,997
I'm asking for your patience,Ziva.

234
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:02,019
We need time to deal with this.

235
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,838
You would hold me against my will,Michael?

236
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:06,014
I will do what's best for you.

237
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,549
Your father...

238
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:13,420
he will find a solution to this,Ziva.

239
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,428
Like he did for my brother Ari?

240
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,951
Escort her to guest quarters.

241
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,846
And do not forget to confiscate her weapons.

242
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,039
I'm sorry for this.

243
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,746
As am I.

244
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,216
I was talking to you.

245
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:39,023
Ever been tied up by a woman before?

246
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,730
Did you like it?

247
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,304
Then,today is not your lucky day.

248
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,189
Very professional.

249
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,181
Your Director kicked us both out,DiNozzo.

250
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,239
Only because you couldn't keep your soup cooler shut.

251
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,369
Well,your Mossad liaison officer killed two FBI agents today.

252
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,296
Sorry if that pisses me off.

253
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,003
-Where's your proof?
-Proof?

254
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:05,208
Car abandoned

255
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:06,580
at the crime scene,

256
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,170
the Syrian was on their most wanted list,

257
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,133
she's disappeared,and,oh,yeah,her brother

258
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:13,940
was a Hamas terrorist.

259
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,124
Where I come from,that's called circumstantial.

260
00:13:16,158 --> 00:13:18,484
Really? Where's that- Narnia?

261
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,003
<i>It's a fantasy movie. The Chronicles of Narnia...</i>

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,090
I know what it is!

263
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,892
Okay story,excellent special effects.

264
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:27,399
They were definitely kicking.

265
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,520
That's not my point.

266
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,289
Six months ago,

267
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,993
you were convinced that I killed a woman and chopped of her legs.

268
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:34,616
I'm still not convinced you didn't.

269
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,838
Exactly.

270
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:40,068
So Ziva David is being framed. By who?

271
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,813
Well,that's what I intend to find out.

272
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,457
Good luck with that.

273
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,432
You two.

274
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:49,972
Up here,now.

275
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,239
Director,will you please tell Agent Slacks...

276
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,047
Sacks. It's Sacks.

277
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:55,909
Will you please tell Agent Slacks

278
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,466
that we're going to be handling this one in-house?

279
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,789
I just assured your director that the FBI

280
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,252
will be getting NCIS' complete cooperation in this matter.

281
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,059
Thank you,ma'am.

282
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,520
If Ziva attempts to contact you or anyone on your team,

283
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:12,139
I want you to notify both myself

284
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,966
and Agent Sacks immediately.

285
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:16,887
This is complete bull...

286
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,703
This...is an order from your director,Agent DiNozzo.

287
00:14:20,786 --> 00:14:22,577
Is that clear enough for you?

288
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,498
Almost crystal,ma'am.

289
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:33,142
I give you my word that I will try

290
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,954
and keep an open mind on this.

291
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,580
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

292
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,179
Okay.

293
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,791
-Liste,um,about what happened between us before...
-No hard feelings.

294
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,749
I got it.

295
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,749
No,I was going to say I still pretty much hate your guts,Sacks.

296
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,373
Me,too,DiNozzo.

297
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
Me,too.

298
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,900
Tony?

299
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,768
That question you asked me earlier:

300
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,726
What would Gibbs do?

301
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:59,722
Gibbs isn't here,you are.

302
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,299
Gibbs...

303
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:12,187
This is really,really bad.

304
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,582
Ziva has disappeared

305
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:17,304
and everyone's saying that she's just like her brother.

306
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:18,994
I really,really

307
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:20,777
need you to call me.

308
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,350
Please.

309
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,162
Gibbs?

310
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,780
Abby,it's Ziva.

311
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,032
Ziva.

312
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,739
Are you all right?

313
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:34,655
No,and don't say my name so loud.

314
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:35,576
Sorry.

315
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,283
Where are you?

316
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,731
At a safe place at the moment.

317
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:40,835
The FBI was here

318
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:43,011
and Tony was freaking out

319
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:43,709
and the Director...

320
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,779
Abby,I need you to do a favor for me.

321
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:46,839
You name it.

322
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,649
First,you can't tell anyone I've spoken to you.

323
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,969
Except Tony,right?

324
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,319
No. Not even Tony.

325
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,323
If I talk to him,he'll get in trouble with the FBI.

326
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,114
What do you need?

327
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,010
A phone number.

328
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,616
All right. I'll call you back at this number.

329
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,078
Abby,

330
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,530
who was that?

331
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,886
Where?

332
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:16,939
On the phone.

333
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,467
That... it was the nuns.

334
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:22,689
The nuns?

335
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,856
Yep,you know nuns with the...

336
00:16:24,873 --> 00:16:26,128
big white hats and the...

337
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,249
The hats.

338
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,559
Yeah,they're called habits.

339
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,609
Big white hats.

340
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,940
Yep. They-they called to say that bowling practice is cancelled.

341
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,296
Bowling nuns?

342
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:38,050
Jeez,McGee,what,are you on some sort of anti-nun crusade here?

343
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,459
What? Wait,no...

344
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,547
Okay,all right,lay off the nuns.

345
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,379
I need to contact Gibbs.

346
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,639
If we're going to get Ziva out of this,

347
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,915
I'm going to need his advice

348
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,224
Well,last I heard,he was still in Mexico.

349
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,701
Well,there must be some way to contact him.

350
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,727
Aw,damn it!

351
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,590
Hey,

352
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,079
you say something?

353
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:07,777
Four months

354
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,250
and you still don't understand the meaning of the word siesta,probie?

355
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:14,593
Roof's not going to fix itself,Mike.

356
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,564
Tropical storm season's only a few weeks away.

357
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,559
You ever stop to think that I might like rain?

358
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,701
Yeah,

359
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:24,580
just maybe not inside your house.

360
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,376
Don't you have a boat to build or something?

361
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,239
Yeah,well,the problem with that,Mike,

362
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,941
is I'm using all my good lumber to fix your dog rot house.

363
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,317
I got a better idea.

364
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,342
Why don't you use it to build your own...

365
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:43,568
somewhere down there.

366
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,685
Hey,you just say the word- I'll be gone.

367
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,238
Don't tempt me,Jethro.

368
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,497
I ain't nearly drunk enough.

369
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,559
But until then,

370
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,539
I was thinking your next project would be a nice,

371
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,325
little hot tub. Say yea big,

372
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,730
right over there.

373
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,108
You want teak or redwood?

374
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,133
<i>Hola,gentlemen.</i>

375
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,505
Gentlemen? She can't be talking to||ou and me,Gunny.

376
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:14,945
You? No.

377
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,271
<i>Señor Gibbs,si</i>

378
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:20,514
-I hope you're not letting him work you so hard.
-Nah.

379
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,099
He's living here for free.

380
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,643
What does he expect?

381
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,786
Perhaps someday he will tell us.

382
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,979
Hey,

383
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:29,777
how much do I owe you?

384
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,610
25 American.

385
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,449
-And you have a phone call.  -Okay.

386
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,225
Uh,not you.

387
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,484
Leroy Jethro.

388
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,493
Who is it?

389
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:42,832
A woman.

390
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,066
<i>And she sounded muy upset.</i>

391
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,889
It's probably that lady director of yours,

392
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,472
about to have a nervous breakdown.

393
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,640
Yeah. Gibbs.

394
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,869
<i>Hola.</i>

395
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,367
Uh,how's Mexico?

396
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:58,740
Ziva.

397
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,413
How'd you get this number?

398
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:03,957
From Abby,and if it helps,I forced it out of her.

399
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,166
No,it doesn't.What's wrong?

400
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,401
Why does something always have to be wrong?

401
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:10,995
Can't I just speak with an old friennd?

402
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,124
Do a little catching up?

403
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,614
Today,Ziva.

404
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,210
Ok

405
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,057
I may be in a little bit of trouble.

406
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,430
Yeah?

407
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,769
Define "little. "

408
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,673
I am currently on the run

409
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:31,275
from the FBI,NCIS,Mossad,and my father.

410
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:32,618
Jeez,what'd you do?

411
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:33,970
I did nothing,Gibbs.

412
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,249
I swear I did nothing.

413
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,744
Where's DiNozzo?

414
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,133
He can't help me.

415
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,629
Well,you should talk to Jenny.

416
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,829
Jenny can help you.

417
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,007
I can't...

418
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:44,889
Ziva,look,I'm retired.

419
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,439
I'm 3,000 miles away.

420
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,170
What do you think I can do that they can't do?

421
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,110
Honestly,I don't know.

422
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,141
I was hoping maybe...

423
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,540
...save me.

424
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,419
Two days...

425
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,749
How long are these guys going to be here?

426
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,549
Officer David was here for a year.

427
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,849
Who knows how badly she compromised our security?

428
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,406
What did you say,probie?

429
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:16,929
Oh,come on,McGee.

430
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,749
You think we don't spy on our allies,too?

431
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,109
It happens all the time.

432
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,393
Agent Lee.

433
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,189
Sir?

434
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,219
Shut up and keep an eye on the Feds.

435
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,862
McGee,you're with me. We got places to be.

436
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,966
Should be done here,DiNozzo,in another...

437
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:30,958
oh,five,six more hours.

438
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,715
First off,this is a strictly voluntary thing.

439
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,590
Ziva's a fugitive.

440
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,709
Anyone caught helping

441
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,339
or assisting her in any way will be in serious trouble.

442
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:47,841
Palmer? Um,by serious,

443
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,272
uh,you mean,we could,like,get fired?

444
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,529
He means,Mr. Palmer,

445
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,255
instead of attending medical school next month,

446
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:57,025
you'll most likely be in prison.

447
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:58,330
Oh.

448
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,899
I'm in.

449
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,999
Danger,intrigue,a damsel in distress.

450
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,585
I'm actually looking forward to it.

451
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,841
Me,too.

452
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,909
I'm not exactly the type

453
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,581
that would do well in prison,guys.

454
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:14,975
No one's going to think any less of you if you want out,Palmer.

455
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:15,778
Really?

456
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:17,639
Well,no,they probably would.

457
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,853
At least I know I would.

458
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:21,249
All right,then I want a code name,

459
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,949
something cool-sounding.

460
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,903
All right.

461
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,728
No one can know about this,especially the Director.

462
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,803
We all good with that?

463
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,548
All right,then,let's figure out how to find her.

464
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,079
McGee,I want you on her electronic tracks.

465
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,869
Cell phone,computer,toaster oven if you have to.

466
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,778
Ducky,please talk to your contacts in the FBI.

467
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:45,280
I want to know everything about that Georgetown crime scene.

468
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:47,640
Palmer,how does "Black Lung" sound?

469
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,016
Like a horrible and painful way to die.

470
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,119
I mean,as your code name.

471
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,340
Oh,I like it. Yeah.

472
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,150
All right,then you're in charge of supplies,Black Lung.

473
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:59,824
Which means lunch and at this point,probably dinner.

474
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:02,736
-Abs,I need you to go...
-I talked to Ziva yesterday.

475
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,119
You don't bowl with nuns.

476
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,199
I should have seen that coming.

477
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,897
I do.

478
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,784
Ziva made me promise not to tell.

479
00:22:11,818 --> 00:22:15,420
Why would Ziva care we knew that you bowl with nuns?

480
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:17,869
I think she means that Ziva didn't want us getting in trouble,Ducky.

481
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,860
It's a bit late for that.

482
00:22:19,927 --> 00:22:21,416
Where is she?

483
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,308
All I have is this phone number.

484
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,870
Well,there's no answer.

485
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,155
Abby,are you sure that this...?

486
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:37,079
Ziva.

487
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:39,050
Tell Abby I'm going to kill her.

488
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:41,000
We love you,too.

489
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,071
I'm hanging up now.

490
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:42,729
No,you're not.

491
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,364
You're going to tell me what the hell is going on here.

492
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,314
Your phone could be tapped,Tony.

493
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,089
Well,then,I'll come to you.

494
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,889
I'm also trying to get a hold of Gibbs right now,

495
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,447
but I'm not having any luck.

496
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:51,881
Gibbs?

497
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:53,521
Why didn't you say so.

498
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:55,679
DiNozzo,

499
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,968
you have ten seconds to tell me why I am not building teak hot tub in Mexico.

500
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,010
Nine...

501
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,520
The target's name was Abdul Wazir.

502
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,097
A Syrian wanted for crimes against the state of Israel.

503
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,980
Terminated by this man- Mossad Officer Namir Eschel,

504
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:18,620
my former team-mate

505
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:21,156
when I was stationed in Paris.

506
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,812
Who's supposed to be dead.

507
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,122
Apparently,he's gotten better.

508
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,181
Being dead makes for a good cover.

509
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,549
I would agree,

510
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,323
but my father claims to have no knowledge of his activities.

511
00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:34,445
I'd believe him.

512
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,859
How many times do I have to tell you,

513
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,277
-I don't believe in... -In coincidences? I know.

514
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,901
Lucky for you,neither do I.

515
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:44,085
And according to the FBI,I should be the one

516
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:45,309
aiming my weapon at you.

517
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,315
You were set up.

518
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,679
The only Mossad liaison officer in D.C.

519
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,118
just happens to be present at a Metsada-style hit?

520
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,817
Oh,God,I'm an idiot.

521
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:04,591
He led me to the scene.

522
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,156
Eschel framed me.

523
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,639
Caca boudin ce méchant mec avec des tresses !

524
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,424
Yeah,but the question is why?

525
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,650
Thought you might be needing this.

526
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,069
Uh...

527
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,479
I meant the NCIS cell phone.

528
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,139
That's my...

529
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,788
coffee,boss.

530
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,521
Do I still look like your boss?

531
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,684
well,maybe,if you shaved and a...

532
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,111
haircut... ... wouldn't hurt.

533
00:24:28,445 --> 00:24:30,369
Smile thing's definitely throwing me off,too.

534
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:33,023
It's good to see you again,McGee.

535
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,299
DiNozzo.

536
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:36,219
What'd I say?

537
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,446
You called him McGee.

538
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,819
That's probably because if I left him in charge,

539
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,078
you wouldn't be on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list right now.

540
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,241
B- but you do remember...

541
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,949
That I left you in charge?

542
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,999
Yeah,I remember I left you in charge,DiNozzo.

543
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,869
What I forgot is your taste in coffee.

544
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,630
It stinks.

545
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:59,124
I like sugar. It's my weakness.

546
00:24:59,141 --> 00:24:59,994
What's our plan?

547
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:02,359
Things are bad enough for NCIS as it is,Tony. You can't...

548
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,178
I don't remember asking your opinion,Officer David.

549
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,182
You see?

550
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,149
He's been completely insufferable since you left.

551
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,806
That true,Tony?

552
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,239
When I need to be.

553
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:12,467
Yeah?

554
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,830
Maybe you were the right man for the job.

555
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,111
Our plan

556
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,291
is to find this guy before he gets out of the country.

557
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,899
How do we put out a BOLO without the FBI

558
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,070
finding out about it?

559
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:30,145
I knew you'd ask me that,McGee.

560
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,869
See? I knew you'd ask me that,McGee.

561
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:33,175
And?

562
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,039
And I... I don't know.

563
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,039
Any suggestions?

564
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,119
We could tell the FBI about Eschel

565
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,239
and let them track him down.

566
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,839
When they ask how we know about him...

567
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,848
They'll know we talked to Ziva.

568
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,183
McGee.

569
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,911
Tony,what if we lie?

570
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,129
Sacks is a self-centered,

571
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,250
egotistical jack hole...

572
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,660
...but he's not an idiot. He'll know.

573
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,258
No,I mean

574
00:25:55,342 --> 00:25:56,619
lie on the BOLO.

575
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,689
Instead of looking for a rogue Mossad spy wanted for murder,

576
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,451
we put out a BOLO for a wife-beater.

577
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,309
That's underhanded,devious...

578
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,798
And it's completely getting me hot.

579
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,865
Well,glad to see I'm finally rubbing off on him.

580
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,254
Do it.

581
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,572
It's one of our old safe houses.

582
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,120
We park on a dirt accesst road 200 meters behind it and enter from the back.

583
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,229
You know he's not going to be here.

584
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,735
It's the first place Mossad's going to try to reacquire him.

585
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:35,145
Mossad does not know about this particular one.

586
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,790
I set this one up for Ari.

587
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,580
How's Eschel know about it?

588
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,529
When Ari infiltrated NCIS three years ago,

589
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,865
Eschel was part of his recovery team.

590
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,965
An FBI agent was killed then,too.

591
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,225
Let's get this over with.

592
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:54,350
I got a beach in Mexico waiting for me.

593
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,617
Move and we shoot!

594
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,100
Clear!

595
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,230
He's dead.Rigor mortis has already set in.

596
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,087
How do you know he's not faking it?

597
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,979
Well,shoot him if you don't believe me.

598
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:27,753
u'd better hope that's not Eschel.

599
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,213
Why? You want to kill him yourself now?

600
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,552
but I won't and neither will you.

601
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:34,419
We capture him alive.

602
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,786
We kill him,there's no way to prove you weren't involved in the hit.

603
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,840
He look familiar?

604
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,251
He's not Mossad.

605
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,790
Eschel is obviously trying to tie up his loose ends.

606
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,949
Yeah,well,that's what you were.

607
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,482
Spread out,start looking around.

608
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,579
What for exactly?

609
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,507
Anything that'll help us find out where he went.

610
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:56,427
Right.

611
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,699
She looks a bit like her brother,

612
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,105
don't you think?

613
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,147
More like her father.

614
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,302
Who's the man?

615
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:10,176
Someone who shouldn't be with her.

616
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,624
Retired Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

617
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,440
Sacks.

618
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,910
Who is this?

619
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,062
How do I know this i***egit?

620
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,941
We got a tip,guys.

621
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:39,548
House in Fairfax.

622
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:02,845
There's nothing here.

623
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:05,774
Eschel was always good at covering up his tracks.

624
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,213
What is it?

625
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,770
Oh le vil gredin des enfers !
He's made us.

626
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,514
Impossible.

627
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:24,706
I placed that camera myself.

628
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,039
We need to detonate now.

629
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,366
No,we wait for the FBI,Faatin.

630
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,259
It must look like Ziva killed herself instead of surrendering.

631
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,856
If she leaves before they get there,Namir?

632
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,266
I will delay her.

633
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,039
He was watching us.

634
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,676
It could have been left from when Ari was...

635
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,086
He was watching us.

636
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,960
What?

637
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,659
I heard you retired.

638
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,877
Yeah?

639
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,835
I heard you were dead.

640
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,052
To the Mossad,I am.

641
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:17,929
We know you're alive now.

642
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,797
I plan on fixing that.

643
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,023
Poor Director David.

644
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,356
First,his son's a traitor and now his daughter.

645
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,149
By this time tomorrow,

646
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,084
he'll be working on a kibbutz.

647
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:30,661
Unless,of course,he kills himself first.

648
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,539
Is it true?

649
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,399
Did you kill Ari Haswari?

650
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:36,459
He's delaying us.

651
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:39,036
Why? I'm his loose end,remember?

652
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,049
He called the FBI.

653
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,570
That's not what I'm worried about.

654
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:44,757
When our safe house was compromised in Paris,Eschel blew it up.

655
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,030
Shalom Ziva.

656
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,554
We're still not sure what the hell happened,DiNozzo.

657
00:31:18,607 --> 00:31:20,710
Or if she was even in there when the place blew up.

658
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,008
Bodies?

659
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,327
No,it was incinerated.

660
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:26,581
We won't even be able to process the scene until at least tomorrow.

661
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:29,064
-What makes you think she was there?  -A tip.

662
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:30,042
From who?

663
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:31,649
Anonymous.

664
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,679
My guess is probably somebody

665
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,712
inside Mossad trying to make nice...

666
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:37,228
Someone tying up loose ends.

667
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:38,599
Well,for all we know,

668
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,396
she blew up the place to cover her own tracks.

669
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:43,501
Well,she was only looking for the guy who set her up.

670
00:31:43,622 --> 00:31:45,714
You mind telling me how you know that?

671
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:46,920
'Cause it's what I'd do.

672
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,929
Not good,Ducky.

673
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,350
You did manage to call them,didn't you?

674
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,689
I got Gibbs' voice mail.

675
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:01,759
I don't think he ever learned how to use it.

676
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:04,599
And the number Abby has for Ziva?

677
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:05,961
Not picking up.

678
00:32:06,028 --> 00:32:07,638
Then,there's only one thing for you to do.

679
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,295
I know.

680
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,059
We'll let the Director know they're probably dead and

681
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,859
resign for disobeying a direct order.

682
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:14,818
You'll do nothing of the sort,Anthony DiNozzo.

683
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,209
And why is that?

684
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,026
Because the man who did that is still out there

685
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,667
and I'll be damned if we let him get away with it.

686
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:28,372
What would Gibbs do,right?

687
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,869
I got a bulletin for you,Ducky.

688
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:32,069
I am not Gibbs.

689
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:34,360
No. You're not.

690
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,372
Gibbs quit.

691
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,032
You're still here.

692
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,970
Why wasn't I with Ziva?

693
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:41,879
I turned over my responsibility to him

694
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,853
without even thinking about it.

695
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,669
Gibbs is one of the most capable agents...

696
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,671
Was,Ducky! You didn't see him.

697
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:51,899
I mean,it didn't even look like Gibbs.

698
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,770
I think he went native down there.

699
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:54,440
Uh,Tony...

700
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,639
His hair is all long and crazy-looking

701
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,179
and he's got this scraggly beard.

702
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,177
He looks like a pirate or something.

703
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,609
His eyes were all bloodshot,

704
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,439
probably from drinking hooch from morning till night with Franks.

705
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,224
They call it a red-eye for a reason.

706
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,533
The flight I was on all night to get here.

707
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:16,700
Oh,chief,all right.

708
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,289
Good,all right,thank God.

709
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,165
Yeah,thank Ziva.

710
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,409
I've already been blown up twice,Tony.

711
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,242
Don't think I've got a third one in me.

712
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,239
Space 73.

713
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,419
Present's in the back for autopsy and Abby.

714
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,829
Don't be seen.

715
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,999
Hey ya,Duck.

716
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:33,269
Welcome home,Jethro.

717
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,083
Oh,you got the wrong guy.

718
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,729
I'm just visiting.

719
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,424
You might want to tell Palmer

720
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:40,030
it's going to be a late night.

721
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,051
I really missed that view.

722
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,698
Harbor isn't bad either.

723
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,954
I had a feeling I'd be seeing you soon,Jethro.

724
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:02,367
How is she?

725
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:03,892
She's scared,

726
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,913
not that she'll ever admit that.

727
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:07,189
NCIS can't help her.

728
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,249
Well,see,that's why I'm here. I'm not NCIS.

729
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,723
I retired,remember?

730
00:34:10,804 --> 00:34:12,494
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

731
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,538
Anyone asks,just tell them two old partners catching up.

732
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,019
My agency has been harboring

733
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,319
a foreign operative for over a year,

734
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,168
one that I personally vouched for and insisted we needed.

735
00:34:24,288 --> 00:34:25,768
She didn't do it.

736
00:34:25,808 --> 00:34:27,160
You think I don't know that?

737
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,892
I'm just telling you what they're saying all over the Beltway.

738
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:32,700
I give it 24 hours before they ask for my resignation.

739
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,941
Don't give it to them.

740
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:36,039
She was set up.

741
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:37,097
By who?

742
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,498
A former Mossad officer.

743
00:34:39,725 --> 00:34:42,657
Claims it was to get back at Ziva's father.

744
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,157
What do you think?

745
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,238
My gut says it was more than that.

746
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,309
I agree.

747
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,036
This is bigger than the director level of NCIS or Mossad.

748
00:34:53,786 --> 00:34:55,569
This incident could jeopardize relations

749
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,898
between both of our countries for years.

750
00:34:57,951 --> 00:35:00,388
I figure someone hired him to do just that.

751
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:02,139
Well,I can think of ten countries

752
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,988
and a dozen terrorist groups that fit that bill.

753
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:06,889
Oh,yeah. I can,too.

754
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:08,951
Which is why I want you to do me a favor.

755
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,129
Name it.

756
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:11,842
It's late.

757
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,524
Go home,catch up on some sleep.

758
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,529
Plausible deniability.

759
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,029
Yeah.

760
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,577
Something like that.

761
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,480
Thank you.

762
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,200
-Jethro,it's good to... -I'm not back,Jen.

763
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:30,624
I'm just doing a favor for a friend.

764
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,225
I was just talking about your hair.

765
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,542
It's good to see it long again.

766
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,501
Reminds me of when we were undercover in Serbia.

767
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,964
Serbia?

768
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,677
Do you rember that little farmhouse we were holed up in?

769
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,131
A whole week with nothing to do,but...

770
00:35:50,135 --> 00:35:52,232
No. No,I don't,Jen.

771
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,329
Memory is a little fuzzy on some things.

772
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,447
We matched the dead guy's prints.

773
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,699
Balash Sassnio.

774
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,759
Arrested five years ago for reckless driving.

775
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,239
An illegal from Iran.

776
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,628
Student visa expired last year,boss.

777
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:38,993
Good job,McGee.

778
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:40,769
What about the cell phone Eschel called us on,Abs?

779
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,369
I isolated the grid the call came in from.

780
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,597
Nice work,Abs.

781
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,558
Actually,no,Tony.

782
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:49,658
The grid includes the entire city of Woodbridge,Virginia.

783
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:50,729
He could be anywhere in it

784
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:52,001
Great. We've got nothing.

785
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:56,543
Well,an ex-Mossad officer workin with an Iranian student is something, Gibbs.

786
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,141
Not if it doesn't help us find Eschel in time.

787
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,748
McGee,the BOLO we put out yesterday.

788
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,462
Any hits?

789
00:37:03,837 --> 00:37:06,642
You completely forgot about that,didn't you?

790
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,650
This one's on me,boss.

791
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,779
We have multiple hits.

792
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:17,209
Six hits on men fitting his general description.

793
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,365
Three in Delaware,one in Pennsylvania,

794
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,199
two in Virginia.

795
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,518
Closest match a local cop saw a man

796
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:25,156
fitting his exact profile at a Freemont Inn.

797
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:26,099
Where,McGee?

798
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:27,593
Woodbridge,Virginia

799
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,999
I'm telling you,Gibbs,don't call her.

800
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,029
She won't wait for us.

801
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,717
She will if I tell her to.

802
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,230
You found him?

803
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,541
The Freemont Inn in Woodbridge.

804
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:45,519
We'll swing by and pick you up.

805
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,456
There's no time,Gibbs.

806
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:48,389
He won't stay in one place for more than 24 hours.

807
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,470
I'll meet you there. Ziva,this isn't a debate.

808
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,441
We go in together or we don't go...

809
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,129
Let me guess,she's going without us?

810
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,308
If she kills him,

811
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,489
there won't be any way to prove the Israelis weren't behind this.

812
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,629
Yeah,I know. Let's roll.

813
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,519
-Hey.
-Hey! No.

814
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,729
This is my team now,Gibbs. My rules.

815
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,209
And DiNozzo's rule number one?

816
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,880
I don't sit on the sidelines when my people are in trouble.

817
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,406
You got a problem with that?

818
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,409
Then let's remember who's got the badge and who's a civilian.

819
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,079
You done?

820
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,296
Yeah.

821
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,328
I was going to say...

822
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,979
"Get McGee. I'll meet you there."

823
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,753
You know,I could arrest you for striking a federal officer.

824
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:27,279
I know that.

825
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,874
All right.

826
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,003
Just so you know.

827
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,416
I trust the rest of my money will be wired into my account shortly?

828
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,594
Of course.

829
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,939
Would you mind?

830
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,612
Careful,it's delicate.

831
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,437
I'm sorry,

832
00:39:09,464 --> 00:39:12,470
but no one can know my country was behind this,Eschel.

833
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,953
And with you gone,

834
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:22,734
no one will.

835
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,237
Who hired you?

836
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,071
Mossad.

837
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,725
Liar.Who?

838
00:39:57,046 --> 00:40:00,782
Go on,do it. You'll never make me talk.

839
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,871
I believe you.

840
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:05,907
Then,kill me.

841
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,216
Make your daddy proud,

842
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:09,850
Jew.

843
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,679
What are you doing?

844
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,371
Not making you a martyr. You're under arrest.

845
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:19,694
Your time with the Americans has made you soft.

846
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,836
You should not have thrown your knife away.

847
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,045
Get up.

848
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,609
Not so tough now,

849
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,130
are you?

850
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,683
I thought I told you to get up!

851
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,689
Who are you?

852
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,483
VEVAK.

853
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:00,919
Iranian intelligence?

854
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:03,349
Yes,and you have our thanks.

855
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:06,241
The Americans will never trust your country again.

856
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,077
It was easier than I thought.

857
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,059
Making you talk.

858
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,499
Ziva,you okay?

859
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,496
I'm okay,McGee.

860
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,058
You should have waited.

861
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,920
Who's she?

862
00:41:33,582 --> 00:41:34,929
Iranian intelligence.

863
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:36,608
They were behind it all.

864
00:41:36,715 --> 00:41:38,258
How do you plan on proving that?

865
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:40,990
I've been with NCIS for a year.

866
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:43,313
I'm not just a killer anymore.

867
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,648
I'm an investigator.

868
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,998
Now,can I go home?

869
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,232
The FBI reports they've apprehended the Iranian terrorist

870
00:41:57,272 --> 00:42:00,319
believed to be responsible for the death of two of their agents.

871
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:03,323
Two other terrorists were also killed in a standoff

872
00:42:03,363 --> 00:42:05,920
with federal authorities in Northern Virginia...

873
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,889
Federal authorities?

874
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:09,361
They mean us.

875
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:10,771
Four stinking letters.

876
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:11,780
N- C-I-S.

877
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,349
It's either that story,Tony,or the FBI charges you

878
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,856
with interfering in their investigation.

879
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:19,574
I can live with "federal authorities. "

880
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,189
Welcome home,Ziva.

881
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:27,115
Well,I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Gibbs.

882
00:42:27,302 --> 00:42:28,253
And me.

883
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:32,303
True,but,uh,mostly Gibbs.

884
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,686
Speaking of which...

885
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,066
He's in the squad room.

886
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,219
Where is he,McGee?Abby's lab?

887
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,536
Gibbs left,ma'am.

888
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:52,679
Said he had a plane to catch.

889
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,292
You sure about that,McGee?

890
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:56,217
Yeah,Tony,I'm sure.

891
00:42:56,595 --> 00:42:59,165
No. 'Cause he didn't even say good-bye to me.

892
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,200
Director,uh,he wanted me to give this to you.

893
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,357
Ah,nice snap.

894
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:12,817
Where was that taken?

895
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,156
Serbia.

896
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:15,659
When?

897
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:18,792
A lifetime ago,Ziva.
