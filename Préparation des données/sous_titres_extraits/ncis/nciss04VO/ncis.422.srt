1
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:11,632
You're late!

2
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:12,633
No, I'm not.

3
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:16,613
Most civilized people
eat breakfast at 7:00 a. m.

4
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:24,007
I got you wheat toast
and a salad.

5
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:27,039
It's doctor's orders until you
get your cholesterol down.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,906
And Vanity Fair called again; they want
to know where the photos are for the...

7
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,727
These are really...

8
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:53,142
"Really" what?

9
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:54,830
Boring?

10
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,455
Stupid?

11
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:58,548
What's wrong?

12
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,606
There's a man
in this photo and...

13
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,783
he's dead.

14
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:08,064

19
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:59,894
I didn't know that fixing a leak involved
tearing out half the wall.

20
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:01,422
I found it.

21
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:03,372
Nice work.

22
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,285
- Ready for payment?
- Not done.

23
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:08,119
What do you mean
you're not done?

24
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:11,093
The sleeve is only temporary;
pipes are old.

25
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:12,912
The leak's going to spread.

26
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:17,620
You've got to swap out all these
old iron pipes with copper.

27
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:19,482
All of them.

28
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:21,783
You know a good plumber?

29
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:24,547
I know a great plumber.

30
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:27,814
You ready for that jump payment?

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,956
Hang on.
Yeah, Gibbs.

32
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:34,531
Gibbs, a call came in
about a dead sailor.

33
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:36,402
Have them meet me there.

34
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:37,449
Go.

35
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:40,814
I'll be here
when you get back.

36
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:42,590
<i>A blind photographer?</i>

37
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:44,080
Well, apparently he's quite successful.

38
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,615
Why not? Beethoven was deaf.

39
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:50,238
After my assistant noticed
the body, I blew up the photo.

40
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:52,731
She saw the uniform, called you.

41
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:55,081
I'll need a copy
of your negative, Mr. Scott.

42
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:56,833
Sorry we're late, boss.

43
00:02:56,834 --> 00:03:00,868
Hit every red light and we
had to stop and get gas.

44
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:02,705
And some...

45
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,010
bratwurst?

46
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:10,327
Everybody gets hungry.

47
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:11,834
Where's the body?

48
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:14,835
Apparently there's been some
sort of miscommunication.

49
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:19,152
What? We carried all our equipment up
here for nothing.

50
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:20,559
Yeah "we".

51
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:23,804
Do you remember where you were
when you took that photo?

52
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:27,358
I was at the corner of 18th and Wescott
following the fruit.

53
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:31,522
Since Mr. Scott lost his eyesight in
an automobile accident ten years ago,

54
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:34,644
he's had to rely on his other
senses for his work.

55
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:38,664
Instead of following the light,
he'll go out and follow a sound

56
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,737
or in this case, a scent
as inspiration.

57
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,928
Last night, it was some
kind of... fruit smell.

58
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:46,902
Slightly rotted.

59
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:49,170
Like an orange, maybe.

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,867
Bad cologne, I followed it
for over an hour.

61
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:53,799
'Til I hit that underpass...

62
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:57,034
and then all I could
smell was vomit.

63
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:00,539
What's the inspiration
behind these?

64
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,118
Oh... I heard

65
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:06,470
a girl crying, I followed the tears.

66
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:08,530
I don't see a girl.

67
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:10,350
Neither did I.

68
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:16,656
It's funny how a hundred people
probably walked by this guy

69
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,657
and it took a blind man to find him.

70
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:20,000
"It's funny"?

71
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,626
Well, funny in a kind
of sad, pathetic way.

72
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:23,982
What if I was blind?

73
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:29,910
That technique may work
for the likes of Jackson Scott, Tony,

74
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:34,198
but a true investigator
keeps his eyes open at all times.

75
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:38,661
A lesson this unfortunate
would have done well to heed.

76
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:40,089
Does he have a name?

77
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,021
No wallet, no I.D.

78
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:43,222
Found this, Duck.

79
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,949
Sharp-force trauma to the abdomen,

80
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,851
making that
the probable murder weapon.

81
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:51,934
If this was a murder, of course.

82
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,363
Yeah, I know, I know.
It always is, isn't it?

83
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,878
I can't imagine what I'd do
if I lost my eyesight.

84
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,332
You'd adapt.

85
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,946
What if I didn't?

86
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:05,022
You'd fall into a deep depression
and eventually you would die.

87
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:09,349
Remind me not to come to you
for a pep talking anytime soon.

88
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:13,847
What?

89
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:14,992
Fresh vomit.

90
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:17,896
Whoever it belongs to
must have seen something.

91
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:22,385
Time of death
roughly 15 hours ago.

92
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,593
Those markings on his neck?

93
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:27,775
Yeah, well abrasions
such as those

94
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:30,682
usually result from the forcible
removal of jewelry.

95
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:33,795
Perhaps a crucifix
or in his case, his dog tags.

96
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:34,867
Pre-mortem?

97
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,885
Well, the inflammation
suggests he was still alive.

98
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:39,680
Combine that with the missing wallet...

99
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:41,412
Looks like a mugging.

100
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:44,177
I'll just swab under the fingernails.

101
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:46,185
He is right, actually.

102
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:50,017
Snatched necklace, missing wallet,
signs of struggle, textbook mugging.

103
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,702
Or it was made to look like one.

104
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:55,307
Although photography
didn't come came into its own

105
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:57,716
as an art form until the 20th century,

106
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:03,643
it was during the Civil War
that its more infamous side blossomed.

107
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:05,065
Oh, I know this...

108
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,529
Mathew Brady, the famous
battlefield photographer.

109
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,039
I said infamous, Mr. Palmer.

110
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:15,575
It wasn't pictures
of battlefields the soldiers wanted,

111
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,100
but subjects of a bluer nature.

112
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:21,001
I thought color film
wasn't invented until...

113
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,889
Oh, you mean...

114
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,289
As with all new media,
carnal activity

115
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,368
came to the forefront,
thus proving the old adage...

116
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:31,708
Sex sells.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,579
Yes, it does.

118
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,978
Although I assume that's not what you came
down here to discuss.

119
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,316
- That's a good guess.
- Yeah, well, how about another one?

120
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:42,420
You came down here
hoping that I had found some

121
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:44,938
subtle incongruity in my autopsy

122
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,525
that would shed some light
on this dastardly mystery.

123
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:50,543
Always seems to
be the case, Duck.

124
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,425
Yes, well, all I've done so far is

125
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,445
to confirm my initial
impression as to the cause of death.

126
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:56,546
He was stabbed.

127
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:57,928
Right in the stomach.

128
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:03,116
Now, even with medical intervention,
this lad was not long for this world.

129
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:05,373
You mean Petty Officer Peter Lynn.

130
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:08,384
Worked in the Supply Corps
at the Defense Logistics Agency,

131
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:13,437
which is also know as DLA,
if you're ever in the K-N-O-W.

132
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:19,000
They're the guys who supply the military,
you know, with pretty much everything.

133
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:20,305
You already knew this.

134
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:24,173
He was a liaison to the Naval Space Command,
which is the spy satellite guys.

135
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:26,113
You remember the time we had
the naked girl on the beach...

136
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:28,740
you already know about all this.

137
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:31,995
Abby got a hit off the prints.

138
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:33,660
That's not all Abby got.

139
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,232
She was able to match
mitochondrial fragments

140
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:40,455
in the vomit to the cellular material
scraped from the victim's fingernails.

141
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,121
They both came from the assailant.

142
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:43,604
The old snatch and vomit?

143
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:47,616
Emesis, as it is known,
is not uncommon in first-time offenders.

144
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:51,567
They learn the hard way that they don't
have the stomach for a life of crime.

145
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,982
Take our mugger's last supper:

146
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:57,020
a cheese blintz, some red wine...

147
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,083
no doubt a cheap bordeaux...

148
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,580
and almost a pound of veal.

149
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,605
Mugging business must be good, Duck.

150
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:06,288
I'll have Ziva start running
down the local restaurants.

151
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:08,980
Uh, I got an address on
Petty Officer Lynn, as well.

152
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,230
So, where were we?

153
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:13,479
Pornography.

154
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:17,042
Yes, I believe it was
photography, Mr. Palmer.

155
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:20,925
Kindly try to keep
your mind out of the gutter.

156
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,919
What is it?

157
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,252
Perhaps I have found a subtle
incongruity after all.

158
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:33,013
Thank you.

159
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,776
You take over here.

160
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:41,594
I need to consult with Ms. Sciuto.

161
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:52,234
Hello?

162
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:57,425
Where did that come from?

163
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,020
I haven't the foggiest idea.

164
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:03,582
Really? How incongruous.

165
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:06,947
Please dispose of this, Mr. Palmer.

166
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,676
Hi. Yeah, well, I found the bra.

167
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,097
It was a close call, but, uh...

168
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,020
Oh, no, no.
No panties, we just...

169
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,886
What do you mean a matching set?

170
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:35,394
Petty Officer Lynn live alone?
We'll find out soon enough.

171
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,999
Hmm, the Eagle Nebula.

172
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:50,458
Trash.

173
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,411
What are you talking about "trash"?

174
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:55,253
This is known as the Pillars
of Creation, Tony.

175
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,773
Talking about this.

176
00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:01,949
He must really not like
taking the trash out.

177
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,078
Maybe it's not trash.

178
00:10:10,518 --> 00:10:11,790
Yeah, what do you got, Duck?

179
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,287
An interesting development, Jethro.

180
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:15,144
When I opened
Petty Officer Lynn's stomach,

181
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,003
I discovered that he, too,

182
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:19,794
before his mugging had eaten
a cheese blintz.

183
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:21,082
Popular dish.

184
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:22,749
Coincidence? No.

185
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,185
I found traces of the same
wine in both stomachs.

186
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:28,530
The D-glucose levels in the tannin,
it's like a fingerprint.

187
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,988
They shared a meal,
Jethro, which means...

188
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,631
It wasn't a random mugging.

189
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,355
Never thought
I'd be doing this again so soon.

190
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,768
When was the last time?

191
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:53,567
After my Psych Evaluation Profile.
I wanted to read the rough drafts.

192
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:56,250
- What'd they say?
- I have no idea.

193
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:59,116
The papers I reconstructed...
they weren't mine.

194
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,833
They're yours.

195
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:02,619
Mine?

196
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:05,650
You read my psych profile? What'd it say?

197
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:07,497
Ah, it's better you don't know, McGee.

198
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:09,006
Got your message.
What do you got, Abs?

199
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:12,374
Trash, and lots of it. Sadly, nothing
that can identify the owner.

200
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,696
Yet.

201
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:15,086
No thanks.

202
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,488
I quit.

203
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:19,102
Quit? You?

204
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:22,076
I decided it was time
to cut down on the caffeine.

205
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:25,545
I wish I could tell I've already
reconstructed these documents.

206
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:28,636
I've got it run on an automated program,
but it's still going to take some time.

207
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:30,466
You called me down here
to tell me you got nothing?

208
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,692
Me, nothing.

209
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:37,340
But Mister Mildly Neurotic Introvert
with a highly sensitive ego...

210
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,029
he has something.

211
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,834
Yeah. Um,

212
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:42,992
I was going through
Petty Officer Lynn's computer,

213
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,704
looking for an address book,
and I found this.

214
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,270
It's called Celestia.

215
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:50,109
It's an open-source astronomy
program popular

216
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,392
with space enthusiasts,
people in the field.

217
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:54,461
I'm not one of them, McGee.

218
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,688
Sorry. My point is, it's supposed to be
an accurate simulation,

219
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,977
but I found a star system
that doesn't belong.

220
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:01,259
Of course you did.

221
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:04,349
Program's open source.

222
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:08,199
That means you can adapt it to pretty much
anything... education, games.

223
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,945
You can store grocery lists,
or in this case,

224
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:13,020
- use it for a diary.
- What better place

225
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:17,618
to hide all your personal secrets
than in a galaxy far far away?

226
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:19,163
What's he hiding?

227
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,217
Well, for the most
part, not a whole lot.

228
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:23,657
It's about the most boring diary
I've ever read.

229
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:27,085
An obsession with Kelly Clarkson.
Wondering why he can't find a girlfriend.

230
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:29,813
He didn't make the connection
between those two things?

231
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:31,941
Two weeks ago, though, it got interesting.

232
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:34,004
Lynn claims that
he was contacted by someone

233
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:36,498
at the Naval Inspector General's
office in Norfolk.

234
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:37,750
Asked to go on a mission.

235
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,467
- He say who?
- Nope.

236
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,347
Didn't say what kind, either.
That was the last entry.

237
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:53,319
You were kidding about the
delicate ego thing, right?

238
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,182
A question that answers itself.

239
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:09,264
My name is Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

240
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:11,879
This is my partner, Ziva David.

241
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,486
Commander Doug Jakobsen.

242
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:27,254
So, what can the Inspector General's
Office do for our investigative cousins?

243
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:30,409
Are you familiar with a Petty Officer
by the name of Peter Lynn?

244
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:32,997
Excuse me.

245
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:37,134
Yes, I'm familiar with the name.

246
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:40,105
Was he helping with an investigation
out of this office?

247
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,448
Petty Officer Lynn...

248
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:47,640
...isn't helping with an investigation.

249
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,542
He's the subject of it.

250
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:51,499
- There's nothing on his record.
- There wouldn't be.

251
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,079
The investigation is classified.

252
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:55,804
But you guys saved me a call.

253
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:59,246
I was just about to bring NCIS in on this.

254
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:06,889
We believe P.O. Lynn is abusing
his position as a DLA Storekeeper.

255
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:11,642
Providing info on military purchases
to competing vendors.

256
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,023
Not anymore.

257
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,159
Petty Officer Lynn's dead.

258
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:19,883
- How?
- Stabbed to death.

259
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:22,287
Someone tried
to make it look like a mugging.

260
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:25,901
Suspects?

261
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:28,420
An accomplice, perhaps.

262
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:30,901
We thought he was working alone.

263
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,807
Maybe his buyers
are covering their tracks.

264
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,065
Good luck sniffing them out.

265
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,070
Now that there's been a murder,
NCIS gets sole jurisdiction,

266
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:46,820
but if there's anything
I can do, let me know.

267
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:51,180
Something wrong?

268
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:56,125
No... other than
a dead petty officer.

269
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,153
He betrayed his country.

270
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:00,900
Far as I'm concerned,
he got what was coming to him.

271
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,029
Oh, come on already!

272
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:04,620
Please stay on the line.

273
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:07,246
Your call will be answered
in the order in which it was received.

274
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:10,600
I got your message.
Yeah.

275
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:11,819
Why didn't you answer your phone?

276
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,119
I've been on hold with the
Department of Development.

277
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,870
What about your cell?

278
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:18,788
On hold with the Secretary
of the Commonwealth's office.

279
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,018
And...

280
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,567
they disconnected me again.

281
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:23,044
Jeanne, what's going on?

282
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:25,395
I'm being evicted.
My building is going condo.

283
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,124
Condo?

284
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,767
Is there something funny about that?

285
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:31,993
No, I just... I got
your message, and so I...

286
00:15:32,302 --> 00:15:33,346
Never mind.

287
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:35,388
- What can I do?
- You're doing it.

288
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:36,810
Thank you for coming.

289
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,263
It's no problem, because

290
00:15:41,264 --> 00:15:44,382
I said I had a dentist's
appointment. Again.

291
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:48,583
I've got 30 days to find a new place,
but no time to go apartment hunting.

292
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:51,582
One of my colleagues offered me
their couch if I can't find anything.

293
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,769
No. I've seen Grey's Anatomy.
That's out.

294
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,662
My mother offered me a bed.

295
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,286
So, I either fight it, or...

296
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:02,099
We get a place together.

297
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,226
Tony.

298
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:15,573
Yeah.

299
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,605
Department of Housing and Development.

300
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:21,044
How may we direct your call?

301
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:22,469
Nowhere.

302
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:25,767
I'm moving in with my boyfriend.

303
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:36,125
The fifth photo was a... Streetlight.

304
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:38,288
Oh, yeah, right, right, right.

305
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:39,988
Halogen one.

306
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:43,774
Let me see, uh...

307
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,592
Oh, yeah, yeah, there was a,
couple having a fight nearby.

308
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:49,858
A hot dog vendor.

309
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:53,546
And something that smelled like mothballs.

310
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,444
- I didn't get too close.
- The next one is...

311
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:57,453
I'm not used to working with anyone.

312
00:16:57,454 --> 00:17:00,050
Bad news from the dentist?

313
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:02,811
Something like that.

314
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:05,558
Okay, um, this is number six?

315
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,357
That's where Mr.
Scott first picked up the fruit smell.

316
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:09,545
You with him?

317
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:12,154
No. I was in the office
when he left.

318
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:15,210
I work alone, and I like it that way.

319
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:19,286
Bryn writes our press releases, so I had to
go over the photos with her this morning.

320
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:24,385
Like I said,
it was an unusual scent, so I followed it.

321
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,376
Why aren't we using the plasma?

322
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:29,567
He said he didn't like looking
at his pictures on a computer.

323
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,112
He's blind.

324
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:36,403
Okay, this is seven.

325
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:39,339
Looks like a... it could be a sewer.

326
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,886
And I'm the blind one.

327
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:43,635
You got the pictures out of order, honey.

328
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:46,747
Number seven's a sky shot... number 22
is the low-angle.

329
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,238
Good memory.

330
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:50,293
Yeah, well,
I don't have much choice.

331
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:52,645
Either that, or I break my nose
walking into walls.

332
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:55,770
Number 22 is where Mr. Scott
lost the fruit smell.

333
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,623
I recognize that graffiti.

334
00:17:57,624 --> 00:17:59,374
It's on the restaurant

335
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,081
where I tracked Petty Officer Lynn
to his last supper.

336
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,316
You found the restaurant?

337
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:06,564
Well, there's not too many places
that serve cheese blintzes.

338
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,724
But no one remembers
seeing the petty officer.

339
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:10,954
If he was the source of the smell he never
came out of there.

340
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:13,648
And if he wasn't, then he was
probably with the guy who was.

341
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:15,126
They could have used the back exit.

342
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,256
Which would make sense
if they were having a clandestine

343
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,879
meeting and were worried
about being followed.

344
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,479
Check, uh...
number 18.

345
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:27,369
There was a car idling
outside the restaurant.

346
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:32,982
- Sorry.
- I'll get those.

347
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:34,717
Time to go digital.

348
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:36,006
How long was he there?

349
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:38,324
Well, he was still there when I left.

350
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,153
Can you get the license?

351
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,845
Accessing the Virginia DMV.

352
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:54,661
We only have a partial plate,
but we can narrow it down

353
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,519
- by making model.
- Really?

354
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:58,543
Sarcasm is not sexy, Ziva.

355
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:00,990
Narrowing the list down
to make and model.

356
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:06,003
Got it. License plate T-A
five, four, zero, two, one.

357
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:09,566
Registered to a David Wong, 41, civilian.

358
00:19:09,794 --> 00:19:10,962
Record?

359
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,381
Guy's squeaky clean...
no criminal record,

360
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:16,453
no outstanding parking tickets.

361
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:20,771
Works in Inventory Management at the
Defense Logistics Agency.

362
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:23,259
Who else works there, he thought sexily?

363
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,439
I know a petty officer who used to.

364
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,687
And just as squeaky.

365
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:30,230
Call McGee and have him bring
David Wong in here.

366
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:35,059
I was just about to call you, Tony.

367
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:37,978
I was going to say great minds
think alike, but, well,you know.

368
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:40,686
- Got a lead.
- Yeah, we do, too. We found a car

369
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:44,360
outside the restaurant
Petty Officer Lynn ate at. A Honda licence plate...

370
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,265
T- A, five, four, zero, two, one?

371
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:47,935
- Good guess.
- Not a guess.

372
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,953
I'm standing
right in front of it.

373
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:52,957
I spoke to Petty Officer Lynn's
superiors.

374
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:55,183
They had a lot of nice things
to say about him.

375
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:57,964
It's the guy in the office
across the hall they were worried about.

376
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,684
- David Wong.
- That's right.

377
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,009
Why were they worried?

378
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:04,072
He left for lunch
four hours ago, never came back.

379
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:16,607
A blind photographer.

380
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:18,318
That is a new one.

381
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:19,998
Is he a suspect?

382
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:21,241
Not yet.

383
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:24,612
Uh... got to come straight in.

384
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:28,432
So, he takes a picture
of a dead body,

385
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:30,749
who just happens to be

386
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,630
under investigation for the
Inspector General's office?

387
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,119
Thought you didn't like
coincidences.

388
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,017
Well, that's why I said not yet.

389
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:41,720
You got any suspects?

390
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,469
A co-worker of Petty Officer
Lynn's went MIA today.

391
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,305
Left in a hurry

392
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:51,562
I'd offer to help you with your manhunt,

393
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:55,548
but I filed for retirement today.

394
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,475
Plus, I got my own manhunt
to worry about.

395
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:08,736
This is the part where
you say something.

396
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:11,174
I'm not sure which part to start with.

397
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,576
You could start with how you feel.

398
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:14,975
- How do you feel?
- Good.

399
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:18,357
I'm ready for something permanent.
And the Army's not going to,

400
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,436
you know, give that to me but...

401
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:24,845
That's a nice try, but,

402
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:27,345
this is the part where
you say something,

403
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:28,593
remember?

404
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:31,525
I guess I'm wondering what you mean
by "permanent. "

405
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:38,961
I mean that... I like you.

406
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,624
And...

407
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:43,010
I think you like me, too.

408
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:50,145
You're going to have to
confirm or deny that.

409
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:52,240
I like you.

410
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:55,881
Good.

411
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:59,590
Well, as you know,

412
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:02,306
when two people like each other,

413
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:05,918
they usually like to spend time
with each other.

414
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,696
And I consider my time valuable,

415
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:11,465
thus I consider time spent
with you an investment.

416
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:15,164
That makes me like...
what?

417
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,394
A CD?

418
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:20,240
At our age, more like an IRA.

419
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,364
And I've, I've already,

420
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,701
uh, invested a lot in it.

421
00:22:26,697 --> 00:22:29,043
You never know how things
are going to turn out,

422
00:22:29,044 --> 00:22:32,470
and I'm not asking for promises.
I just need to know

423
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:35,114
if you're in this for the long haul.

424
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:42,118
I want to start building something,
and I want to build it with you.

425
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:57,461
Holly, I do like you.

426
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,097
I'm just...

427
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,415
What? Wounded?

428
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,233
- Afraid to love?
- I'm in the middle of a case,

429
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:11,017
and I'm not real focused right now.

430
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:18,627
Okay, well, I didn't expect
to get an answer tonight,

431
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:21,323
but I did have to ask the question.

432
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:25,053
I'm leaving for Fort Bragg.

433
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:28,160
I'm helping
choose my replacement tomorrow.

434
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:32,698
You know, and hopefully when I get back
you may have an answer for me.

435
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,915
I'd hate to have
to find a new plumber.

436
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:46,272
No hits on the BOLO yet.

437
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,722
Co-workers said he'd been
acting strange all week.

438
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:51,726
If he planned his run,
it'll make him that much harder to find.

439
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:53,455
Did you track his cell calls yet?

440
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:56,098
Agent Lee is getting the warrant now.
She's at the U.S. Attorney's office.

441
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:58,227
And Abby's processing evidence
from his office.

442
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,750
She nearly bit my head off when
I poked it in to her lab

443
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:02,657
- to check on her.
- Quit drinking caffeine.

444
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:03,788
Abby?

445
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,920
Abby Sciuto?

446
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:09,468
- Yes, boss?
- Wong, David Wong.

447
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,110
We have two competing theories
on Mr. Wong.

448
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:14,645
- Theory one...
- It is possible that David Wong

449
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:16,656
and Petty Officer Lynn
were working together.

450
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:19,334
And then they had a fall out and
Wong ended their relationship.

451
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:20,639
Theory two.

452
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,035
The Commander from the I.G. had it wrong
about Petty Officer Lynn.

453
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:27,262
Wong was selling the info,
Lynn found out, Wong killed him for it.

454
00:24:27,263 --> 00:24:29,851
We figure out a motive,
we'll figure out where he's going.

455
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:31,894
First, we need that warrant.

456
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:33,286
I've got it right here.

457
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:37,676
Uh, Agent Lee faxed this over.
I thought I'd run it up to you.

458
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:40,665
- McGee.
- Yeah? On it, boss.

459
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:45,991
All right, pulling up his records.

461
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,502
You need something else?

462
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,116
Uh... no.

463
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:04,883
Palmer's been acting
like that all morning.

464
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:08,100
Earlier, I caught him at the gym
hiding in the towel bins.

465
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:09,748
Bank records are coming up.

466
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,289
No unusual activity.

467
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,260
You know what?
I got to make a pit stop.

468
00:25:23,182 --> 00:25:25,728
I can't think of anything
charming or pithy to say.

469
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:28,400
Well... I have fantastic news.

470
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,237
I think I found us a place.

471
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,602
That's great.

472
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:35,819
It's a three bedroom apartment,
not far from the university

473
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,258
or the hospital and has really
cute floral wallpaper.

474
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:44,999
That, that, that's great.

475
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,498
Great as in... "great" or...

476
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:49,711
"great" as in you're having
second thoughts?

477
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:51,277
I'm not having second thoughts.

478
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:55,101
Is there a third option?

479
00:25:57,676 --> 00:25:59,135
Don't do this to me, Tony.

480
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:00,244
Jeanne...

481
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,878
You didn't have to say anything yesterday.
You could have just given me a hug

482
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:07,395
and told me everything would be okay.
That would have been more than enough.

483
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:10,909
But don't tell me you want to
live with me, then take it back.

484
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,386
I am not taking it back.

485
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:17,224
When I suggested that we live together,
I was speaking from...

486
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:21,104
you know... what's that,
the thing in you rib cage?

487
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:23,075
Heart.

488
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:25,513
Heart. Yeah.

489
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:28,722
I was... and I am.

490
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:30,920
And I meant it.

491
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:31,933
I'm just...

492
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:33,861
A commitmentphobe afraid to love.

493
00:26:33,998 --> 00:26:35,337
Right in the middle there.

494
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:40,337
And I'm... I'm just not very
focused right now.

495
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,588
And I'm not a big fan of floral.

496
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:44,311
I'll be honest with you.

497
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,697
Okay, then...

498
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:49,169
I'll keep looking, if

499
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,629
you're sure that's all that it is?

500
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:53,912
Yeah. I'm sure.

501
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:56,804
Then what are you doing on the phone?
Get back to work.

502
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:58,265
Yes, ma'am.

503
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:05,998
- Hi.
- Hey.

504
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:07,867
Abby called; she found something.

505
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:09,087
Wanted us to come down.

506
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:12,053
- If you're done, that is.
- I'm sorry, boss, I... I'm...

507
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:13,152
I know.

508
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,710
DiNozzo, trust me.

509
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:18,019
I know.

510
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,078
How long were you guys there?

511
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,109
Long enough.

512
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:28,062
So you are getting a new roommate?

513
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,062
We're discussing it.

514
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:33,727
What is there to discuss?

515
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,065
It's complicated.

516
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:37,102
Complicated, complicated, complicated.

517
00:27:37,878 --> 00:27:41,743
You know, in America, I have noticed
they use that word as a code

518
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,667
for... "If I explain it,
you would not agree,

519
00:27:44,668 --> 00:27:48,843
"therefore I will use he word complicated
and hopefully, you will stop asking ".

520
00:27:48,953 --> 00:27:51,930
Yeah, that's pretty much it in a nutshell.
I'm gonna go see what Abby wants.

521
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:53,492
- Tony...
- Ziva.

522
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,917
If you're going to give
me advice on dating,

523
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:01,173
I'm going to need to get something out
of my system first, okay?

524
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:10,585
Stop laughing or I will hurt you.

525
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,806
I know what you're doing.
You're hiding behind all these jokes.

526
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,751
And I know what you're hiding from.

527
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:18,500
Really? What's that?

528
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:21,392
Everyone who is afraid to love hides from

529
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,057
getting hurt.

530
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:27,212
It's not just me

531
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:30,079
that I'm worrying about hurting, Ziva.

532
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:34,032
That's because you're a good person.

533
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,588
It's a low-frequency,
acoustic RF buffer transmitter.

534
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:50,026
- English, Abs.
- It's a bug.

535
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:54,847
I found it embedded underneath the
"Caps Lock" key of David Wong's keyboard.

536
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:58,112
I thought the DLA ran routine
security sweeps.

537
00:28:58,113 --> 00:28:59,623
How did they miss it?

538
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:01,889
The same way I almost did.

539
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,970
Okay.

540
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:09,024
To avoid detection from internal sensors,
the bug records for five hours...

541
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:15,378
...and then blast sends the
data in under five seconds.

542
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,022
- A little bug can do all that?
- Yeah.

543
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:20,728
It can if it only records a few,
tiny sub-audible frequencies.

544
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:22,291
"Sub-audible" meaning?

545
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,691
- Humans can't hear it.
- So, what?

546
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:27,671
- Lassie's bugging this guy?
- I think,

547
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:29,037
he bugged himself.

548
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,757
Don't you like the way I do that?
Like, right when you think you know

549
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:34,533
where I'm going,
it's like... shazam... a hard turn.

550
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:36,121
He bugged himself?

551
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:37,879
- Abs!
- Sorry, Gibbs.

552
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,858
I'm just a little bit distracted.

553
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:45,799
Better.
Sub-audible bug!

554
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,900
Whoever planted it wasn't
eavesdropping on conversations.

555
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:50,509
They were listening for keyboard taps.

556
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,677
Every key makes a
similar but unique sound.

557
00:29:52,678 --> 00:29:55,981
With the right software,
you can record the keystrokes...

558
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:59,171
then using a decoding algorithm,
you can figure out what was typed.

559
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,404
The virtual Rosetta Stone.

560
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,236
A bug like this would bypass
all security protocols.

561
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,936
No password would be safe.

562
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:10,150
David Wong had access
to some pretty sensitive info.

563
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:12,261
Why would he need to bug himself?

564
00:30:12,262 --> 00:30:14,013
He already knew his passwords.

565
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:16,017
No, he didn't.

566
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:19,622
The DLA uses RSA Secure ID.

567
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:24,075
It's a hardware token that regenerates
authentication every minute.

568
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:27,051
If Wong had a partner, the best way
to give him access would be to...

569
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:28,390
Bug himself.

570
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:32,996
- Does this record more than passwords?
- It records everything that's typed.

571
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,058
- Okay, let's see it.
- But we can't.

572
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:37,058
'Cause it broadcasts and it then dumps.

573
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:39,014
You could try the buffer.

574
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:46,681
Sorry. You guys say that
every once in awhile, so I thought...

575
00:30:47,986 --> 00:30:49,033
He's right.

576
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:50,371
- He is?
- I am?

577
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:54,820
If we treat the buffer like a normal
hard drive, even if it erased itself,

578
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:56,794
we should be able to get
something off of it.

579
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:58,717
Accessing the RAM buffer.

580
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,965
We've got something.

581
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:06,826
Wong was looking for directions
to an abandoned DLA warehouse.

582
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:08,848
Perhaps a rendezvous with his buyers?

583
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:10,461
Or he was worried we'd trace the murder

584
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:12,937
of Petty Officer Lynn to him
and he decided to run.

585
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,820
- Address.
- Got it.

586
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:17,086
That's good work, Abs.

587
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:34,467
Nice place.

588
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:36,870
Don't think Wong chose
this location for scenery.

589
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:38,365
McGee, DiNozzo.

590
00:31:45,623 --> 00:31:48,281
If Wong was running,
he didn't get very far.

591
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:55,301
Federal agents!

592
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:11,869
Wrong.
He got about as far as he could get.

593
00:32:18,715 --> 00:32:24,403
The telltale inverted "V", combined with
the hemorrhaging of the lips and eyelids,

594
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:27,716
fractured cervical vertebrae...

595
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:32,155
No evidence of any drugs in his system,
and only his DNA on the rope.

596
00:32:32,156 --> 00:32:34,001
Let me guess...
he hung himself.

597
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,891
It certainly would pear that way.

598
00:32:35,892 --> 00:32:37,884
- He have any help?
- He may have.

599
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:43,637
A murder could easily cover up a ligature
strangulation with a post-mortem hanging.

600
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:47,396
I understand there was some
kind of note from Mr. Wong.

601
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:49,816
Took the credit for killing
Petty Officer Lynn.

602
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:53,373
Wong said he and Lynn were partners
on a con, embezzling from the DLA,

603
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:56,044
until Lynn tried to blackmail
Wong out of his share.

604
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:57,627
So Wong killed him.

605
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:58,963
Tried to make it look like a mugging.

606
00:32:58,964 --> 00:33:02,378
Then he panicked when he learned
NCIS figured out it wasn't.

607
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:05,743
"I'm sorry, I never meant
for any of this to happen.

608
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:07,219
"May God have mercy.

609
00:33:08,095 --> 00:33:09,608
David B. Wong".

610
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:11,820
Abby verified the handwriting.

611
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:15,400
You know, the vomit near the body

612
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:18,293
contained copious
amounts of cheese blintz.

613
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,485
David Wong was lactose intolerant.

614
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:25,857
If he had consumed that much cheese,
that would explain his throwing up.

615
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:27,714
Puts Wong at the underpass.

616
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,654
Which corroborates his letter.

617
00:33:29,655 --> 00:33:31,199
Yet you doubt it?

618
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,787
Mugging wasn't a mugging.

619
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:35,516
So the suicide may not be a suicide.

620
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:38,246
In the mugging, certain
key facts did not add up.

621
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:41,173
But here, I'm afraid,
there are no such discrepancies.

622
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:45,379
Well, I've got a discrepancy.
Evidence bag says David G. Wong.

623
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,496
Yes. His middle name was George.

624
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:50,089
Then why'd he sign his name with a "B"?

625
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,303
Perhaps he was a sending us a message.

626
00:33:52,304 --> 00:33:54,469
Letter "B" is not much of a message.

627
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,194
I find it very doubtful
that he would make a mistake.

628
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:58,871
Besides, if he wrote a note under duress,

629
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:02,202
the message would have to be
something the killer would not notice.

630
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:04,177
Could be part of the killer's initials.

631
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:06,113
- Is that at you'd write, DiNozzo?
- No.

632
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:09,083
Two letters would be circumstantial,
one letter is just useless.

633
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:12,834
Perhaps there's another place
where David Wong used the false initial.

634
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:15,646
I already checked. DMV, bank records.

635
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:19,303
Only place that Wong used the letter "B"
is on the suicide note.

636
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:21,929
Maybe it wasn't one letter then.
McGee, run it.

637
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:24,492
Whoa, stop it right there. There.

638
00:34:25,127 --> 00:34:27,530
- What?
- The Bs are different.

639
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:30,998
Thirteen.

640
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:32,764
It's not a letter. it's a number.

641
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:34,637
Actually, I think it's both.

642
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:38,279
Boss, I think this is an "I"
and a three together.

643
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,413
After Wong's suicide note,
I checked his office's records.

644
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,411
They code their invoices
with an "I" followed

645
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:46,106
by a number corresponding to department.

646
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:47,943
I've gotten as far as I-5,

647
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:50,672
but I didn't find anything to corroborate
the claim of embezzment.

648
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:52,749
Look again.

649
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,391
That's good advice, Gibbs.
That's exactly what I did.

650
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:57,624
You're going to love what I found.

651
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,598
The first thing I did when I got
the photos...

652
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,622
Was run facial-recognition software
on every face you could find.

653
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:04,923
Which led nowhere.

654
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:07,535
Thank you both for that
reminder of my failure.

655
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:09,690
Haven't failed me yet, Abs.

656
00:35:10,257 --> 00:35:13,277
I thought I had squeezed all the data
I could out of the photos,

657
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,806
until Jackson Scott walked in
and humbled me.

658
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:19,510
The man uses echolocation
to find obstacles in his way.

659
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:23,098
No Shamu jokes.
Echolocation is reflected sound,

660
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:28,131
which made me think of reflected images.
Which made me find... this.

661
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:34,720
I know, it's a blur,

662
00:35:34,721 --> 00:35:37,251
but that's because the photons
of light in the image,

663
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:39,000
they're spread out in time.

664
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:40,187
But you can de-spread them.

665
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:43,333
Well, the technical term
is "deconvolution," but yeah.

666
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:48,349
So I calculated the shutter speed,
merging the photons into a coherent image.

667
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,010
The final results are still processing.

668
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:54,520
But this is good enough for an ID.
Look familiar?

669
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:02,501
Relax. There's nothing
to be nervous about.

670
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:04,371
Then why am I in an interrogation room?

671
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:05,778
That's a good point.

672
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:07,285
Maybe you should be nervous.

673
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,413
I haven't done anything wrong.

674
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:11,045
Actually, you did.

675
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,439
But we're going to give you
another chance to correct it.

676
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:16,347
So, tell us again,

677
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,817
where were you the night your boss
took this picture?

678
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:23,352
I told you already.

679
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:26,794
I was in Mr. Scott's office until 6:00.
And then I went straight home.

680
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:29,437
She was at your loft when you left?

681
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,221
Told you that already, too.

682
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:33,762
I'm blind, but you guys are deaf.

683
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:35,564
You believe her?

684
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:37,827
Well, why would I think she's lying?

685
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,175
Because she is.

686
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:41,029
So if you went straight home,

687
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,270
then what are you doing in this photo
your boss took that night?

688
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:51,690
It's interesting you didn't notice
she was there.

689
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:53,609
Yet you noticed everything else.

690
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:55,326
I see.

691
00:36:55,643 --> 00:36:58,235
She's not the only one being interrogated.

692
00:36:58,236 --> 00:37:00,140
Care to change your testimony?

693
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:02,372
I took the long way home.

694
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,412
I must have walked by
where Mr Scott was shooting.

695
00:37:05,895 --> 00:37:07,878
If I did, I didn't realize he was there.

696
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:10,468
So you two were within
20 feet of each other...

697
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:13,026
And neither of you knew
the other was there.

698
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:14,882
It's possible Bryn wouldn't
have noticed me.

699
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:17,474
I work hard to keep
myself below people's radar.

700
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:20,358
But I would have certainly noticed her.

701
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:22,229
Why didn't you?

702
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,204
I don't know.

703
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:28,812
We showed your photo
to the staff at the restaurant

704
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:32,024
where Petty Officer Lynn
was having his last supper.

705
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:35,061
And one of the waiters
identified you at the lobby.

706
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:38,598
You being at the same restaurant
as Petty Officer Lynn a coincidence, too?

707
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,472
Because I don't think
the jury will see it that way.

708
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:43,548
What they will see is the person

709
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:46,722
he had dinner with
then lured him to the underpass,

710
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,514
- and stabbed him to death.
- No.

711
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:51,285
- It's not what happened.
- Then tell me what did!

712
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:56,653
I was following Mr. Scott.

713
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,400
But I lost him for a few minutes.

714
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:02,113
I just ducked into the restaurant

715
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,859
for a second when he came around
the corner and surprised me.

716
00:38:07,006 --> 00:38:09,610
Jackson's harder
to follow than you'd think.

717
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:14,908
I have to wear special shoes and perfume
when I follow him.

718
00:38:15,272 --> 00:38:17,056
Fruity perfume by any chance?

719
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:19,869
- Lavender.
- Why were you following him?

720
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,064
- I don't understand this.
- Why were you following him?

721
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:25,387
- I was the one who called NCIS...
- Why were you following him?!

722
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:31,489
You're in love with him.

723
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:38,637
If you think his photos are brilliant,

724
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:42,242
you should see him work.

725
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:46,533
He can't see, but he still sees
more than most people.

726
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,667
I lied to you, because if Jackson knew
I was following him...

727
00:38:57,243 --> 00:38:59,020
I didn't see your petty officer.

728
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:01,676
And if he was there when I was,

729
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,675
I wouldn't have noticed.

730
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,776
For a man who can see
more than most people, I...

731
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:16,821
managed to miss the thing
that counts the most.

732
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,848
Better late than never, I suppose.

733
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:23,188
- You going to let her go now?
- Now, no.

734
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:25,020
After we corroborate, yeah.

735
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:27,576
Maybe Wong's suicide note
was legit after all.

736
00:39:30,323 --> 00:39:31,405
Oh, I'm sorry.

737
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,937
I was just looking for some pipettes,
which are clearly not here.

738
00:39:36,263 --> 00:39:37,310
Bye.

739
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,583
What?

740
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,455
The fruit smell from that night.

741
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:48,949
Oh. Oh, my gosh.

742
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:50,928
I forgot to take my insulin.

743
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:54,866
I was so busy looking for
the pipettes that I forgot.

744
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:56,132
Insulin?

745
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,612
Yeah, I have mild diabetes.

746
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:02,815
When my blood sugar spikes,
my breath gets a mild fruity smell.

747
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:05,699
Is it really that bad?

748
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:10,323
Why is everyone looking at me
like I'm in some kind of trouble?

749
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:19,490
Well, I got your message.

750
00:40:19,491 --> 00:40:21,615
What's this about
a breach of our security?

751
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:24,428
We believe someone's been running
a bogus investigation out of your office.

752
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,795
The Lynn case?

753
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:28,665
Our suspect told Petty
Officer Lynn a co-worker

754
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:31,095
was under investigation
for embezzling.

755
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,475
A lie.

756
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:35,853
And asked Lynn to plant a bug
in the co-worker's office.

757
00:40:36,437 --> 00:40:38,239
That co-worker was David Wong.

758
00:40:38,514 --> 00:40:42,187
The lie was to get Wong's password
to the DLA accounting database.

759
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:44,649
The suspect was the one
who was embezzling.

760
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,348
You can check DLA ledger I-three.
It's all there.

761
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:52,183
The funny part is Wong grew suspicious
and contacted you, which is ironic, since

762
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:53,738
you were the one running
the bogus investigation

763
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:55,461
out of this office in the first place.

764
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:58,889
We traced the log-ons to DLA's servers
back to your computer.

765
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,997
Also, a waiter places you
at the restaurant with Lynn.

766
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:03,486
And we have come to  believe that it was

767
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:06,730
Colonel Mustard in the
conservatory with a wrench.

768
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:09,256
How?

769
00:41:10,288 --> 00:41:13,893
Jackson Scott decided to follow the fruit.

770
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,987
As a diabetic, you should've
skipped the cheese blintz.

771
00:41:34,587 --> 00:41:36,129
You're done already.

772
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:39,586
Thought you said it was
going to take awhile.

773
00:41:39,587 --> 00:41:41,464
Nope. Worked all night.

774
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,335
And what's the rush?

775
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:54,523
Oh, I see.
So that's how it's gonna be, huh?

776
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:58,543
- Hol, I wanted...
- No. Don't...

777
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,837
Don't say it.

778
00:42:00,371 --> 00:42:02,498
Don't say anything.

779
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,481
Not that you ever do anyway.
But you know what? I'm gonna say something.

780
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,607
You're making a mistake.

781
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,298
You're going to wake up in a week
or a month

782
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:13,624
and you're going to realize that
you threw away something good,

783
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:15,351
and it's gonna be too late.

784
00:42:15,352 --> 00:42:18,252
You know, I realize that
there are three billion men in the world,

785
00:42:18,253 --> 00:42:21,660
and they don't all have to want me,
but you should want me.

786
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:29,653
The fact that you don't,
it just makes me wonder

787
00:42:29,654 --> 00:42:33,570
why I ever wanted you in the first place.

788
00:42:35,463 --> 00:42:37,185
Are you going to say something?

789
00:42:38,171 --> 00:42:40,729
- You told me not to.
- Well, I changed my mind.

790
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:45,944
I worked through the night

791
00:42:45,945 --> 00:42:49,149
because I found another small leak
in your bathroom,

792
00:42:50,545 --> 00:42:52,640
and I wanted to surprise you.

793
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,734
Bigger job than I thought.

794
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,024
And how long is this gonna take?

795
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,995
could take awhile.

796
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:11,568
- I feel like an idiot.
- Sounded like one.

797
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:19,762
How do I make it up to you?

798
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,423
