1
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:07,517
It's here, dad.

2
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:08,891
In the trap?

3
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:11,106
I'd say titleist three.

4
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:12,622
You know how good I feel?

5
00:00:12,881 --> 00:00:14,711
How good this morning is?

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,636
No, how good?

7
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:18,613
I'm going to blast out and two-putt.

8
00:00:18,614 --> 00:00:21,486
And I'm going to break 90
for the first time in my life.

9
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:23,949
Did I tell you to have the
truck detailed while I'm away?

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,081
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:27,168
Last time I returned from deployment,

12
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:30,080
I found a petrified
big mac under the seat.

13
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,305
How long?

14
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,068
Must have been there six months.

15
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:36,849
How long will you be in Iraq this time?

16
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,447
As long as it takes, Josh.

17
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:41,155
18 months, maybe less.

18
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:43,128
And then I go into teaching full time.

19
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:46,911
And your mother and I can drive up
to Princeton every weekend to see you.

20
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:49,250
Every other weekend will be fine.

21
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:53,743
Are you going to swing or
should I get a beach towel?

22
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,131
Keep your head down.

One and a half teaspoons
is not sweet, McGee.

51
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,985
I've seen my people pour three ounces
of sugar into a one-ounce espresso.

52
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:11,555
Your people being long islanders?

53
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:13,053
Romans.

54
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:17,594
Inventors of the grain harvester,
the arch, modern plumbing.

55
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,725
Plumbing.

56
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:21,151
Every time I flush, I
will think of you, Tony.

57
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,393
You and your people.

58
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:25,484
I'd ask you to explain that,
but I really don't want to know.

59
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:28,028
And I definitely don't want
to know what you're doing.

60
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:30,512
Making cappuccino, Ziva.

61
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:34,345
And educating probie as to what
Italy has contributed to the world.

62
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:37,148
Oration, italian cinema,...

63
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:38,099
...sports cars.

64
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,157
Gold chains and chest hairs?

65
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:43,545
And pasta in all its
sexy shapes and sizes.

66
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,770
The Chinese invented pasta.

67
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:48,377
Communist era propaganda.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,419
I assume Homeland
Security's been informed?

69
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,363
Yes, Ma'am, they have.

70
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:55,835
Will they be raising the threat level?

71
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:57,368
Affirmative, to level orange.

72
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:59,270
You have my direct line.

73
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,044
Orange.

74
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,690
Army navy club is a high-value target.

75
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,624
High-value target?

76
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,686
It's a terrorist's dream.

77
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,255
You can't slice a tee shot without
hitting a congressman or a general.

78
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:12,598
Or a colonel.

79
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,181
He was set to deploy tomorrow.

80
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:20,215
At least he got to spend
the last day with his son.

81
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,406
That's one way of looking at it.

82
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:32,453
Looks like we're late to the party.

83
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,693
Assume 100-meter blast
radius from the sand trap.

84
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:37,141
It's called a
bunker, boss, not a sand trap.

85
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,285
Blast radius, hundred meters, got it, boss.

86
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,115
Probie, you got the
woods, I got the far side.

87
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:43,379
Uh...

88
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:46,954
what, McGee?

89
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:48,743
Poison ivy, boss. I just...

90
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:50,950
I look at the stuff and I break out.

91
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:52,299
Don't look.

92
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:55,283
- The zaka would be busy today.
- Zaka?

93
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:59,926
Orthodox jews who volunteer to
collect body parts from terror attacks.

94
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:03,658
Agent Gibbs,

95
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:08,320
lieutenant colonel Hollis Mann, army CID.

96
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:10,475
- I believe your director called.
- She did.

97
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:13,556
- Officer Ziva David.
- Ziva David, yes, I know.

98
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:16,746
Army criminal investigative
division has excellent intel.

99
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:19,190
Good. You can use it to
support our investigation.

100
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,268
Our joint investigation.

101
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,629
With army in the lead.

102
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,954
This isn't the navy-army
club, it's the army-navy club.

103
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:26,981
Yeah.

104
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,691
That is a dead marine at
the army-navy club.

105
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:49,673
I had EOD sweep the
rest of the sand traps.

106
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:50,614
Bunkers.

107
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:51,351
Excuse me?

108
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:53,542
They call them bunkers, not sand traps.

109
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,701
The colonel's son said he saw what he
thought was a spiderweb in the bunker.

110
00:04:57,702 --> 00:04:58,600
Trip wire?

111
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,447
Possibly.

112
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:01,542
There's not much to go on with this one.

113
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:03,721
Of course, we've got a
lot of land to cover.

114
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,977
- 18 holes on a golf course.
- Yep.

115
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:07,261
You want to divide them up?

116
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:09,264
Sure, we'll take the crime scene.

117
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:12,569
You and your people can
take the other 17 holes.

118
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:17,513
You're not taking away my
crime scene. End of story.

119
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:19,123
But if you ask nicely,

120
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:21,158
I might just give you the body.

121
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:23,189
Well...

122
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:28,426
I don't really have to ask,
seeing as my M.E. got here first.

123
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:29,769
Okay.

124
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:34,411
If this is going to be a pissing
match, you better bring an umbrella.

125
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,866
Whoa-ho!

126
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,826
Got some good news, boss.

127
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:41,416
Did I miss something?

128
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,863
Gibbs just found his fourth ex-wife.

129
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:45,872
What do you got, DiNozzo?

130
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:47,719
Found this off the next tee.

131
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,940
It was outside the blast radius.
Wind must have carried it.

132
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,395
Looks like part of a detonator.

133
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:53,542
I checked the neighboring tees myself.

134
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:55,996
Well,maybe you shouldhave
checked the trash cans.

135
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:58,150
Looks like a hole in one, boss.

136
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:01,440
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

137
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,534
Myself. I have difficulty
getting out of the sand.

138
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,751
I suppose it's because
I don't practice enough.

139
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:10,684
I mean, I dig my feet in...

140
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:13,898
I open the club face,but then
I forget to follow through.

141
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,820
And the ball just goes a couple of feet.

142
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:19,287
Not nearly as far as
you traveled, my friend.

143
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:21,216
Is he talking to himself?

144
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,518
The body.

145
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:28,151
Ah, colonel, your C.O. just called.
Requested copies of my autopsy report.

146
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:29,528
Gibbs.

147
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:31,779
The report?

148
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,985
Yeah, well...

149
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:37,176
the cause of death appears
to be just what you see here.

150
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:39,774
Explosive dismemberment.

151
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,135
Yeah, got that part.

152
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:44,340
What we don't have are
traceable fragments from that explosion.

153
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:48,717
Yes, Abby was complaining about the dearth
of physical evidence from the crime scene.

154
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:50,583
Present company excepted, of course.

155
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:51,931
Bomb shell was plastic.

156
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:54,148
Which means the fragments disintegrated.

157
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:56,969
Yes, but luckily for you, not all of them.

158
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,091
As the ancients soon discovered,
fire and water do not mix.

159
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:04,819
The human body is
over two-thirds water.

160
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,022
Some of the burning
fragments were cooled

161
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:11,196
by the interstitial liquid
in the colonel's tissue

162
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,970
before they could disintegrate.

163
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:16,461
Get that to Abby.

164
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,513
Thank you.

165
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,394
I can't believe he's gone.

166
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,904
It's like I hear myself say that,
but I know it's a stupid thing to say.

167
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:34,817
It's not stupid, Josh.

168
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:39,070
If you told me he was still alive,

169
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:41,873
that what I saw was a trick...

170
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:45,208
I think I'd believe you.

171
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,756
Look, maybe we should
finish this tomorrow.

172
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,011
I'll be at Princeton tomorrow.

173
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:01,230
Dad wouldn't want me to
miss my first day of classes.

174
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:04,289
Okay.

175
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,840
You saw a spiderweb
in the bunker, you said?

176
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:12,387
Yeah, at least I thought so.

177
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,369
Until my dad hit it. I
should have said something.

178
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:19,475
There was nothing you could have done.

179
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:24,308
That's another one of those
stupid things people say.

180
00:08:25,232 --> 00:08:27,098
Well, I got a million of them.

181
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:29,666
You should ask my
coworkers, they'll tell you.

182
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,062
Okay, what else you got?

183
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,723
Everything happens for a reason.

184
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,380
Yeah, that would have
really pissed me off.

185
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,510
But you can do better.

186
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:46,007
When your time is up your time is up.

187
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:47,855
Hope you've got more skills than that.

188
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,795
In the immortal words of Elvis Costello,

189
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,838
"oh, accidents will happen."

190
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,772
Oh, yeah.

191
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,807
I probably would have stuck my fist
through your skull if you had said that.

192
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,722
Soft skull, actually.

193
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:08,119
Except this wasn't an accident, was it?

194
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:11,203
No.

195
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:16,209
I thought we were fighting them over there
so we didn't have to fight them over here.

196
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:20,296
Maybe they need some more help, huh?

197
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,058
Look, you just focus on Princeton.

198
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:26,211
We'll find who did this.

199
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,576
Like you found Bin Laden?

200
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:36,803
- There it is.
- Okay, good.

201
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:38,403
Punch in on that.

202
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,206
You can read the entire license plate.

203
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:41,593
I'll update the bolo.

204
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,457
Bolo for what?

205
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,759
Well, we cleared the course, we
vetted everyone as they left,

206
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,996
but we don't have any record
of this '99 toyota leaving.

207
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:49,648
The owner's a green skeeper at the club.

208
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,822
He must have used an old service entrance
and snuck out before we covered them all.

209
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:54,274
Nice catch, McGee.

210
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:56,265
No, it's my catch.

211
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:58,755
Let's see if we can
get an address on this.

212
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,795
Was it just me, or did
the secdef seem nervous?

213
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:04,054
Probably has a tee time tomorrow.

214
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:07,149
What's she like?

215
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:12,110
I just meant, is she up to the job?

216
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:14,664
I'll let you know.

217
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:18,530
Yeah, Gibbs...

218
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,390
Hey, boss, DiNozzo here.

219
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,867
Hey, DiNozzo!

220
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,639
hey, that's weird, 'cause I...

221
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,005
I thought you were still in MTAC.

222
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:31,788
What do you want?

223
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:32,961
Uh... we...

224
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:37,060
...just found an unaccounted for
vehicle from the army-navy club.

225
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:49,828
DiNozzo...

226
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:54,624
He's already in CID custody, agent Gibbs.
My people can handle the interrogation.

227
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:57,209
What are you doing?

228
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:00,607
Divorced, right?

229
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,625
Three times.

230
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:03,129
Only three?

231
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:07,934
well, I'll be sure to let my
superiors know how you assisted.

232
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,235
Stand clear!

233
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,165
Opening!

234
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,672
All clear.

235
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,460
Marijuana.

236
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:22,170
Okay, drugs.

237
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:24,301
Doesn't mean he didn't plant the bomb.

238
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,300
You can have that interrogation.

239
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,447
I'll look for who did.

240
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,543
Agent Gibbs!

241
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:49,510
I...I've been ringing your
bell for the last three minutes.

242
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:52,063
Yeah. I've been meaning to fix that.

243
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:53,835
Well, the door was unlocked, so...

244
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:56,869
so this would be trespassing, not
breaking and entering.

245
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,221
Uh-huh.

246
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,109
"Kelly"?

247
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,574
Is there a reason you
broke into my house?

248
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:11,150
This is a joint investigation. I thought
maybe we could share some information.

249
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:14,601
Beer?

250
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:17,541
Beer? Uh.

251
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:20,837
Sure.

252
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:24,610
I got the results on the
swabs from the toyota.

253
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:29,350
There were traces of diesel
fuel and, uh, fertilizer.

254
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:33,179
Same thing that McVeigh used to, uh...

255
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,942
blow up the federal
building in oklahoma.

256
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:36,695
Yeah.

257
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:39,576
Guy driving the toyota
was a greenskeeper.

258
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:44,031
I know. He's around fertilizer
and diesel fuel all day.

259
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,852
It was a bad lead.

260
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,134
Anything you'd like to share?

261
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,949
Well, I got some sardines upstair

262
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,778
I meant about the case.

263
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,170
But, then, you knew that.

264
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,778
Girlfriend.

265
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,705
Is, uh, Kelly your... your girlfriend?

266
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:07,976
Okay...

267
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:09,260
Look,...

268
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,315
CID intel did a profile on you for me.

269
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:15,550
I know you flaunt authority,
especially in front of a female.

270
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,027
A female write that, too?

271
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,079
Yep.

272
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:20,737
She also wrote you were
a sniper, a good one,

273
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:23,285
but your eyesight's
shot, you're injury-prone,

274
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:25,729
if not in a state of near
death-wish fulfillment,

275
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,982
and though you're pressured and
impatient, you're also passionate and loyal,

276
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,000
in spite of the fact that
you don't trust anyone.

277
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:38,900
You are gonna have to trust me.

278
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:43,005
Is there anything I should know
about you before we get involved?

279
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,518
Involved?

280
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:47,895
In the case.

281
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:53,564
You can have NCIS intel do a
profile on me, if you'd like.

282
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,843
Oh, I could.

283
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,022
But I like surprises.

284
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,192
This hypothesis states

285
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:12,100
that the fate of
transplanted embryonic cells

286
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:16,231
is independent of their
new position in the embryo.

287
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:18,095
The mosaic hypothesis.

288
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:21,280
I'm sorry, I'm going to
need the complete answer.

289
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:25,739
what is the mosaic hypothesis?

290
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,782
Correct! Hot and smart.

291
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:30,460
The female version of me.

292
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:31,801
Oh!

293
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:34,597
So you think I'm ready
for the exam tomorrow?

294
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:37,041
Oh, I have 20 bucks saying that
you're gonna set the curve.

295
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,737
Okay, that's... good to hear.

296
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:44,920
Because, uh, that means it's my
turn to ask you some questions.

297
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,715
Fire away.

298
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:50,561
All right, how's a, uh, kind of cute,

299
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:55,047
definitely charming guy like you who
does some pretty bad impersonations...

300
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:58,805
I don't know what that
means, but I thank you.

301
00:14:58,806 --> 00:14:59,494
Yeah...

302
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:02,318
...Manage to stay single for so long?

303
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:04,695
Oh, you're-you're gonna
ask a real question?

304
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,893
That's a real question.

305
00:15:05,894 --> 00:15:07,788
- Well, ah.
- um

306
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,348
what are commitment issues?

307
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:13,756
mm-mm, not buying it.

308
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:14,372
Really?

309
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:15,399
Mm-mm.

310
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,905
And why is that?

311
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,316
In the last hour...

312
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,005
yeah?

313
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:21,342
At least a dozen hot
coeds have walked by.

314
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,450
Your eyes haven't wandered once.

315
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,020
Really?

316
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,149
Well, obviously, yours have.

317
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,717
don't get your hopes up. I'm a very, um...

318
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:37,110
traditional girl.

319
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:39,502
Well, so was Anne Heche.

320
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,968
You still haven't
answered my question, Tony.

321
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,712
Okay.

322
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,190
Okay.

323
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,637
well...

324
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:56,518
I suppose that I am patiently waiting...

325
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,452
to find the right girl.

326
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:01,532
You think you'll, uh, ever find her?

327
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,665
I'm getting more and
me confident by the day.

328
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:32,188
Ah, and to think people once questioned the
need for a video camera in a cell phone.

329
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:33,394
Tony!

330
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,612
Wait till you see this.

331
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,419
Any ideas?

332
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:41,086
He's definitely not making cappuccino.

333
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,117
There's no way he's got an STD.

334
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:45,933
I was itching, it's poison
ivy and it's spreading, okay?

335
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:48,763
This is your second tango
with the vicious weed, McGee.

336
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:50,823
Maybe you ought to learn
what that stuff looks like.

337
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:51,722
And avoid it.

338
00:16:51,723 --> 00:16:53,391
I thought I did.

339
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:55,159
This is killing me.

340
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,982
When Gibbs told me to check out the
forest, I should've just told him...

341
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,759
Tell me what,McGee?

342
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:01,494
No!

343
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:03,830
Well, that probably would
have been a good idea.

344
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,420
Baking soda and vinegar, you
make a paste, slop it on.

345
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:08,432
Okay. Thank you. Thank you boss.

346
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,419
Not now, McGee.

347
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:13,004
After we catch the terrorists.

348
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,406
that could be a while. All
the club guests check out,

349
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:18,760
local LEOs report no
unusual activy in the area.

350
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:19,511
DiNozzo?

351
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:22,059
I've gone through the last month
of the club's video surveillance.

352
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,335
If the terrorist cell
was casing the joint,

353
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,129
they hid their tracks pretty well.

354
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,232
Your contact at interpol?

355
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:30,766
Uh, said there was almost no uptick
in chatter prior to the explosion.

356
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,930
Could be homegrown bad boys, boss.

357
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,398
So there should be some
chatter, no matter who it is.

358
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,905
However this cell is operating,

359
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:39,760
they found a way to do so without
leaving a shred of evidence.

360
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:42,374
Other than a dead marine.

361
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:45,631
Nice.

362
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:49,394
Gibbs wanted me to see if you've finished
processing the crime scene evidence yet.

363
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:52,617
I have, but Gibbs is not
gonna like this. Exhibit A.

364
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:55,523
These are the bomb fragments that
Ducky pulled from colonel Cooper.

365
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:58,874
It's plastic but not
your usual petroleum-based,

366
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,432
wreck-the-environment
polymer.

367
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,970
It's made out of... corn.

368
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:04,214
It's biodegradable.

369
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:07,390
Which explains why it
disintegrated so much in the blast.

370
00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:08,307
What are you doing?

371
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:09,864
Well, actually, I have...

372
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:11,316
you know what?

373
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,114
I don't want to know.

374
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:16,810
It's green technology, mostly
used for making milk containers.

375
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:21,826
So the best guess is that the bad guys
used a jug as casement for the explosives.

376
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:23,337
okay, I do want to know.

377
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:25,590
I have poison ivy, and it's killing me.

378
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,595
My secret remedy.

379
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:29,706
Ooh, what is it?

380
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:32,051
Carbonic acid. You just smear it on.

381
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:34,304
I am not gonna put acid on my...

382
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:35,546
boys.

383
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,770
Relax, McGee.

384
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:41,875
It's just sodium bicarbonate
and oxidized ethanol.

385
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,450
Baking soda and white vinegar.

386
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:48,442
Ah. I think Gibbs knows your secret
remedy, he told me to do the same thing.

387
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:49,904
Well, you should've listened.

388
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,897
Go ahead, rub it in. I'll wait.

389
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,052
Okay.

390
00:18:56,076 --> 00:18:58,661
So, uh, milk jug,
do we got a trace yet?

391
00:18:58,662 --> 00:19:00,679
The green revolution has begun, McGee.

392
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,823
It's too wildly available to
narrow down a purchase place.

393
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:06,859
I had the same problem with this
piece of detonator that Tony found.

394
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,116
You can buy this anywhere.

395
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:10,144
It's an
off-the-shelf fuse.

396
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:13,581
I got excited, 'cause I thought I'd found
tissue on it that might match the suspect,

397
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:16,923
but...it was too degraded
from the blast to get any DNA.

398
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:24,210
You're right, Gibbs is...not gonna
like this, but right now I don't care.

399
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,953
Ah. Thank you.

400
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,298
Approaching contact
point. Intercept in five.

401
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:38,759
Intercept successful. Commencing search.

402
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,873
Out of the car! Out of the car!

403
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:43,601
update, major thompson.

404
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:46,790
Negative on grant way***. I
repeat, negative.

405
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:51,490
Director, agent Gibbs is
attempting to access MTAC.

406
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:52,767
Go dark.

407
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:53,956
Let him in.

408
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,578
Change the locks on me?

409
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:03,421
Threat level orange,
remember? We're on lockdown.

410
00:20:03,422 --> 00:20:05,051
Unless you have some good news for me.

411
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:08,465
All I've got is 300 wasted man-hours.
We're looking in the wrong direction.

412
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:11,690
Well, I might be able to point
you the right one. Danielle?

413
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:17,518
This just came from the CIA
regarding the golf course bombing.

414
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,821
A suspected homegrown terrorist cell?

415
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,708
Suspected? By who?

416
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,257
A CIA informant.

417
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,258
Why are we just hearing about this now?

418
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,634
Unfortunately,probably
the same reason why

419
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:33,673
we didn't hear about those
flying lessons until after 9/11.

420
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:35,825
I've informed army CID as well.

421
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:37,956
Colonel Mann will meet you on-site.

422
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:41,339
Your men all the way
around the building.

423
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,600
CID beat us to the punch
again. That's twice in one week.

424
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,154
I didn't know this was a race, DiNozzo.

425
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:52,260
Oh, no, it's not, I'm just not
used to these joint efforts.

426
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,545
Oh, glad to see you finally made it.

427
00:20:56,709 --> 00:21:00,171
To be honest, I thought you'd beat
me here and head in without me.

428
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:02,750
Thought you said I was the
one with trust issues.

429
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:09,610
Clear!

430
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:11,065
Clear here!

431
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:12,504
Oh, that's original.

432
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,973
Metro subway maps, national
monuments, bridge blueprints.

433
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,043
Potential targets.

434
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:19,290
They sure as hell weren't sightseeing.

435
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,475
Uh, I think I know who
their target is, boss.

436
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:27,686
Us.

437
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:37,618
All right, secure the building now!

438
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,198
Ziva, Tony, out the back door!
No one in until EOD gets here.

439
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,950
Move back!

440
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,748
Ziva, hey, what the hell are you doing?

441
00:21:58,598 --> 00:21:59,675
I can disarm it.

442
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:02,796
Okay, well, great.  Let's go
outside and talk about this.

443
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:05,316
If it detonates before EOD gets here,

444
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:06,403
we'll lose evidence.

445
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:09,065
Well, what a bummer.
It'd be a real shame.

446
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,468
Ziva! Ziva!

447
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,786
This has to be the stupidest thing
any human being has ever done.

448
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:16,365
Then why are you following me, Tony?

449
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,265
I don't freakin' know.

450
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:20,760
God!

451
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,751
Here, hold this.

452
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,539
Do you have any idea what's going
to happen if this cell phone rings?

453
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:48,034
I can see down your shirt right now.

454
00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:52,257
I don't think your new
girlfriend would like that.

455
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,428
What are you talking about? I don't
know what you're talking about.

456
00:22:55,593 --> 00:23:01,536
I'm talking about you and the fact that you no
longer stare at every woman when they pass you by.

457
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:04,315
Well, I'm looking down
your shirt right now.

458
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,810
See anything good?

459
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:08,282
Yeah, real good.

460
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:11,153
But I'm not entirely
sure it's worth dying...

461
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,923
...over.

462
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:16,028
Not worth dying over.

463
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,776
I'll remember that.

464
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:20,993
What if I said it was?

465
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:23,163
Then now you'll never know.

466
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:27,551
The bomb was set to go off
when the cell was called.

467
00:23:27,552 --> 00:23:30,658
It's prepaid and
disposable. Never been used.

468
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,399
So there's no call log.

469
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,725
Thanks to our bomb-disposal expert,

470
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:36,146
we still have plenty to work with.

471
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,224
Looks like two or three
people were staying there.

472
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,653
Abby's processing it.

473
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:41,102
It's a nice job, Ziva.

474
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,874
You do anything like that ever again,

475
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,361
I'll kick your ass back to Israel.

476
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:49,085
CIA refuses to let us talk
to their source directly.

477
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:49,813
Protected?

478
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:51,987
The right hand still isn't
talking to the left hand and

479
00:23:51,988 --> 00:23:54,825
we have no idea what
the source actually said.

480
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:55,707
Oh, McGee?

481
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,675
Yeah, almost there, boss.

482
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,097
Oh, you're not hacking the CIA?

483
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:01,761
No, no, no,

484
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:03,105
Homeland Security.

485
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:05,241
They post a redundant CIA archive.

486
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:07,912
All right, my superiors
are not going to like this.

487
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,098
Don't tell 'em.

488
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,741
Smart and devious, it's
a dangerous combination.

489
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:18,966
You forgot "charming."

490
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:21,640
I'm in.

491
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:23,114
No, I didn't.

492
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:29,792
Okay, informant's name is Mamoun Sharif.

493
00:24:29,793 --> 00:24:34,673
Native of Lebanon. Arsted in Beirut
for extortion, cooperated with Interpol.

494
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:38,069
Helped break a stolen weapons
ring on one of our bases in Turkey.

495
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,469
CIA moved him to the States.

496
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:46,771
Been on retainer ever since. Has a small
convenience store in Rosslyn, Virginia.

497
00:24:46,772 --> 00:24:48,071
Address.

498
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,242
You bring anything other than ACUs?

499
00:24:50,243 --> 00:24:52,313
Would you like me to wear a dress?

500
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:57,822
Thank you.

501
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,305
Hey, what did I tell you?!

502
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:02,663
The owner takes this out of my pocket.

503
00:25:02,664 --> 00:25:06,322
The next time I'm catching you, I'm
calling the police. Out the back!

504
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,420
So don't let me catch you.

505
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,112
Thank you.

506
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:19,567
It still comes out of
your pocket, doesn't it?

507
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,773
Yes.

508
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:24,632
But where I was born, it is a
sin to turn away a hungry man.

509
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,944
Now what can I help you with?

510
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:29,891
Lieutenant colonel
Hollis Mann, army CID.

511
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:30,466
Put that away!

512
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:34,334
We have a couple of questions for you
about a recent tip you gave the CIA.

513
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:35,738
Are you trying to get me killed?!

514
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:37,249
You can't contact me here!

515
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,823
We understand the need
for confidentiality.

516
00:25:39,824 --> 00:25:42,313
Just want to know how you
heard about the warehouse.

517
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,979
Who am I talking to?

518
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,185
- Me
- Me

519
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,556
I hear things, okay?

520
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:53,436
In the mosque, in the
store, on the street.

521
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:54,207
Names.

522
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,469
Forget it.

523
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,885
I hear things from people who
hear things; innocent people.

524
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:02,587
Names I will not give. I
know what happens nowadays.

525
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:06,041
I am taking a big enough risk
myself talking to your CIA.

526
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:08,604
Which you're well compensated for.

527
00:26:08,957 --> 00:26:11,082
We all have to make a living.

528
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,001
.38 super auto colt.

529
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,738
It's a bad neighborhood.

530
00:26:19,972 --> 00:26:21,577
You got a license?

531
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:25,157
Okay.

532
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:27,636
Your country has been good to me.

533
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:33,600
The man I heard talking in my store
about the golf course two days ago

534
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,769
buying ring dings...

535
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,028
I'm not so sure he's one
of those innocent people.

536
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:40,277
Why?

537
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,167
Because of what he
called the golf course.

538
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:47,425
"The beginning."

539
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,243
Look, quick, look. Do you see that?

540
00:26:56,244 --> 00:26:57,723
See what?

541
00:26:57,793 --> 00:27:00,446
Gibbs let her go first. He
never lets anyone go first.

542
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:01,881
Get this to Abby.

543
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,888
I.D. on anyone buying a slurpy.

544
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:07,320
Where's DiNozzo?

545
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:08,970
Had a doctor's appointment.

546
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:11,516
I want him on that grocery store.

547
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:13,758
He said he'd be back asap.

548
00:27:24,195 --> 00:27:24,998
McGee?

549
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:27,632
You're not really with
a doctor, are you, Tony?

550
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:29,700
As a matter of fact, I am.

551
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:33,105
Well, Gibbs keeps looking
at your desk and his watch.

552
00:27:33,106 --> 00:27:34,875
Tell him I'll be right there.

553
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:35,979
You okay?

554
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,711
I was fine.

555
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:48,120
When did you leave?

556
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:54,673
well, I'm a cheap date.

557
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:57,102
This is a date?

558
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:00,564
Is a figure of speech, agent Gibbs.

559
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:04,927
So I got the food.
Did you solve the case?

560
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:09,244
I was about to, till you
broke my concentration.

561
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:12,630
That easy to break, huh?

562
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:14,485
When I'm hungry.

563
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:21,650
I thought I was close
to a break, but now...

564
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,387
I've got more questions than answers.

565
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:28,788
And colonel Cooper, was
he specifically targeted?

566
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:30,441
No way to know who'd be in the bunker.

567
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,689
Okay, so the target is random
which says "terrorist attack."

568
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,131
Except the explosive
was not designed to kill.

569
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,217
The guy in the morgue would
probably disagree with that.

570
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:41,558
No, I mean, if the terrorists had
packed the bomb full of shrapnel

571
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,263
like they usually do, then
the son would be dead, too.

572
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,663
And make the bomb easier to detect.

573
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:54,088
Which means the terrorists
priority's clearly to avoid detection.

574
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,483
Explains a lack of chatter.

575
00:28:57,993 --> 00:29:03,444
So if you're that busy covering your tracks, why do
you write "death to america" all over your hideout?

576
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,889
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

577
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,421
More questions than answers.

578
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:13,077
Sign of weakness.

579
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:17,397
I thought it took strength to apologize.

580
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,341
Shouldn't you be packing?

581
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:28,462
My mom called you, didn't she?

582
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,933
What did she tell you?

583
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,114
That you're not going to Princeton.

584
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,370
She's right.

585
00:29:38,884 --> 00:29:40,809
Coltrane.

586
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,295
I wouldn't have really pegged
you for a jazz man, Josh.

587
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:52,248
Dad played Coltrane and Miles Davis every
sunday for as long as I can remember.

588
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:55,217
The same albums over and over.

589
00:29:55,313 --> 00:29:56,656
Used to drive me nuts.

590
00:29:56,657 --> 00:30:00,312
Well, military man set in his routines.

591
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:04,835
The funny thing is, the first time he was
deployed, I found myself playing those same albums.

592
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,563
Next thing I knew, he was home
and we were listening together.

593
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:15,069
I know this must be a pretty
difficult time for you.

594
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:17,704
If you're here to talk me
out of joining the marines...

595
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:20,542
I would never talk someone
out of joining the corps.

596
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:22,151
It's an honor to serve your country.

597
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:24,389
Good. Glad that's settled.

598
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,646
I would ask one question, though.

599
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,760
What's the big rush?

600
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:32,385
You know what? You're
probably right. I should ...

601
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:35,860
wait a little longer. What's
a few more dead colonels?

602
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:37,146
I understand that you're pissed off.

603
00:30:37,147 --> 00:30:41,064
Pissed off?! They killed
my dad! How would you feel?!

604
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,028
I would want justice,

605
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,546
but you're looking for revenge.

606
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:47,932
You're damn right.

607
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,205
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

608
00:30:50,206 --> 00:30:53,370
Which just leaves you with a
bunch of toothless, blind people.

609
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,712
So you just make a joke and do nothing?

610
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:59,850
I would do... whatever it takes.

611
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:05,217
But there is a right time ...

612
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,708
a right place.

613
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:13,497
And this is not the time.

614
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:15,487
Not for you.

615
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:26,843
Homeland Security says there's an uptick
in chatter. Something is definitely going on.

616
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,101
Better have a fatal disease, DiNozzo.

617
00:31:29,102 --> 00:31:31,228
Josh's mom called. He's
looking for payback.

618
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:35,214
Wants to skip Princeton and join the
marines. I went to talk him out of it.

619
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:36,404
Did you?

620
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,582
I don't know, boss.

621
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:39,004
McGee, turn this up. Gibbs ?

622
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:42,559
A fiery explosion has completely
engulfed a Rosslyn convenience store.

623
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,474
The store's owner is believed to have
been inside at the time of the blast.

624
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:48,357
That's Sharif's place.

625
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,630
First the friendly links,

626
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,708
now the neighborhood convenience store.

627
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:04,281
It's such tragedies as your mr. Sharif,

628
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:07,086
that make my mother
afraid to leave the house,

629
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:10,224
which does not bode
well for me, I'm afraid.

630
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:14,003
Your visit is premature. I'm still waiting
for the rest of him to be delivered.

631
00:32:14,004 --> 00:32:16,356
Mm... Until then, you have...

632
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,859
well, the obvious. Same as before.

633
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:24,230
Except this time the dismemberment was
caused by some form of high-impact explosive.

634
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:26,580
His dismembermt, but not his death.

635
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,528
Correct, colonel. Yeah, as you can see,

636
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:32,900
he was the pugilist-at-rest
posture at the time of his demise.

637
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:38,057
This praying mantis posture is one
of man's oldest defensive positions,

638
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:42,518
almost always assumed when
battling intense heat and flame.

639
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:45,286
So Sharif was burned alive.

640
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:46,989
Place was torched
before the bomb went off.

641
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,189
That kind of overkill means they
were either sending a message...

642
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,600
or there was something there
they didn't want us to find.

643
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:54,517
We may have beat them to it.

644
00:32:57,654 --> 00:33:00,392
Oh... come on, down in front, man.

645
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:02,222
Do all your people talk to themselves?

646
00:33:02,223 --> 00:33:03,326
Don't yours?

647
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:07,378
Have you any idea how many ring dings are sold
each day in your average convenience store?

648
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:09,967
- Abs, the customers.
- The customers.

649
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:14,346
They're talking about everything
from the weather to hemorrhoids cream.

650
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:17,499
There's no audio. How do you
know what they're talking about?

651
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:21,610
Ah, you read lips.

652
00:33:22,554 --> 00:33:24,188
Maybe she'll surprise you...

653
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:27,379
okay, you guys want to keep talking
about me or get back to the case?

654
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,207
Um, after watching seven hours of
the most boring reality show ever made,

655
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:35,005
I've narrowed it down to
one final contestant.

656
00:33:35,152 --> 00:33:37,287
He refers to himself as Abraham.

657
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:39,177
He didn't say the name
of the golf course,

658
00:33:39,178 --> 00:33:42,767
but he did say that the day
of judgment was approaching.

659
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:46,813
According to Maryland DMV records,
his full name is Abraham Moussalah.

660
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:51,748
Born in 1974, served three years for
robbing a convenience store in Baltimore.

661
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:54,872
Almost got away with
$86 and some ding dongs.

662
00:33:54,873 --> 00:33:56,961
Spent some time in a psych ward,

663
00:33:56,962 --> 00:33:59,032
converted to a radical sect of Islam.

664
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:00,629
Got a last known for him?

665
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,439
His probation officer hasn't
heard from him in over a year.

666
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,152
No credit cards, no car registrations.

667
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:07,608
Boss, this guy's gone off the grid

668
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:09,739
I'll check the bolo.
See if there's any hits.

669
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,138
CID should have intel on Abraham's
sect.  I'll make a few calls.

670
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,397
I'm going to coordinate with local
LEOs and highway patrol. Where's Tony?

671
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:18,160
Don't worry about Tony.

672
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:21,185
Tony is fine.

673
00:34:22,086 --> 00:34:23,556
Yeah. Gibbs.

674
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:25,557
On my way, Abs.

675
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,242
Ziva.

676
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:31,526
Tony is...?

677
00:34:37,382 --> 00:34:40,034
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

678
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:41,164
Hey.

679
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,925
Looks like you've made up your mind.

680
00:34:43,926 --> 00:34:47,048
Special agent slash mind reader.

681
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:49,456
Well, when you're good, you're good,

682
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,477
but I wasn't reading your mind. I
was reading your body language.

683
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:55,830
You're relaxed. The struggle is
over. You've made up your mind.

684
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:58,699
Special agent slash dr. Phil.

685
00:35:00,037 --> 00:35:02,213
So what's it gonna be, Josh?

686
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:05,283
6:00 A.M. Wake-ups and desert camo?

687
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:10,861
Or all-night frat parties
and jell-o shots with co-eds?

688
00:35:11,302 --> 00:35:14,143
I decided to do what my
dad always wanted me to.

689
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:17,969
Ah. I'm guessing he wasn't
a big fan of jell-o shots.

690
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,120
No.

691
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,882
But he was a big fan of Princeton.

692
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,791
So you're going back to school.

693
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,609
Then Georgetown law, then
into Naval Intelligence.

694
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,273
That's good. I could use the help.

695
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,009
Listen, I keep my word, Josh.

696
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,306
We're gonna find the
person who did this.

697
00:35:43,318 --> 00:35:44,720
I know, Tony.

698
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:49,302
It's in your body language.

699
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:57,149
Remember the cell phone
that was never used?

700
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,346
Well, it was used. Only
all the data was hard-erased.

701
00:36:00,347 --> 00:36:01,553
Hard-erased?

702
00:36:01,554 --> 00:36:04,219
What part of "hard-erased"
do you not understand?

703
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,212
All of it.

704
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,386
Well, then, you've come
to the right place.

705
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:09,852
A cell phone is very
much like a computer.

706
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:12,592
You can delete data off of it, but
then if someone knows where to look...

707
00:36:12,593 --> 00:36:14,053
Bottom line, Abby.

708
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:15,300
The cell phone was used once.

709
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:18,079
It was an incoming call,
probably to test the detonator.

710
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,824
Then it was reset to factory defaults.

711
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:21,167
You got a number?

712
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,297
I thought you'd never ask.

713
00:36:27,504 --> 00:36:30,863
The incoming call came from the
warehouse Sharif gave the CIA.

714
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:32,605
Must be where Abraham was
testing the detonator.

715
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:33,921
He's not there now.

716
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:36,249
Place has been crawling
with EOD since yesterday.

717
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,319
Can you trace that call?

718
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,028
If it's on. Ziva.

719
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:40,039
Almost done.

720
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,735
I'm having Ziva scan the cell tower control-track
frequencies looking for the cell's registration request.

721
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:47,375
McGee, it just powered up.

722
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:49,823
Tell me he's not making a call.

723
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:53,018
Nope, not yet.

724
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:57,106
I've got his location.
M street and Wisconsin.

725
00:36:57,107 --> 00:36:59,083
Georgetown promenade.

726
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:04,622
You guys weren't planning on
starting without me, were you?

727
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:05,427
Who's that?

728
00:37:05,428 --> 00:37:08,042
- Flanking positions on the promenade, east and west.
- Yes, ma'am.

729
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:09,781
- clear the civilians quietly.
- We're on it.

730
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:10,975
DiNozzo.

731
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:12,602
Princeton.

732
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,509
There. Abraham on the bench.

733
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,571
If he sees us clear the
promenade, he may detonate.

734
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:22,160
If it's a trip-wire any of
these people may detonate it.

735
00:37:22,161 --> 00:37:24,255
On the second bomb, he used a cell phone.

736
00:37:24,256 --> 00:37:26,402
The cell phone's not
connected to the backpack.

737
00:37:26,403 --> 00:37:29,344
Trip wire, cell phone who
knows how he armed this one?

738
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:32,272
A dead-man switch. Or not.

739
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:34,634
DiNozzo, you keep your ears on me.

740
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,722
What the hell is he doing?

741
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:42,552
What he always does.

742
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,562
Hey! My hat!

743
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:49,190
Four marriages... negotiating's
probably not his thing.

744
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:50,812
You'd be surprised.

745
00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:52,968
Well, I have been so far.

746
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:05,083
Cell's not the detonator.

747
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,440
My son, Tony, he plays that same game.

748
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:15,730
What's your name?

749
00:38:15,749 --> 00:38:17,536
Abraham.

750
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,271
Hey, Abraham. Jethro.

751
00:38:20,864 --> 00:38:22,685
Jethro?

752
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,376
That's the name they gave me.

753
00:38:25,377 --> 00:38:28,226
Everybody, please stay calm. Stay back.

754
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,568
That means "friend of god."

755
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:36,032
The father-in-law
of Moses.

756
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:40,050
He walked with the israelites
when God parted the red sea.

757
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,164
- You know why God parted the red sea?
- No.

758
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,117
To show the people that sea creatures
were totally dependent on God's will.

759
00:38:52,118 --> 00:38:53,505
What is he talking about?

760
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:56,031
I'd say this guy's a few
puppies short of a pet shop.

761
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:58,227
Most suicide bombers are.

762
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,827
Abraham, can I ask you a question?

763
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:08,636
You think it's all right for
someone to hurt innocent people?

764
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,984
No, Jethro.

765
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:11,661
I didn't think so.

766
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:16,156
What are you doing here, Abraham?

767
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:18,124
I'm waiting for my friend.

768
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,501
He's gonna take me to dinner.

769
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,538
Your friend give you the backpack?

770
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:27,417
Mm-hmm. About an hour ago.

771
00:39:27,418 --> 00:39:29,435
He said so I don't lose it.

772
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:31,223
What's this friend's name?

773
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,090
Sharif.

774
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:35,183
So who's laying in autopsy then?

775
00:39:35,184 --> 00:39:37,567
He was supposed to meet me here at 3:00.

776
00:39:37,568 --> 00:39:38,747
Ziva!

777
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,725
Right behind you!

778
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:45,144
Abraham, is it all right if we
take a look in your backpack?

779
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,497
EOD's still on their way, boss.

780
00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:51,961
We're out of time.

781
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:54,380
You want me to defuse it? Because
before you said you'd kick my ass...

782
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:56,584
do it! The rest of you, go!

783
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:58,526
Go on, get out of here.

784
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,983
30 seconds.

785
00:40:04,984 --> 00:40:06,070
Tony, army knife.

786
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,593
What's your name?

787
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,196
Tim. It means "he who's
about to wet his pants."

788
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,614
why is he gonna wet his pants?

789
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,522
he's here.

790
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,253
No.

791
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,392
Not anymore.

792
