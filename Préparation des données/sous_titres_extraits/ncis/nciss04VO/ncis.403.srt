Oh, my God.

2
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:12,763
The guy in the SUV is
totally checking you out.

3
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:15,121
Really? Is he cute?

4
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:17,040
Only extremely.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,839
Okay, he's probably gay. He
looked totally creeped out by us.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,455
What are you talking about?
He's into you. No way.

7
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:29,901
Yeah. Here, write your number down.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,657
Quick, before he gets away!

9
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:40,751
Oh, my God.

36
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:49,334
Is there a reason you're
touching my flowers, Tony?

37
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:52,230
I-I was just admiring them, uh....

38
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,470
Jenny, flowers are-are
a passion of mine.

39
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:55,457
Really?

40
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:59,144
So then, you'd know how
rare and expensive they are.

41
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,739
Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:02,114
And their name.

43
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:03,699
Of course.

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,494
Um, well, judging by the color,

45
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,940
and of-of course, uh, the...

46
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,591
the green things they're attached to...

47
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:12,466
- Stems.
- ...stems...

48
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,514
... uh, these...

49
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,647
Right on the tip of my tongue.

50
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:20,022
Phaleonopsis orchids.

51
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:20,922
Orchids.

52
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:23,051
Of course they're orchids.

53
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:29,190
This flipped out when
I was sniffing them.

54
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:36,066
Tony, how would you rate your
recent performance as team leader?

55
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:39,022
I'd say it was a solid B.

56
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:41,103
Minus.

57
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,496
I'm being fired, aren't I?

58
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,452
In a manner of speaking, yes.

59
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:47,667
If this has to do with
Gibbs coming back,...

60
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,664
...I have no problem working for him.

61
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:54,392
These orders are for you.

62
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,754
NCIS Rota, Spain?

63
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,287
Your own team.

64
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:00,994
Congratulations.

65
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:03,020
Wow. Uh...

66
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:04,534
I don't know what to say.

67
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:09,659
Your performance these last four months
has been exemplary. You've earned it.

68
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,197
What about La Grenouille?

69
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:12,832
It took months getting in.

70
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,132
You're not getting
too involved, are you?

71
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:16,448
Only in the mission.

72
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:20,260
If we put another agent undercover,
La Grenouille will smell it.

73
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,956
So, you're passing on a promotion that

74
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:26,023
any other agent in this
building would kill for,

75
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:29,278
all because you're worried
about some long-shot mission?

76
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,770
I don't think so.

77
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:34,024
Okay.

78
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,990
I'm worried about Jethro.

79
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:40,666
Jethro's fine.

80
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,903
Then how do you explain
that thing on his upper lip?

81
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:44,589
Looks like Wilford Brimley Jr.

82
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,747
So, you're turning down looks like
a promotion because of a moustache?

83
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:49,853
His memory is still screwed up.

84
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:53,318
He called Ziva Kate yesterday.

85
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:56,237
I just want to make sure he's a
hundred percent before I leave.

86
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:57,548
I see.

87
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:00,137
And how long might that process take?

88
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:02,743
I don't know, maybe... a few months?

89
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,675
How does 72 hours sound?

90
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:08,652
- Very fast.
- It wasn't a question.

91
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:11,533
I need an answer by the end of the week.

92
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,563
Tony, if you pass this up,...

93
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:18,088
...another opportunity like
this might not come up for years.

94
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:28,240
Can we keep this like
the Grenouille mission--

95
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,005
just between the two of us?

96
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:32,590
If you wish.

97
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:34,823
Thank you.

98
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:48,930
DiNozzo.

99
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:52,305
Stop calling me from
dispatch, will you, Mollvaney?

100
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,735
I'm not the team leader
any more; Gibbs is.

101
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,176
Trust me, it makes a difference.

102
00:04:58,177 --> 00:05:00,389
Now, call him and leave me alone.

103
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:02,461
Problems, Tony?

104
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:04,297
Wrong number, Ziva.

105
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:06,848
Gibbs.

106
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,401
There a reason you're gearing up?

107
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:09,495
What's my motto, McGee?

108
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:12,937
You'll never date a woman
that eats more than you do.

109
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,133
Oh, yeah. That's true.
But: Always be prepared.

110
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,718
The batsignal may fly at any moment.

111
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,040
We're on our way.

112
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:22,022
Grab your gear. We're heading out.

113
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:23,658
How did you know?

114
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:24,198
Well...

115
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,118
it's a gift, McGee. I
choose not to question it.

116
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:30,409
Where we going, boss?

117
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,649
Ask DiNozzo. All I
got was a wrong number.

118
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,304
Since when do we investigate
stolen cars, Tony?

119
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:44,515
Since it belongs to a sailor

120
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:46,612
and someone appears to have
been slaughtered inside it.

121
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,709
So where's the body?

122
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,754
Well, that's kind of the reason we're here.
Goes with the whole criminal investigative thing.

123
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:54,645
Oh, okay. I understand.

124
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:56,238
Understand what?

125
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:58,334
You feel a little threatened,
now that Gibbs is back.

126
00:05:58,335 --> 00:05:59,228
I do not!

127
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,861
You have been whining like
a little snitch all week.

128
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:07,801
- The term is "bitch."
- I know, I was being polite.

129
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:12,632
Boss, vehicle's registered to
a Navy Lieutenant Anne Sullivan.

130
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,620
She's a computer
programmer for base housing.

131
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,188
Reported UA this morning.
First time in her career.

132
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,638
Witnesses?

133
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:21,422
Uh, 911 call.

134
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:26,161
Two motorists reported a man driving her vehicle,
a bloody woman screaming in the back. I'm...

135
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:28,231
...assuming that's
our missing Lieutenant.

136
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:29,503
Assuming?

137
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:32,927
Well, Fredericksburg PD has descriptions
of the woman and her abductor.

138
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:35,351
They're sending them
to NCIS as we speak.

139
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:36,905
That's a good job, Tim.

140
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:40,535
Can I help you find something, boss?

141
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,236
- Maybe...
- My notepads.

142
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:47,417
Right back here.

143
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:50,543
We reorganized the supplies.

144
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,446
Tony felt this way was more efficient.

145
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:56,392
You don't say.

146
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:02,568
Well, you know, I could put them
back the way it was before you quit.

147
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,731
Retired.

148
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:06,962
Well, that depends, McGee.

149
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:08,592
Is it more efficient?

150
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,608
Seems to be.

151
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:13,050
Then leave 'em where they are.

152
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:18,370
There appears to have been a struggle.

153
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,612
Multiple hand and fingerprints.

154
00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:23,377
A lost shoe, a pair of glasses...

155
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:27,200
And I don't believe she was slaughtered.
At least not in the back of this vehicle.

156
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,595
Why's that?

157
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:31,141
The traces of blood are
all from skin contact.

158
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:34,037
A more serious wound
would've left pools of it.

159
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:37,122
Enough criminal
investigating for you, Tony?

160
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,123
Lieutenant Sullivan's
address. She ves in Culpeper.

161
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:40,735
Take McGee.

162
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:44,577
If you leave now, you can avoid
traffic. Anything unusual, you call me.

163
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:50,166
I mean, you know, you do... you...

164
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:52,816
whatever you want them to do, boss.

165
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,763
So I got used to being
in charge, sue me.

166
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:03,154
Is there a reason why
you always have to drive?

167
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:07,069
I could say it's because I'm the Senior Field
Agent, but mostly because I want to live.

168
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,621
Then I recommend you getting
unused to being in charge.

169
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,878
Before Gibbs decides to kill you.

170
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,718
Tow truck should be
here any minute, boss.

171
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,615
You find the other shoe yet, McGee?

172
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:23,395
There was only one in the vehicle.

173
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:26,488
You ever see a woman try to
walk with one high heel on?

174
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,256
Not pretty.

175
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:31,087
Hey, look at this.

176
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:36,049
Blood smears on the pavement.

177
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:39,143
If she was carried, they'd be drops.

178
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:43,173
And what looks like a strand of
nylon thread, maybe from a stocking.

179
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:46,724
She could've fallen
and scraped her knee.

180
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,107
Mark it.

181
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:56,985
Okay!

182
00:08:56,986 --> 00:09:00,132
You're looking for help,
which way would you go?

183
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,119
Well, Waverly's football
team was away,...

184
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:09,089
so the lot was empty all weekend...

185
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,873
She should've headed towards campus, but she
didn't, she went in the opposite direction.

186
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:15,470
She was forced.

187
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,515
That's good thinking,
Tim-- come on.

188
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,638
Another blood drop...

189
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,804
Like I said, the other shoe.

190
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,177
Okay, now, tell me where she went.

191
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:37,816
There was another car.

192
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:42,162
Judging by these tire
tracks, they left in a hurry.

193
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:45,288
Match the tires, we might even
find out the make and model.

194
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:48,630
Good to have you back, boss.

195
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:52,071
If you'd let me drive,we would've
been here half an hour ago.

196
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:55,723
Yeah, our bodies could be in a twisted
wreck, awaiting the Jaws of Life.

197
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,254
Gibbs lets me drive.

198
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:58,647
I have more to live for.

199
00:09:58,648 --> 00:09:59,313
I see.

200
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:01,669
Perhaps this new mystery
girlfriend of yours.

201
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,009
She's not a mystery.

202
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,047
Then why haven'tb any of us met her?

203
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:07,037
Look, it's complicated...

204
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,320
Clear.

205
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:28,445
This is weird.

206
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:30,289
I agree.

207
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,634
Someone was obviously
searching for something.

208
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:35,908
No, I mean this apartment.

209
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,507
What does it remind you of, Ziva?

210
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:39,311
Put a writing desk over there.

211
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:40,797
You're right.

212
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,023
-  It's almost...
-  Identical to McGeek's.

213
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,101
What do you make of this?

214
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,654
Some kind of profile?

215
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:56,038
They're all profiles.

216
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:04,350
I think I know what the profiles
might have been used for.

217
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,332
She was targeting people.

218
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,451
This is a police sketch artist's rendering of
what the witnesses saw late yesterday afternoon.

219
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:17,598
And this is a photo of Lieutenant
Sullivan for comparison.

220
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,154
I'd say that's a pretty good match.

221
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:20,993
You think, DiNozzo?

222
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:23,459
The driver, McGee.

223
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,820
Fredericksburg PD put a
BOLO out on him last night.

224
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,213
Any hits? Any hits?

225
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:29,601
Sorry.

226
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:30,654
Boss...

227
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,896
Continue... if y want to, of course.

228
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:41,286
No hits yet, but the local LEOs did
match the likeness to a mug shot.

229
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,692
Justin Farris.

230
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:44,450
Arrested for car theft five years ago.

231
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:47,924
Currently lives with his mother. Claims
she hasn't seen him since yesterday.

232
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:51,093
Our lieutenant had around 16
profiles on people at her apartment.

233
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:54,078
Without photographs or names.
I'm still waiting on the why.

234
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,466
Me too, boss. I'm just saying,...

235
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,049
... Farris might be one of them...

236
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,604
Our Rosetta stone, if you will.

237
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:01,666
Find him.

238
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,373
That's good work, Tim.

239
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,798
Not bad either, Tony.

240
00:12:09,865 --> 00:12:12,751
Is it me or does he seem
a little more...? Human?

241
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:16,149
Well, I was going to
say mellow, but yeah.

242
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,366
Yeah...

243
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,294
... I think it's the moustache...

244
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,886
Falling us into a
false sense of security.

245
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:27,862
That's all of them.

246
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:29,755
It appears one of them is missing.

247
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:31,093
Missing what?

248
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:32,608
One of the profiles.

249
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,471
Alpha Bravo,
one-zero-one-six.

250
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:36,498
Targets?

251
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:39,203
The binder they were kept in
listed them as potential targets.

252
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:40,482
The Alpha Bravo designations.

253
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:43,106
That's how we labeled pre-planned
artillery targets in the Corps.

254
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:45,526
Maybe she was planning
on dropping bombs on them.

255
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:47,421
What else was missing from
the lieutenant's place?

256
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:49,254
I'm more concerned with
what was left, Gibbs.

257
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:51,382
Money, jewelry. It's not
your typical burglary.

258
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:53,408
This means they knew what
they were looking for.

259
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:55,634
What can you tell me about these?

260
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,166
She was profiling men.

261
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,579
All the information gathered
was taken from public records.

262
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,984
Yeah, I can see that. Why?

263
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:03,735
- Well, that's an excellent question. I was wondering that myself.
- Abby...

264
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:06,443
All of these were all
printed on the same printer.

265
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:07,733
You want to know how I know?

266
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:10,242
Newer models embed
micro codes in the print.

267
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:12,824
It helps I.D. hardware to
counter money and documents.

268
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,888
Wow. Good guess.

269
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,412
It also means that the information
they represent is on her computer.

270
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,512
- Show me.
- I'd love to.

271
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:21,387
But I can't.

272
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:22,470
Not yet.

273
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:26,035
Bad guys smash up real good.

274
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:28,027
- I'm still trying to recover the hard drives.
- How long?

275
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:30,156
Did I mention bad guys
smash up real good?

276
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:31,951
Like really, really good...

277
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:32,808
...Probably days.

278
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,739
We don't have days, Abs.
Get McGee to help you.

279
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,601
Wait. There's more.

280
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:38,815
I ran the fingerprints from the SUV.

281
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:43,052
- I matched all of them except three to a partial handprint.
- And ?

282
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:44,470
And I can say, with certainty,

283
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,394
that the woman in the back of the SUV...

284
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:48,002
- ...Was ...
- Lieutenant Anne Sullivan.

285
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:49,645
McGee already figured it out.

286
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:52,211
Okay, did he tell you this?

287
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,136
The partial handprint that I couldn't
match has a super-defined index finger.

288
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,623
Which means it's not Sullivan's.

289
00:13:58,624 --> 00:13:59,979
It's the bad guy's.

290
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,728
I'm running it now.

291
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:02,647
His name is Justin Farris.

292
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,327
McGee!

293
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:05,119
Yep.

294
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,257
- Is it just me or does he seem a little...
- Snitchy?

295
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:10,569
That's close enough.

296
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:14,932
It's got to be that damn moustache.

297
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:19,143
I want agents knocking on
doors of anyone who met...

298
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:20,717
..., knows or sneezed

299
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:23,464
on Farris in the last year, Mollvaney.

300
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:24,746
Probie!

301
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:27,523
I need you over here.

302
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:31,466
Well, if they find anything, make
sure that you call Gibbs not me.

303
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,925
Yes, the mustache is real.

304
00:14:35,112 --> 00:14:36,792
You got a hearing problem?

305
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,228
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you talking to me?

306
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:43,176
There's no one else in the squad room.

307
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,693
Well, I thought I
heard you say "probie."

308
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:48,350
And since Agent Lee has been reassigned

309
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:50,313
to the legal department,
I wasn't exactly sure

310
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:52,094
who you were referring to.

311
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:54,231
I get it. You don't like being ...

312
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:55,829
...called probie anymore?

313
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,402
Things change.

314
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,666
Yes, I know. I used to be team leader...

315
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,276
Pr-oh-ho-ho-bie.

316
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,988
Temporary team leader.

317
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,415
And that was only because Gibbs quit.

318
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:11,584
You don't think I rate my own team?

319
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:14,155
Wouldn't be here now if
you did, would you, DiNozzo?

320
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:18,282
Yeah.

321
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:20,720
Maybe you're right.

322
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,331
If Gibbs asks, tell him
I went out for coffee.

323
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,396
Tony, I didn't...

324
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:33,033
McGee...

325
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:37,027
how long have I been
an NCIS special agent?

326
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:40,053
Almost 16 years.

327
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:43,794
Want to take a wild guess what
my first partner still calls me?

328
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:01,612
You've done it again, DiNozzo.

329
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:06,183
I voluntarily turned myself in.

330
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:09,276
I'm just trying to do the
right thing here, Agent Gibbs.

331
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,052
Look...

332
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,876
I'm admitting it, okay?
I stole the damn SUV.

333
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:16,010
But I didn't kidnap anyone.

334
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:22,402
How do you explain these?

335
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:25,209
I didn't know that chick was
back there when I took it.

336
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,458
Her name is Lieutenant Anne Sullivan!

337
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:29,131
Where is she?!

338
00:16:29,132 --> 00:16:30,536
I told you, I don't know.

339
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:33,381
Look, I am telling you I just
committed grand theft auto.

340
00:16:33,382 --> 00:16:35,903
Why the hell would I do that
if I wasn't telling the truth?

341
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:38,463
To avoid kidnap and murder charges.

342
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,123
Whoa. She's dead?

343
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,693
No, no, she was alive

344
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:43,619
and screaming in the back of the
SUV the last time I saw her...

345
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,376
Screaming what?

346
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:46,216
I don't know. It was something about...

347
00:16:46,217 --> 00:16:48,826
...being singled out by some guy.

348
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:51,400
I didn't exactly stick
around to find out, okay?

349
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:53,634
I'm telling you, I didn't kill her.

350
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,078
So what do you think?

351
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,902
He might be telling the truth.

352
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:04,234
I mean about the moustache?

353
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,045
Oh, makes him look distinguished, yes?

354
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:08,502
It's not Gibbs.

355
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:09,977
People change.

356
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:11,691
People maybe...

357
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:12,550
...not Gibbs.

358
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:16,283
I knew it was too good to be true.
The door was open, engine running.

359
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:18,970
Couldn't help myself, Agent Gibbs.

360
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:21,116
Where?

361
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:24,357
It was the Texaco
station on Wildwood Road.

362
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,685
I'm telling you, the first
time I saw this chick...

363
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:28,202
sorry, Lieutenant Sullivan,

364
00:17:28,203 --> 00:17:31,414
was in the rearview mirror when
she woke up and started screaming.

365
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:32,365
Last time.

366
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:34,302
In the lot where I dumped the ride.

367
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,679
I even dialed 911.

368
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,426
I mean, yeah, I hung up, but I dialed.
That's got to count for something, right?

369
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:47,010
Wait, wait, wait.
There might have been...

370
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:48,321
...another car.

371
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:51,422
There was a silver Honda Accord
that I thought might be tailing me.

372
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:52,861
Thought somebody ...

373
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,714
...saw me boost the SUV at the station.

374
00:17:57,704 --> 00:17:59,281
You see the driver?

375
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:01,452
No. He was wearing a ball cap.

376
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:05,308
I never got a good look at his face,
okay? But he must have followed me.

377
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,661
That's who you should be looking for.

378
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:10,199
- I'm not a kidnapper.
- No...

379
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:14,106
... you're just the dirtbag
that left her there to die.

380
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,172
Ziva's running down the gas station
lead. 911 hang-up already checked out.

381
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:23,681
911 hang-up already checked
out. Traced to Farris' cell.

382
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:25,961
Ducky wants to see you.

383
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:26,952
About what?

384
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:28,901
Something about, uh...

385
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:32,238
profiling Lieutenant Sullivan's
profile. Maybe you should ask him.

386
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:34,212
- So you think Farris is innocent?
- I don't know.

387
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,477
Have you checked the bloody
fingerprints Abby has against his yet?

388
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,033
You are quite the
fascinating woman, my dear.

389
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:45,267
Sadly, due to Darwinian evolution,

390
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:49,964
men tend the cherish women's
bodies rather than their minds.

391
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:51,195
I must admit,

392
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,486
I sometimes fall prey to that myself.

393
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:56,143
Thought you only talked to bodies.

394
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:59,089
A lot has changed since you quit.

395
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,774
Fortunately, one doesn't need a
body for a psychological autopsy

396
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:06,755
which is what I'm doing here
on our missing Lieutenant.

397
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:08,696
I heard you passed your test.

398
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:12,230
Yes. The graduation
ceremony was very rewarding.

399
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,106
All my friends were there.

400
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:16,778
What do you got?

401
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:19,887
Um, well,

402
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:23,614
a sampling of the
Lieutenant's DVD collection--

403
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:27,412
<i>Under the Tuscan Sun, Sabrina,
Ghost, Fried Green Tomatoes.</i>

404
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,177
What Tony would classify

405
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:30,702
as chick flicks.

406
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:34,411
Yet they contrast vividly
with her choice in literature.

407
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:37,307
Like our Timothy, she's quite the fan

408
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:40,620
of the detective and the spy genres.

409
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:43,170
A dissonance made even more interesting

410
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:46,087
by these her fitness reports.

411
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:50,631
They reveal a brilliant tactical mind
with little tolerance for failure.

412
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:53,529
One who is... highly driven.

413
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:56,334
She's well traveled,...

414
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:57,977
...but notice this.

415
00:19:58,476 --> 00:19:59,318
Alone.

416
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,219
Yes

417
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,860
I imagine you know something about that.

418
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:06,494
Are you going somewhere
with this, Doctor?

419
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:07,702
Yes.

420
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:10,342
This woman is a highly motivated loner

421
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,039
with an odd desire for secrecy.

422
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,463
These profiles that she keeps

423
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,224
may indicate a need to
control her environment.

424
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:21,113
And the people in it.

425
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,000
But you don't know who they are.

426
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:25,552
Well, this isn't an exact science.

427
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:28,399
Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs! Over here! Gibbs!

428
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:33,348
Your new golden boy McGee, he was wrong.

429
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:34,943
The partial handprint...

430
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:36,823
Isn't Farris', boss.

431
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:38,021
Whose is it?

432
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:38,968
Well...

433
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,641
That we don't know yet.

434
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:42,308
But what that means is that...

435
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,899
Somebody else was here.

436
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,184
Farris claims he didn't
know Lieutenant Sullivanwas 
in the vehicle when he stole it.

437
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:51,417
When she started screaming, he
dumped it here with her still in it.

438
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,280
Which means whoever kidnapped her

439
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:55,713
must have followed Farris
to get the Lieutenant back.

440
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:59,423
If he's telling the truth it still doesn't
explain why she was profiling people.

441
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,447
Blackmail, espionage, assassination.

442
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,254
All good reasons

443
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:06,978
someone would want
to make her disappear.

444
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,038
We could be missing something.

445
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,000
Believe me, not from this angle.

446
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,136
She could be a covert operative.

447
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:18,496
She's a Navy computer geek who
worked on software for base housing.

448
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:21,719
According to her coworkers,
she's a female version of McGee.

449
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,743
Being a geek makes for a good cover.

450
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:24,645
Cover for what?

451
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:26,585
We're still trying to
figure that out, boss.

452
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,722
You pull security tapes
from the gas station?

453
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:30,919
There weren't any. The system's
been broken for a month.

454
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,788
Tire marks from the lot
check out Farris' story--

455
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:35,918
they're a match for a
factory-standard Honda Accord.

456
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,809
Let's hope that Abby
and McGee had better luck

457
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,762
come on.

458
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:53,329
I wouldn't call this luck.

459
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:56,050
Your computer's on fire.

460
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:57,379
McGee, my baby's French-frying!

461
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,297
Checking internal core temperature.

462
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,828
That is so not funny, Gibbs.

463
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:12,674
We must have nodded off.

464
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:14,377
Tell me that you two have something.

465
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:17,131
We have something, just
don't know what it is.

466
00:22:17,132 --> 00:22:18,831
Looks like a timetable for an operation.

467
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:22,024
The problem is, the events
on the axis are encrypted.

468
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,031
We been trying to crack it all night.

469
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:25,450
Well, try harder, McGee.

470
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:29,846
Chances of finding her alive drop
to almost zero after 48 hours.

471
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,523
- Sorry. I'm sure you knew that, boss.
- Don't apologize, DiNozzo.

472
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:33,863
Right. Sign of weakness.

473
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:35,608
Not to mention annoying.

474
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:38,245
We were able to pull some
programs off our directory.

475
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:40,437
This is the only one that stands out.

476
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:42,533
MorphPro.

477
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:45,552
It's super-high-end
imaging software.

478
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:48,444
It's unusual, because it
retails for over $5,000.

479
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,360
Big bucks on a lieutenant's salary.

480
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:51,318
What's it for?

481
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,374
Morphing human features.

482
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,003
Um, we pulled some test
runs out of her cache.

483
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:57,509
Ah, yeah,...

484
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,655
<i>this is like the end of
Saving Private Ryan  you know,</i>

485
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:01,660
where Matt Damon morphs
into his older self.

486
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:03,682
Anybody else get head-faked
by that? 'Cause...

487
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,678
Tom Hanks was who I thought...

488
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:08,755
I've seen software
like this before, Abby.

489
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:11,890
Mossad used earlier versions
to age Nazi war criminals.

490
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,053
It was a great asset
to hunting them down.

491
00:23:14,054 --> 00:23:17,780
So basically, what you're
saying to me is, we have nothing.

492
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:19,012
Gibbs !

493
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:22,310
Ziva's talking about Nazis. I
wouldn't exactly call Nazis nothing.

494
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:23,964
- Abby...
- We have nothing.

495
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:26,276
Until we crack her encryptions.

496
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:27,493
You mean if.

497
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:28,509
It's high-level,

498
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,830
it's extremely sophisticated.

499
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:32,301
Would her password help?

500
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:34,451
Well, yeah, Ducky, but we don't have it.

501
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:37,961
Yeah, well, I just spent a long
night in our lieutenant's head.

502
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:39,861
I may be able to offer some suggestions.

503
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:42,034
Try "Coral Gables."

504
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:47,346
Uh, "Fiddlers green."

505
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:50,155
"Hampton Inn."

506
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,207
Nice try. Tony, Ziva, with me.

507
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,187
"Spanish rose."

508
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,992
Whoa!

509
00:23:56,993 --> 00:23:58,392
We're in.

510
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,106
Ducky, that was...

511
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,154
Mind-blowingly amazing.

512
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:04,518
It's more of an art

513
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,220
than a science.

514
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,566
DUCKY: Oh...

515
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:13,654
Lieutenant Sullivan was
indeed into targeting people.

516
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,889
She was using all her military
knowledge and skills...

517
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,153
...to find a husband.

518
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:23,295
Well, it looks like she found
herself a psycho instead...

519
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:25,516
Dr. Mallard.

520
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:28,393
Now that we have access to her files,

521
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:30,801
we can see she was using MorphPro

522
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,106
to predict the appearance
of her adult offspring.

523
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:35,137
Creepy.

524
00:24:35,138 --> 00:24:36,855
No wonder she couldn't find a husband.

525
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:40,287
You know, choosing someone to spend the
rest of the your life with is not easy.

526
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:42,837
Who wouldn't want to know
all the facts before deciding?

527
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:44,317
Isn't that what dating's all about?

528
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,804
Yeah, you should try
that sometime, McGee.

529
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:50,070
Gee, I wonder what would
happen if you two hooked up.

530
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:58,276
Guys, meet your love child.

531
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:03,895
Do Gibbs and the director.

532
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,062
Hmm.

533
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:12,374
Now, that's not a bad combination.

534
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,502
Even with Gibbs as her
father, I'd date her.

535
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:16,947
Never more than once, DiNozzo.

536
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:18,888
Aw,Aw...

537
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:21,346
... you and the director
make nice Gibblets, Gibbs.

538
00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:23,146
McGee, pull up that Web site.

539
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,078
While you three were
playing, Abby found out

540
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,745
where our lieutenant was
the day she was abducted.

541
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:28,833
Speed dating?

542
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,696
There was an e-mail
invitation on her computer.

543
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,396
It's a three-day event, and she
went missing after the first day.

544
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:35,467
Gas station where Farris stole her SUV

545
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:37,225
was two blocks from
the hotel hosting it.

546
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:40,497
So she wasn't screaming about
being singled out by a guy.

547
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:42,180
She was talking about this.

548
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:43,458
I've heard of VSO.

549
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,204
Apparently, they have
an 85% success rate.

550
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:47,416
For what?

551
00:25:47,574 --> 00:25:48,301
For marriages.

552
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:49,935
What about kidnappings, McGee?

553
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:52,438
I will work on getting a list
of clients attending the event.

554
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,650
I tried it.

555
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:57,012
Their lawyers say that Virginia's
Singled Out is a confidential service,

556
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,508
so they keep their client
list under lock and key.

557
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:02,177
- Warrant. On it, boss.
- Not enough time, it ends tonight.

558
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:04,153
I can't tell you who is there...

559
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:06,822
... but I can tell you that it's
the same guys from Sunday night.

560
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:08,004
You want to know how I know?

561
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:13,200
VSO is designed to introduce successful
men to a wide assortment of eligible women.

562
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:16,504
Each night brings the promise
of romance and a chance

563
00:26:16,505 --> 00:26:18,469
of finding your soul mate.

564
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:20,540
Or so I've heard.

565
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:23,846
Okay, you know what, I...

566
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:26,916
I thought about going to one, one time.

567
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:29,763
After this is over, you and I
are gonna have a little talk.

568
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,457
So...

569
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,731
...the men remain the same, but
the women change every night.

570
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:36,205
Hey, we're doing this
the old-fashioned way.

571
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:40,859
So, Ziva, you still think being
a geek makes for a good cover?

572
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:44,390
You sure about this?

573
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:46,934
Oh, absolutely.

574
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:50,041
We have created an image

575
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:53,407
of Lieutenant Sullivan's type.

576
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:55,885
Hopefully, the similarities with trigger

577
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:58,488
a visceral response in our kidnapper.

578
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:00,714
Do you really think he'll come
back for another woman, Ducky?

579
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:04,210
No, no, no, no. I think he'll
come back to avoid suspicion.

580
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:06,766
I doubt you'll be in any kind of danger.

581
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:09,197
Video surveillance glasses.

582
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:15,205
Good work, McGee!

583
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:16,880
I look like a dork.

584
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:18,622
Yeah, that's the point.

585
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:21,997
And this is a portable
fingerprint scanner, it's wireless.

586
00:27:21,998 --> 00:27:26,223
We'll know within a matter of seconds if the prints
you collect match our mystery print from the SUV.

587
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:28,345
All you have to do is get each dater

588
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:31,715
to press his right index finger here.

589
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,981
Really. Is that all, Abby?

590
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:35,689
How do you suggest I do that?

591
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,404
Improvise. You'll figure it out.

592
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:42,452
Our priority is I.D.'ing the members and finding
out which one drives a silver Honda Accord.

593
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:43,309
Questions?

594
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,930
Uh, just one.

595
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:48,219
Can anyone please explain
what...speed dating is?

596
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,987
90-second dates?

597
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,814
I thought you were kidding me, Gibbs.

598
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:01,234
You'll do fine, Ziva. I had
marriages shorter than that.

599
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:03,589
I'm starting to understand why.

600
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,255
Tony, sit-rep.

601
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:07,419
No silver Accord in
the parking structure.

602
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,705
Our girl is looking
a little nervous now.

603
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:11,574
I think we found her kryptonite.

604
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:15,074
Our big bad spy doesn't do geek.

605
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:16,707
Did he just say "Greek"?

606
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,054
How about both of you...

607
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:19,449
shut up.

608
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:20,923
Okay, daters,

609
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:23,455
we've got a really full house
tonight, so please remember,

610
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:24,694
be courteous to each other,

611
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:26,646
and move at the sound of the chime

612
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:28,809
please begin now.

613
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:30,917
Hey, Natalie.

614
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,205
I'm Larry.

615
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:35,055
Hi. Uh, last name?

616
00:28:35,056 --> 00:28:36,862
Uh, West.

617
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,175
Uh, banker by trade,...

618
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,703
...but my passion...

619
00:28:40,704 --> 00:28:43,035
...happens to be astronomy.

620
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:46,737
Um, wh-why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself.

621
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:48,910
I like...

622
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:50,717
- ...computers.
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,024
And...

624
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,837
... that stuff

625
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:56,185
you do with the yarn.

626
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:58,032
- Knitting?
- Yes!

627
00:28:58,033 --> 00:28:59,172
That's it.

628
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:03,042
Has anyone ever told you
you're very attractive, Natalie?

629
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,398
My brother.

630
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,640
That's...

631
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,258
interesting.

632
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,207
Get his prints, Ziva.

633
00:29:09,422 --> 00:29:10,840
You know, I feel...

634
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:13,725
Unit face is up. Just
getting his print now.

635
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:14,959
ZIVA: ...with you, Gary.

636
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,183
- Larry.
- Oh.

637
00:29:16,184 --> 00:29:17,574
What do you got in your hand there?

638
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:18,665
I-It's called a mood scanner.

639
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:19,565
- See?
- Oh.

640
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:20,936
Let's me know if you're in the mood.

641
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:24,842
<i>Oh, very New
Age-- I like that.</i>

642
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:27,594
There's something about your eyes.

643
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:29,420
I get that a lot.

644
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:31,066
It's allergies.

645
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:33,954
What kind of car do you drive?

646
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,452
Does it really matter?

647
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:38,354
<i>Well, cars get me extremely</i>

648
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:39,500
<i>hot...</i>

649
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:40,691
<i>... Larry.</i>

650
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,091
<i>I drive...</i>

651
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,319
...a Porch.

652
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:46,242
- You mean a Porsche.
- Yeah.

653
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,603
It's in the shop.

654
00:29:47,604 --> 00:29:49,487
That's a nice... car.

655
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,696
We're oh for one.

656
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:54,697
- 24 more guys to go.
- He's clean, Ziva.

657
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:57,211
Yeah, well, you didn't
have to smell him, Gibbs.

658
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,620
And do turn up the charm,
Ziva David, you're a geek,

659
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:02,618
not mentally deranged.

660
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:49,291
Get you another one, sir?

661
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:50,922
Ah. Uh...

662
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:52,655
Yeah, sure. Why not? Thanks...

663
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:53,725
Graham.

664
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,202
You with the speed dating party, sir?

665
00:30:58,827 --> 00:30:59,806
Why ?

666
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:01,802
Do I look like I need
that stuff to get a date?

667
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:05,313
I have to ask, sir,
they get 15% off drinks.

668
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,412
Just my luck.

669
00:31:07,838 --> 00:31:09,083
I'm...

670
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:11,319
... just waiting for a friend.

671
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:13,683
Met her online last month...

672
00:31:13,684 --> 00:31:16,138
...she was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

673
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:17,812
Want to see a picture?

674
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,635
Recognize her?

675
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:25,646
Dirty vodka martini.

676
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:27,891
She's a regular.

677
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:30,559
See her on... Sunday afternoon.

678
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,631
Really?

679
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,354
Was she here alone or with someone?

680
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:36,969
She was with the speed dating party.

681
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,954
Couple guys were buying
drinks for her afterwards.

682
00:31:39,955 --> 00:31:42,164
- You know how that goes.
- Yeah.

683
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:43,597
Yeah.

684
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,421
Any of those McFisters here now?

685
00:31:47,392 --> 00:31:48,147
That's one of them.

686
00:31:48,148 --> 00:31:48,875
Over there.

687
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:50,920
The, uh, gentleman with the glasses

688
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:53,005
across from the nerdy-looking girl.

689
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:54,542
Yeah. Thank you.

690
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:56,508
Did you get that, boss?

691
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:58,014
Yeah. Got It.

692
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:01,547
I need a print on this guy.
And you are out of time, Ziva.

693
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:03,958
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

694
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,549
I think there's something spiritual

695
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,231
about glass.

696
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:10,289
Hot molten, silicate, ...

697
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,983
- ...shaping it... -
You know, I-I feel a...

698
00:32:12,984 --> 00:32:14,512
an attraction between us, Calvin.

699
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,667
- Really?
- Yes, something animal, you know?

700
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:17,956
Something, uh,...

701
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:18,705
...primal.

702
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:20,730
Uh... okay.

703
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,508
And time.

704
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:23,985
Print didn't scan.

705
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,598
Ziva, we still need his print.

706
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,188
Oh, we did get a hit on his name.

707
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:33,651
Calvin Hooper reported silver Honda
Accord stolen Sunday night in Fairfax.

708
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,972
- Could have been the one following Farris.
- Tony ...

709
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:38,267
... take him down, quietly.

710
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,638
Intercepting now, boss.

711
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,975
Would you like to get
a bite to eat, Calvin?

712
00:32:45,976 --> 00:32:48,037
Uh... you mean... together?

713
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:49,069
Of course.

714
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,510
Uh... well, sure.

715
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,010
I'd love to.

716
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:55,101
Or let's just skip the dinner

717
00:32:55,102 --> 00:32:58,050
and go straight for dessert.

718
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,680
You know, this kind of
thing never happens to me.

719
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:01,007
Oh!

720
00:33:01,008 --> 00:33:03,018
- Calvin Hooper?
- Yes?

721
00:33:03,637 --> 00:33:04,378
Huh?

722
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:05,346
Remove your hand

723
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:07,087
or I will rip your arm off

724
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:08,746
and beat you to death with it.

725
00:33:08,747 --> 00:33:09,793
Um..

726
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,522
It's not a match.

727
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:13,697
What?

728
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:15,934
Run it again.

729
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:17,518
Boss, he's not our guy.

730
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:23,565
But but you have no right to arrest me.

731
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:25,121
You're not under arrest, Calvin.

732
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:26,283
Yet.

733
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,282
We just...

734
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:29,473
...want to clear up a few things.

735
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,392
No one read me my Miranda rights.

736
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:33,066
That's because you're not under arrest.

737
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:34,941
- Yet.
- Ziva!

738
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:36,353
Sorry.

739
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,762
You should be proud of him.

740
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:42,133
DiNozzo?

741
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:45,077
When you left, there
were some rocky moments.

742
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:47,057
He really held the team together.

743
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,062
It's what I trained him to do.

744
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:53,599
I just thought you should
know he excelled at it.

745
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:55,922
Then give him his own team, Jen.

746
00:33:57,174 --> 00:33:58,448
You think he's ready?

747
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:00,565
I wouldn't have quit if he wasn't.

748
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,143
You should tell him that.

749
00:34:02,144 --> 00:34:03,793
Oh, trust me.

750
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:07,567
When DiNozzo thinks he's ready for
his own team, you'll know about it.

751
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:10,637
Hell, the whole world
will know about it.

752
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:18,321
So you reported your
car stolen Sunday night.

753
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,486
Yes. Is that some kind of crime?

754
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:23,224
No. Of course not.

755
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:24,464
However,...

756
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:27,668
- ...filing a false police report...
- Crime!

757
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,105
I think I want a lawyer now.

758
00:34:31,106 --> 00:34:33,814
What part of "You're not under
arrest" don't you get, Calvin?

759
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:34,833
So I...

760
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,832
...I'm free to go here at any time?

761
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,073
Sure.

762
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:43,165
Unless we charge you with a crime.

763
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,090
See, the thing is, Cal...

764
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:46,626
Can l call you Cal?

765
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:50,008
Arresting you means
more paperwork for me.

766
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:51,531
So...

767
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,393
what I need from you

768
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:54,905
is the truth.

769
00:34:56,035 --> 00:34:57,770
But my car really was stolen.

770
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,117
Which sucks for you.

771
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:03,370
Unfortunately, you reported it
stolen from your home in Fairfax.

772
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:05,210
Speed dating is a three-day event.

773
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:07,727
You stayed at the Belmar every night.

774
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:09,125
You paid cash up front.

775
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:11,009
Which was wise,

776
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,656
considering that you're married and
attending a speed dating service.

777
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:15,823
I'm calling his wife.

778
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:19,052
No, wait! Please.

779
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:21,977
It wasn't stolen from my
house, but you can't...I...

780
00:35:21,978 --> 00:35:23,074
... She...

781
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:25,372
...She'll find out.

782
00:35:26,148 --> 00:35:28,848
My wife is at her
sister's place in Jersey.

783
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,016
- They just had a baby.
- Oh.

784
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:34,267
I've been married 18 years now.

785
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:36,973
I was just trying to have a little fun.

786
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:38,221
Yeah...

787
00:35:38,998 --> 00:35:41,525
What we need to know
is where and when, Cal.

788
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:43,765
The first day of the ...

789
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,026
...event I...

790
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:46,873
- ... struck out.
- Shocking.

791
00:35:46,874 --> 00:35:49,871
So I drove over to the
Texaco station around 6:00

792
00:35:49,872 --> 00:35:51,804
to get some cigarettes and wine,...

793
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:53,658
...and I'm in the store...

794
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:54,868
...maybe a minute when I...

795
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:58,012
I look out, and this guy
is driving away in my car.

796
00:35:58,013 --> 00:35:59,352
Please describe him.

797
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:01,251
White, about your height.

798
00:36:01,252 --> 00:36:03,163
He was wearing a Chicago Cubs hat.

799
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:05,602
And, really, you know,I
just got a glimpse of him.

800
00:36:05,603 --> 00:36:06,812
Not good enough.

801
00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:08,476
You grabbed my ass, Calvin.

802
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:14,180
No! Hold on! Hold on! Just a second. Um... Just
gi-gi-gi-give me a second. Just a second. Uh...

803
00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:16,687
When I drove up, he, uh...
he was standing out front.

804
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:19,075
And he... he was on the pay phone.

805
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,630
And I swear, that's all I can remember.

806
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:24,639
Farris stole the lieutenant's
SUV with the lieutenant in it

807
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,192
from the gas station at around 1800.

808
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:29,479
And Cubs Hat steals Calvin's car

809
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,809
at the same time, same
place, and follows him.

810
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,772
Well, do you think they
were working together?

811
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:34,889
It's possible.

812
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,493
Except they weren't.

813
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:38,850
Guy in the Cubby hat stopped
by to use the pay phone.

814
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:40,752
Probably didn't want
to risk being overheard.

815
00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:43,561
Didn't figure on Farris
coming by and stealing his car.

816
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:46,514
So he had to steal the
Accord to follow Farris.

817
00:36:46,515 --> 00:36:48,493
If he wanted the lieutenant back.

818
00:36:48,823 --> 00:36:51,768
Well, we got to get that pay
phone, find out who he was calling.

819
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,971
McGee just brought it back.

820
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:57,656
Feast your eyes on the
Western Electric 1D2,

821
00:36:57,657 --> 00:37:00,821
a piece of 1989's finest technology.

822
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:05,329
The three latent prints that we took
off this phone matched our mystery print

823
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,133
that we got from the
back of Sullivan's SUV.

824
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:12,983
Cubs Hat is definitely our kidnapper.

825
00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:14,945
Did you run the calls made Sunday night?

826
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:16,815
Did and done, Ziva.

827
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:18,588
The traces just came in.

828
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:21,689
There were only four calls made
from the pay phone that night.

829
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,334
I mean, the pay phone industry has been
decimated by cell phone penetration.

830
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:27,067
The only time you really use a pay phone

831
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:29,623
would be on an airplane,
which is probably the reason

832
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:31,328
that you can't use your
cell phone on an airplane.

833
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:32,675
Abs, our missing lieutenant?

834
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:34,409
Right. Um...

835
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,186
Three of the calls were
to taxicab companies,

836
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:40,610
and one was to a warehouse
in Fredericksburg.

837
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:43,126
It's a rental space.
There's the address.

838
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:50,019
Abby.

839
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,659
Good job.

840
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,581
Those are two words I will never
take for granted again, Bert.

841
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,263
Clear.

842
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:34,974
No one's here, boss.

843
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:38,270
The lieutenant was here. It's her
purse. Military I.D. is still inside.

844
00:38:38,271 --> 00:38:40,049
- They knew we were coming.
- Maybe not, boss.

845
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,980
You definitely need to check this out.

846
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:43,575
Looks like a professional crew.

847
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:45,736
Detailed itineraries, blueprints,

848
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:47,384
and a scale model.

849
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:50,799
It's for the Belmar Plaza Hotel.

850
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,146
They planning a heist?

851
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:53,951
Yeah. A big one.

852
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,294
Coin convention and auction.

853
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:57,653
They're planning on
hitting the hotel's vault.

854
00:38:57,654 --> 00:38:59,228
Does it say how?

855
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,035
From inside. They're working the place.

856
00:39:02,036 --> 00:39:03,432
What does the lieutenant
have to do with this?

857
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:07,293
She was dating one of them.
Alpha Bravo, one-zero-one-six.

858
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:08,503
The missing profile.

859
00:39:08,504 --> 00:39:10,339
It says here he's a hotel bartender

860
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,364
that lied to her about his entire past.

861
00:39:12,365 --> 00:39:14,329
She ran a background check on his cover.

862
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,283
I can only imagine he panicked when
she started questioning him about it.

863
00:39:17,284 --> 00:39:19,238
We need to get to the hotel
before they hit the vault.

864
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:21,636
They started four minutes ago. Come on.

865
00:39:52,508 --> 00:39:55,409
You really had us scared
there for a minute, Annie.

866
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,923
We thought you might be FBI

867
00:39:58,174 --> 00:40:01,466
or a detective working
for the hotel. But...

868
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,188
...no cops.

869
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,879
Looks like you were
telling me the truth.

870
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:13,038
I'd wish you luck with the
whole husband thing, but...

871
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,667
I don't think it's really
going to work out for you.

872
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:19,935
I'm not exactly the marrying type.

873
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,009
We're running eight
minutes behind schedule.

874
00:40:35,473 --> 00:40:37,002
Sanitize the warehouse.

875
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:39,349
We meet at the airport in two hours.

876
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,695
It's nothing personal, Annie.

877
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:47,643
You just know too much.

878
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:50,389
Don't move. Drop your weapon!

879
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:52,753
Or, if you'd prefer, I
can shoot you in the spine.

880
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:55,327
Would you rather be a para
- or quadriplegic?

881
00:40:58,084 --> 00:40:59,424
NCIS!

882
00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:01,645
Put your hands where we can see them!

883
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,046
Have a seat. You're
going to be all right.

884
00:41:19,047 --> 00:41:20,414
Thank you.

885
00:41:27,714 --> 00:41:30,624
You can't tell me you didn't
miss this when you were in Mexico.

886
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,245
A couple of minutes.

887
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,615
That's it?

888
00:41:37,202 --> 00:41:40,823
That's the difference between putting
the lieutenant in a body bag...

889
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:42,966
...or an ambulance.

890
00:41:51,352 --> 00:41:53,031
Come in, Tony.

891
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:57,462
How did you know it was me?

892
00:41:57,463 --> 00:42:00,371
Because your deadline passed hours ago.

893
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,973
I've made my decision.

894
00:42:08,974 --> 00:42:10,632
And I respect it.

895
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,104
Sometimes I even wish I
made the same one myself.

896
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:17,064
But I'm passing on the promotion, Jenny.

897
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,126
I know.

898
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:19,531
How can you know?

899
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:22,133
I just made up my mind behind the door.

900
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:24,942
To get here, ...

901
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:26,880
...in this office,...

902
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:29,329
especially as a woman?

903
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:33,715
My career has been on the
fast track my entire life.

904
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,645
And, between you and me?

905
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,822
Sometimes I wish I had
taken it a little slower.

906
00:42:40,402 --> 00:42:41,927
So you're not disappointed?

907
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:43,017
No.

908
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:46,608
Actually, I'm feeling a
bit proud at the moment.

909
00:42:47,226 --> 00:42:48,174
Hmm.

910
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:52,366
Go home and get some sleep.

911
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:57,297
Listen...

912
00:42:57,627 --> 00:42:58,854
... this wouldn't be

913
00:42:58,855 --> 00:43:03,193
the right time to bring up the
possibility of a performance award or...?

914
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:04,963
Good night, Tony.

915
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:06,670
Yeah, I didn't think so.

916
00:43:07,324 --> 00:43:08,489
Good night, Jenny.

917
