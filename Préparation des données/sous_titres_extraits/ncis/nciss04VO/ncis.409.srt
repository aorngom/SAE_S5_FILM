1
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:25,103
Open up, McGee.

2
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:27,800
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,692
Bzzzz!

4
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:31,368
Um...

5
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:32,998
That's what I've been
hearing all night long.

6
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,758
Bzzzz. Bzzzz.

7
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:37,577
You electrocuting sheep in here?

8
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:38,971
Feels like it.

9
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:41,045
You know what? That's
probably my shredder.

10
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,178
You know that's funny 'cause
you say that like, well, uh...

11
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:45,338
like I haven't been up
all night listening to it.

12
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,672
I'm sorry, I'm having...

13
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:49,585
It won't happen again.

14
00:00:49,587 --> 00:00:51,655
It does, and paper's
not gonna be the only

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,107
thing getting shredded around here.

16
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:54,111
Sorry.

17
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:11,766
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

18
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:12,836
Won't happen again.

19
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:18,642
I think I killed someone, Tim.

25
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:13,660
You okay?

26
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:16,867
You asked me that 30 seconds ago, Mom.

27
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:18,858
Yeah, well, you've been
in there over an hour.

28
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:20,623
Yeah, well, how long
would you be in the shower

29
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:22,379
if you were covered in mystery blood?

30
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:26,627
You're sure that none of it is yours?

31
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:28,294
Yeah.

32
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,000
But you don't know whose it is?

33
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:32,156
No. I told you.

34
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,144
I was at Headliners with
these girls from school,

35
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,000
we were watching this crappy band,

36
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,867
the next thing I know,
I'm at your front door.

37
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,031
You left out the part where you said

38
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:42,192
you killed someone.

39
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,155
Tim, that's not funny.

40
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:51,378
You don't remember saying that?

41
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:55,975
How much did you have to drink?

42
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:56,826
Nothing.

43
00:02:57,131 --> 00:02:58,592
I'm under 21, remember?

44
00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:00,980
Really, because your
fake ID says you're 22.

45
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:04,591
How much?

46
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,933
Okay, I had a few drinks.

47
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:10,783
Sarah, do you remember what happened
the last time you had "a few" drinks?

48
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:11,477
No.

49
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,076
That's the point. You can't drink.

50
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:16,007
Last time you had a few
too many, you painted

51
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:17,808
"bitch" on Katie Hutchinson's garage.

52
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,136
I would have done that sober.

53
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,543
That bitch stole my boyfriend.

54
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:24,262
Tim, relax.

55
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:26,541
I barely even touched
my second beer, okay?

56
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,943
I remember because I had...

57
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:42,051
You had to what?

58
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:46,819
I had to study.

59
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,538
That's right.

60
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,989
After the concert, we
went to the food court,

61
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,212
but I left early because
I had to go to the library.

62
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:57,170
Good. Library's good and then?

63
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:01,834
Why can't I remember?

64
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:05,664
Someone could've slipped you something.

65
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,083
No, Smart Girl 101,

66
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:08,971
you don't take drinks
from guys you don't know.

67
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,551
We should still get a urine sample.

68
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,391
I can't pee in a mug with
a picture of Grandma on it.

69
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:22,872
What are you doing?

70
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:24,368
Calling the police.

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,596
And telling them what?

72
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,543
That I showed up at your front door

73
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:29,480
with blood on my hands
saying I killed someone?

74
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:31,433
Besides, Tim, that
could be animal blood.

75
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,213
And what if it's not?

76
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,586
Sarah, I'm a federal agent.I
have a responsibility...

77
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:37,273
Tim, I didn't come to a federal agent.

78
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,336
I came to my big brother.

79
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,689
McGee's not answering his cell phone,

80
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,845
pager or MySpace IM.

81
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,401
McGee on MySpace, I gotta see that.

82
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:53,251
Keep calling.

83
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,478
Still trying to get
into his calendar, boss.

84
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:57,162
You know, I'm not sure
what the problem is.

85
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,107
When I was framed by
the Iranians for murder,

86
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:01,833
I was late for many hours
before anyone even noticed.

87
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:03,220
You're not McGee, Ziva.

88
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:06,105
McTimex's brain is
hard-wired for punctuality.

89
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,503
And sadly, scaring away potential mates.

90
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:10,792
There we go.

91
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,709
No doctor's appointments.

92
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,681
He does have a personal trainer.

93
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:16,057
Four times a week?

94
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:18,517
And tomorrow, an 8:00 a.m. appointment

95
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,403
at a Harley Davidson dealership?

96
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:22,984
Either McGee's won the lottery
or he's got a sugar daddy.

97
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:25,268
Yeah. Gibbs.

98
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:27,482
Where?

99
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:28,983
Dead?

100
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,300
Sailor. Waverly campus. Gear up.

101
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,056
What about McGee? We
haven't found him yet.

102
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,211
I did.

103
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,025
Or rather, he found
me. Sent me an email.

104
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,445
Woke up sick.

105
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,726
Laryngitis, won't be
coming in to work today.

106
00:05:42,318 --> 00:05:43,702
You know, I bet he sent you one, too.

107
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:55,343
You still here?

108
00:05:58,892 --> 00:05:59,205
Hmm.

109
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:03,904
Who emails in sick to work?

110
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:06,498
If I called, they'd know I was lying.

111
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:09,249
Oh, and if you have
laryngitis, you can't call.

112
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,686
Have you been saving that one
for a comic book convention?

113
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:14,555
Can we get back to the timeline, please?

114
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:16,938
Okay...

115
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,509
now you left the bar at 9:30 p.m.

116
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:23,480
I got to the campus food
court at around 10:00.

117
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:27,847
You showed up here at
my door at 2:30 a.m.

118
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,422
That leaves four hours unaccounted for.

119
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:32,686
I'm actually impressed.

120
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,465
Is this what you do at work?

121
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,832
Yeah?Really?

122
00:06:35,903 --> 00:06:37,956
State the obvious and
make pretty pie charts?

123
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:43,238
No, we collect facts and
we formulate theories.

124
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:44,887
But if you think you can do better.

125
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, okay.

126
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:54,270
There are

127
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:55,659
four hours unaccounted for.

128
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,235
Of which I have no memory,

129
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,672
so, I either drank more than I realized,

130
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,445
repressed some kind of traumatic event,

131
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,976
or was drugged.

132
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:09,369
And the blood on my hands
and the fact that I'm always

133
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,632
careful with what I drink
imply a traumatic event.

134
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:13,460
But what and where?

135
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:14,898
Answer...

136
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:17,112
the shoes I bought yesterday.

137
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:20,396
$32 on sale, plus I had
a back-to-school coupon.

138
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:22,810
They're muddy, but the soles
are barely even scuffed,

139
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,177
so I didn't walk the
five miles to your place.

140
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,068
Okay, so how did I get here?

141
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,137
When I left the food court, I had

142
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:32,695
$14 in my back pocket

143
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,591
and now there's only two,
and since it's a ten dollar

144
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:36,701
taxi ride to your place, do the math,

145
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:38,341
I must've taken a taxi cab here.

146
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:39,519
And that's our first step.

147
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:42,503
We find the driver.
We ask him where I was.

148
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,738
And when we find out where I was,
we can find out what happened.

149
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:53,828
Let's start by checking
local taxi dispatchers.

150
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:55,415
There's two major cab companies.

151
00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:59,049
Dozens of gypsies. I'm
assuming you left from campus.

152
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:00,926
It would definitely be a major.

153
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:02,404
They'll have a log of the fare.

154
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:04,914
Do you think you caught
the taxi on campus?

155
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,766
Ready! Five, six,

156
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:17,263
seven, eight. Hit, one,

157
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:18,893
two, roll, three, four,look,

158
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,767
five, hit, six, seven, down, eight.

159
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:21,860
Go, one, two.

160
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,533
This isn't the XFL ladies.

161
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,916
This is Waverly.

162
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,993
Save the pole dancing for
your boyfriend, Carolyn.

163
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:46,724
Uh, you'll have to move your car, sir.

164
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,391
You're in a passenger loading zone.

165
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:49,786
I don't see any, uh, pass...

166
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,234
Oh, well, you don't want to park here.

167
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,326
You might want to yank
out your rent-a-cop manual

168
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,900
- and recheck the pecking order.
- No, no, no.

169
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:59,238
Your people are on the
other side of the quad.

170
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:08,307
Well, that was quick.

171
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:10,928
Solve this case already, DiNozzo?

172
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:13,437
No. It's my hundredth body.

173
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:15,266
Hey, listen, you wouldn't mind taking...

174
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:18,886
Sorry. That's a bad idea.

175
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,553
It seemed less disgusting in my head.

176
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,351
By comparison with
what else is in there,

177
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:23,162
I'm sure it was.

178
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:24,953
Anything useful from that jogger,Ziva?

179
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:27,616
If "I saw the body and I
called the police" is useful,

180
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:28,424
the yes...

181
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:29,859
Otherwise, no.

182
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,468
Can't tell how long
the body's been here.

183
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:33,551
Luckily, of course, I can.

184
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:36,050
I must apologize for
our tardiness. We had...

185
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:38,076
trouble parking the van.

186
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:39,385
Homecoming.

187
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:42,920
I would have thought McGee
would have beaten me up here.

188
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:43,928
McGee's not here.

189
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:44,672
Really?

190
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,980
I could have sworn I saw
him in the parking lot.

191
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:48,768
Well, we're at a college.

192
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:50,788
Pencil-neck geeks are a dime a dozen.

193
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:55,516
Ah, let me see.

194
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:05,934
Preliminary time of death:
between ten and 12 hours ago.

195
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:07,371
We have another body!

196
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,034
I thought you said you had another body.

197
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,778
I do.

198
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:16,610
Actually, ten of them.

199
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:48,978
Hey, what time is it?

200
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,380
After 10:00.

201
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,473
After 10:00?

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,121
I missed my class.Why
didn't you wake me?

203
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:58,633
I wanted you to get some rest before...

204
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:01,169
Before what?

205
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:05,668
Sarah...

206
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:07,980
You found my taxi.

207
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:11,314
I haven't spoken to
the driver yet, but...

208
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,011
I did get a log from the company.

209
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:16,162
And?

210
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,754
And you were picked up

211
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,628
early this morning at the quad.

212
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:26,118
When I went to check
it out, NCIS was there.

213
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,025
What was NCIS doing there?

214
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:34,869
Probably had something
to do with the dead body.

215
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:38,501
Where are you going?

216
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:40,160
The library.I have to study.

217
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:41,177
Excuse me?

218
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,471
I have a Chaucer midterm coming up.

219
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:44,200
Hey, Sarah!

220
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,534
Hello! Dead guy!

221
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:47,543
That's probably dead
guy's blood on your shirt.

222
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,100
I told you, that could be animal blood.

223
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,125
It's not. I tested it, and it's human.

224
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,987
Sarah, we've got to go to NCIS.

225
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,264
Why? Why NCIS?

226
00:11:57,957 --> 00:11:58,898
Body was a sailor.

227
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:04,620
Sarah!

228
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:05,956
Hey!

229
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,121
Do you know the sailor's name?

230
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:19,495
No.

231
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:23,680
I do.

232
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,765
Dental records confirm the
body is Seaman Jeff Petty,

233
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,570
currently serving on the USS Enterprise.

234
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:33,753
Docked at Norfolk last night.

235
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:35,864
- Navy notifying the family?
- As we speak.

236
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:37,580
A duty I do not envy.

237
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:40,510
Yes, when I was an
officer with the regiment,

238
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,293
I was twice called upon
to render such services.

239
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,726
I prefer combat to telling a family

240
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:48,334
that one of their loved ones
shall never be returning.

241
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:52,367
Luckily, in this case,
we are spared such a duty.

242
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:53,911
You got a time of
death on those goldfish?

243
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:56,179
No time, but a cause.

244
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,361
Asphyxiation.

245
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,486
Suffocation?

246
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:01,722
Over-feeding.

247
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:04,434
Nicotine poisoning.

248
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,143
I just got the test results from Abby.

249
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:09,679
There was enough nicotine
in their blood to kill...

250
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:11,431
well, to kill a gold fish.

251
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,004
That much is certain.

252
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:13,968
How did that get there?

253
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,266
Your guess is as good as mine.

254
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:19,230
Yeah, the cause of death of Seaman Petty

255
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,684
is more explicable.

256
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:23,918
Sharp-force trauma
to the thoracic area.

257
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,133
Punctured the aorta, so death
was almost instantaneous.

258
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:29,805
The shape and depth of
the wound suggests...

259
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:30,719
- a combat knife.
- a combat knife.

260
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:31,814
We didn't find a knife.

261
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:33,490
All we bagged was trash.

262
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:34,834
Tell DiNozzo to keep looking.

263
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,132
Well, Tony went home.

264
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:40,767
He went home?

265
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,500
He wasn't feeling well.

266
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:44,365
Thought McGee might
have gotten him sick.

267
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,216
So he went...

268
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:46,919
home?

269
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,283
Well,actually,...

270
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,528
the Director told him he could go.

271
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:55,139
I'm not done, Gibbs.

272
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,546
Make it fast, Dr. Mallard.

273
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:57,786
Postmortem lividity

274
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:00,718
suggests that Seaman
Petty was killed on scene.

275
00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:03,680
Tox screen came back negative;
no drugs in his system.

276
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:05,650
His CO said he was a model sailor.

277
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:08,783
There was very little trauma
beyond the entry wound.

278
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:12,633
No scratches, no DNA in the fingernails.

279
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:14,710
He was surprised.

280
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:16,396
Or he knew his killer.

281
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:21,964
Sarah, open up.

282
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:24,752
Sarah!

283
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:28,253
Tell me how you know this guy!

284
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:32,568
Sarah, I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

285
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:42,155
How do you know him?

286
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:46,530
We used to date.

287
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,173
Until he started seeing my old roommate.

288
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:57,383
And?

289
00:14:58,737 --> 00:14:59,297
And...

290
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:05,497
I threatened to kill him once or twice.

291
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,465
Maybe even three times.

292
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:17,857
This is that sailor that
you were dating last year?

293
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:20,968
You told me you didn't like him.

294
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,267
What did you expect me to say, Tim?

295
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:26,244
I really liked this guy
and he just broke my heart

296
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:28,315
when he dumped me for
some skanky cheerleader.

297
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:29,485
You threatened to kill him

298
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:31,034
because he dumped you for a cheerleader?

299
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:32,148
I didn't mean it.

300
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:34,067
It was just one of those
things you say, you know?

301
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,456
Did anyone hear you say it?

302
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,674
I never actually said it.

303
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:45,014
I e-mailed it.

304
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:48,632
Sarah, we got to go to Gibbs now.

305
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,833
I haven't done anything wrong.

306
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:51,658
How do you know?

307
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:53,958
Tim, you don't really...

308
00:15:58,342 --> 00:15:59,014
You do.

309
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:01,005
Sober, no, but you were drinking, Sarah.

310
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:02,107
There could have been an accident.

311
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,627
Tim, I swear on my life...

312
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,802
How can you swear?!

313
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:06,931
You don't remember what happened.

314
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,285
If my own brother doesn't believe me,

315
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:11,616
who the hell is going to?

316
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,803
Sarah.

317
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,018
What, are you gonna arrest me?

318
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:20,218
You need to understand something.

319
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:24,562
Our only option right
now is going to N...

320
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,300
Wait a minute.

321
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:35,012
I thought they were brother and sister.

322
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:36,917
They are, but they don't know it.

323
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,316
Haven't you been reading the subtitles?

324
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,454
There are subtitles?

325
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,238
So much for being a film buff.

326
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:46,327
Hey! Listen, I could...

327
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:47,579
bore you to death

328
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,600
with a lecture on German
Expressionism in film if you'd like.

329
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:52,356
You could never bore me.

330
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:53,862
Well, that is very sweet of you,

331
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:55,118
but you underestimate me.

332
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,394
It is my contention, Miss Benoit,

333
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,682
that the abstract nature
of Expressionism in film...

334
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:04,783
What are we doing, Tony?

335
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:08,620
Well, I'm boring you with
German Expressionism in film.

336
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:12,166
We've been dating for over a month.

337
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,533
Don't you find it a
little curious that...

338
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:17,694
we haven't taken it to the next level?

339
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:20,832
You mean Italian Neo-Realism?

340
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:22,225
- Japanese cinema?
- No.

341
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:22,764
Sex...

342
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:26,324
Yeah...

343
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:28,144
Yeah, sex, right.

344
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:29,210
Yeah, is that

345
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:31,300
something you might be interested in?

346
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:34,926
Yeah.

347
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,719
Yeah, I get that vibe from you,

348
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:39,741
and yet we still haven't had it

349
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:42,399
and you don't seem like
the type who usually waits.

350
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,600
Yeah, well, it could be

351
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:48,115
because you remind me of my sister.

352
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,267
You said you were an only child.

353
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,441
I am.

354
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,749
Could I have a serious answer...

355
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:57,959
please?

356
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:03,568
I don't want to rush things.

357
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:06,934
Date Two is rushing things, Tony.

358
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,645
Date 11, that's a violation
of the Geneva Convention.

359
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:17,944
If you always do what
you've always done,

360
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:20,885
then you'll always get
what you always got.

361
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:24,081
And while what I got had its perks,

362
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,250
I'm looking for something different now.

363
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:31,855
Okay, Tony,

364
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:33,998
but just so you know,

365
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,082
whenever you're ready...

366
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,291
so am I.

367
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:54,534
And then when we finished bowling,

368
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,668
he walked me to my car.

369
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:56,627
And?

370
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,729
And he said, "I hope to
see you soon, baby doll,"

371
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,612
gave me a peck on the
cheek and then he left.

372
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:02,894
Short and sweet.

373
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,836
Oh, he is.

374
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,103
Hey, I've been looking all
over the building for you.

375
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,633
Since we were low on agents,

376
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:08,754
I thought I'd give Abby a hand.

377
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:11,197
The only reason we are
low on agents is because

378
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:12,534
you sent DiNozzo home.

379
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:14,815
Well, there's no sense
in getting us all sick.

380
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:16,276
Next time you send one of my team home,

381
00:19:16,277 --> 00:19:18,033
you clear it with me first, Director!

382
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,705
Oh, I didn't know I
needed your permission

383
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:21,947
to manage my own personnel Agent Gibbs.

384
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:22,852
Your personnel?

385
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:23,906
Last time I checked it said

386
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:25,627
Director on my door, not yours.

387
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:28,380
The kids don't like it
when Mommy and Daddy fight.

388
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,366
You got the call log

389
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,233
off the cell phone we
found on Seaman Petty?

390
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,324
There was damage on the
DC run to the SIM chip,

391
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:37,500
probably from the fall.

392
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:43,249
Okay. Wow, 15 missed text messages.

393
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,998
Someone's really trying
to get ahold of...

394
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:48,423
Oh, no, what do I do? Do I answer it?

395
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:50,066
Put it on speaker.

396
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:52,033
Hello.

397
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:54,133
Finally.Where the hell are you?

398
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:56,600
McGee?

399
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:58,431
Boss?

400
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:01,100
Why do you have my sister's cell phone?

401
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:02,950
I got a better question for you.

402
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,767
Why is your sister's phone
doing on my dead body?

403
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:26,455
Ooh, and I thought being sent

404
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:27,900
to the principal's office was bad.

405
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:29,514
He's still in the elevator?

406
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:31,988
Per Gibb's orders.
Awaiting El Jefe's arrival.

407
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:33,733
How mad is he?

408
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,579
Well, considering McGee's
been covering for his sister

409
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:38,524
who's implicated in the
death of a Navy sailor...

410
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:43,012
What were you thinking, McGee?!

411
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:44,715
...I'd say he's handling it pretty well.

412
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:48,660
I would apologize, but I
know how you feel about that.

413
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,564
You got your voice back.

414
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:56,290
I never lost it.

415
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:57,196
No kidding?

416
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:04,314
I know withholding evidence
is a violation of NCIS policy.

417
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:05,207
And a crime.

418
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:07,789
One that I don't really care about.

419
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:10,774
Why didn't you come to me?

420
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:14,746
I was going to.

421
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:17,844
When I saw the body, I-I
know I had to bring Sarah in.

422
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,386
No, before that.

423
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,753
I couldn't take that chance.

424
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:31,006
I don't know what my
sister did or didn't do.

425
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,206
But I know what it looked like.

426
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,671
And we say, 'better
ten guilty men go free

427
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:41,003
than one innocent get punished,

428
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:42,045
but I know from experience

429
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:43,289
it doesn't always work out like that.

430
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:47,539
I couldn't take that chance with Sarah.

431
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:52,524
Not with the police, not with NCIS.

432
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,124
Not even with you.

433
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:01,158
She's my sister.

434
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:13,468
Apology accepted.

435
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:23,675
Cute girl.

436
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:26,234
Hey. This is the one I
found on McGee's iPod.

437
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:28,323
I knew there was no way
she could be his girlfriend.

438
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:30,837
Poor McGee got the shallow
end of the gene pool.

439
00:22:30,838 --> 00:22:31,600
They're here.

440
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:34,267
I thought for sure
probie would be limping.

441
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,832
Getting, uh, soft, in
your old age there, boss?

442
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:38,967
Prime of your youth, sir?

443
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,100
We needed it for the BOLO.

444
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:42,534
Please tell me that's not for..

445
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:44,762
Citing a bench warrant
for Grand Theft Auto.

446
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,537
Guess that's better
than a BOLO for murder.

447
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:47,634
We need to find her, McGee.

448
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,301
Right now, she's our main suspect.

449
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:50,030
Witness.

450
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,298
Spoke to the taxi driver
who picked your sister up.

451
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:54,880
He places her at the crime scene.

452
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:56,830
And Abby confirmed the blood type

453
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:59,048
on your sister's clothes,
matches Seaman Petty.

454
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,267
That's more than witness, probie.

455
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,483
And there are the emails.

456
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:03,389
Like the one that
starts "Dear man whore"

457
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,732
and ends with "if I ever see
you again I will kill you.

458
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:06,845
Love, Sarah."

459
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:08,967
Got them off Seaman Petty's e-mail.

460
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:10,794
Throw them on the pile
and they add up to...

461
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,395
Motive and opportunity.

462
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:14,412
Why is she running?

463
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,815
She's mad. She's scared.

464
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,429
Says she has nothing
to do with the murder.

465
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,298
Thinks I don't believe her.

466
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:21,643
Do you?

467
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:23,401
Sarah's not a killer.

468
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:24,360
But?

469
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:26,100
But an accident's another story.

470
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,000
- If she was drugged...
- She wasn't.

471
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:29,919
Abby ran the urine sample you took,

472
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,134
and it was clean.

473
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:33,075
Any other suspects?

474
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,208
Maybe Seaman Petty's
cheerleader girlfriend.

475
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:36,967
At least your sister's not the only one

476
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:37,961
writing threatening e-mails.

477
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:39,100
Cheerleader was worried

478
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,000
Popeye was getting his
spinach somewhere else.

479
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:41,655
Address?

480
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:44,000
Ziva, I want that taxi impounded.

481
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:45,524
DiNozzo, you're on McGee's sister.

482
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,967
Ah, with great pleasure, boss.

483
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:48,608
Boss, maybe Tony would
be better on the taxi...

484
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:49,603
- McGee...
- Yeah.

485
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:50,114
Go home.

486
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:51,933
I can't have you working this case.

487
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:54,339
If I go home, how do you know
I won't keep working on it?

488
00:23:58,141 --> 00:23:58,983
Come on.

489
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,095
I'll keep an eye on you.

490
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:04,291
Hey.

491
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:06,300
You're wondering if she did it?

492
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:09,500
No, I'm wondering why McGee
never told me he had a sister.

493
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:27,361
This is Jeff in Bahrain.

494
00:24:29,212 --> 00:24:30,028
Handsome kid.

495
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:31,734
He loved wearing that uniform.

496
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:34,206
Almost as much as I
loved seeing him in it.

497
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,555
He was supposed to meet
me at the food court.

498
00:24:36,556 --> 00:24:39,338
We were having freshman
cheerleader initiations

499
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:40,155
later that night.

500
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:42,953
But I wanted to make time
to surprise Jeff with...

501
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,423
a surprise.

502
00:24:46,812 --> 00:24:47,539
He never showed?

503
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:50,686
I just figured his ship was late.

504
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,527
I told you we should have used carbon.

505
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,369
If you can't get this thing working,

506
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,235
I'm going to have to
find some geeks who can.

507
00:24:58,656 --> 00:24:59,651
No, we can do it.

508
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:03,986
Seen enough?

509
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,867
No, no, no, actually, um...

510
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:08,241
I was checking the water gun here.

511
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,836
The check valve is on backwards.

512
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,029
If you flip this...

513
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,230
Real smooth, Einstein.

514
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,435
It sounds like you and Jeff
had a perfect relationship.

515
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:20,551
We did.

516
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:22,505
We were going to get married.

517
00:25:25,495 --> 00:25:27,011
You better make her pay for this.

518
00:25:28,284 --> 00:25:28,598
Who?

519
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,401
That jealous bitch, Sarah McGee.

520
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,193
She couldn't deal
with the fact that Jeff

521
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:34,415
wanted me instead of her.

522
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,286
She sent him threatening e-mails,

523
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:37,850
she trashed me in her blog.

524
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:38,819
Blog?

525
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:40,172
Yeah.

526
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:41,517
What's a blog?

527
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:44,967
It's a... blog. You know.

528
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:46,269
No, I don't know.

529
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:46,704
It's...

530
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,515
something losers put online
so that everyone can read.

531
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:51,102
Are you going to arrest her or not?

532
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,065
I saw her

533
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,660
at the food court with her geek friends.

534
00:25:54,661 --> 00:25:56,525
When she found out that
Jeff was coming to meet me,

535
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:57,567
she left to find him.

536
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,431
How do you know she just didn't leave?

537
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:01,269
Because she killed him!

538
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:02,381
- Boss...
- Hey.

539
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:05,591
I told you to wait outside.

540
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:07,164
Why didn't you ask
her about the e-mails?

541
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,491
Maybe I don't want her to know

542
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:10,715
that I know about the e-mails, McGee.

543
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,000
There's a reason

544
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:14,888
I told you to stay outside.

545
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:16,502
And there's a reason that I came in.

546
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:18,286
Look.

547
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,399
Come on in.

548
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,588
I take it this isn't a social call.

549
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:45,345
I need some advice.

550
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:48,026
And you came to me?

551
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,963
Well, it was either you or Gibbs,

552
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:53,249
and his track record
with women sucks, so...

553
00:26:58,256 --> 00:26:59,695
I'm finding, um...

554
00:27:00,672 --> 00:27:03,133
myself in a particularly
odd situation with...

555
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:04,505
someone...

556
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,101
special.

557
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:07,742
Odd?

558
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:10,593
Odd, yeah, odd.

559
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,752
Because, uh...

560
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:15,183
we've been going out for, uh...

561
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:17,464
over a month, and, we... we haven't...

562
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,579
done something

563
00:27:20,196 --> 00:27:23,563
that I usually do... you
know, a lot earlier than that.

564
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:26,858
And may I ask what it is
that's holding you back

565
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,826
from doing what you usually do?

566
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:32,247
Yeah.

567
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,158
Um...

568
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:37,395
Because of the...

569
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,573
particular importance...

570
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:41,123
of this person,

571
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:43,650
I thought it would be a good
idea to take things slowly.

572
00:27:44,878 --> 00:27:47,907
Which is kind of a new
concept for me. But...

573
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:52,432
at a certain point, things
have to speed up, righ... right?

574
00:27:53,393 --> 00:27:54,654
Are you attracted to her?

575
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:57,593
Oh, yeah.

576
00:27:58,588 --> 00:27:59,323
Yeah.

577
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:01,060
I could make a meal.

578
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,060
Is she attracted to you?

579
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:06,671
So what's the problem?

580
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:14,145
DiNozzo.

581
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:16,108
BOLO just came back on McGee's sister.

582
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:17,421
Campus security has her.

583
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:19,737
Well, let Gibbs know.
He's there with McGee.

584
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:20,476
I did.

585
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:21,893
He wants us to bring her in.

586
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:23,550
Okay, I'll be right there.

587
00:28:26,261 --> 00:28:26,978
Good luck.

588
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,146
I'm Security Officer Tate.

589
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,193
One of the librarians reported her.

590
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,098
Apparently, she sleeps here a lot.

591
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:35,375
How McGee-ish of her.

592
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:36,714
Must be in the McGee-nome.

593
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:38,968
You want her for more
than GTA, don't you?

594
00:28:41,683 --> 00:28:43,228
I didn't have the
authority to arrest her,

595
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,192
- but if you want me to...
- We'll take it from here.

596
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:55,990
No, you can't have my number.

597
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,136
I already have have your number, Sarah.

598
00:29:03,387 --> 00:29:04,453
It's not whays think.

599
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,482
My eyes water when I read a lot,

600
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:08,827
and these lights are really crappy.

601
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:14,584
Are you guys here to arrest me?

602
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:15,651
No.

603
00:29:16,018 --> 00:29:17,291
You do have to come with us, now.

604
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:18,760
Yeah, sure.

605
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:24,102
You are just being nice to me
'cause Tim's my big brother?

606
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:27,032
No. I'm always nice to hot girls.

607
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:31,848
You must be Tommy.

608
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:33,210
Tony.

609
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:35,769
Sorry. In Tim's book, you're Tommy.

610
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:38,238
Which would make you Lisa?

611
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:56,109
Where have you been?

612
00:29:56,682 --> 00:29:58,421
The library. I told you Io study.

613
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:00,460
You know, Tony

614
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:01,885
is much cuter than Tommy.

615
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,950
Tommy?

616
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:05,205
Hmm,

617
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:07,970
you know if you rearrange
these letters, you get...

618
00:30:08,454 --> 00:30:09,484
Timothy McGee.

619
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:11,999
You should have told
me this was a secret.

620
00:30:12,235 --> 00:30:13,933
Can't wait to read
about your swashbuckling,

621
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:15,432
and socially repugnant,

622
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:17,500
Special Agent Tommy.

623
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:22,840
And Lisa... the sultry
and emotionally distant

624
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:24,091
Mossad officer.

625
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:27,351
Or their boss...L.J. Tibbs, who drinks

626
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:30,949
to alleviate the burden
of his messianic complex."

627
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:32,504
Where is L.J.,

628
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:33,463
Dead-Agent-Walking?

629
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:35,000
Evidence garage.

630
00:30:36,716 --> 00:30:37,164
Tony?

631
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:38,862
Tony?

632
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:41,429
I'm going to kill you.

633
00:30:42,895 --> 00:30:44,033
Where'd you find it, Abs?

634
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:45,579
Stuffed behind the seat cushion.

635
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:47,371
Hey, boss.

636
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:54,856
You okay?

637
00:30:56,515 --> 00:30:58,997
Sarah, please, no!

638
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:04,356
You didn't find that
in the taxi, did you?

639
00:31:16,164 --> 00:31:18,370
Who studies while they wait
to be interrogated for murder?

640
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,632
A Mc-Geek.

641
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:22,626
"Lisa's eyes reminded him of emeralds."

642
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:23,290
Oh.

643
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,140
"Flawed only by the
icicles in her heart."

644
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,412
He's dead.

645
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,062
"And the Field Agent Tommy is
a dogged pursuer of dirtbags."

646
00:31:33,411 --> 00:31:34,218
Yep.

647
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:38,837
"And any skirt over the age of 18."

648
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:40,038
Your brother's dead.

649
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,829
Sarah threatened to kill
Seaman Petty by e-mail.

650
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:46,862
A taxi picked her up
near the crime scene

651
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:48,233
at the time of the murder.

652
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:50,097
The blood on her clothes

653
00:31:50,232 --> 00:31:54,067
matches the victim's and her
fingerprints are on the murder weapon.

654
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:56,284
Other than being your sister,

655
00:31:56,786 --> 00:31:58,605
is there any evidentiary reason

656
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:00,291
why she shouldn't be charged?

657
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:02,952
But she is my sister, Director.

658
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:05,336
Sarah may have a temper,

659
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:07,894
but she lashes out with her
mouth or a pen, not a knife.

660
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:09,740
And I hope you have more to offer

661
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:11,810
than brotherly love, Agent McGee.

662
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:14,100
She was drugged.

663
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,071
She showed up at my door groggy,

664
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:19,548
barely able to walk. She couldn't remember
anything except leaving the food court.

665
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:22,626
And the lab reports for drugs
and alcohol were negative.

666
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,100
By the time those tests were taken,

667
00:32:25,101 --> 00:32:26,852
whatever was in her
system had metabolized.

668
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,518
And if that's true, whose fault is that?

669
00:32:30,893 --> 00:32:32,200
Mine,I should have taken

670
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,877
- Sarah in earlier.
- But you didn't bring her in.

671
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:36,319
Agent DiNozzo and Officer David did.

672
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:39,702
So your actions, or
should I say inactions,

673
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:42,287
did nothing to help your sister,

674
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,459
but it did impugn the
integrity of this agency.

675
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,294
Forgive me, Director,

676
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:49,072
for not putting the integrity
of NCIS before my sister.

677
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:52,602
It won't happen again.

678
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:05,873
McGee.

679
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:11,353
Hey.

680
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:13,755
Boss, don't try and talk me out of this.

681
00:33:14,297 --> 00:33:17,164
Never let someone manipulate
you like that again.

682
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,893
Not even the Director.

683
00:33:23,092 --> 00:33:24,078
She wanted me to quit?

684
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,852
That's her job, to protect
NCIS. Come here. Sit down.

685
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:29,865
Boss, you don't think...?

686
00:33:29,866 --> 00:33:32,054
You sit down here until I get back.

687
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,224
Boss, you don't think
Sarah did it, do you?

688
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,542
I don't know, McGee.

689
00:33:42,025 --> 00:33:43,929
I'll know after I interrogate her.

690
00:33:44,082 --> 00:33:44,973
- Can I watch?
- No.

691
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,828
- Please, from observation...
- No!

692
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,167
Boss, I can't just sit here.

693
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:54,643
Here, read a book.

694
00:34:15,412 --> 00:34:16,255
What's your major?

695
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:18,813
English lit.

696
00:34:20,802 --> 00:34:22,751
You intend to be a
writer like your brother?

697
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:25,879
I intend on being a writer.

698
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:28,044
Why the smart-ass answer?

699
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:29,527
What?

700
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,771
You put your brother down.

701
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:32,887
No, I didn't.

702
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:33,850
Yeah, you did.

703
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:37,108
He just resigned because of you.

704
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:39,617
No!

705
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,430
But Tim loves NCIS.

706
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:45,625
Evidently, he loves you more.

707
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:54,954
I'm sorry.

708
00:34:56,634 --> 00:34:58,042
Fake tears don't bother me.

709
00:34:58,043 --> 00:34:59,887
I don't fake tears.

710
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:03,167
Just lapses in memory.

711
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:04,359
I don't remember!

712
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:12,715
I just get...

713
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,717
quick film cuts.

714
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:17,904
Hold onto 'em.

715
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:19,123
I can't.

716
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:20,842
I guess you don't want to.

717
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:21,676
I do.

718
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:23,630
If you did, you'd remember.

719
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:26,341
And how would you know?

720
00:35:29,347 --> 00:35:30,073
I've been there.

721
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:40,262
Sarah, stop it! Stop it!

722
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:41,969
What are you doing?!

723
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,880
No! No! No!

724
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:53,108
I stabbed him!

725
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,756
I stabbed Jeff!

726
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:04,238
What's your sister's favorite pizza?

727
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,183
What? Her favorite pizza?

728
00:36:06,184 --> 00:36:07,590
Come on, Tim, it's not a trick question.

729
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:11,237
Uh, cheeseless with pickles,
Tabasco and peanut butter.

730
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:13,415
Yes, yes, yes!

731
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:14,059
Yes?

732
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,947
You sister was doped.

733
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:16,434
Where's Gibbs? Where's everybody?

734
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:17,201
Interrogation.

735
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:18,935
Well, go get 'em and
bring 'em down to my lab.

736
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:19,562
There's more!

737
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,355
Abby's got great news.

738
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:28,564
It's not great. It's actually terrible,

739
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:30,575
but it explains why Sarah...

740
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:33,534
What did Gibbs do to my sister?

741
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,210
Nothing.

742
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:36,347
She admitted stabbing Seaman Petty.

743
00:36:42,189 --> 00:36:43,551
Sarah doesn't know what she's saying.

744
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:44,797
McGee...

745
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,863
Boss, she was drugged. Abby has proof.

746
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:50,304
Stay with her.

747
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,767
Hey, hey.

748
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:54,247
I remember the knife.

749
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:56,922
I remember Jeff lying there.

750
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,162
No, no,my little sister
could never kill anyone.

751
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:06,412
I was poring over all
the forensic evidence:

752
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:09,238
the trash from the crime scene
and every inch of the taxi

753
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,744
and I realized that the floor
mat smells like Nilosorb.

754
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:12,775
Nilosorb?

755
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,258
Industrial vomit cleaner.

756
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,740
So I took what was left on there.

757
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:19,934
I ran it through the mass spec

758
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,232
and found what McGee has confirmed

759
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:24,267
to be Sarah's favorite
late-night snack:

760
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,834
cheeseless pizza with Tabasco,
pickles and peanut butter.

761
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:28,644
Yuck.

762
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,968
But I also found traces
of sodiumoxybate, aka GHB.

763
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:34,629
It didn't show up in her urine sample

764
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,133
because it metabolizes so quickly.

765
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,698
Which is probably what makes it
such a popular date-rape drug.

766
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:40,434
You think Seaman Petty
tried to rape her?

767
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:41,521
Her ex-boyfriend?

768
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:43,635
There's nothing like a death
threat from an ex-girlfriend

769
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,357
to get your dander up.

770
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,365
Are you talking from experience, Tony?

771
00:37:46,392 --> 00:37:48,400
So the levels of GHB

772
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,400
allowed me to triangulate
a window of exposure.

773
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:53,641
She was dosed at the food court.

774
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:54,224
DiNozzo.

775
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:56,383
Pull the security tapes from
the food court. On it, boss.

776
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:56,831
Ziva.

777
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:58,176
Names of food workers,

778
00:37:58,177 --> 00:38:00,067
janitors and anyone working that night.

779
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:01,877
What was I going to tell you?

780
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,987
I don't know. What were
you going to tell me,

781
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:04,852
El Magnifico?

782
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:08,534
Good job.

783
00:38:09,278 --> 00:38:10,133
But I have more.

784
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:12,818
I solved the mystery
of the smoking goldfish.

785
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:14,718
At first, I couldn't figure out

786
00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:16,909
how they were lighting
the cigarettes underwater,

787
00:38:17,482 --> 00:38:18,621
and then I found this.

788
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,139
They were trying to kick the habit.

789
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:25,171
Our little Nemos were swimming
in a bag that sprung a leak.

790
00:38:25,413 --> 00:38:27,994
Sprang a leak...
sprung, sprang, sprung...

791
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,538
So their little lives flashed
before their eyes in a nicotine buzz.

792
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:33,495
Hey, do you think,
since goldfish only have

793
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:34,499
three seconds of memory...?

794
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,767
Abby, get Ducky on that.

795
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:37,484
I don't know, Gibbs.

796
00:38:38,013 --> 00:38:41,067
That is a very complicated
piece of equipment.

797
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:42,936
Probably have to go get my manual out...

798
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:43,528
Abbs!

799
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,350
Ducky.

800
00:38:48,646 --> 00:38:51,067
Yes, my little lotus blossom.

801
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,133
Gibbs wants you.

802
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,143
You know when the goldfish died?

803
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:57,567
I was just determining
the time they expired.

804
00:38:57,638 --> 00:38:59,950
You're using a little
teeny tiny liver probe?

805
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:02,822
Being cold-blooded,
temperature is useless

806
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,767
in determining the time of death.

807
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:05,801
So you don't know?

808
00:39:05,892 --> 00:39:06,819
Au contraire.

809
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:09,794
They died about the
same time as our victim.

810
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,634
Now how did you calculate that?

811
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:16,430
Track Sara McGee from the time
she enters until she leaves.

812
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:17,971
Ah, okay.

813
00:39:19,163 --> 00:39:20,543
Ah-ah, oops.

814
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:22,429
That was the wrong way.

815
00:39:25,701 --> 00:39:26,946
I'm sorry. Sorry, boss. One second.

816
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:27,654
DiNozzo?

817
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:32,444
Froze.

818
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:36,419
This is sort of a McGeek thing.

819
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:36,797
Get him.

820
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:41,605
You know what a clog is?

821
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:45,629
A shoe or a block to drain?

822
00:39:45,754 --> 00:39:46,373
On the Internet.

823
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,631
I thought that was a blog,

824
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,130
but, uh, my English is often wrong.

825
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:52,717
Sarah McGee wrote a blog

826
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:54,406
trashing her and the cheerleaders.

827
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:55,199
Do you think you can find it?

828
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:56,570
Probably on MySpace.

829
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:57,744
Who is she?

830
00:39:57,915 --> 00:40:00,513
Seaman Petty's girlfriend, Sarah's ex
- roommate.

831
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:07,798
"These peppy little girls
all skanked up to the nines

832
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:09,767
"in their adorable
cheerleading uniforms,

833
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:12,566
"which had been mistakenly
ordered in children's sizes,

834
00:40:12,772 --> 00:40:17,100
"were engaged in strangely
homoerotic, adderol-fueled

835
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:19,887
spastic movements that
they called dance routine."

836
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,622
Where's that from?

837
00:40:21,124 --> 00:40:21,770
That's my blog.

838
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:26,801
You should let your sister
ghostwrite for you, probie.

839
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:28,513
Find your sister
entering the food court.

840
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,658
How do you get a
ready-made cheeseless pizza

841
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:34,533
with Tabasco sauce,
pickles and peanut butter?

842
00:40:34,947 --> 00:40:36,296
Oh, I make it myself.

843
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:38,500
Food court has everything
but peanut butter,

844
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:40,002
so I carry a jar in my backpack.

845
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:41,793
McGee, isolate her table.

846
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:51,800
<i>Ready?</i>

847
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:54,107
One, two, down, up.

848
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:57,252
Steady. Hold it, Heather.

849
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:58,879
Uh! Take five.

850
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:06,416
Whatever happened to quitting?

851
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:07,881
After football season.

852
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:11,492
Why don't you go home?

853
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:14,180
I'd rather be here.

854
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:20,200
Seen enough of my ass?

855
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:21,892
What do you think, Tony?

856
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:23,289
I don't know. There's a lot to see.

857
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,771
Stay the hell away from me, jerk.

858
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:28,837
It's amazing what a
college education does

859
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:30,400
for a girl's vocabulary,
don't you think?

860
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:31,386
Astonishing.

861
00:41:32,762 --> 00:41:33,828
I believe you know my sister.

862
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:38,139
That was for spiking my peanut butter.

863
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:41,033
And that was for setting
me up to be raped.

864
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:43,100
This is for being an
accessory to murder.

865
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:43,430
What?

866
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:44,712
Madison?

867
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,787
They're framing me.
I didn't do anything.

868
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:48,417
We got you starring
in the food court show.

869
00:41:48,426 --> 00:41:50,380
Spiking Sarah's peanut butter with GHB.

870
00:41:50,434 --> 00:41:52,252
Oh, yeah, try and prove
that from a security camera.

871
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:54,820
Your greasy paw prints are
all over my peanut butter jar.

872
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:57,271
We have you leaving the
food court with Officer Tate.

873
00:41:58,575 --> 00:41:59,722
You murdered Jeff?

874
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:00,614
No!

875
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:04,064
I was just using Tate to get
even for this bitch's blog.

876
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,035
And Jeff saw Tate grappling with her

877
00:42:06,036 --> 00:42:07,022
and tried to play hero.

878
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:10,008
I'm not gonna hurt you.

879
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:11,700
What are you doing? Let go of her!

880
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:12,662
Drop it!

881
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:19,500
Tate stabbed him.

882
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,047
I dropped everything and ran.

883
00:42:21,048 --> 00:42:22,782
You stabbed him! Put
the knife in her hand,

884
00:42:22,783 --> 00:42:23,991
put the cell phone in his pocket.

885
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:25,130
You lying bastard!

886
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:26,567
- Lying bitch!
- Get 'em out of here.

887
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,421
- I didn't do anything!
- You have the right to remain silent,

888
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:29,113
you have the right to do splits

889
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,005
Let go of me!

890
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:31,600
the right to wear short skirts...

891
00:42:36,874 --> 00:42:37,573
I'm sorry.

892
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,237
Jeff was a great guy
and he really loved you.

893
00:42:43,205 --> 00:42:43,967
How would you know?

894
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:46,816
He e-mailed me.

895
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:50,186
He said he was sorry,
but he met his soulmate.

896
00:42:51,297 --> 00:42:51,799
It was you.

897
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:05,041
Sometimes, McGee,...

898
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:08,217
a little lie...

899
00:43:09,938 --> 00:43:11,336
it's good for the soul.
