1
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:05,472
Retesting evasive driving techniques.

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,985
Third time's the charm,Otto.

3
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:08,428
You can do it.

4
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:22,363
Give me a 180,Otto.

5
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:28,399
Yes! Didn't touch a single cone on that run.

6
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:30,448
I would call that a pass,baby.

7
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,411
Phase two.

8
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:33,618
This one's for you,Torsten.

9
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:34,872
Go for it,Otto.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,379
Make me proud.

11
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,117
Avoiding civilian casualties

12
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:41,411
during high-speed egress.

13
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:49,153
Oops.

14
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:51,831
Sorry about that,Torsten.

15
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:57,282
Need to recalibrate the braking-to-surface algorithm.

16
00:00:57,502 --> 00:00:58,448
That was my fault,Otto.

17
00:00:59,075 --> 00:00:59,779
Not yours.

18
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:01,231
Test concluded.

19
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:02,880
Take me home,Otto.

20
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:16,049
Ooh...

21
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:17,930
Still a few bugs to work out,

22
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,122
but Otto and I are both feeling much better

23
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:21,548
about the drive-off next week.

24
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:24,831
Oh,note for Jamie-- fuel pressuge is fluctuating.

25
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:32,799
Malfunction in the electrical system at 0638.

26
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,702
Initiating software shutdown.

27
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:41,929
Exhaust in the cabin.

28
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:43,730
Otto's core is frozen.

29
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:45,119
I'm hitting the kill switch.

30
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:51,734
Come on... Come on!

31
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,263
I'm trapped in the ca...

37
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:50,802
Lights,please.

38
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:53,079
From the video presentation,

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,953
it's clear that sexual harassment

40
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:57,088
can take many forms in the workplace.

41
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:58,363
A coworker with

42
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,893
elevator eyes looking you up and down,

43
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,044
a coworker shows you a cartoon or

44
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:06,034
photo of a sexual nature.

45
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:06,947
If you're lucky.

46
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,757
A coworker's hand accidentally

47
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:11,968
brushes up against your body.

48
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:13,381
If you're really lucky.

49
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:14,459
Physical contact

50
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,032
can be divided into three categories.

51
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:20,188
Green light includes normal behavior.

52
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:21,750
Yellow light includes

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,143
borderline behaviors such as hugging someone or...

54
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:27,112
Yep?

55
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,497
What's wrong with hugging people?

56
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,839
I hug people all the time.

57
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:31,181
You may see it as friendly,

58
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:32,880
but your coworkers may find it offensive.

59
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:35,855
You guys get offended when I hug you?

60
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,240
No. No. No.

61
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,580
Of course not,Abby.

62
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:41,579
I'm hugging you all in my mind right now.

63
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:42,783
D.O.D. policy

64
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:44,807
is very clear about this point,Miss.

65
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,513
You must first ask permission

66
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:47,897
before making physical contact

67
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:48,524
with a coworker.

68
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:50,570
Like,every time?

69
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:51,928
Yes.

70
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:53,979
And finally,there's red light behavior,

71
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,618
such as deliberate,

72
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,493
unwelcomed touching.

73
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:03,008
Another question?

74
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:03,855
Yeah,

75
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,335
what if you slap someone in the back of the head like this?

76
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:09,975
Would that be considered inappropriate behavior?

77
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,932
Absolutely.

78
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:12,967
Are you saying that this has actually happened?

79
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,394
No,I was just wondering, that's all.

80
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:19,670
Yes?

81
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:23,266
Uh,yes,uh,what if part of your job...

82
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:23,739
Gibbs.

83
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:26,631
includes... touching naked people

84
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,990
- ... and...
- That's inappropriate at any time.

85
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:30,640
Even if they're dead?

86
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:34,753
Why are you touching dead,naked people?

87
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,002
You see,I work in autopsy...

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,193
Can we try to keep this discussion

89
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:40,747
focused on the topic...

90
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:41,410
Gear up.

91
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,825
Navy lieutenant's been found dead

92
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,393
in an R & D facility in Fairfax.

93
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:46,597
Wait,I can't

94
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:48,054
mark you as attending unless you're here for...

95
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,364
Uh,Ms. Taylor.

96
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,440
I will take excellent notes for them.

97
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:56,834
Okay...

98
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:00,651
Ducky won't be here.

99
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,669
He's got to take his mom to the hospital.

100
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,110
Is Victoria all right?

101
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,946
Well,she cut herself shaving, and for some reason,

102
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:08,498
he thinks you can handle this,Palmer.

103
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:12,309
Uh... what do you think, Agent Gibbs?

104
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,546
Well,I don't know,Palmer.

105
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,042
- You got me a T.O.D.?
- Yes.

106
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,797
Uh,according to the liver probe,she died...

107
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,272
two hours and 18 minutes ago.

108
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,498
Does it tell you how?

109
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:24,373
Actually,the probe only

110
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,749
tells you the difference between ambient temperature and...

111
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,749
But you already know all this.

112
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:31,583
Tentatively,I'd say she died from hypoxia,

113
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:32,251
Agent Gibbs.

114
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:33,951
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

115
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:35,051
Yeah,most likely.

116
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:37,388
In 68% of cases, it's accidental.

117
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:40,703
And,uh,the other 29% are self-inflicted.

118
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:43,052
Well,I'm more concerned with the three percent you left out.

119
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:44,152
Palmer,he's talking about the ones

120
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:45,680
deliberately murdered this way.

121
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:47,165
How'd she get on the floor.

122
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:49,018
Coworker found her in the passenger seat,

123
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,080
in there,doors still closed and the engine running.

124
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,176
He drove it out,attempted CPR.

125
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:55,287
Tony's taking a statement now.

126
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:57,256
What kind of vehicle is this?

127
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:00,098
It is a second generation

128
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,710
fully autonomous AI- operated vehicle,boss.

129
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,189
Well,yeah. Yeah,I can see that,McGee.

130
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,598
I mean,other than the obvious.

131
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:06,939
Wait,

132
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,780
you actually understood that?

133
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,117
You know what it does then?

134
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,625
Yeah,your basic second generation...

135
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:14,648
AI...

136
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:16,804
autonomous stuff.

137
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:22,592
Where the hell does the driver sit?

138
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,594
That's the point. There isn't one.

139
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:25,815
It drives itself.

140
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:28,784
Boss,"AI" stands for artificial intelligence.

141
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,017
It's a robot.

142
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,353
<i>All I'm saying,Agent DiNozzo</i>

143
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:36,779
is our entire team is under a tremendous

144
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,835
amount of stress.

145
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,288
We're competing against dozens of teams.

146
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,784
Three and a half years of work,

147
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:45,066
and it all comes down to a single proof of concept test.

148
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:46,397
Robot car race.

149
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:48,927
In crude terms,yes.

150
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:49,888
What do you get if you win?

151
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,692
Recognition in my field.

152
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:54,696
What about one of those cool trophies like

153
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:56,103
they hand out at NASCAR?

154
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:57,488
I wouldn't know.

155
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,765
I'm a scientist,not a redneck.

156
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,085
It is the fastest-growing sport in the country.

157
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,372
I rest my case.

158
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:04,763
In my opinion,

159
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,039
it's clear what happened here.

160
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,958
When I found Seabrook,she was...

161
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,880
sitting in Otto with the diagnostic

162
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:10,833
bay doors closed

163
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:12,109
and the engine running.

164
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:13,627
What's that tell you?

165
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,783
You think she killed herself?

166
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,004
I do.

167
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:20,754
What about an accident or a malfunction?

168
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,563
All she had to do to shut Otto down

169
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:23,926
was to flick the kill switch.

170
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:26,910
It was right in front of her on the dashboard.

171
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,007
Look,obviously...

172
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,564
she couldn't face her own faults and

173
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:31,910
missed deadlines,so...

174
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,012
she took the coward's way out.

175
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,980
-That's enough,Torsten.
-She's dead, Russell.

176
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,267
There's no need for you

177
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:39,549
to continue this charade of defending her.

178
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:42,947
I'm Dr. Pike.

179
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,520
Project leader.

180
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,642
Where is Lieutenant Seabrook?

181
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:51,184
Could you stop?

182
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:56,364
Can I...

183
00:07:57,431 --> 00:07:58,333
Can I see her?

184
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,406
Roni...

185
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,301
What have you done?

186
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:18,142
Ziva,you have really got to see this.

187
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:19,764
See what,McGee?

188
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:21,859
It's an Atlas-Seven CPU.

189
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:23,880
It's the same one developed for the Martian rovers.

190
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:25,879
And how does this pertain to the case?

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,578
Well,it doesn't. I just thought it was cool.

192
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:28,936
See,the thing about...

193
00:08:31,537 --> 00:08:32,714
That better be your handcuffs.

194
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,331
I believe this is a classic yellow light situation.

195
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,977
Stop moving,McGee. My hand's stuck.

196
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:40,643
It's not the only thing that's stuck.

197
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,249
Make that a red light situation.

198
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:45,163
What are you doing?

199
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:48,149
Investigating a dead Naval officer.

200
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:51,630
That's a $22 million piece of equipment,you...

201
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:56,623
You people are jeopardizing my entire project.

202
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:58,399
We're doing our jobs. What'd you find?

203
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,649
Ah,there's a USB cable,

204
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,580
still attached to the console in the passenger side.

205
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:06,356
Also bagged a battery for a laptop in the front seat.

206
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,980
I removed the laptop.

207
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:08,902
We'll need it.

208
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:09,941
Absolutely not.

209
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:12,152
It contains a backup copy of Otto's AI.

210
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:15,040
Well,whatever that is, we'll need that,too.

211
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:17,068
That is Otto.

212
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:20,829
Already got it covered,Tony.

213
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:23,573
Tow truck should be here any minute now.

214
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:26,284
This is our only prototype!

215
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:29,028
You people... you people are...

216
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,731
you're....

217
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,411
We're cops,Federal agents, police officers?

218
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:36,633
Maybe if you sound it out,it's easier.

219
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:37,150
You know,

220
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,662
english as a third language is always the trickiest one.

221
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:42,434
I'll take the laptop now, please.

222
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,693
I've known Roni for almost ten years,Agent Gibbs.

223
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:54,880
She was one of my brightest students at MIT.

224
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,910
An exceptional mind.

225
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,140
Light-years ahead of her peers

226
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,880
when it came to the field of artificial intelligence.

227
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:03,577
Machines that can think.

228
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:04,302
Yes.

229
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:05,941
So...

230
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:08,042
that Humvee can think?

231
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:09,840
Only about driving.

232
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:12,743
An easy task for you or me, but for a machine,

233
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:15,548
it takes millions of calculations a second and complex

234
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:16,901
reasoning skills.

235
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,945
According to the Navy,

236
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:22,410
your thinking car is a joint project with them and Azeon.

237
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,803
They've been very good to us as far as R & D resources go.

238
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:26,980
Meaning money.

239
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:29,940
And Lieutenant Seabrook's time.

240
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,576
Gonna need your security tapes

241
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,568
and access logs that you keep,Doctor.

242
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:38,589
She wasn't even supposed to be here this morning,

243
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,390
agent Gibbs.

244
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:42,361
She worked late last night. I... I...

245
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:45,149
I gave her the morning off.

246
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:46,672
She didn't take it.

247
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:49,690
She died in your garage

248
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,363
at zero-six-forty this morning.

249
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,921
She must have come in to run a test.

250
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:57,433
She's a...

251
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:01,403
was a perfectionist.

252
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:03,806
Never satisfied.

253
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:08,700
Traits I'm afraid I encouraged her in.

254
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:10,965
Sitting in a running vehicle

255
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,737
inside an enclosed space is not a bright idea.

256
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,937
Trust me,Agent Gibbs...

257
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:18,714
Roni was not the type to kill herself.

258
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:20,787
What type was she,Doctor?

259
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,431
Driven.

260
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:28,480
Lieutenant Seabrook's Naval career was most unusual.

261
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:30,240
No deployments and, as far as I can tell,

262
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,625
she never set foot on a ship.

263
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:33,175
Well,she was an egghead.

264
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:34,693
They don't recruit them to fight wars.

265
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,805
No. Just to build the machines for fighting them.

266
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:37,652
Maybe she had enough.

267
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:38,812
Enough of what?

268
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:40,856
You'd be surprised how many weapon designers

269
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:41,885
take their own lives.

270
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,189
I might have a better motive.

271
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,580
Azeon had everything leveraged on Otto.

272
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,280
It fails the drive-off, the company goes bankrupt.

273
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:50,410
Sabotage.

274
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:51,940
Someone wanted them to fail.

275
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:53,499
Not bad,McGee.

276
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,885
I got one better than better.

277
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:57,580
Curious to know what follows red light behavior,Ziva?

278
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,944
A potential pregnancy?

279
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,704
It's a good guess, but not in this case.

280
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:03,656
Check this out.

281
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,994
Ran the security footage taken from the lab.

282
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,144
Zero-one-fifteen.

283
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:10,883
Last two people present were our lieutenant

284
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:11,744
and this guy.

285
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,483
Azeon's chief mechanic, Jamie Jones.

286
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:15,891
Hold on to your socks.

287
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:17,145
Gets a little steamy.

288
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:23,617
What about the video from this morning,when she died?

289
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:24,964
Oh,yeah!

290
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,114
Why didn't I think of that?!

291
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,231
'Cause someone erased it.

292
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:32,206
The last image taken from any camera stops

293
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,966
at zero-five-thirty-seven this morning.

294
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:35,665
And then nothing but snow.

295
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,139
She was murdered.

296
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,375
Did you find my bag,Mr. Palmer?

297
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:52,772
In the trunk of your car, Doctor.

298
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:54,476
Ah,thank you.

299
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:57,688
I'm sorry if I seem a bit flustered today.

300
00:12:58,034 --> 00:12:59,519
Oh,that's understandable,Doctor.

301
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:01,042
Where did your mother cut herself?

302
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:04,407
Well,let's just say that a woman in her 90s

303
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,843
should not be using a straight-edged razor

304
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,362
when grooming,and leave it at that.

305
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,680
Are you hiding a secret from me,Mr. Palmer?

306
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,075
Well,it's nothing to be embarrassed about.

307
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:17,874
I've been thinking of doing the same thing myself.

308
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,188
You are? Yes,only in my case,

309
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:21,889
I have to be careful of heart strain

310
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,347
and muscle fatigue.

311
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:25,182
How long have you been pumping?

312
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,861
I,I wouldn't call it pumping, Doctor.

313
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,723
Well,whatever they call it these days,

314
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:31,731
I'm impressed with you.

315
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:32,869
Really?

316
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,014
Yes,you've certainly got yourself in shape.

317
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:37,032
Have you joined a gym?

318
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:38,616
A gym?

319
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,970
Yes,yes,yes,I have. A,uh,few months ago.

320
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,256
What have we got,Duck?

321
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:47,579
Ah,Mr. Palmer's initial assumption was correct.

322
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:51,263
Lieutenant Seabrook died of carbon monoxide poisoning.

323
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,727
Tell me something I don't know.

324
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:56,223
The levels of C.O. in her blood

325
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:58,609
five times the fatal dose,yes.

326
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,005
She was probably rendered

327
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,997
unconscious in less than 30 seconds.

328
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:03,932
Not possible, unless she was...

329
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:05,439
She was breathing in the

330
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:07,336
exhaust fumes directly from the tailpipe.

331
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:08,986
Or someone pumped it into the vehicle.

332
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,724
Which makes sense,in light of what else I found.

333
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:14,540
Evidence of assault. Look at her wrists.

334
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,008
They're bruised.

335
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:17,658
She was restrained.

336
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,500
And I also found what appear to be

337
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:23,195
bite marks on her inner thighs and back.

338
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:24,289
Run a rape kit.

339
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:27,440
I did. That's when I found this.

340
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:31,581
An intrauterine device.

341
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,984
More commonly known as an I.U.D.

342
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,567
Is it just me,or has anyone else wondered

343
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:37,107
how they get those little things in there?

344
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,108
That,that probably sounded

345
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:42,428
a lot more inappropriate than I meant.

346
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:43,423
Do you think,Palmer?

347
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,781
As I was saying,

348
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:46,046
when I ran the rape kit,

349
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:48,444
I found fresh male genetic material.

350
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,533
From last night or early this morning.

351
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:52,645
Abby's running the samples now.

352
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:53,904
I also found

353
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:55,828
traces of engine oil

354
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,665
and a particular kind of lotion

355
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,172
on her hair and skin.

356
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,141
The main ingredient was pumice.

357
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,570
Grease-monkey soap.

358
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:04,286
Yeah.Except,

359
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,481
her nails and hands are clean.

360
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,231
The skin is soft,no calluses to speak of.

361
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:11,935
Not her soap.

362
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:14,305
She certainly wasn't a regular user.

363
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:16,548
Thanks,Duck.

364
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:19,522
Did you learn nothing

365
00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:21,503
in that class this morning, Mr. Palmer?

366
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:25,550
Jamie Jones was arrested in 1998

367
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,887
for assault and battery on his girlfriend and....

368
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:31,076
she dropped the charges and married him six months later.

369
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:32,627
There's no accounting for taste.

370
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:34,255
Look at Britney and K-Fed.

371
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:36,861
At least she was smart enough to ask for a divorce.

372
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,258
So was Jones' wife.

373
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,100
Divorced three years ago.

374
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,234
Ooh,and there's a restraining order.

375
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:42,943
Shocking.

376
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:43,977
Not on him.

377
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:45,643
He got it against his ex-wife.

378
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,441
Lieutenant Seabrook wasn't alone at Azeon last night,boss.

379
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:49,860
She was with a mechanic.

380
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,006
Yeah. The Azeon security cameras caught it.

381
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,309
And there was evidence she was...

382
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,299
Sexually assaulted.

383
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:56,734
Ducky thinks she was raped.

384
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,197
Yeah,check this out.

385
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:10,190
You get a warrant yet?

386
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,379
Yeah. Right here. Name's Jamie Jones.

387
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,359
Ziva and I were gonna pick him up.

388
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:13,945
Not anymore.

389
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,570
You're processing the Lieutenant's apartment.

390
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:16,432
Boss,what about me?

391
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,488
You get with Abby.

392
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:19,808
The C.O. levels in that vehicle were off the charts.

393
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:21,360
You find out how he did it.

394
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:25,605
Letting me drive?

395
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:26,897
No,I'm meeting you there.

396
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:29,152
I need to drop something off at the hospital.

397
00:16:29,768 --> 00:16:30,153
What?

398
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:32,677
A stool sample. Would you like to see it?

399
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:34,882
You want me to stab you in the eye with my knife?

400
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,785
Abby?

401
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:44,704
Over here.

402
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,387
Over where?

403
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:48,850
Over down here.

404
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,551
I'm trying to decide if this is a yellow light

405
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:54,091
or a red light situation.

406
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:58,446
You only wish I was still sexually harassing you.

407
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:02,069
So,uh,Gibbs wants us to figure out how so much CO

408
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,653
got pumped into the vehicle's cabin.

409
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:06,017
Okay,first of all,McGee,his name...

410
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,210
is Otto.

411
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:09,537
O-T-T-O. It's a palindrome.

412
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:10,218
And second...

413
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:14,585
he is so much more than a vehicle.

414
00:17:14,596 --> 00:17:16,421
I've never seen programming like this.

415
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:18,764
It's complex,elegant,

416
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,453
visionary.It's way out of my league.

417
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:22,008
You?

418
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,856
I got lost about 50 lines in.

419
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:26,039
Seabrook was operating at a whole different level.

420
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,755
If they used the A.I. to sabotage

421
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,096
or redirect the exhaust into

422
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:31,384
the ventilation system,

423
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,106
that could take us months to track.

424
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,695
Make sure you tell Gibbs that.

425
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:36,366
I did.

426
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:39,071
I told him we needed help from the Azeon people.

427
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,359
How? Right now they're all suspects.

428
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,909
That's what he said.

429
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:44,119
Great.

430
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:46,110
Well,how long did he give us this time?

431
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,182
Today.

432
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,234
This is completely unacceptable.

433
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:51,911
When do we get our vehicle back?

434
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:52,890
When we're done with it.

435
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,045
Doing what?

436
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:56,646
Figuring out how it was used to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.

437
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,521
Are all NCIS agents this stupid.

438
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:00,500
Mr. Engler,

439
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:02,436
insulting our guest

440
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,245
won't bring Otto back here any sooner.

441
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:06,379
Of course.

442
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:08,105
My apologies.

443
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,657
How long will it take for you to figure out

444
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:12,416
Roni killed herself, Agent Gibbs?

445
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:13,571
Who said she killed herself?

446
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:16,040
She was the only one down here this morning!

447
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,624
You mean except for you.

448
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,004
Torsten...

449
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:20,863
take a break.

450
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:22,364
I'll handle this.

451
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:24,052
Well,you better,Russell.

452
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:26,433
He's jeopardizing the entire future of this company.

453
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,092
What he was trying to say was that this...

454
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,011
proof-of-concept test

455
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:37,590
is make-or-break time for us, agent Gibbs.

456
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:38,459
Reschedule it.

457
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:39,625
I tried.

458
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:42,501
The D.O.D. won't budge on the dates.

459
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:45,195
Dozens of teams are flying in from all over the world.

460
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:48,049
Then you better help me find Lieutenant Seabrook's killer.

461
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,391
Where's your chief mechanic?

462
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:50,804
Jamie?

463
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,955
No. No,not possible.

464
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:55,687
He got along very well with Roni.

465
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:56,864
They were very good friends.

466
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,712
He sexually assaulted her in his garage last night.

467
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,466
That's definitely yellow light.

468
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,270
Cytology tests take 72 hours,but...

469
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:12,519
Dr. House gets his results back in ten minutes.

470
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,344
It's ridiculous.

471
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:14,456
In the entertainment world, they call that

472
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,150
"suspension of disbelief," actually.

473
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,094
Tony!

474
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:19,880
What are you doing here?

475
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:21,701
Oh,well,I was in the area,

476
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,479
and I thought I would, uh,drop this off.

477
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:25,777
You found it.

478
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:26,926
Yes,I did.

479
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:27,971
Thank you.

480
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:30,291
Uh,who's the guy molesting your neck...

481
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:31,853
- over there.
- Oh.

482
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:33,216
Just... curious.

483
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:35,427
Am I detecting a little bit of jealousy here?

484
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:37,775
Me?

485
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:39,975
Jealous? Yeah.

486
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:40,915
Who was he?

487
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,180
He's gay.

488
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:43,780
Okay. Good.

489
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,771
What's next,insisting that I...

490
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,322
can't see other people?

491
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:49,917
Oh,no,that would...

492
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,522
that would just be cruel.

493
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,110
You're the one who was too busy to see me last night.

494
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:55,844
Yeah,and I'll make it up to you.

495
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:57,098
When?

496
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:58,638
Tomorrow.

497
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:01,030
I promise.

498
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:02,597
Promise?

499
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:07,678
What's that, marking your territory?

500
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,844
Oh,just a reminder.

501
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:10,559
Just until you make good on your promise.

502
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:34,228
Looks like she did

503
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:36,472
<i>a Trading Spaces with John Nash.</i>

504
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:38,089
Russell Crowe played him in

505
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,710
<i>A Beautiful Mind, that Ron Howard movie</i>

506
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:40,932
about the insane mathematician?

507
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:44,150
What kind of tests are you getting done?

508
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,677
Why,you worried about me?

509
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,063
You're keeping a paper bag filled

510
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:48,927
with crap in your desk, what do you think?

511
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:52,826
I think you should go and check the bedroom.

512
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:54,014
That is...

513
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:57,480
unless you want me to come with you...

514
00:20:57,835 --> 00:20:58,363
and help.

515
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:01,866
What?

516
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,551
Just wondering if offering to take me to a bedroom

517
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:09,141
constitutes sexual harassment.

518
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,137
Well,if you have to ask, then it's not

519
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:13,254
- harassment.
- Tony! Get in here!

520
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:17,130
I just found Jamie Jones.

521
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,157
Untie me!

522
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:28,453
What do you think,Tony?

523
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:31,747
Well,you saw the video of him assaulting Lieutenant Seabrook.

524
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:33,237
Doesn't explain how he ended up

525
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:35,640
tied to her bedposts with a ball gag in his mouth.

526
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,208
Well,have you ever heard of accomplices?

527
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:42,410
Oh.

528
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:44,488
Tony.

529
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,209
Am I catching you at a bad time?

530
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:48,276
Uh,what can I do for you?

531
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:50,322
Tomorrow night, I was thinking sushi.

532
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:52,093
There's a great new place in Georgetown.

533
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:53,016
Okay.

534
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:55,106
Well,don't sound so excited.

535
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:56,448
I'm at work.

536
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:58,504
But,right,got it.

537
00:21:59,208 --> 00:21:59,560
Okay.

538
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:06,850
What part of inappropriate
touching don't you understand?

539
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,193
Uni Hospital?

540
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,030
Test results came back already?

541
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:15,038
I'm pregnant.

542
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,149
McGee's gonna be very proud.

543
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:19,651
What are you looking at?

544
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:21,554
Keep an eye on the jumpsuit.

545
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:29,016
This Seabrook's got a
bunch of MP3 files on here.

546
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,199
All created over the last 24 hours.

547
00:22:31,353 --> 00:22:33,140
You think she was illegally downloading?

548
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,494
No. They were recorded with
the laptop's microphone.

549
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,592
I think she was making
verbal observations

550
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:39,871
while running her tests.

551
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:43,373
I'm gonna line up the time-stamps.

552
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:45,177
She might have made a
recording while she was dying.

553
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,976
So,she was in the passenger seat.

554
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:49,774
Probably...

555
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:52,416
buckled her seat belt.

556
00:22:54,747 --> 00:22:56,149
Now,if she was tied to something,

557
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,511
what would she be tied to?

558
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:05,042
McGee!

559
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:06,160
McGee!

560
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:07,698
McGee!

561
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:12,725
McGee!

562
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,883
McGee,help me!

563
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:32,692
McGee!

564
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,966
McGee!

565
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:35,543
Help!

566
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:39,954
It won't open. The kill switch.

567
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:46,551
Cover your face!

568
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:56,249
Permission to hug you.

569
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:58,049
You never have to ask,Abby.

570
00:23:58,615 --> 00:23:59,116
What happened?

571
00:23:59,205 --> 00:23:59,908
Get the chair.

572
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:02,024
I almost bought the farm,McGee.

573
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,053
I even saw that old lady
telling me to run to the light.

574
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:08,476
Boss,my back was only
turned for a few seconds.

575
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:10,108
A few mores seconds,McGee,
she'd be dead.

576
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:10,750
You okay?

577
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:12,711
Yeah,I'm really lightheaded.

578
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:13,584
Boss?

579
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:15,143
Evidence cage called in an...

580
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:16,262
- emergency alert...?
- It was me,DiNozzo.

581
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,962
Stand down.

582
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,535
You attacked the car?

583
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,745
The car tried to kill Abby.

584
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:22,204
I think there was a short.

585
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:24,683
When I tried to unbuckle my seat belt,

586
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:27,220
it pinned me back and the windows shut

587
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:28,635
and the engines started.

588
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:30,545
It triggered all the doors

589
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:31,700
in the car to lock.

590
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,896
And then the whole cabin
filled up with exhaust.

591
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:36,616
A few minutes more, I would've been

592
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:38,447
singing hymns with my angels right how.

593
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:40,347
Abby,I'd have noticed before then.

594
00:24:41,628 --> 00:24:43,098
Then I would've hugged you,McGee.

595
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:45,702
So Lieutenant Seabrook was
killed by a malfunction?

596
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:47,898
Too many variables.

597
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:49,207
It was deliberate.

598
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:51,468
The lieutenant was set
up to look like suicide.

599
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,786
I think it's time you had a
heart-to-heart with Jones,boss.

600
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:55,494
How'd he do it?

601
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:58,367
It's not a damn quiz,McGee!

602
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,983
Find out!

603
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:00,194
On it.

604
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:01,815
What'd you say to Jones?

605
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,036
Nothing. He's been asking
about Lieutenant Seabrook.

606
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,606
Acting like she's still alive.

607
00:25:07,494 --> 00:25:08,704
Come on,Ducky's checking you out.

608
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:09,658
I'm fine,I just...

609
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,041
It's not a request,Abby.

610
00:25:20,515 --> 00:25:21,376
This is not good.

611
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:26,450
Look,this is all just a big
misunderstanding,Agent Gibbs.

612
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:29,408
All you have to do is
call one phone number,man.

613
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:34,445
Lawyer?

614
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:35,601
No.

615
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:36,442
Roni.

616
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,736
Look,I know what it must
have looked like back

617
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:40,616
at her apartment but...

618
00:25:43,017 --> 00:25:44,783
Lieutenant Seabrook's
your girlfriend now?

619
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:46,594
Yeah.

620
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:48,789
Look,we worked together
for a few years,we started

621
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,022
dating maybe six months back.

622
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:50,529
Dating?

623
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:51,313
Yeah.

624
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:02,655
What's that look like?

625
00:26:04,244 --> 00:26:05,503
It's a stupid game,man.

626
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:07,814
Only when we're alone.

627
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:11,455
You like games,Jones?

628
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:14,415
We're just role playing, all right?

629
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:16,225
It's not like we're freaks.

630
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:19,911
Am I going to lose my security clearance

631
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:20,386
- over this...?
- Hey,...

632
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:22,781
you almost killed one
of my people today!

633
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:23,549
What?

634
00:26:23,555 --> 00:26:25,732
That damn Humvee you used
to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.

635
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:27,642
Roni... What the hell
are you talking about?

636
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,937
Roni is downstairs,Jones!

637
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:31,706
On a steel slab!

638
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,607
This is one of her jokes,right?

639
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,199
Is she behind the glass?

640
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:41,967
Huh?

641
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,620
Because if you are,Roni,

642
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,730
this isn't funny!

643
00:26:58,755 --> 00:26:59,256
Roni...

644
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:05,057
...tell me it's not real.

645
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,064
I did it,Abby.

646
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,159
I know how they got in.

647
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,176
How'd you know I was here?

648
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:30,601
I didn't.

649
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:36,826
Abby,I'm sorry for...

650
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:37,336
I know.

651
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:50,136
Thought you were supposed
to ask for permission first.

652
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:53,504
Never with you,Tim.

653
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:00,759
He's telling the truth.

654
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,786
Just a quick test run

655
00:28:02,787 --> 00:28:04,500
and she's coming right back to him.

656
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:07,618
Yeah. Gibbs.

657
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:10,237
Right with you,Abs.

658
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,305
The reason that we couldn't
find how they hacked

659
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,022
the AI program was they didn't.

660
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:18,434
They snuck in

661
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:19,918
before the system was even on-line.

662
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:21,209
Makes sense.

663
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:23,257
There were a series of commands inserted

664
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:25,251
into the flash memory
of the BIOS at boot-up.

665
00:28:25,418 --> 00:28:27,122
They waited until the
conditions were met,

666
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,151
and the,bam, killer car syndrome.

667
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,007
Once executed, they purged from memory.

668
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:32,583
The only trace left, an extra space

669
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:34,044
on one of the mother board's bio chips.

670
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,118
Figured it'd be something like that.

671
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:38,092
Right.

672
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:41,068
We know the program was flashed from a

673
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:43,026
physical device that
was tied into the system.

674
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:44,718
Memory stick. SD card.

675
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,759
We just need to find it.

676
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:47,325
And when we do,we'll
have the killer code

677
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,413
and a clue to who wrote it.

678
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,168
I think we lost him.

679
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:52,847
We need to try it again but slower.

680
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:54,349
So what you're saying, for example,

681
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,157
is we need to find something this small

682
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:57,659
in a Humvee jammed with

683
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,428
$22 million worth of electronics.

684
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:00,863
Pretty much.

685
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:04,295
We're screwed.

686
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,937
Now that is an excellent point.

687
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,647
You wanted to see me?

688
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,090
You have plans tonight,Tony.

689
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:17,164
Actually no. Tomorrow,I'm going to...

690
00:29:17,228 --> 00:29:18,409
It wasn't a question.

691
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,240
We've had these three under observation

692
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:23,325
ever since you tagged
their bags at the airport.

693
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,785
They made reservations
for dinner tonight here.

694
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:29,119
The reservation is for four.

695
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:31,257
I want to know who they're meeting with.

696
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:32,278
Excellent.

697
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:34,750
I've always wanted to try
the food at this place,

698
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:36,696
but it's a little
outside of my price range.

699
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:38,450
You won't be inside.

700
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:40,518
We couldn't risk them
I.D.'ing you as the

701
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,246
baggage handler from the airport.

702
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:44,106
So what's the plan?

703
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:47,814
We're going to take a more
covert approach on this one.

704
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:51,606
Oh,I ever tell you
covert's my middle name?

705
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:56,242
* In my perspective *

706
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:01,684
* I see the people
from the big jet plane *

707
00:30:02,563 --> 00:30:05,665
* The woman looks Teutonic,
she drinks a vodka tonic *

708
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:08,233
* And two bald men sit with her *

709
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,105
* Waiting for a fourth *

710
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:14,139
* They're not going to
order that main course *

711
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,609
* Until that person come... *

712
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,416
Hey...

713
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,121
Everybody's a critic.

714
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:21,312
Am-scray.

715
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:22,699
Get out of here.

716
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:29,876
Keep your eyes on the
prize, Tango Eight.

717
00:30:29,877 --> 00:30:31,848
I may even let you keep
the money you're making.

718
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:36,215
* Sorry,I just do what I can... *

719
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,561
You're not going to sing
the whole thing,are you?

720
00:30:38,562 --> 00:30:41,451
* I gotta do what I gotta do *

721
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:44,732
* I'm just a man *

722
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:46,963
* Oh,speaking of man *

723
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,404
* Another man walks
through that front door *

724
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,812
* Wearing a polka-dot scarf *

725
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,865
* Will he join the table? I don't know *

726
00:30:56,122 --> 00:31:00,027
* Yes,he does and greets the
pretty lady, what do they say? *

727
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,044
* Who knows *

728
00:31:01,282 --> 00:31:02,637
* He's sitting at the table

729
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:05,077
* With the other people from the plane *

730
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,011
Stay steady on the target, Tango 8.

731
00:31:08,012 --> 00:31:08,884
I want his photo.

732
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,226
Isolate and freeze-frame.

733
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:14,198
* They are having a conversation *

734
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:17,373
* A heavy,heavy conversation *

735
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,663
* That man
talk,a-talk,a-talk a lot *

736
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:22,782
* Talk,a-talk,a-talk
a lot *

737
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:26,538
* Jenny,think I've been made *

738
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:29,280
* Do you see what I see? *

739
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:30,500
Relax,Tango 8.

740
00:31:30,782 --> 00:31:33,409
I'm sure he's just checking
his reflection in the glass.

741
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:38,290
Hey,what was that movie

742
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,044
where they took the whole car apart?

743
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:41,392
I am not Tony.

744
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:43,725
Come on. You know the one.
They were looking for heroin

745
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:45,664
and they took apart that entire car?

746
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:46,830
Still not Tony.

747
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:57,379
Abby,I think I found it.

748
00:32:07,723 --> 00:32:09,016
That's it. That's the kill program.

749
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,774
Yes!

750
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:11,142
That's a good job.

751
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:13,620
Now put it back together.

752
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,181
As in "now."

753
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,706
Gibbs,what's the rush?

754
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:21,235
The Director just assured
the Secretary of The Navy

755
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:23,249
we were handling this
thing with kid gloves.

756
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,642
Well,we didn't get that memo

757
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:25,139
'cause...

758
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:25,935
you know,...

759
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:27,117
we're wearing latex.

760
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:29,371
Well,they want a team
from Azeon to come by,

761
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:31,012
check and make sure we
didn't break anything.

762
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:32,020
When?

763
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,445
Two hours.

764
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:36,559
Boss,it took us ten
just to take it apart.

765
00:32:37,452 --> 00:32:38,685
Yeah,that's why I brought you help.

766
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:44,080
And Roni would be in tears
if she saw Otto like this.

767
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:45,806
Can you do it or not,Jones?

768
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,402
Does he have to run?

769
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:50,987
It'd be nice.

770
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:54,455
You all right?

771
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:56,175
Define "all right."

772
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:59,980
Find out the results from
the medical tests yet?

773
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:04,166
Not yet.

774
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,248
Time's the Azeon team getting here?

775
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,187
40 minutes ago.

776
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,204
You fell asleep.

777
00:33:10,952 --> 00:33:12,862
Gibbs and Jenny are stalling
them in her office now.

778
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,839
If you've discovered the
problem with the vehicle,

779
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,036
we can fix it.

780
00:33:17,216 --> 00:33:17,934
Wasn't a problem.

781
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:19,116
It was sabotage.

782
00:33:20,053 --> 00:33:20,652
By whom?

783
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,295
An expert in artificial intelligence.

784
00:33:23,744 --> 00:33:25,050
Then it wasn't Jamie.

785
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:27,748
It must be one of the companies
we're competing against.

786
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:30,285
They,they know they can't
beat us in a fair fight.

787
00:33:30,386 --> 00:33:31,915
The winner of the drive-off

788
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,972
gets the entire D.O.D. contract,

789
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:35,891
Director Shepard, not just the Navy's.

790
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,060
The Navy's banking on you, Doctor.

791
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:40,443
It's why I've agreed to
the Secretary's request

792
00:33:40,444 --> 00:33:42,022
that you visually inspect Otto.

793
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:42,938
When?

794
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,528
Right how if you'd like.

795
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:50,011
Agent Gibbs, would
you mind escorting us?

796
00:34:15,192 --> 00:34:15,969
Where is Otto?

797
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:18,816
Gibbs?

798
00:34:28,273 --> 00:34:31,497
We have let a robot-killer Humvee loose

799
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:33,741
on the streets of Washington.

800
00:34:33,754 --> 00:34:36,525
Uh,technically,Director,
it's a second-generation,

801
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:38,244
- fully...
-I don't care what it's called!

802
00:34:38,363 --> 00:34:40,344
Find it! Fast.

803
00:34:45,354 --> 00:34:46,846
BOLO,on it,boss.

804
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,116
I'll take the Beltway!

805
00:34:49,774 --> 00:34:50,701
Abby and I will see

806
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,408
if we can access Otto's system remotely.

807
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:54,239
I think I might be
able to help with that.

808
00:35:00,622 --> 00:35:02,015
Someone had to send Otto

809
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:04,247
a remote command and navigational data.

810
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,519
All we have to do is find it...

811
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,190
...so we can back-trace
it to our bad guy.

812
00:35:07,262 --> 00:35:09,671
If we access the vehicle,
can we remotely operate it?

813
00:35:09,796 --> 00:35:11,220
Yeah,I've seen Roni do it before.

814
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:11,777
How?

815
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:13,958
I don't know,man. I'm
just a mechanic, all right?

816
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:15,772
All this A.I. stuff is
way out of my league.

817
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:17,706
Okay,what's your job during test runs?

818
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:18,645
I monitor stuff like

819
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:20,595
tire pressure, fuel injectors...

820
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:21,101
How?

821
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:22,618
I have my own program.

822
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:24,516
I mean,I could try...

823
00:35:24,548 --> 00:35:24,917
Do it.

824
00:35:25,784 --> 00:35:26,290
All right.

825
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:28,488
But even if I can get
in, all I can tell you

826
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:30,360
is stuff like oil
pressure and fuel levels.

827
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:32,518
Navigation,external sensors,

828
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,771
that's all handled by scientists.

829
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:40,382
All right,I'm in. Now what?

830
00:35:40,968 --> 00:35:42,899
Just sit back and let the scientists....

831
00:35:42,902 --> 00:35:44,752
...kick all kinds of major ass.

832
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:53,565
Roni would've really liked you guys.

833
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,098
Okay,Abby,we're in sync.

834
00:36:00,178 --> 00:36:01,764
You are now following
the same stream back

835
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:03,080
into Otto as Jamie's program.

836
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:05,326
Jamie,

837
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:07,590
what's the most complex
sensor you monitor with this?

838
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:09,291
I'd say fuel injectors.

839
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,530
And when something goes
wrong, do you just monitor it,

840
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:12,920
or is there something
you can actually do?

841
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:14,375
I have the ability to tweak

842
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:15,944
some of the parameters
to avoid engine damage.

843
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:17,711
That's our way in. Is
that program on here,too?

844
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:18,927
Yes...

845
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:20,103
it's right there.

846
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,855
Great. Before we were just receiving.

847
00:36:23,344 --> 00:36:24,590
Now we can send. Tweak something.

848
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:26,350
All right. What?

849
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:26,992
It doesn't matter.

850
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,333
I just need to follow it

851
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:29,490
downstream back into Otto.

852
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:31,872
Okay. Um...

853
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:35,190
How's that?

854
00:36:38,623 --> 00:36:39,217
I'm in.

855
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:42,740
Pull up the navigation subdirectory.

856
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:47,050
Accessing Otto's onboard GPS.

857
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:50,220
It's stopped.

858
00:36:50,361 --> 00:36:53,102
It's right off Route 123 in Fairfax.

859
00:36:53,174 --> 00:36:53,848
Go,McGee.

860
00:36:54,314 --> 00:36:55,557
I'll keep working on back-tracing

861
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:56,445
the guy who sent him there.

862
00:37:13,576 --> 00:37:14,186
Clear!

863
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,720
They took our chip,boss.

864
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:21,778
Hey,McGee,when I told
you to put this car back

865
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:23,283
together I didn't mean put it back

866
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,732
together with the only piece of evidence

867
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:25,695
we have on the killer.

868
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:26,433
I didn't.

869
00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:28,576
We put in a copy.
Abby's got the original.

870
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:30,527
Otto has five stereo cameras.

871
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:32,268
Hoping one of them got
a picture of our guy.

872
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:36,229
We're definitely dealing
with someone on the inside.

873
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,975
He knew where all of
Otto's cameras were.

874
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:39,536
The only shot I got is this.

875
00:37:40,543 --> 00:37:42,309
This thing takes worse
pictures than you do,McGee.

876
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,797
They went to a lot of trouble
to get the chip back. Why?

877
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:47,092
Like you said, It's the
only evidence we have.

878
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,496
They know we can link it to 'em. How?

879
00:37:49,874 --> 00:37:51,675
There weren't any prints on the surface.

880
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,208
The program's in assembly language.

881
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:53,870
I'm not sure.

882
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:57,567
Yeah. Gibbs.

883
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,550
I back-traced the connection
used to activate Otto.

884
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:01,666
They're in Azeon's network.

885
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:02,660
They're online right now.

886
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:04,952
I even have their... Gibbs?

887
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:09,958
Don't worry,Jamie. We
are going to get this guy.

888
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:15,855
You're sure about this, Agent Gibbs?

889
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:17,994
We sure about this,McGee?

890
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:20,577
Abby gave me the specific I.P. address

891
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:22,290
for the computer used to access Otto.

892
00:38:22,446 --> 00:38:23,580
I'll know it when I find it.

893
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:27,264
Which one was it?

894
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:28,633
We're working on it.

895
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:36,003
Boss?

896
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:38,167
I.P. address matches this one.

897
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:40,028
Engler.

898
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:45,764
You're bastard! You killed her!

899
00:38:45,796 --> 00:38:46,890
Get him off me!

900
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:48,910
What's the matter? You
couldn't share the limelight?!

901
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,222
Why would I kill Seabrook?!

902
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,465
You've been jealous of Roni
from the moment you met her.

903
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:54,487
That's ridiculous!

904
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:56,555
If anything, she was jealous of me.

905
00:38:57,282 --> 00:38:59,961
I demand to know what
proof you have against me.

906
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,763
This.

907
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:06,551
A flash chip?

908
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:08,444
It was used to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.

909
00:39:08,631 --> 00:39:10,424
The one you took from
the vehicle was a copy.

910
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:12,672
Then let me see the code.

911
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:15,204
Everyone here has their
own specific style.

912
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:17,520
I can tell you with
certainty who wrote that one.

913
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,540
As can
I,Engler-- may I?

914
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,717
You're mistaken, Agent Gibbs,

915
00:39:38,516 --> 00:39:39,645
this chip is blank.

916
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:42,879
Let him go.

917
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,743
Boss?

918
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:47,050
Let him go, he's the
one who found Seabrook.

919
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:49,211
If he wanted the chip back,

920
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:50,743
he would have taken it
before anyone got there.

921
00:39:52,895 --> 00:39:53,693
Dr. Pike...

922
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,905
The only thing you erased from this chip

923
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:01,825
are my photos.

924
00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:08,237
The real chip is in the
evidence locker at NCIS.

925
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:11,142
She thought of you like a father!

926
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:13,967
She was supposed to
take the morning off,

927
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:14,693
Jamie.

928
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,124
It was an accident.

929
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:20,339
I would never...

930
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:21,164
never...

931
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:23,171
Who was supposed to
drive Otto that morning?

932
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:26,722
Me.

933
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:28,533
You...

934
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:30,990
senile old fool,

935
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:32,642
you were trying to kill me.

936
00:40:32,893 --> 00:40:34,393
I did it for all of us.

937
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:36,412
He owns half the company.

938
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:38,570
When Otto wins that race,

939
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:41,347
we would have been stuck
working with him forever.

940
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,494
Nobody deserves that.

941
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:45,524
You smug bastard.

942
00:40:45,724 --> 00:40:47,567
I'll never?????????? on this

943
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:48,572
Look...

944
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,261
If "red light" is for
sexually assaulting

945
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:53,500
a coworker,what color is for murder?

946
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:55,578
How's "black light" sound?

947
00:40:56,424 --> 00:40:57,078
Works for me.

948
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:10,192
Hey.

949
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,458
It's late; go home.

950
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:14,852
Just doing a little research.

951
00:41:15,403 --> 00:41:15,845
On what?

952
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:17,908
Y. Pestis.

953
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:20,597
A very nasty illness.

954
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,495
It can cause permanent damage
to the heart,lungs and kidneys,

955
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:26,378
and in some cases, patients can relapse

956
00:41:26,379 --> 00:41:28,756
months or even years later.

957
00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:30,519
Tony had it.

958
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:32,757
I know,Ziva,I was there.

959
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,037
Did you know that he had
some tests done recently?

960
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:38,861
and he's been wearing a
hospital bracelet on his wrist.

961
00:41:40,393 --> 00:41:40,940
No.

962
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:43,621
I asked him why, but he won't tell me.

963
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:46,909
And he's probably got
a pretty good reason.&

964
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:07,890
So,uh... can I take this off now?

965
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:12,468
I haven't made up my mind yet.

966
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,434
Okay.

967
00:42:14,304 --> 00:42:16,123
You do know that it's
for the psych ward,right?

968
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:18,588
Oh,yeah.

969
00:42:18,987 --> 00:42:20,775
I picked it out special for you.
