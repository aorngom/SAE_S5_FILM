1
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,230
Oh, crap.

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,830
You gotta be kidding me.

3
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,300
Hello?

4
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,729
I'm from next door.

5
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,205
I locked myself out.

6
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,445
Uh, I just need you to call the front desk.

7
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,731
Hello?

8
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:05,564
Holy Mother of God.

14
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,070
Ziva, I'm not secretive.

15
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,299
Did you hear that, Tony?

16
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,929
McGee just said he's not secretive.

17
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,169
Hmm, let's see: Wrote a novel.

18
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,569
- Didn't tell us.
- Got it published.

19
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,369
- Didn't tell us.
- Made substantial amounts of money

20
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,899
- from said novel.
- Hmm, didn't tell us.

21
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,369
- Anything else?
- Bought a Porsche.

22
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,369
Didn't tell us. Can you see how
people might begin to think

23
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,229
there was a pattern of
secretive behavior emerging here,

24
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,269
Probie? Okay, look.

25
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,499
I might have been hiding stuff.

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,129
But it was not secretive, it was just...

27
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,299
- Deceptive?
- Sneaky?

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,000
Self-preservation.

29
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,069
If I'd told you guys I was writing a novel,

30
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,299
you would have laughed at me.

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,230
- True.
- True.

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,369
Besides, everyone has secrets.

33
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,799
I bet you two have some doozies.

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,530
No.

35
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,270
Ha?! What 'ha'? I said 'no.'

36
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,499
You said no too quickly.

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,429
He did, didn't he?

38
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,530
What dark,

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,099
dirty little secrets do you have

40
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,705
that are making you so uncomfortable?

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,248
Does she have a name?

42
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:43,811
Lieutenant Brana SHAHEEN.

43
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:46,761
Her death is really a lost for the Marines.

44
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:47,569
Marine Corps Intelligence?

45
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,300
Three years.

46
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,769
I've personally known her for two.

47
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,999
She's an interpreter.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,129
Born in Kuwait,
emigrated when she was a kid.

49
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,970
Working anything sensitive?

50
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,569
Just routine, nothing classified
since we got back from Iraq.

51
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,078
Ironic, isn't it?

52
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:02,386
You last saw her Friday.

53
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:04,799
She said she was going to
the country for the weekend.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,649
Didn't say where.

55
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,267
I've got the impression
she was gonna meet someone.

56
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,230
<i>Edenvale.</i>

57
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,599
Where the hell is Edenvale?

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,799
Keep scrolling, probie.

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,229
I'm scrolling, I'm telling you,

60
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,499
I can't find it.

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,769
It's not on the map.

62
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,830
Boondocks.

63
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,730
Boondocks, boss.

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,969
Pack a toothbrush.

65
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,330
What are boondocks?

66
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,169
Don't get a lot of murders out here

67
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,469
in Edenvale, Agent Gibbs.

68
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,599
Got the whole town talking.

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,270
Well,

70
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,529
you all wanna come on inside,

71
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,929
I've set up the conference room for you.

72
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,629
Crime scene first, Sheriff.

73
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,269
Uh, that'd be the Edenvale, uh,

74
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,869
Motel U. S. 29. A ten-minute drive.

75
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,350
Not much to see out there, though.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,470
Except the crime scene.

77
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,930
Well, yeah, room eight.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,729
Shot twice in the chest.

79
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,670
Bled out under the door.

80
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,669
Sheriff, the sooner we
get to work on the body,

81
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,829
the sooner we'll be out of your way.

82
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,870
You wanna work on the body?

83
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,805
Preliminary examination.

84
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,500
I'll do the autopsy back at D. C.

85
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,399
Agent Gibbs, uh, I think
we have what you might call

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,630
a breakdown in communications.

87
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,630
She was found three days ago.

88
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,669
Booked in under a false name.

89
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,770
Paid cash.

90
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,669
No pocketbook, no driver's license.

91
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,670
No vehicle.

92
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,599
Took the best part of two days

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,499
to get her prints up
to Washington and processed.

94
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,529
Soon as we found out

95
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,569
she was a Marine, we called you.

96
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,670
By that time,

97
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,199
Harry had done the autopsy.

98
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,999
Harry Lawson, the coroner.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,229
He's a good man.

100
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,875
Well, I'll bet he is.

101
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,310
He's also the funeral director
and owns the furniture store.

102
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,630
Old country tradition.

103
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,099
What about the crime scene, Sheriff?

104
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,929
Uh, turned back to the motel.

105
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,030
Cleaned up?

106
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,629
And I'm guessing already occupied.

107
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,700
Evidence?

108
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,569
Oh, yeah, got plenty of that.

109
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,799
Uh, you'll wanna talk to Ruby.

110
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,229
If it was loose, I bagged it.

111
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,730
Hairs, fibers, shell casing,

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,599
gum wrappers, used tissues,

113
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,799
uh, even an old French fry the
cleaning lady must have missed.

114
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,429
It was right up under the headboard.

115
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,800
Anybody would have missed it.

116
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,469
Um, everything's been tagged,
numbered, indexed

117
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,629
and photographed.

118
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,499
I did the indexing by hand

119
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,369
on account of the printer not working.

120
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,570
Blood samples?

121
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,499
I took multiples, sent some

122
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,155
ho the lab, kept the rest as backup.

123
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,400
Sorry... my fault.

124
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,769
No, it, it does that all the time.

125
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,069
Well, that's everything.

126
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,400
Um, except

127
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,500
one teeny-tiny little thing.

128
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,070
She was shot twice.

129
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,965
But I could only find one shell casing.

130
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,769
Maybe he picked it up.

131
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,494
Yeah, maybe.

132
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,445
You said you had an office we could use?

133
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,130
Here you go.

134
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,430
Home sweet home.

135
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,269
I'll stir up some coffee for you.

136
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,450
Oh, uh, we do have a suspect.

137
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:35,529
When were you gonna tell me that?

138
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,169
Well, I'm telling you now.

139
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,130
Tyler. Yeah?

140
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,500
Bring me that

141
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,229
suspect's file, would you?

142
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,299
Yeah, the victim made one

143
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,629
phone call from the motel.

144
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,069
Local guy by the name of Masoud Tariq.

145
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,130
Only been

146
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,429
in town a few months.

147
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,469
He's an Iraqi.

148
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,669
Same as the victim.

149
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,869
She's from Kuwait, actually.

150
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,930
And where are you from?

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,300
The city.

152
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,970
Well, unfortunately, this guy

153
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,969
Masoud Tariq, he's disappeared.

154
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,229
So I got a search warrant.

155
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,629
We found her lipstick in his living room.

156
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,830
Ruby got a fingerprint match.

157
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,929
We've got a BOLO out for him,

158
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,499
but he's got a couple days start.

159
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,369
Now, he comes back, we'll catch him.

160
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,210
You need anything else, you just holler.

161
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,469
Did you see their name plates?

162
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,600
Both Barretts.

163
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,630
Brothers?

164
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Cousins?

165
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,770
Boondocks.

166
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,229
I'll take the body back to D. C.,Jethro.

167
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,669
But I'm afraid we're gonna
have to rely on this autopsy report.

168
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,829
Can't do another one?

169
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,569
Well, if I think it's necessary,

170
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,899
but there'd be so much missing
that you can't get back.

171
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,499
blood patterns, position of the body,

172
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,929
and of course you'll be missing

173
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,999
all the usual pieces that
have gone off for testing.

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,399
She comes down

175
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,769
from D. C. for the weekend,

176
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,399
books into a motel under a false name,

177
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,999
pays cash and calls a man.

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,065
Jealous spouse?

179
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,329
She's not married.

180
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,450
Neither was he.

181
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,699
Moved here six months ago.

182
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,799
Which is about the time

183
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,369
Lieutenant Shaheen got back from Iraq.

184
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,300
Nice timing.

185
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,769
DiNozzo, drive back with Ducky.

186
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,130
Talk to Lieutenant

187
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,229
Shaheen's commanding officer.

188
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,069
Find out what she was working on in Iraq.

189
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,929
Okay, back to the big city suits me, boss.

190
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,469
I got the Boondock Blues already.

191
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,030
McGee. Boss?

192
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,300
Crime scene.

193
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,199
Take that forensic woman with you.

194
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,130
Ruby.

195
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,470
Ruby, yeah.

196
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,000
Ruby.

197
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,010
Check her methodology.

198
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,129
See what she missed.

199
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,375
Maybe she didn't miss anything.

200
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,670
Right.

201
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,470
What do you need, Duck?

202
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,330
Just the body.

203
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,300
That leaves you and me...

204
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,370
with Masoud Tariq.

205
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,700
Sleepy.

206
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,600
Not quite.

207
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,700
That's Daryl Hardy.

208
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,399
the sort of nosy neighbor
gives small towns a bad name.

209
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,599
He thinks Tariq is a terrorist.

210
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,229
Like a terrorist'd ever come
live in a little town like ours.

211
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,769
He file complaints?

212
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,969
Nothing ever amounted to anything.

213
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,199
Just spread a lot of bad
feelings among people, is all.

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,729
Tariq kept out of trouble.

215
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,469
Paid his bills, obeyed the law.

216
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,629
Least up until now.

217
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,230
We're being watched.

218
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,655
That kind of town.

219
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,300
Lacking a woman's touch?

220
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Wouldn't know.

221
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,505
You wanna take mine?

222
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,629
I didn't mean anything
by what I said earlier.

223
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,230
Yes, you did.

224
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,000
You find something?

225
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,970
The sooner you leave me alone,
the sooner I'll know.

226
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,185
Well, I guess a photo can wait, huh?

227
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,470
Gibbs.

228
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,269
I think someone's been making modifications.

229
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,200
Diesel fuel.

230
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,529
And a positive indicator of nitrates.

231
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,330
Probably ammonium nitrate.

232
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,099
Mix with diesel oil and all
you have to do is add a detonator,

233
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,029
and a cell phone if you
want to set it off remotely.

234
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,520
I think we just found
ourselves a bomb factory.

235
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,959
I thought the local
constabulary searched the house.

236
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,659
Not for a bomb factory.

237
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,230
Hard to miss.

238
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,445
Maybe the neighbors were more observant.

239
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,330
You're from Washington?

240
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,699
Special Agent Gibbs.

241
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,760
NCIS.

242
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,560
NCIS? That like the FBI?

243
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,359
Navy and Marine's version.

244
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,100
About time.

245
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,430
- You found something?
- Maybe.

246
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,960
I knew it.

247
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,899
Sheriff didn't wanna know.

248
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,560
No one did.

249
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,129
It's one of them sleeper cells

250
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,599
they warn us about on the news, ain't it?

251
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,059
What makes you think that?

252
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,899
I don't think it. I know it.

253
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,430
Wait there.

254
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,229
Waste of time giving it to that son-of-a-b.

255
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,230
Here.

256
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,600
Good luck.

257
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,100
Nice neighbor?

258
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,799
He thinks he uncovered a sleeper cell.

259
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,130
- Does he have proof?
- Maybe.

260
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,200
Send it to Abby.

261
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,129
So what's your biggest secret? Shock me.

262
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,429
When I was 11 years old,

263
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,829
I had a paper route and I got sick of it.

264
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,459
So I used to hide the papers

265
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,599
and then I only deliver
to people that complained.

266
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,100
That was you?

267
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,560
No, I mean

268
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,659
like a certain probie who secretly

269
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,799
wrote a not-so- secret bestseller.

270
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,400
Oh, you mean a MOAS.

271
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,699
Like a mother of all secrets. Yeah.

272
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,899
Everybody has one.

273
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,529
I'm not going to tell you mine.
What's yours?

274
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,330
Ha! Nice try.

275
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,160
I'm sitting on my MOAS.

276
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,829
I thought there was only one shooter?

277
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,499
So did the Boondock Probie.

278
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,260
Maybe she was wrong.

279
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, find out soon enough.

280
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,099
How do you live with
the Mother Of All Secrets?

281
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,160
You don't.

282
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,329
It consumes you.

283
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,899
It eats you like a cancer, from the inside.

284
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,100
First there's the guilt.

285
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,999
And then there's the excruciating urge

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,829
to blab your secret, although you know

287
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,860
that it's gonna spell your doom.

288
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,599
Have you gotten at that stage yet?

289
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,059
No. It's a hypothetical
situation we're talking about.

290
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,775
You're still in the guilt stage, huh?

291
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,929
And then, you know, eventually,

292
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,059
you can't take it anymore,
it drives you insane,

293
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,699
so you blab your secret

294
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,959
to your best friend or your mother

295
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,599
or your lover and it sets you free.

296
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
- It does?
- Yeah.

297
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,459
Of course, you lose all your friends

298
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,159
and your family and maybe even your job

299
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,699
depending on what the secret is, but, yeah.

300
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,330
Great.

301
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,760
Masoud Tariq has another name:

302
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,100
Wasim Al Fulani.

303
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,330
Oh, this is bad.

304
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,499
He was in the Republican Guard.

305
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,045
Yeah, it's a long way
from Baghdad to Edenvale.

306
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I hate giving Gibbs bad news.

307
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,960
Yeah, got it.

308
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,599
He dropped off the planet,
like, two years ago, boss.

309
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,299
Ziva just sent over photos
of two men with Tariq

310
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,699
both Middle Eastern, same deal.

311
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,260
"Masoud Tariq" is an alias.

312
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,159
His real name is Wasim Al Fulani,

313
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,059
former captain, Republican Guard,

314
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,699
disappeared off the radar two years ago.

315
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,999
Hmm, we know where
he's been for the past six months.

316
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,929
Just need to figure out where he is now.

317
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,410
Yeah, and whether he packed a bag.

318
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,099
Okay, thanks for the bad news.

319
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,930
Yeah. Bye.

320
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,499
They found explosive
residue in Tariq's garage.

321
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,899
Well, that's not good.

322
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,929
Yeah, I dusted for prints in that garage.

323
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,529
Well, sometimes we miss things.

324
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,859
Like that second shell
casing we still can't find

325
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,900
and probably never will?

326
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,900
This is my first.

327
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,500
- First?
- Murder.

328
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,829
I'd only ever done break-ins
and stolen cars.

329
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,429
We get a lot of stolen cars in Edenvale.

330
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,400
I bet.

331
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,130
I'm so excited.

332
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,380
My first murder.

333
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,159
I mean, it's sad and everything, but...

334
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,759
No, it's okay to be excited.

335
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,199
Helps us do our job.

336
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,259
Well, it sure didn't help me, did it?

337
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,530
Look, you might've missed something, okay?

338
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,429
But, next time, you might see something

339
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,629
that someone else doesn't.

340
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,129
And they might see something that you don't.

341
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,060
You can't do it all.

342
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,399
Can't be right every time, Ruby.

343
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,160
I'd settle for just once.

344
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,299
Never thought I'd see a grown man so happy

345
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,359
to break a hundred.

346
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,859
This coming from the girl who rolled

347
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,360
an 86.

348
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,500
Eighty-nine.

349
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,400
Whatever.

350
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,600
Competitive. I like it.

351
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,759
I have a question to ask you. Yeah?

352
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,929
What are the chances of my
sneaking you away for a little dinner?

353
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,930
Two of the interns called in sick, so...

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,760
Whoo, that's not good.

355
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,659
You look cold and we can't
have you getting sick.

356
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,259
Mm-hmm. There... it's a little chilly.

357
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,325
And it's a good thing that I am prepared.

358
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,030
<i>Signorina...</i>

359
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,830
What are you doing?

360
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,629
It's easier than it looks.

361
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,900
Yeah, okay...

362
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,600
This is not a sundial.

363
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
There we go.

364
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,760
What is all this?

365
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,900
This, Miss Benoit, is a Penne

366
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,160
a la DiNardo.

367
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,529
I don't know what to say.

368
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,730
Well...

369
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,059
<i>you could say, Grazie,</i>

370
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,159
"you're a god among men,

371
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,930
a prince among thieves."

372
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,890
This is like a scene from an old movie.

373
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,699
Wait a second is this
a scene from an old movie?

374
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,360
Uh, well, that really depends.

375
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,760
On...?

376
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,299
Have you ever seen a movie called

377
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,799
<i>Strangers in the Night, with Cary Grant?</i>

378
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,999
No, I don't think so.

379
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,029
Then no, this is a completely original idea

380
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,625
that I came up with, all by myself.

381
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,530
It's not even close, Abigail.

382
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,800
<i>Shalom.</i>

383
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,130
Morning.

384
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,529
You brew that in your room?

385
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,860
Yeah.

386
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,574
You know, it's not even real coffee.

387
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:28,429
It's coffee.

388
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,529
I read the label.

389
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,529
"Roasted chicory," whatever that is.

390
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,599
It's a flower.

391
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,059
It's got a taproot like a dandelion.

392
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,429
Dried and roasted, it makes
for a cheap coffee substitute.

393
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,959
Well, that's what you're drinking,

394
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,529
cheap motel coffee substitute.

395
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,559
Does that smell like
a cheap coffee substitute?

396
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,199
- Well, you brew it in your room.
- Well, yes, I did.

397
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,899
With my own grind that I brought from home.

398
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,459
You bring your own
coffee grind on investigations?

399
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,940
Only on overnighters.

400
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,099
Did you hear from Tony last night?

401
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,400
No.

402
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,115
How about this morning?

403
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,359
The only reason I'm asking you

404
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,699
is because I called him
last night to update him

405
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,099
and he didn't pick up the phone.

406
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,729
He didn't answer this morning either.

407
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,000
Ah, you two got married and didn't tell me.

408
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,260
No. I know this may sound a bit strange,

409
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,229
coming from me, but...

410
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,259
More than a bit, Ziva.

411
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,730
He's my partner,

412
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,159
and I'm concerned. Yeah, okay. So?

413
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,059
So you sent him back for other reasons

414
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,164
than to question Lieutenant
Shaheen's commanding officer.

415
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:25,175
Did I miss the announcement?

416
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:30,030
No, I was not made Director of NCIS.

417
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,599
I was thinking more like
Secretary of the Navy,

418
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,499
because the Director of
NCIS would know damn well

419
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,429
not to ask me such a stupid question.

420
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,429
Look, Tony's been very
secretive lately, and for a man

421
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,529
who can't keep what
he had for breakfast a secret,

422
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,899
I think it's scary.

423
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,699
What's scary is your persistence.

424
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,530
Sorry!

425
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,285
So the only reason you sent
him back was what you said...

426
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,230
Can I talk bullets?

427
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,199
No, you can't, but you
can listen to me talk bullets.

428
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,999
Now, the first bullet, bullet "A".

429
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,700
Yes, that's it

430
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,329
it penetrated the body here,
just below the rib cage.

431
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,600
All soft tissue, no bone.

432
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,799
But once it punched through the skin,

433
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,030
it stopped no kinetic energy.

434
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,425
Unlike bullet "B".

435
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,459
Yeah, that's the little devil

436
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,459
which according to this,

437
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,359
punched right through the sternum,

438
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,059
gouged its way through the heart muscle,

439
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,529
took a chip out of the eighth

440
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,699
thoracic vertebrae

441
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,759
and finally sputtered to a stop

442
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,999
in Lieutenant Shaheen's
right latissimus dorsi.

443
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,120
In other words,

444
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,699
it did exactly what it was designed to do

445
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,059
in all its brutal efficiency.

446
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,129
Which begs the question, Abby...

447
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,159
How were they fired from the same weapon?

448
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,729
Yeah, one high velocity, one low velocity.

449
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,859
I was thinking, could it be a ricochet?

450
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,959
No, there were no
layer deposits on the slug,

451
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,329
so it didn't hit anything. Ah.

452
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,729
And their weight and lead
composition's the same,

453
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,529
but it's almost as if...

454
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,299
...it was fired from another weapon.

455
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,999
And if it was a revolver,

456
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,800
that would explain finding only one casing.

457
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,799
Two weapons means two shooters, Duck.

458
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,259
I don't think Gibbs is going

459
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,985
to appreciate me doubling his workload.

460
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,860
Morning.

461
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,640
So, you going to call 'em or will I?

462
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,900
The FBI.

463
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,959
I'm beginning to think
Daryl Hardy was right, after all.

464
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,529
Still NCIS jurisdiction.

465
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,400
Till he sets off a bomb in the local mall.

466
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,099
That'd be a good time for it to be

467
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,890
under someone else's jurisdiction,
wouldn't you say?

468
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,030
That's him. That's Tariq!

469
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,560
Stop right there!

470
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,325
Cease fire!

471
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,030
Hey! Cease fire!

472
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,560
Put it down!

473
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,559
Hey... it's a circus out there.

474
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,619
Every deputy in the county
is either in the E. R.,

475
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,719
the building or the parking lot.

476
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,319
Everyone loves a shooting.

477
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,489
Except the shootee.

478
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,520
Is that a word?

479
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,389
Sounds like a word. Do you want to spell?

480
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,360
S- H-O-O-T-E-E.

481
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,659
No, no, no, no, no. Uh,"spell: as in "rest."

482
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,015
Oh, no. Thank you.

483
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,859
They're going to hold him here
for a couple of hours, then we're

484
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,589
moving him back to D. C.

485
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,389
Check his clothes and
the pickup for explosive residue.

486
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,155
I can get Ruby to help.

487
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,320
Or not.

488
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,760
Did you shoot me?

489
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,860
No.

490
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,460
Did she? No.

491
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,660
Sheriff Barrett?

492
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,790
Possibly.

493
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,020
His brother?

494
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,490
Probably.

495
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,860
Why'd you run?

496
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,559
In Baghdad, when you see
men with guns, you go the other way.

497
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,160
It's what you do.

498
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,060
You all seemed very eager to shoot me.

499
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,320
You were armed.

500
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,400
You couldn't see it. And it was unloaded.

501
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,219
Where have you been for the past

502
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,120
four days? Deer hunting.

503
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,325
Rana Shaheen was shot dead over the weekend.

504
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,245
Right after she came
to see you in your house.

505
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,460
Of course.

506
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,519
That means I must be a murderer.

507
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,889
At least in this town.

508
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,390
I'm curious.

509
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,559
What else are they accusing me of?

510
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,159
We found traces of
explosives in your garage.

511
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,919
So now I am the monster
that scares them at night

512
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,020
Al-Qaeda come to kill them.

513
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,259
Do you believe this?

514
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,589
I don't know what to believe,

515
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,620
Wasim Al Fulani.

516
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:14,220
Lab.

517
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,989
Give me some good news, Abby.

518
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,360
I'm not pregnant.

519
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,260
Too much information.

520
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,859
I'm just kidding.
Not that there's anything wrong

521
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,989
with being pregnant; I love kids.

522
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,319
Doesn't mean that I'm trying, you know.

523
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,189
And even if I were trying, it doesn't mean

524
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,559
I know anybody
that I would want to try with.

525
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,589
Am I being trying, Gibbs?

526
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,620
Affirmative.

527
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,789
My guess is that you want to know

528
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,019
about the two guys in the photos.

529
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,759
That's a good guess, Abby.

530
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,260
Well, don't hold your breath.

531
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,089
There are three-quarter
profiles, no full face.

532
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,089
Not really good for a match.
I think we're out of luck.

533
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,689
Evidence turning up anything?

534
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,420
Um, I'm beginning to think that she was shot

535
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,759
with two different weapons.

536
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,655
They're both nine mils,
but I can't match the slugs

537
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,959
and Ducky said they hit the
body at two different velocities.

538
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,219
Like, really different.

539
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,319
Like, the difference between
a howitzer and a BB gun.

540
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,519
Maybe not that different,

541
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,819
but Ducky's really puzzled about it, too.

542
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,459
You telling me there were
two different shooters?

543
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,420
Maybe.

544
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,790
Or maybe not.

545
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,859
I haven't figured it out yet.

546
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,290
When you do, Abs...

547
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,119
You will be the first to know.

548
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,889
Actually, technically,
you'll be the second to know

549
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,959
because I'm doing the testing,

550
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,555
but you will be the second to know.

551
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,520
Gibbs?

552
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,589
We don't normally open
these files to just anyone.

553
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,260
I guess NCIS isn't "just anyone."

554
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,759
Lieutenant Shaheen had

555
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,689
a certain amount of autonomy, Agent DiNozzo.

556
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,189
Sounds like a Marine covering his butt.

557
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,689
Marine officers don't cover their butts.

558
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,059
I've uploaded the files
on the work we did in Iraq.

559
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,759
Code name was "Operation Cauldron."

560
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,060
Classification?

561
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,135
Top secret, strictly a need-to-know basis.

562
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,359
Lieutenant Shaheen
was one of the best I had.

563
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,090
You find who did this.

564
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,020
Working on it.

565
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,159
Do you have any more indicator spray?

566
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,089
I hope this doesn't count as helping you.

567
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,619
I'd hate to get you in trouble.

568
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,020
Thanks.

569
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,515
I bet he didn't even
read my evidence report.

570
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Did you read my evidence report?

571
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,320
Sorry. Not yet.

572
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,520
Not ever.

573
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,859
I promise I will read your evidence report.

574
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,360
What, and grade me?

575
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,059
Look, I'm sorry that you're
not allowed to help me.

576
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,390
It's just...

577
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,959
He doesn't trust me.

578
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,359
Well, see, he would if-if
he got to know you.

579
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,860
It's just, um, he's hard to get to know.

580
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,690
Make sure you do inside his trouser pockets.

581
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,960
People put their hands in
their pockets to get their keys

582
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,859
and the explosive residue rubs off.

583
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,190
Gonna read your evidence report.

584
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,420
I promise.

585
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,160
Yeah. Gibbs.

586
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,460
Hey, boss,

587
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,989
Lieutenant Shaheen
worked on Operation Cauldron

588
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,290
in Iraq.

589
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,959
In return for high-quality intel

590
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,189
about terrorist bombers,

591
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,690
Uncle Sam relocated informants to the U. S.

592
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,959
Kind of a witness relocation
deal for born-again bad guys.

593
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,520
Anyway, Wasim Al Fulani was one of them;

594
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,659
relocated here six months ago,
new name, passport,

595
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,789
whole nine yards.

596
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,089
Lieutenant Shaheen was his case officer.

597
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,489
Yeah, and there's something else.

598
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,789
Two other guys relocated at the same time,

599
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,589
but their computer files have been deleted.

600
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,890
Hard copies?

601
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,259
Both unaccounted for.

602
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,289
Last person to sign him out
was Lieutenant Shaheen

603
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,319
and you'll never guess when.

604
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,359
The day she went to Edenvale.

605
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,790
You guessed.

606
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,520
You're a Jew.

607
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,660
Yes.

608
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,760
Israeli?

609
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,560
Mossad, then.

610
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,119
I'm working with NCIS.

611
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,160
So, yes.

612
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,620
So, now,

613
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,930
I am as suspicious of you as you are of me.

614
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,489
Is it always going to be this way?

615
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,360
At least in our lifetime.

616
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,460
Ooh, cozy.

617
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,690
Can I help you?

618
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,920
You know, couple of
more inches to your right

619
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,420
and our martyr here
could've been living it up

620
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,489
with all those vestal virgins.

621
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,459
You know, it truly is a screwed-up religion

622
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,719
where you got to blow yourself up

623
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,520
just to get lucky.

624
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,289
When you insult his religion,
you insult mine and your own.

625
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,220
Tell him you're sorry.

626
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,660
Sorry.

627
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,089
I don't think he heard you.

628
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,060
I'm sorry.

629
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,620
Apology accepted.

630
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,890
There a problem?

631
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,059
I was telling the deputy here

632
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,715
where the bathroom was.

633
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,020
I know about Operation Cauldron.

634
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,660
Good. Then you know that
I'm not in your country illegally.

635
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,020
Lieutenant Shaheen was your case officer.

636
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,859
Yes. She was the only American
I ever met whom I trusted.

637
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,659
So you kept in touch with her?

638
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,760
No, it was forbidden.

639
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,459
I gave them information,
they gave me a new life.

640
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,019
She came to visit you

641
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,559
I did not invite her.

642
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,819
Why did she come?

643
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,659
An unmarried woman
visiting a Muslim man's home?

644
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,320
It was not for that.

645
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,619
So you were disappointed,

646
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,219
and that's why you followed
her back to the motel.

647
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,819
No. Maybe she saw something

648
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,719
in your garage you didn't want her to see.

649
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,589
A bomb perhaps, Agent Gibbs?

650
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,789
Explosives. Somebody put 'em there.

651
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,590
Not me.

652
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,359
Why don't you go talk to Mr. Hardy,
my good neighbor?

653
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,250
Maybe he put them there or saw who did.

654
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,619
My wife and daughter
were killed buying fruit

655
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,619
in a Baghdad market,

656
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,590
Agent Gibbs.

657
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,020
I've seen enough bombs.

658
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,190
That's why I did what I did.

659
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,390
That's why I left.

660
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,490
Boss, you got a minute?

661
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,460
Found something.

662
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,359
It doesn't look like
explosive residue, McGee.

663
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,620
It's Ruby's.

664
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,789
She uses a red florescent
powder to dust for prints.

665
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,320
So?

666
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,520
So we don't.

667
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,019
The only way this could've gotten

668
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,319
on the back of the cell phone,

669
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,519
is if it was planted
after she dusted for prints.

670
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,260
Someone set him up, boss.

671
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,719
I don't like what
you're getting at, Agent Gibbs.

672
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,959
Do you have a better explanation?

673
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,959
People like living here.

674
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,189
They go to church on Sundays

675
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,459
and they obey the law, mostly.

676
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,859
And they believe every
person, even a stranger,

677
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,519
is guilty until proven innocent.

678
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,159
You mean innocent until proven guilty.

679
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,059
Yeah, well, that's the
way it used to be before...

680
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,620
Masoud arrived?

681
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,320
Before everyone got so damn scared.

682
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,659
Well, then you know
why I asked the question.

683
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,360
Have a seat.

684
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,059
Look, half the town would
have planted those explosives

685
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,319
just to get rid of Masoud.

686
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,389
Half the town didn't
have a key to his house.

687
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,019
The house was leased. The owner?

688
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,420
Martha Hollingway,84 years old.

689
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,360
Unlikely.

690
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,520
Who else had access to it?

691
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,160
Oh, my Lord.

692
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,160
You think I killed her?

693
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,990
Did you?

694
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,189
I was radio officer

695
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,859
the night she was murdered.

696
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,919
I didn't leave the conference
room the whole night.

697
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,520
Tell him, Tom.

698
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,520
It's true.

699
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,520
You big-time Washington, D. C. guys,

700
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,459
you blow in here so smart.

701
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,060
Think you got all the answers.

702
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,719
You don't know squat about this town.

703
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,520
Educate us.

704
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,490
Everyone knows he did it.

705
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,289
Nobody's trusted this guy
since the moment he got here.

706
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,920
She was at his house.

707
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,055
Maybe they're getting it on.

708
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,559
They had a fight. Who knows?

709
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,359
Or maybe... maybe she figured
out what he's really up to.

710
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,660
Making bombs?

711
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,490
Doesn't surprise me.

712
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,190
Our country is at war.

713
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,789
Alert-level orange, in case
you happened to not notice.

714
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:13,190
We are told to keep an eye on people

715
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,459
who are behaving suspiciously.

716
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,160
I was doing my job.

717
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,819
I told you we needed
to keep a better eye on that Iraqi.

718
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,820
You never listened to me.

719
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,059
Is that why you planted explosives?

720
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,220
I didn't plant any explosives.

721
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,420
McGee?

722
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,820
Deputy, please take off your trousers.

723
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,159
You know what? Screw you, McGee.

724
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,360
Tyler.

725
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,020
If you prefer,

726
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,750
I can get Officer David
to take 'em off for you.

727
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,860
Guess that's not your favorite color.

728
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,789
I was just getting him before he got us.

729
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,285
It's too bad you weren't
getting Lieutenant Shaheen's killer.

730
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,729
Doctors released Masoud.

731
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,729
He's in the car.

732
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,660
Hey! McGee.

733
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,620
Yeah, ready to roll, boss.

734
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,200
Uh, you're leaving?

735
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,030
Yeah, back to D. C.

736
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,599
Thank you for your help.

737
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,730
Yeah, some help I was.

738
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,559
No, no, no, you were. Honest.

739
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,000
We, uh,

740
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,629
found some bomb
residue on the deputy's pants.

741
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,230
Same pocket where he keeps his keys.

742
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,560
I, uh, have your report.

743
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,199
I will read it; I promise.

744
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,560
Bye, McGee.

745
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,000
Bye.

746
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,699
Well, no one could ride Blackie.

747
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,800
He was a warm-blood,
stood 18 hands at the withers.

748
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,829
I don't know what I measure at the withers.

749
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,720
We can measure me tonight.

750
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,860
What time do you get off?

751
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,499
Uh... I gotta go.

752
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,529
I'll see you then.

753
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,399
You have a tape measure at your place?

754
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,330
Good.

755
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,700
Hey. Hey.

756
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,730
Taking calls again?

757
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,400
Never stopped, boss.

758
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,129
Why? Did I miss your call?

759
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,730
No, not mine.

760
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,129
What'd you find out about Masoud?

761
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,299
This guy was good, boss.

762
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,665
Gave the Marines some hard intel.

763
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,859
IED factories, weapons caches,

764
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,729
and the names of more than 50 bad boys.

765
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,800
He deserves a medal.

766
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,759
Got a U. S. passport instead.

767
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,929
What about the other
two who relocated with him?

768
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,629
Yeah, low level stuff mostly.

769
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,349
Nothing to get excited about.

770
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,059
Couple of names, a weapons cache.

771
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,229
But good old Uncle Sam
gave 'em both passports anyway.

772
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,585
He's ready, Gibbs.

773
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,300
DiNozzo, run these plates.

774
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,700
Sure thing, boss.

775
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,200
Why didn't you answer my calls?

776
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,499
Gibbs just asked me that.
I think I had it on silent.

777
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,100
Your other phone is never on silent.

778
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,399
Don't tell me, probie, let me guess.

779
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,760
Research for the next book?

780
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,559
No, it's Ruby's evidence report.

781
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,000
Ah, another work of fiction, then.

782
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,099
If it is, she's a better writer than I am.

783
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,060
Probie,

784
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,829
I have a pimple on my left buttock

785
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,459
that is a better writer than you are.

786
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,830
Ruby, it's McGee.

787
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,759
You need to get to Washington.

788
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,929
I do? When?

789
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,230
Now.

790
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,959
Why did Lieutenant Shaheen come to you?

791
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,460
She was investigating someone.

792
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,830
Who?

793
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,029
Two Iraqi men who relocated with me.

794
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,729
I didn't meet them un...
until I left Baghdad.

795
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,059
They were on the same flight.

796
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,460
When did you last see them?

797
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,505
Lieutenant Shaheen asked
me precisely the same question.

798
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,575
Edenvale, two weeks ago.

799
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,000
This them?

800
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,360
Yes.

801
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,660
They were nervous.

802
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,799
They wanted to know
what information I passed on

803
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,330
to the Marines in Baghdad.

804
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,500
You told them?

805
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,600
No, I lied.

806
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,699
I told them I gave them bad information.

807
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,230
They believed me.

808
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,399
They said they had passed
on bad information, too.

809
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,700
Why did you lie?

810
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,760
Because I trust no one, Agent Gibbs.

811
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,599
Why was Lieutenant
Shaheen investigating them?

812
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,190
She wouldn't tell me.

813
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,060
Names.

814
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,730
I don't know.

815
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,860
Did these men kill
Lieutenant Shaheen, Agent Gibbs?

816
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,400
Yeah, I got it, thanks.

817
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,630
Hey, Major Raines gave us their names, boss.

818
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,299
Asad Al Qutaji and Youssef Zidan.

819
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,659
They're sharing a house in Washington.

820
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,559
No record of employment since they arrived.

821
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,399
Abby thinks there could
have been two shooters.

822
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,959
Get Major Raines in here.

823
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,199
Already on his way.

824
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,700
McGee.

825
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,859
Get down here.

826
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,300
I think Ruby...

827
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,330
Thanks.

828
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,930
Boss.

829
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,799
Think there's something you need to see.

830
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,959
It was in the report, only no one read it.

831
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,130
What report?

832
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,199
Ruby's report.

833
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,629
She just got here. Hey, Ruby.

834
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,810
Hi, Agent Gibbs.

835
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,359
Uh, bear with us here for a second.

836
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,559
You're gonna love this, Gibbs.

837
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,299
- Ready?
- Okay.

838
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,499
So the shell casing I collected
from the crime scene

839
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,359
had quite a lot of
undischarged powder in it.

840
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,330
It was all kind of clogged
inside, so I did a test.

841
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,259
This is the same amount of powder found

842
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,685
in a normal nine millimeter shell.

843
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,100
And this is similar

844
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,230
to the powder I found in our shell casing.

845
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,030
A bit like my last boyfriend.

846
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,429
The powder was degraded

847
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,729
by some type of oil.

848
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,499
The first round didn't
even leave the barrel,

849
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,160
so he fired again.

850
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,829
The second round hit the first,

851
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,829
and they both left the barrel in tandem.

852
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,200
Which is why

853
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,359
the first round was at low velocity

854
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,759
and the second round was all mashed up

855
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,300
and unrecognizable.

856
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,729
I'm surprised the barrel didn't rupture.

857
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,695
Maybe it did.

858
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,929
Not two weapons,
boss, just one.

859
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,000
One weapon, one shooter.

860
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,860
That's good work.

861
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,160
Tell DiNozzo I need another search warrant.

862
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,000
Agent Gibbs.

863
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,630
Ah. Thanks for coming, Major.

864
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,900
Have a sit.

865
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,859
Came down to give you what I could.

866
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,899
Their files are missing.

867
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,060
Oh, I know where they are.

868
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,660
You do?

869
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,629
Lieutenant Shaheen's briefcase.

870
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,600
You found it. Not yet.

871
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,530
Bad luck.

872
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,500
Not for you.

873
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,660
I'm sorry?

874
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,760
Operation Cauldron

875
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,899
relocated three Iraqi men from
Baghdad to the United States

876
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,899
after they supplied intelligence

877
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,100
on the insurgency in Baghdad.

878
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,360
That's right.

879
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,659
Masoud Tariq gave
you first-class intelligence.

880
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,229
In comparison, the other ones
gave you far less, Major Raines,

881
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,559
but they still came to America.

882
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,460
Lieutenant Shaheen...

883
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,699
Wasn't investigating them.

884
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,760
She was investigating you.

885
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,799
How much did they pay you
for their new life in America?

886
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,199
I don't know what
you're talking about, Agent Gibbs.

887
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,159
For an intelligence officer,
you're not very intelligent.

888
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,499
What's your license plate number?

889
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,700
I drive a Pentagon car.

890
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,699
Kilo-echo-four- seven-one-three-nine.

891
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,960
You signed it out last Friday.

892
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,129
Masoud had suspicious neighbors

893
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,760
looking for terrorists, found you.

894
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,229
You followed Lieutenant Shaheen,

895
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,199
parked the car down the street,
and waited while she met Masoud.

896
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,930
Not very smart.

897
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,715
Neither was killing her.

898
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,800
All right, so I followed her.

899
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,599
Because it was me investigating her.

900
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,329
She's the one who got paid off.

901
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,829
I didn't say anything

902
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,159
because I didn't want her name
ruined after she was dead.

903
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,760
Take off your gloves.

904
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:25,500
- What?!
- Gloves! Off!

905
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,529
I had a minor accident over the weekend.

906
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,629
The barrel on your weapon exploded.

907
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,999
Guess you tossed it in the river.

908
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,330
You should have tossed your ammo, too.

909
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
McGee.

910
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,660
Found them in Major Raines' garage, boss.

911
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,999
Served the warrant to his wife.

912
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,065
I hate it when that happens.

913
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,360
What's that, sump oil?

914
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,399
Well, I'm sure we'll be
able to tell you exactly

915
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,715
after we match it to the casing
found at the murder scene.

916
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,960
How much?

917
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,660
How much?

918
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,800
Half a million.

919
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,999
Lieutenant Shaheen always suspected.

920
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,199
It could've been anyone

921
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,029
criminals, insurgents, Al-Qaeda.

922
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,160
You think I didn't check them out?

923
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,799
Just a couple of rich kids who wanted

924
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,899
to get the hell out of there
and come party in America.

925
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,859
Just rich kids, that's all.

926
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,175
P.T. Lieutenant Shaheen
had to pay the price.

927
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,629
Gibbs, about this morning...

928
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,059
- Come on, are you starting this again? 
- It's my Mossad training.

929
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,129
They drummed it into us.
Push, push, push, push, push,

930
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,399
push, push, never give up
until you get to the truth.

931
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,699
Or get your ass kicked.

932
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,960
Right.

933
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,259
I thought you sent
Tony back because of his, um,

934
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,430
illness.

935
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,160
His illness?

936
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:08,929
He has two cell phones,
makes furtive calls to a hospital,

937
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,059
goes missing for hours, always
lies about where he's been.

938
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,999
I mean, he doesn't even
talk about women anymore.

939
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,260
The only logical explanation

940
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,659
is that he's receiving outpatient treatment

941
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,630
for a serious medical problem.

942
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,005
That's not the only explanation.

943
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,830
You know,

944
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,100
for a couple of rich kids,

945
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,600
Asad and Youssef
aren't exactly living it up.

946
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,599
Do you think they'll be deported?

947
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,730
Yeah, probably.

948
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,630
Youssef! Youssef!

949
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,100
Turn around.

950
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,800
Gibbs.

951
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,600
How could I possibly believe all that?

952
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,759
It's all true.

953
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,030
The roses?

954
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,030
True.

955
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,600
Mm... the runaway horse?

956
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,430
I still have the scars.

957
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,830
Where?

958
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,700
Okay.

959
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,130
Right there.

960
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,500
Yes.

961
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,699
Shall I kiss it and make it better?

962
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,759
You do whatever you think is best, doctor.

963
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,199
I'm not going to stop you from...

964
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,359
This is illegal in some
Southern states, you know.

965
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,530
Oh... pager.

966
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,599
Well, just tell them you're performing

967
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,099
a delicate emergency procedure

968
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,329
and you'll call them back later.

969
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,899
I couldn't do that to them.

970
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,400
I could.

971
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,730
You... did not just do that.

972
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:27,851
You like it, don't you?

973
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:29,607
Greedy.

974
