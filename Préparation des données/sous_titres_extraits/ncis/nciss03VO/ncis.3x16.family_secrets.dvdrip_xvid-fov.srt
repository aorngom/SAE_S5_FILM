1
00:00:03,822 --> 00:00:06,177
So when you say you're sure,
how sure are you?

2
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:08,298
Sure enough that if you don't
ask her out by tomorrow,

3
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:10,453
l'm gonna spike your coffee
with testosterone, man.

4
00:00:10,622 --> 00:00:11,850
Yeah, but what if you're wrong?

5
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:14,980
- J.B., trust me, the girl's into you.
- Oh, hey, careful.

6
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:19,417
Relax. This guy's a Marine.

7
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:22,011
At least he was before he deployed
himself through his windshield.

8
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:23,776
So, what do l say to her?

9
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:26,456
l don't know. What do l look like,
the Cyrano de what's-his-face guy?

10
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:28,852
Go with your gut.
You got the release?

11
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,018
No, didn't you get it?

12
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:33,975
You know what? On second thought,
maybe you better not go with your gut.

13
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:40,901
So where should l take her?

14
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:43,735
l'm gonna start charging you
for advice, you know?

15
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:47,656
Oh, there she is.

16
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:55,940
- Do you smell that?
- Gas.

17
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:04,374
Oh, no. Get out.
Get out, get out, get out. Go, go, go.

18
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,371
What are you doing?

19
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:14,417
l'm in the middle
of a very serious negotiation.

20
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:15,571
On McGee's computer?

21
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:20,213
l know where you're going with this,
and the answer is yes.

22
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:21,974
And what's the question?

23
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:26,100
Have l no shame?

24
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:28,494
Who are you lM'ing?

25
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:31,540
Agent Larsen?

26
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:36,418
And she thinks you're McGee?

27
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:42,171
And this is because she warned you
that if you spoke to her again,

28
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:44,982
she would have you brought up
on sexual-harassment charges?

29
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:47,940
- That was a misunderstanding.
- So now you're correcting the record.

30
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:49,774
l'm just trying to let her know that l--

31
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,499
McGee feels that
she may have misjudged me,

32
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,334
and that as a close, personal friend,
l can--

33
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:58,572
''Vouch for Tony's
strength of character.''

34
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:00,976
Yeah.

35
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:05,337
l don't have much time.
She's being reassigned in two days.

36
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:07,697
Yeah, well, you'll be reassigned
if Gibbs catches you.

37
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:09,181
Doing what?

38
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:11,776
We were looking at McGee's
bookmarks, trying to get an idea for a--

39
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,375
Birthday present.

40
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:16,010
- Morning.
- Happy birthday, probie.

41
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:18,901
- lt's a bagel.
- lt's not my birthday.

42
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:22,771
Grab your gear.
Medical transport just exploded.

43
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:31,453
- Any day now, probie.
- Yep. Sorry.

44
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:40,816
l just got the strangest lM.

45
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:47,052
- She asked you out? You?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:48,814
Trust me, l'm just as surprised
as you are.

47
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:50,580
Trust me, you're not.

48
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:53,540
Blast radius indicates
a low-yield detonation.

49
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:55,061
Did she say why?

50
00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:01,020
lt said that she liked the loyalty
l showed my coworkers.

51
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:04,652
Pyrolysis on the pavement suggests
an O2 was the primary accelerant.

52
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,934
Even if they were total scum.
No idea what she was referring to.

53
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,060
l'll tell you though, l did not realize she
was paying so much attention to me.

54
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:13,540
Do you wanna tell the probie
or should l?

55
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:16,576
How about neither?
Why don't you just focus on the work?

56
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:20,331
Yeah, l've noticed you've morphed
into quite the forensic expert.

57
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:24,017
l'm lsraeli. This isn't
my first exploding ambulance.

58
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,412
We left the van unattended for four,
maybe five minutes, tops.

59
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:29,050
- As Patto hit the brakes--
- The whole thing exploded into flames.

60
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:32,095
- l think someone's trying to kill us.
- Would you please stop that, J.B.?

61
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:35,379
- lt was-- lt was an accident.
- Who's trying to kill you?

62
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,498
Who knows?
There's a lot of weirdoes out there.

63
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,858
Tell me about it.

64
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:44,810
- Talk to me, Duck.
- Lance Corporal William Danforth Jr.

65
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:48,338
Survived lEDs in lraq,
RPGs in Afghanistan.

66
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:52,177
Unfortunately,
the local <i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>

67
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:53,775
was too much to bear.

68
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:57,332
- That's a white-tailed deer.
- Yeah, l know.

69
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:59,413
Are you saying
Bambi killed this Marine, Ducky?

70
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:04,610
No, but swerving at 60 miles an hour
into a tree to avoid Bambi did.

71
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:07,541
And his girlfriend is still in a coma
at the hospital.

72
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:10,170
Danforth was DOA
when they brought him in last night.

73
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:13,454
This morning, he was on his way
to Bethesda for a routine autopsy

74
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,374
when fate intervened.

75
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:16,657
Fate?

76
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:20,417
Well, the scorching of the body
is consistent with a gasoline fire

77
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:23,096
accelerated by onboard oxygen.

78
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:25,537
This could have been a accident,
Jethro.

79
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:29,980
- Lucky for those two to get out.
- Yeah, lucky in a way l don't like.

80
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:33,532
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

81
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:35,181
Morning.

82
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:36,974
<i>Good...</i>

83
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:43,014
<i>Good morning to you</i>
<i>You, you and you</i>

84
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,417
<i>Good</i>--

85
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:48,500
- What's that?
- Looks like an iPod.

86
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,056
iPod Photo.

87
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:53,782
Anyone who might have possibly
had a motive to try to kill them--

88
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:56,291
Either has an alibi or is out of town.
Way ahead of you.

89
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:58,140
You could've told me
and saved me the trouble.

90
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:00,452
Just say you need the practice
and leave it at that.

91
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:04,217
What kind of music
does the McGee listen to?

92
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:10,411
Barry Manilow. Julie Andrews?
Zamfir.

93
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:13,462
- Let's go to photos.
- What are you doing?

94
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:16,978
Well, McGee had a date
with Agent Larsen last night.

95
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:20,612
Didn't return any of my e-mails
about a SitRep.

96
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:22,540
But maybe he took some photos.

97
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:27,696
- Those are his private photos.
- Well, he left them on his public desk.

98
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,732
Where's the clickety?

99
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:36,893
- Who is this?
- Well, it's definitely not Agent Larsen.

100
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,371
- Gotta be his sister.
- Why?

101
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:42,176
Are you kidding?
This girl's way out of McGeek's league.

102
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,333
l don't think
the drivers were the target, Tony.

103
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:45,537
Yeah.

104
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:47,932
- l actually think it was the body.
- Why blow up a dead guy?

105
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:51,219
- Put it back up there.
- Put what back?

106
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:57,573
McGee's got good taste.
Going for coffee.

107
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:01,291
- What was that for?
- Alerting DiNozzo.

108
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:11,415
The fuel line to the gas-tank cap
was ruptured here.

109
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:14,496
Torn by a loose belt
on the differential housing.

110
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:15,697
- Loosened how?
- Unknown.

111
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:18,740
The van also had
a short in the electrical system,

112
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:22,133
coincidentally in the taillight
right by our ruptured fuel line.

113
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:24,293
You know how l feel
about coincidences, Abs.

114
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:27,335
Equatorial pygmies know how you feel
about coincidences, Gibbs.

115
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:30,454
So one would wonder,
accident or not an accident?

116
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:31,691
That is the question.

117
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:35,457
Our first player,
an innocent differential-housing bolt

118
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,578
that is rubbing and straining
on the molecular bonds

119
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:39,534
of our vulcanized fuel line

120
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:42,899
until, after eons,
our hapless hose finally ruptures.

121
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:45,855
The gas moves quickly
into the floorboard of the van

122
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:48,172
when it's in motion.
The driver smells it.

123
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,333
What could it be?
He hits the brakes,

124
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:53,619
and the short in the taillight
ignites the pooling gas vapours.

125
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:56,854
The flames quickly superheat
the onboard O2,

126
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,490
and when the canisters can no longer
contain the growing pressure:

127
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:01,616
Not an accident.

128
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:05,419
Not unless the Angel of Death is
going through a Rube Goldberg stage.

129
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:07,135
Boss, we found remnants

130
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:09,452
of what may have been the trigger
on an O2 canister.

131
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,941
May have been, McGee?

132
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:12,899
There were traces
of mercury fulminate,

133
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:14,461
sodium azide and tetryl
on the material.

134
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:16,692
- Blasting cap.
- O2 would've never blown on its own.

135
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:17,931
Fire wasn't hot enough.

136
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:20,497
The perp rigged the transport
to make it look like an accident.

137
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:22,732
He might've gotten away with it
if he'd detonated it sooner.

138
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,972
Fire dispersed pieces of the trigger.

139
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:30,975
- He waited for the drivers to get out.
- So he's not a murderer.

140
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:34,817
Well, at least, he wasn't trying
to kill the ambulance drivers.

141
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,017
Trace it.

142
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,254
Gibbs, this is a garden-variety,
laminated-paper substrate.

143
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:42,414
lt's used as a cheap shielding
in thousands of electronic devices.

144
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:44,095
Yeah, so?

145
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:46,651
So maybe l should
get back to work.

146
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:49,012
Did we get a positive match
on our Marine's DNA?

147
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:52,492
You know, l've been a little busy here,
Gibbs, with all the rubbing

148
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,699
and the looking and the analyzing
and the...

149
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:57,978
l should mention
that Ducky's taking care of it.

150
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:05,571
l haven't seen a body this badly burned
since the Bertram Mills Circus.

151
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,295
Specimen jar.

152
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:10,691
- Mr. Palmer.
- Sorry, doctor.

153
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:13,621
lt's just, l'm having a problem
with this smell today.

154
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:18,060
Really? l think he smells
like my mother's fried chicken.

155
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:22,255
- Yeah, that would be the problem.
- Oh, l see.

156
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:24,653
Well, the vegetarian lifestyle

157
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:27,700
has been medically proven
to be the healthiest of choices.

158
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:30,740
Perhaps it's time
you made the jump.

159
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:35,134
- You wanted to see me, Duck?
- Well, actually, yes, Jethro.

160
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,980
Then why do you look surprised
to see me?

161
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:40,339
Because l haven't told you
that l wanted to see you.

162
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:42,413
Yes. Well...

163
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:47,341
...our latest houseguest
has thrown us quite the little mystery.

164
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:48,770
Define mystery.

165
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:52,218
Yeah, well,
the young lad's death certificate

166
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:55,658
lists blunt-force, thoracic trauma
as the cause of death,

167
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,217
typical in motor-vehicle accidents.

168
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:00,617
But l've only partially been able
to verify that,

169
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:05,614
since, as you can see,
the post-mortem damage is extensive.

170
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:07,215
- Ducky?
- Yes?

171
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,572
- Mystery.
- Of course.

172
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:10,817
Well, you know me, Jethro,

173
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:13,655
l attempted to make
a identification myself.

174
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:19,372
The blast destroyed his jaw
and shattered his teeth.

175
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,578
lt would take
an inordinate amount of time

176
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:24,819
to get an identification
from dental records.

177
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:29,692
Also, the fire so degraded
his DNA, that,

178
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,332
you know, l spent the better part
of yesterday scouring his body.

179
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,812
- Mystery.
- Almost there.

180
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:40,459
By a stroke of luck,
l found a piece of tissue

181
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:45,782
viable enough to send
to have run against Danforth's DNA

182
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:48,940
at the Armed Forces Repository.

183
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,497
This isn't William Danforth Jr.

184
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:58,576
Then who is this?

185
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:02,815
That, my dear Jethro,
is the mystery.

186
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:15,294
Lance Corporal Danforth's
pro and cons were 50-50.

187
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:19,051
A real squirreled-away Marine.
So, what'd you find, Tony?

188
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:20,976
Tony.

189
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:26,091
Zamfir, he's a master
of the pan flute.

190
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:28,493
- lt's helping me think.
- What are you thinking?

191
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:30,852
l'm thinking
that there are a lot of reasons

192
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:33,337
for post-mortem mutilation
you're overlooking,

193
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,498
besides hiding a suspicious
cause of death.

194
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:37,454
Such as?

195
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:40,859
Such as enraged acts of violence,
sadistic curiosity.

196
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:43,895
- Hiding the real identity of the victim.
- That was the next one on my list.

197
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:45,973
- ls his identity in question?
- Yeah, it is now.

198
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:47,690
Tony, get me a copy of--

199
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:50,780
The names of the cops who processed
Danforth's report. Already on its way.

200
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,694
- Ziva, take me--
- Have a chat with the doctor

201
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:55,217
who pronounced the body dead.
Find out who made the lD.

202
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,179
Hey, you want me to go
and supervise that, boss?

203
00:11:57,822 --> 00:12:01,178
Actually, you know, l'll stay here
just in case you need me.

204
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:04,052
Zamfir. No, l'm not saying
you need me.

205
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,100
That's a bad word.
Need's the wrong word.

206
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:10,811
Oh, the director needs to see you
in her office ASAP.

207
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:25,974
l was just gonna tell the director
you're here.

208
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:27,456
Cynthia, did you know

209
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:31,456
that when a Roman emperor
made a triumphal march into Rome,

210
00:12:31,622 --> 00:12:33,499
he had a slave on his chariot who--

211
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:35,812
Who whispered, ''You're only human,''
into his ear.

212
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,974
Going in unannounced
is whispering into her ear.

213
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:40,575
So you're the director's slave.

214
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:50,217
Cynthia is there to direct traffic,
Agent Gibbs.

215
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,219
l'm just responding to your ASAP,
director.

216
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:57,381
This is Lance Corporal Danforth's
father, William.

217
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:02,060
- My sympathies, Mr. Danforth.
- Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

218
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:05,095
The SECNAV would like us
to keep Mr. Danforth in the loop

219
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,258
throughout the entire investigation.

220
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:10,892
- More than usual?
- Yes.

221
00:13:11,702 --> 00:13:13,772
Gordo and l served together in Beirut,
Agent Gibbs,

222
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:16,058
and quite frankly,
l'm using that friendship.

223
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:18,858
- Wouldn't you?
- He would.

224
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:23,296
- Sixth or eighth?
- Two-six, Fox Company.

225
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:26,490
One-one, scout sniper platoon.

226
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:30,461
- Beirut?
- Desert Storm.

227
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:32,533
So, what can you tell me
about my son, Agent Gibbs?

228
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:34,579
Jethro.

229
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:36,697
Bill.

230
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:39,171
Only what l read in hospital
and police reports.

231
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,094
Mr. Danforth has seen those.

232
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:44,220
He's asking how his son's body
was incinerated.

233
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:46,378
lt wasn't.

234
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,694
AFlS couldn't match the body
in autopsy

235
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,853
with Lance Corporal Danforth's
DNA.

236
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:53,252
You're saying
that it isn't Mr. Danforth's son?

237
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:55,100
Not according to AFlS.

238
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:59,653
- Could there be a mistake?
- One in 9 million.

239
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:02,251
- Have Abby rerun the DNA.
- Already on it, director.

240
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:05,135
Well, if it's not Lance Corporal
Danforth, who the hell is it?

241
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,781
l'll let you know when l find out.

242
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:12,056
- What should l tell his mother?
- l wouldn't tell her anything yet.

243
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:13,541
Right.

244
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,051
My numbers.

245
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:20,541
Director Shepard, l'll tell Gordo
how cooperative you've been.

246
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:24,138
- Least we could do.
- Hey, Bill.

247
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:27,459
Did you identify your son's body?

248
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:31,615
No, the police notified us
that he had died.

249
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:33,972
Said that his body
was being shipped to Bethesda.

250
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:36,497
Do you think Billy...

251
00:14:36,662 --> 00:14:37,981
...could still be alive?

252
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,377
l think the hospital transported
the wrong body.

253
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:48,457
Bull.

254
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:50,573
The Marine from two nights ago,
Danforth?

255
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:52,295
Yeah, l remember him.

256
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:54,493
- Are you the one who treated him?
- Treated, no.

257
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:57,176
Unfortunately, all l did was pronounce
him dead, Agent McGee.

258
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:00,462
- lt's hard to believe it's the same kid.
- Why is that?

259
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:02,931
He was a mess.
Heavy contusions to the cranium,

260
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,060
pronounced facial lacerations,
half his skull caved in.

261
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:07,536
Who lD'd his body?

262
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,533
A buddy gave us a tentative lD

263
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,738
and we also pulled his license
from his wallet.

264
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:13,051
This buddy have a name?

265
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,975
Well, l can do better than that.
He's in lCU room five.

266
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,295
The police report didn't
mention anything

267
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:19,975
about a third injured party, doctor.

268
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:23,492
That's because he wasn't injured,
Officer David. He's visiting.

269
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:26,455
''Our souls are like those orphans

270
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:33,016
whose unwedded mothers die
in bearing them.

271
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,173
The secret of our pa--''

272
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:38,015
Paternity lies in their graves,
and we must there to learn it.

273
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:42,619
- Herman Melville, <i>Moby Dick</i>.
- Call me lshmael.

274
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:46,218
lt's her favourite book.
The doctors said it might help.

275
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:50,893
lt's helping give me a headache.
You're Rebecca's relatives?

276
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:54,617
- No, NClS.
- Corporal Merrill, sir.

277
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:56,851
At ease, Marine.

278
00:15:57,462 --> 00:15:59,373
We're only here
to ask you a few questions.

279
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,773
Oh, of course, sir. l mean, ma'am.

280
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,971
She doesn't like being called ma'am.
lt's okay though.

281
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:16,416
This about Billy, ma-- Miss?

282
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:19,096
lf you mean Lance Corporal Danforth,
yes.

283
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:21,093
We understand
that you lD'd his body.

284
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:25,454
Tried to.
Billy's face was all mashed up.

285
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:27,971
How did you know it was him?

286
00:16:28,182 --> 00:16:32,221
Who else could it be?
He was in his car with Rebecca.

287
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:35,533
- At least he was last time l saw him.
- Which was?

288
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:38,131
The night he was killed.

289
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:40,370
Feel free to elaborate.

290
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:43,101
Tell us about that night.

291
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:48,378
Billy had just landed stateside
after his second tour in lraq.

292
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:53,212
So me, him and Rebecca,
Billy's girlfriend,

293
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:56,180
we were out celebrating
at the Gold Monkey.

294
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,293
- Celebrating meaning drinking?
- Not me, sir.

295
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:00,976
Billy was, even though he shouldn't

296
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:03,610
because he just shouldn't.

297
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:11,135
l made Rebecca drive him home
because he looked pretty bad,

298
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:14,339
like he was gonna puke
or something.

299
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,498
You're a good friend.

300
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:21,417
Me and Billy have been buds
since we was this big.

301
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,413
He's the only one
that never made fun of my stutter.

302
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:26,460
You saw Lance Corporal Danforth
get into the car?

303
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:31,133
l put him in it.
Like l said, he was pretty drunk.

304
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:36,251
l went back inside the bar
for maybe half an hour.

305
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:42,856
When l left, l passed the accident
on my way home.

306
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,260
Cops were already there,
said Billy's car hit at a d--

307
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:50,653
lt's okay, corporal,
we read the police report.

308
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:56,260
He was just lying there
all broken and bent up.

309
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:59,653
They were trying to save him,

310
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:02,615
but l knew, l just knew he was...

311
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,814
Doctor said he probably
didn't feel anything.

312
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:11,938
Think he was telling the truth
or just trying to make me feel better?

313
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:15,412
Doctors do that, don't they?

314
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:23,257
Well, in my experiences, ER doctors,
they usually tell it like it is.

315
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:31,618
You got a favourite movie, huh?
Got a favourite movie?

316
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:38,294
Ball, ball, ball.

317
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:41,851
Who's your daddy now?

318
00:18:50,702 --> 00:18:52,818
Are you having fun, DiNozzo?

319
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:57,057
- All done interviewing Danforth's CO?
- You done interviewing his platoon?

320
00:18:57,222 --> 00:18:59,531
Nothing builds rapport
like a good game of ball.

321
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:07,536
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah, later, man.

322
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:11,532
The guys said
Danforth was a top Marine.

323
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:14,302
But the word is, he only joined
because his father was a Marine.

324
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:17,061
Little looser, please.

325
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:21,775
My toes have gotten used to
the whole blood thing, circulation.

326
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:22,931
DiNozzo.

327
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:25,935
The word also is that he
was inseparable with another Marine,

328
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:27,131
a corporal--

329
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:28,417
- Kenneth Merrill.
- Yeah.

330
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:30,732
Followed Danforth into the corps
on the buddy program.

331
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:33,780
Course he did.
Guy's as loyal as a Saint Bernard.

332
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:36,542
Would you just focus, please?

333
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,294
And l'm starting to lose feeling
in my toe.

334
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:39,895
- Does that look right?
- Yeah.

335
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:42,292
Apparently he was as loyal
as a Saint Bernard.

336
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:45,251
According to the CO, the corps
worked out pretty well for him.

337
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:48,300
Oh, yeah. He got into boxing,
got his first girlfriend, and get this,

338
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,259
turns out he had a knack
for disarming lEDs.

339
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,698
- His platoon called him the--
- Forrest Gump of explosives.

340
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:57,538
l'm not trying to do your job, am l?

341
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:02,618
Put an ice pack on that. Fifteen on--

342
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:05,376
Fifteen off. Yeah, l know the drill.
Thanks, corpsman.

343
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:08,331
lt's real swollen.

344
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:11,460
l don't think l'm gonna be able
to walk on this thing, boss.

345
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:17,492
- Look at that. Look, it's a miracle.
- Yeah, loyal as a Saint Bernard.

346
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:19,533
Always wanted to get one of those
until l found out

347
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:22,614
they didn't come with that
barrel of whiskey around their neck.

348
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:27,499
You're wondering if Merrill helped
his buddy fake his own death

349
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:28,651
to get out of the corps?

350
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:33,293
No. l'm wondering who they got to play
the part of the dead body.

351
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,818
You really think Lance Corporal
Danforth faked his own death?

352
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:44,097
You got a better theory?

353
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:48,301
- Actually, we do, Tony.
- l'd like to hear it, Agent McGee.

354
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:51,141
And yours as well, Agent DiNozzo.

355
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:02,294
Both preferably some time today.

356
00:21:04,502 --> 00:21:08,541
We think Corporal Merrill
may have killed Danforth, director.

357
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:09,851
Why?

358
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,455
Merrill conveniently forgot to tell us
about the fight they had

359
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:14,896
the night Danforth was killed.

360
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:17,701
- A fight over what?
- Gibbs is not gonna like this.

361
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:26,016
- ls there a problem, Agent McGee?
- No, no, ma'am.

362
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:31,453
Merrill claims that he was trying to
stop him from drinking and driving.

363
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:35,060
According to the bartender, they broke
two tables and a chair over it.

364
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:37,611
Sounds like more
than two good friends fighting to me.

365
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:41,457
l agree. Merrill also passed
Danforth's accident on the way home.

366
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:43,214
He could have easily
finished him off.

367
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,418
- No.
- Merrill goes to hide the body.

368
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:48,455
And when he comes back to clean up,
the cops are already on the scene.

369
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,175
What about the other body?

370
00:21:51,662 --> 00:21:52,981
There was a third party in the car.

371
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:56,818
We only have Corporal Merrill's word
that the two of them drove off.

372
00:21:57,422 --> 00:22:01,051
No way. No way. Wrong.

373
00:22:01,782 --> 00:22:05,297
Merrill shows up at the hospital,
confirms the false lD.

374
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:06,611
Then later, goes back,

375
00:22:06,782 --> 00:22:09,171
torches the ambulance
before the real lD can be made.

376
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:13,176
Okay, l'm sorry,
l gotta interrupt because...

377
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:15,298
Here's the thing.

378
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:17,896
l have a theory
that actually has motive,

379
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:21,213
which might be helpful. l don't mean
to belittle my colleagues' efforts.

380
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,180
l am a senior field agent.
Danforth didn't hit a deer.

381
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:27,652
He hit Ducky's John Doe.
Stick with me here.

382
00:22:27,862 --> 00:22:30,899
He's drunk, right? Wasted,
looking at five to ten for manslaughter.

383
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:37,456
So he switches the John Doe
with his body, then skips town, right?

384
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,500
Then he has his buddy Corporal Merrill
come along and torch the evidence.

385
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:42,653
That's how it happened.
lt's pretty simple.

386
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:46,258
lt's really just detective work,
connecting the dots.

387
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:49,575
Hey, boss. l was just--
The director wanted-- She wanted--

388
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:51,738
- With me.
- Okay.

389
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:14,900
Dramatic,

390
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:18,498
but duly noted, Agent Gibbs. l get it.

391
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:27,978
- lt wasn't the way it looked, boss.
- l know.

392
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:30,093
Director kind of suckered me
into that deal.

393
00:23:30,262 --> 00:23:31,854
- Ziva caved first.
- l didn't cave in.

394
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:33,137
- l was trying--
- McGee next.

395
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:34,621
Yeah, but, boss, it wasn't what it--

396
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,694
And my loyal Saint Bernard
held out till last.

397
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:40,330
- Well, l--
- Probably all of 30 seconds.

398
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:44,171
So, what is my team--?
Can l call you my team?

399
00:23:44,342 --> 00:23:45,411
- Yes, of course.
- Yes, boss.

400
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:47,652
- What are you gonna do now?
- Well, l think we should--

401
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:50,052
- We could--
- Just solve the case!

402
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,492
- Tony, you impound--
- lmpound Danforth's car.

403
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:54,414
See if it hit anything
besides the tree.

404
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:57,142
- Then you and McGee--
- Go to the original crash site.

405
00:23:57,342 --> 00:23:59,856
McGee, l want an agent standing by
Rebecca Crawford's room to get--

406
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,252
A statement the second she wakes up,
boss. You got it.

407
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:06,737
- And l'm with you, yes?
- l don't know, Ziva.

408
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:10,458
- Are you?
- Definitely.

409
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:20,260
The improvised explosive device,
gentlemen.

410
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:23,892
The weapon of choice in lraq
and Afghanistan.

411
00:24:24,142 --> 00:24:27,020
Problem is spotting them
when they look something like this.

412
00:24:27,222 --> 00:24:30,214
Now, these are just a few of the lED
configurations l encountered

413
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:31,940
on my last pump in lraq.

414
00:24:32,102 --> 00:24:34,457
Today, l'm gonna teach you
how to locate,

415
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:37,932
disarm or, if need be,
blow them all in place.

416
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:42,492
Corporal, you've got it. Take it over.
They're yours.

417
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:45,699
Gentlemen, you heard Corporal Merrill.
Give me a huddle.

418
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,339
Can l help you, sir?

419
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,931
Did you know that lying
to a federal investigator is a crime?

420
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:53,895
l didn't lie.

421
00:24:54,062 --> 00:24:55,939
What was the fight
in the Gold Monkey about?

422
00:24:57,902 --> 00:24:59,540
Billy was drunk, sir.

423
00:24:59,702 --> 00:25:03,854
l tried to take his car keys away
and he started swinging.

424
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:06,582
l guess l didn't try hard enough.

425
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:09,131
You told me you placed him
inside the car.

426
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:10,496
l did.

427
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:15,611
Billy must have made Becca pull over.
l should have--

428
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:18,250
You should have taken him home
yourself.

429
00:25:18,422 --> 00:25:22,973
Yeah. Billy's dead because of me.

430
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:24,257
Are you sure he's dead?

431
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:29,291
The burned body
isn't Lance Corporal Danforth.

432
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:35,337
Enough already. You know
l'm not the type to kiss and tell.

433
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:37,976
Kiss? l heard from a reliable source

434
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:41,134
that you were out with Agent Larsen
last night till about 2 a.m.

435
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:43,097
Who told you that?

436
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:47,695
l have information you want,
you have information l want.

437
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:51,372
- Shall we dance?
- Forget it.

438
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:53,612
Real men always kiss and tell.

439
00:25:56,462 --> 00:25:59,022
Okay, so, what are we looking for
that the cops didn't already find?

440
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:00,655
They thought it was an accident.

441
00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:06,897
But they were not using the honed eye
of a highly trained federal agent.

442
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:11,213
Probie, bring one of those numbers.

443
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:25,461
- Prescription bottle of ibuprofen.
- Grunt candy, a Marine's best friend.

444
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:27,658
Must have been thrown
from Danforth's car.

445
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:31,059
- So?
- So it belonged to Corporal Merrill.

446
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:32,811
And there's blood on it.

447
00:26:34,222 --> 00:26:37,419
- Come on. Say it.
- Say what?

448
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:41,820
''You were right, Tony.''
You'll be the bigger woman for it.

449
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:43,813
l'll just have to content myself
being the--

450
00:26:44,022 --> 00:26:47,139
- Well, the righter one.
- Woman?

451
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:50,581
You know what l mean.
l found Merrill's scrip at the scene

452
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,334
which means they were
in it together.

453
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:56,017
And the DiNozzo body-swap theory
takes the lead.

454
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:58,298
What if he dropped it
while killing Danforth?

455
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:00,737
Abby found Danforth's blood
all over the windshield and hood.

456
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:03,541
So much for your body-swap theory,
Tony.

457
00:27:04,142 --> 00:27:07,498
l've seen more than a few people
survive the windshield taste test, Ziva.

458
00:27:07,702 --> 00:27:10,580
Give it up, Tony. You said Merrill
was the Forrest Gump of explosives.

459
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:13,131
Who else had the equipment and
expertise to blow up the ambulance?

460
00:27:13,302 --> 00:27:16,977
- Ziva's right. Bring him in.
- Feeling pretty smug, aren't you?

461
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:20,821
Oh, yes, very.

462
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:28,258
So, what's bugging
that famous gut now?

463
00:27:29,622 --> 00:27:32,182
Yes, you're that easy to read.

464
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:36,334
l learned how to speak ''Gibbs''
a long time ago.

465
00:27:36,502 --> 00:27:38,572
- You going to Abby's lab or Autopsy?
- Abby's.

466
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,016
Not to work my case.

467
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:44,010
l have the right to dig into
any NClS investigation that l want to.

468
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:48,460
Not mine, unless you want me
behind your desk again.

469
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,575
Of course,

470
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:54,970
you could just observe
and keep quiet.

471
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:57,295
Fine.

472
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:03,537
As you know, this is the only piece
of the trigger that l found.

473
00:28:07,782 --> 00:28:09,101
l'm not really here.

474
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:10,581
Do you know how long
l've been waiting

475
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:12,255
to cross over
into an alternate dimension?

476
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:15,494
Well, you're still here, Abs, for now.
What is this?

477
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:17,738
That's laminated-paper substrate,
boss,

478
00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:19,858
found in any number
of electronic devices.

479
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:22,252
Unfortunately, l couldn't find a trace
of a single one.

480
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:26,256
But then, l was surfing around
on my favourite origami web ring,

481
00:28:26,422 --> 00:28:27,855
and it hit me:

482
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:31,693
Origami,
the ancient art of paper folding.

483
00:28:31,862 --> 00:28:34,422
Maybe the laminate substrate
was the trigger.

484
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:36,493
You're telling me
Merrill folded himself a bomb?

485
00:28:36,662 --> 00:28:38,732
No, that's impossible.
lt came pre-folded.

486
00:28:38,902 --> 00:28:40,972
You see, several companies
have been exploring

487
00:28:41,622 --> 00:28:45,740
the use of paper circuit boards
for disposable products.

488
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:47,978
Metallic ink is printed
on laminated paper

489
00:28:48,182 --> 00:28:49,774
and then folded
into the desired shape.

490
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:52,820
l coated our burned substrate
with a metallic iron particulate.

491
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,576
Which would attach to any
residual metallic ink still present.

492
00:28:55,822 --> 00:28:57,460
And then l ran the whole thing
through an x-ray

493
00:28:57,622 --> 00:29:00,011
to pick up on any latent patterns.

494
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:03,854
Voila. You're looking at
a partial circuit board

495
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:05,580
for a disposable cell phone.

496
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:07,061
Any chance we could read the--?

497
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:10,932
Any chance we could read the--

498
00:29:13,262 --> 00:29:14,741
Call log.

499
00:29:14,902 --> 00:29:16,460
--call logs?

500
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:20,450
l'd have a better chance of getting
McGee to wear a Speedo to church.

501
00:29:20,982 --> 00:29:22,256
But l was able to pull a list

502
00:29:22,422 --> 00:29:25,255
of all the incoming calls
to the hospital's cell zone.

503
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:28,101
Only three came in
immediately prior to the explosion.

504
00:29:28,662 --> 00:29:32,177
One of them was the triggering call,
Corporal Kenneth Merrill.

505
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,934
- l appreciate you meeting me, Bill.
- Sure.

506
00:29:46,102 --> 00:29:48,821
- How's she doing?
- She's stable. Still in a coma.

507
00:29:48,982 --> 00:29:51,052
Are you waiting to question her?

508
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:54,901
Listen, the fire wasn't an accident.

509
00:29:55,702 --> 00:29:58,091
How well do you know
Corporal Kenneth Merrill?

510
00:29:58,262 --> 00:30:01,379
Kenny? He's like a son to me.

511
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:02,611
- lt wasn't an accident?
- No.

512
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:04,898
The van was rigged to explode.

513
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:06,859
Because Kenny defused lEDs
in lraq,

514
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,252
you think he had something
to do with this?

515
00:30:09,422 --> 00:30:11,731
No. lmpossible.

516
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:15,055
Mother told me that Rebecca
used to be Kenny's girlfriend.

517
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:16,331
When they were children.

518
00:30:16,502 --> 00:30:18,379
They've been best friends
since elementary school.

519
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:21,301
Night of your son's accident,
he was also in a fight.

520
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:27,055
My son liked to drink,
sometimes in excess.

521
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:30,779
Kenny was just trying to stop him
from driving home drunk.

522
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:33,331
Kenny had nothing to do with this,
Jethro.

523
00:30:35,382 --> 00:30:37,612
lt looks like the call
that triggered the fire

524
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:39,215
came from Kenny's cell phone.

525
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:41,417
What time was that?

526
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:44,056
- 0900 about.
- No, wasn't Kenny.

527
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:46,497
He was with my wife and l from--

528
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:51,213
l don't know, since before dawn
up until at least noon.

529
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:53,291
Yeah, Gibbs.

530
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:55,259
<i>Hey, boss,</i>
<i>Corporal Merrill's disappeared.</i>

531
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:01,574
- Was that about my son?
- No. Corporal Merrill.

532
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:05,777
After l questioned him, he walked
out of the class he was teaching.

533
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:07,855
No one's seen him since.

534
00:31:30,582 --> 00:31:33,574
l don't recall ordering room service.

535
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:39,251
ls that steak au poivre?

536
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:42,292
And frisée salad?

537
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,579
You know, the last time
we had steak au poivre,

538
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,454
six people died.

539
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:55,257
What is this meal gonna cost me?

540
00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:59,774
Can't a guy just sit down
and have a bite with his old partner?

541
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:03,457
Old partner?
Must be worse than l thought.

542
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:14,052
How'd it go with Danforth
at the hospital today?

543
00:32:14,262 --> 00:32:17,857
lt went okay,
if you're Corporal Merrill.

544
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:21,731
Danforth gave an alibi
for the day of the explosion.

545
00:32:23,662 --> 00:32:25,573
l assume you didn't believe him.

546
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:28,860
Why is that?

547
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:31,820
Because l wouldn't be eating
steak au poivre right now if you did.

548
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:38,337
lf Danforth's covering for Merrill,

549
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:42,015
he has to believe
Merrill didn't kill his son.

550
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:43,740
The only way he can know that
for sure is--

551
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:45,335
lf the kid is still alive.

552
00:32:48,462 --> 00:32:50,692
But you don't believe that either.

553
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:55,570
The alibi was B.S.

554
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:57,491
The grief was real.

555
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:00,580
You sure
Danforth wasn't playing you?

556
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:05,531
Sorry. That still doesn't mean
the son's dead.

557
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:09,533
There was an accident.
He could be hurt.

558
00:33:09,742 --> 00:33:12,017
Could be recovering
in a private hospital somewhere.

559
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:14,292
Wouldn't be the first time
a parent with means

560
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:17,135
used them to keep a child
out of trouble.

561
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:20,218
- You gonna eat that aspara--?
- Hey.

562
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:27,013
Thank you.

563
00:33:28,862 --> 00:33:30,898
There is another possibility.

564
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:34,422
lf Danforth is grieving for his son,

565
00:33:35,302 --> 00:33:37,611
then he's only covering
for Merrill because--

566
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,501
He refuses to believe
that Merrill attempted to kill him.

567
00:33:43,782 --> 00:33:45,135
Let's hope he's not wrong.

568
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:50,459
Either way, however it went down,

569
00:33:50,622 --> 00:33:54,615
Jethro, you find Merrill,
and you'll find Danforth Jr.

570
00:33:57,622 --> 00:34:00,341
- Merrill, M-E-R-R--
- <i>Say again?</i>

571
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,498
R-R, like Ricky Ricardo.

572
00:34:02,662 --> 00:34:05,415
Okay, l got his ATM records,
checking for any recent activity.

573
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:09,097
Vehicle is a tan Sierra,
license plate DPH--

574
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:11,378
Ricky Ricardo, you know,
from <i>l Love Lucy</i>.

575
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,010
No withdrawals in the last two weeks.
Credit-card records coming up.

576
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,901
Tan. lf l meant burnt umber,
l would have said burnt umber.

577
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:18,381
Get-- Whatever it is.

578
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:21,818
Ricky Ricardo, you know,
''You got some explaining to do, Lucy.''

579
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:23,017
<i>Yeah, whatever. Okay.</i>

580
00:34:23,182 --> 00:34:24,934
Hey, boss.
Just updating the BOLO on Merrill.

581
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:27,775
And checking the DMV to see if
he's had any traffic violations recently.

582
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:30,217
Going through his financial records
to try and pick up any leads

583
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:31,417
off any recent purchases.

584
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,820
- And?
- And we can't find him.

585
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,374
But we're not gonna give up
until we do.

586
00:34:39,582 --> 00:34:41,334
Or die trying.

587
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:50,136
Or die trying?
You had to put that in his head?

588
00:34:53,742 --> 00:34:54,891
You wanted to see me, Duck?

589
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:56,933
Yes, l did.
l was just about to call you.

590
00:34:57,582 --> 00:35:01,052
Small wonder DiNozzo is always
looking over his shoulder.

591
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:03,690
l managed to put a couple of bits
together.

592
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,257
- His lower canine.
- How long?

593
00:35:06,462 --> 00:35:08,373
Oh, a week, maybe longer.

594
00:35:08,582 --> 00:35:10,652
What are the odds
of this reconstruction getting us an lD?

595
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:11,937
Exceedingly long,

596
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:16,300
but it's the only method l have
for identifying these remains.

597
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:17,781
Well, l've had long shots come in.

598
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:21,816
l once wagered a 500-to-1
on the lrish sweepstakes.

599
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:24,456
He fell at the first jump,
but then recovered.

600
00:35:24,662 --> 00:35:26,812
He fell at the second jump.

601
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:29,217
You'll never guess
what happened next.

602
00:35:32,182 --> 00:35:35,060
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- lt's me, Gibbs.

603
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:38,652
You'll never guess what l found.
Come on, Gibbs, guess.

604
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:42,777
l ran the prints
from the bottle of ibuprofen

605
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:45,502
that Tony found
at the Danforth accident site.

606
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:48,218
Can l at least get a drumroll?

607
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,373
- Pathetic.
- Prints?

608
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:54,698
The prescription belonged
to Corporal Merrill.

609
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,212
All of the prints on the bottle belonged
to Lance Corporal Danforth.

610
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,459
So? Merrill gave Danforth
some of his grunt candy.

611
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:04,813
lt wasn't grunt candy.
The bottle was empty.

612
00:36:05,022 --> 00:36:07,456
So l swabbed it
and l ran it through the mass spec.

613
00:36:08,742 --> 00:36:12,178
- Cyclosporine, azathioprine.
- Come on, Abs, in English.

614
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:14,100
They're antirejection drugs, Gibbs.

615
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:17,060
lf Danforth was taking them,
he's had a transplant.

616
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:19,178
The DNA l ran
could be from a donor organ.

617
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:22,414
Kind of turning me on.

618
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:24,893
l'm gonna get another sample
from Ducky.

619
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:28,936
This body could be
Lance Corporal Danforth.

620
00:36:30,742 --> 00:36:32,334
So urban myth.

621
00:36:32,502 --> 00:36:34,652
There you go. Thanks.

622
00:36:38,502 --> 00:36:41,539
Hey, Bill. Called your home,
wife said you were here.

623
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:46,742
You got bad news for me,
don't you?

624
00:36:51,382 --> 00:36:52,497
Yeah.

625
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:02,692
Where'd your son
have his transplant?

626
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:09,501
Does it matter?

627
00:37:14,302 --> 00:37:15,735
No.

628
00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:20,337
You can't stay in the corps
with a kidney transplant, Jethro.

629
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:23,181
Who burned in the fire, Bill?

630
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,254
An unclaimed body
at the hospital morgue

631
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:29,532
scheduled for cremation.

632
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:33,132
l made a donation,
they switched a toe tag,

633
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,697
and the county saved itself
the cost of a cremation.

634
00:37:35,902 --> 00:37:38,211
- lt could have killed those EMTs, Bill.
- No.

635
00:37:39,262 --> 00:37:41,537
l didn't detonate that oxygen
until they were clear.

636
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:45,411
Why? Your son was dead.

637
00:37:45,582 --> 00:37:48,096
Corps doesn't care
if he had a transplant now.

638
00:37:52,502 --> 00:37:56,734
They were more than friends.
They were a match.

639
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:59,496
Corporal Merrill gave your son
a kidney.

640
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:02,053
An autopsy would reveal
the transplant.

641
00:38:02,262 --> 00:38:06,221
l was afraid that the ME would run
a DNA check on the donor organ.

642
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:10,893
And you can't be on active duty
if you gave away a kidney.

643
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:14,331
The corps means the world
to that boy, Jethro.

644
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:17,016
lt's his life.
And he risked everything.

645
00:38:17,182 --> 00:38:20,652
He risked it all to help out
his best friend, my son.

646
00:38:20,862 --> 00:38:22,932
- He rigged an lED to burn--
- l did that.

647
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:24,894
- Bill.
- l'll swear l did it.

648
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:26,973
- Kenny had nothing to do with this.
- Why'd he go UA?

649
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:30,339
He didn't go UA,
he was at my place.

650
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:33,611
The things that Kenny's teaching
those Marines going to lraq

651
00:38:33,782 --> 00:38:35,738
will save their lives, Jethro.

652
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:39,661
Come on, let me take the hit
on this one.

653
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:44,373
Where is your son's body?

654
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:53,738
At the hospital morgue.

655
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,215
Come on.

656
00:39:05,422 --> 00:39:09,893
l do apologize.
Usually one scraping is sufficient,

657
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:14,175
but you are so crispy.

658
00:39:15,902 --> 00:39:18,780
That should satisfy Abby.

659
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:22,577
Jethro, Abby told me
about the transplant and her theory.

660
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:27,380
- Well, do you buy it?
- Well, it is possible.

661
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:30,972
My money's on your teeth, Duck.
Get back to it.

662
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:33,298
As soon as l give this to Abby.

663
00:39:34,182 --> 00:39:35,979
- l'll do it.
- Jethro.

664
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,575
l've never seen you
break evidence protocol before.

665
00:39:40,782 --> 00:39:42,374
You don't trust me, Duck?

666
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:45,460
Well, that's not the point.
Chain of evidence is chain of evidence.

667
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:49,740
You're right about that.
l'd slap DiNozzo silly if he did it.

668
00:39:49,942 --> 00:39:52,297
Jethro, you surprise me.

669
00:39:52,902 --> 00:39:55,177
Must be getting old.

670
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:15,580
God.

671
00:40:18,022 --> 00:40:20,013
Yes! Yes!

672
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:22,180
- Yes!
- That is incredible.

673
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:24,576
No need for a dental match now.

674
00:40:24,782 --> 00:40:30,539
The odds on getting donor DNA
from Danforth's body are astronomical.

675
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:36,339
Alabama, 1 954, a 9-pound meteorite
hits Annie Hodges.

676
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:40,541
The odds of getting hit by a meteorite,
astronomical-- No pun intended.

677
00:40:40,702 --> 00:40:44,092
--but it happens. And l'm gonna
be published again. Yes.

678
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:45,900
Peachy for you,
but we just lost our victim.

679
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:47,461
- Our suspect.
- Our theories.

680
00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:52,173
We've been barking up the wrong tree
the entire investigation.

681
00:40:52,342 --> 00:40:53,821
- Bush.
- Sorry, bush.

682
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:58,021
We've been barking up
the wrong bush.

683
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:01,892
Tree. So who torched the ambulance
and why?

684
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:04,934
Don't look at me.

685
00:41:08,702 --> 00:41:10,977
- Don't tell me.
- Well, yeah.

686
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:13,696
Abby was right.
The first test picked up donor DNA.

687
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:16,422
Our John Doe
is Lance Corporal Danforth.

688
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:20,734
Good. l mean, not good,
a Marine is dead,

689
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:23,541
but good that the case
is no longer ours.

690
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:26,495
l know what you're gonna say,
Jethro, and don't.

691
00:41:26,662 --> 00:41:29,301
l want Lance Corporal Danforth's
remains returned to his father

692
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:32,420
and l want the case turned over
to the Maryland Arson lnvestigators.

693
00:41:32,582 --> 00:41:35,733
That will make Mr. Danforth happy,
which will make the SECNAV happy,

694
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:37,654
which, in turn,
will make me very happy.

695
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:40,780
We have wasted way too many
of our resources already.

696
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:43,100
Okay.
