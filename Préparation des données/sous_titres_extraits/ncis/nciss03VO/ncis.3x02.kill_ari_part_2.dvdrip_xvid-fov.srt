1
00:00:05,182 --> 00:00:06,934
- Sorry, Caitlin.
- Ari.

2
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:08,541
l found Ari's sniper's nest, boss.

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,300
Didn't police his brass.

4
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:15,212
l'm dead now, Ducky. Shouldn't be.
l could have killed Ari right here.

5
00:00:17,662 --> 00:00:18,890
- You okay?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,297
Him sniping Abby
means he's after my people.

7
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:24,818
l've been offered a deputy director's
position at Homeland Security.

8
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:26,301
Well, who'll be replacing you, sir?

9
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:28,171
Hello, Jethro.

10
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:34,814
On the job,
it is Director Shepard or ma'am.

11
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:37,138
l'm here to see Special Agent Gibbs.

12
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:39,812
- You first.
- Ziva David. Mossad.

13
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:41,779
She's here to stop you
from whacking Ari.

14
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:43,973
Director Jenny Sheppard,
same mission.

15
00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:47,219
Ari Haswari is a Mossad
operative undercover in Hamas.

16
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,014
He hasn't turned on us or you.

17
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:55,781
Dr. Mallard,

18
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:58,576
l want to prove l didn't kill Caitlin.

19
00:00:58,782 --> 00:01:01,933
- By taking Gerald hostage?
- <i>Gerald is free to go.</i>

20
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:04,736
Come alone
and you can exchange places.

21
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,974
You shouldn't have come, doctor.

22
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:06,696
Couldn't let the bastard
put a bullet in your good shoulder

23
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:09,019
or you'd never return to work.

24
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:12,820
- Do you have your cell phone?
- Ari took it.

25
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:16,691
Keep walking. Don't turn back
until you're behind the wheel.

26
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:20,938
- Where is Ari?
- ln the back seat.

27
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:25,535
When l reach your car,
l'll lean in through the open window.

28
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:28,535
That's your cue to drive off, fast.

29
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:31,176
- Dr. Mallard.
- Go straight to NClS.

30
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:33,896
Tell Gibbs everything
that's happened.

31
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:39,290
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Dr. Donald Mallard.</i>

32
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:42,022
<i>Please leave a message and</i>
<i>l'll get back to you as soon as l can.</i>

33
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:44,980
l said no one
was to leave the building.

34
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:48,578
- Ducky, please call. We're worried--
- No one includes you, Dr. Mallard.

35
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:52,417
We're worried, including Gibbs
or he wouldn't be yelling.

36
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,214
Look, Gibbs,
it's not Ducky's fault, okay?

37
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,976
He probably did Kate's autopsy
on autopilot

38
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,575
and drove himself home
the same way.

39
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:01,779
Boss. Outside call
came in to Autopsy 23 minutes ago.

40
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:04,174
Tracing the number.

41
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:22,539
You look surprised.

42
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:24,892
l expected to be shot.

43
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:28,890
Doctor, please.
l would never harm a fellow physician.

44
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:33,617
Use the clutch!

45
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:38,499
Good God, man, use the clutch!

46
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:46,335
You're-- You're stripping the gears.

47
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,861
This is too painful, doctor.

48
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:52,656
Gerald, turn it off.

49
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:58,295
Obviously, Gerald does not have
an intimate relationship

50
00:03:58,462 --> 00:04:00,100
with a standard transmission.

51
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:01,536
Unbelievable.

52
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:07,135
The price of growing up in America.
That was so unnecessary, doctor.

53
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:09,736
Gerald is free to leave

54
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,698
in his own car.

55
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:18,622
Boss, that call came
from Gerald Jackson's cell phone.

56
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:21,700
- l almost forgot about Gerald.
- Yeah, he's been in rehab a year.

57
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,456
Maybe he heard about Kate
and he called Ducky.

58
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:26,618
- They're in a pub somewhere.
- Yes.

59
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:28,181
- l don't like it.
- Why?

60
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:29,775
l don't need a reason why.

61
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:36,336
Did you buy it
in such pristine condition?

62
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:37,537
God, no.

63
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:39,613
The frame
had severe termite damage.

64
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:42,421
That's right.
The Morgan has a wood frame.

65
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:46,581
The top was in rags. The body dented.
The rocker panels rusted out.

66
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:50,741
- lt was a disgrace.
- Who did the restoration?

67
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:54,053
- l did.
- Of course you did.

68
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:57,060
- Do you doubt me?
- Not at all, doctor.

69
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:59,059
l was thinking of the irony.

70
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:01,816
That hands so skilled
at dissecting the dead

71
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:07,176
are also capable of restoring life.
At least to a machine.

72
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:11,331
- What do you want, Ari?
- A test drive.

73
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:19,297
Now, who at NClS
could be calling Gerald at this hour?

74
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:23,373
Oh, well,

75
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:26,253
Gerald is sure to arrive there shortly.

76
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:29,021
Doctor?

77
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:33,412
Oh, your cell phone.

78
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:42,697
Now buckle up, doctor.
lt's a dangerous night.

79
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:58,053
- <i>Please record your message</i>--
- l'm getting voice mail.

80
00:05:58,262 --> 00:05:59,854
They can't hear their phones
in a pub.

81
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:01,939
- Wanna leave a message?
- No. Get a GPS fix.

82
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:07,017
- Snap it up, McGee.
- One second, boss.

83
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,017
Got it.

84
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:15,900
Georgetown. Olive and 29th.

85
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:18,252
l know that street.
That's mostly residential.

86
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,611
Locate Ducky's cell.

87
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,096
- See? They're together.
- There's no pub there.

88
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,817
- Well, maybe Gerald lives there.
- That's negative. He lives on Peabody.

89
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,740
So they're parked. They're talking.

90
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,379
- Want me to go with you, boss?
- No. Tony's out. Stay here with Abby.

91
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:39,698
For nobody leaving the building, there
are a lot of people leaving the building.

92
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:58,653
Why don't you visualise her naked?

93
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,418
Does she intimidate you?

94
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:04,893
A woman hasn't been born yet
who can intimidate Anthony DiNozzo.

95
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:06,734
You're forgetting your mother.

96
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:10,218
- Mothers don't count.
- And that lawyer, Marla?

97
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:13,334
Divorce attorney.
Worse than mothers.

98
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:17,171
Well, Ziva's not your mother.
She's not a divorce lawyer.

99
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:19,179
- She definitely intimidates you.
- Does not.

100
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:20,417
- Does too.
- Does not.

101
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:21,975
Does too.

102
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:30,495
- Okay, where are they now?
- <i>Same place, boss.</i>

103
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:33,136
- Olive and 29th.
- Get a fix on my cell.

104
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:37,657
Okay. You're right on top of them.

105
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:42,781
- Damn it, McGee. They are not here.
- <i>They have to be, boss.</i>

106
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:45,701
- Gibbs. ls there a pub?
- <i>No.</i>

107
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:49,741
There is no pub. There are no people.
There are no cars.

108
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,739
Okay, l was just checking.

109
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,093
How accurate is this fix, McGee?

110
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:57,577
<i>Within 25 metres.</i>

111
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:11,330
lt's gonna happen again, isn't it?

112
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:14,300
Ducky's gonna take a bullet for you.

113
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:20,741
- He won't kill Ducky.
- Why not?

114
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:22,813
Because you couldn't live
with the guilt?

115
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:26,097
Maybe Ari knows that.

116
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,851
Maybe that's his plan.

117
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:34,622
Maybe the only way to save Ducky,
Abby and McGee is to kill yourself.

118
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:09,131
Special Agent McGee.

119
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:11,611
l found Ducky and Gerald's
cell phone in the park.

120
00:09:11,782 --> 00:09:14,012
Why would they leave
their cell phones in the park?

121
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:15,615
<i>They wouldn't, McGee.</i>

122
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,096
Do you want me
to come down there?

123
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,730
lf l wanted you to come down here,
l would have told you so.

124
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,854
Put a BOLO out on Ducky's Morgan.
Pull his licence plate from his file.

125
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:26,014
Gibbs, Ari has Gerald and Ducky.

126
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:27,450
They're not dead, Abs.

127
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:29,217
How do you know?

128
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:34,498
Because Ari dumped their cell phones
in the park, not their bodies.

129
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,741
Boss, Gerald's here.

130
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:41,574
- Ari's got Dr. Mallard.
- How'd you get away?

131
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:44,302
l didn't. Ari let me go.

132
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:52,139
Excuse me.

133
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:56,135
May l?

134
00:09:58,542 --> 00:09:59,816
You certainly may.

135
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:14,497
- l've never driven a stick.
- Are you serious?

136
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:17,694
- What, you can drive a stick?
- Yeah, since l was like 1 0.

137
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:19,494
What were you driving
when you were 1 0?

138
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:22,256
A red '4 7 Ford half-ton pickup
with four on the floor

139
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,698
- and Bubba riding shotgun.
- Bubba?

140
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:28,661
Best damn coon dog
in Jefferson Parish.

141
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:34,811
- l don't believe in coincidences, Tony.
- l know, boss.

142
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:37,092
- <i>You beat that into me.</i>
- Haven't l beat that into you?

143
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:40,580
- That's what l said.
- <i>What did you say?</i>

144
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:44,492
- l said the reception sucks.
- Stay with them.

145
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:47,017
- l'm on my way.
- What if they split up?

146
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,980
- What about your gut?
- lt wants a pizza.

147
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:52,250
Oh, God.

148
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:54,014
What do we have?

149
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:56,491
Ari picked up Gerald
to force Ducky into a meet.

150
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:57,737
Did you warn him?

151
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,291
l did. But you know Dr. Mallard.
He came anyway.

152
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:03,659
lt's not your fault, Gerald.
Ari's the bastard.

153
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:05,939
Ducky made the decision to go,
not you.

154
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,219
Debrief it. Write it up.

155
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:10,060
l'll be with Tony
at the Embassy Hotel.

156
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,298
- Tony's at the Embasero.
- Why did he say the Embassy?

157
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:14,657
Cell phone garble.

158
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:17,859
All right, from now on everyone
is using phonetics,

159
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:19,978
like we did in the Corps.

160
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:22,019
Golf. lndia. Bravo. Bravo. Sierra.

161
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:26,222
Can l go back to my lab?
l'm flipping out here with nothing to do.

162
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:29,454
- Okay, but don't leave--
- Don't leave the building. l know.

163
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:31,977
Bravo. Yankee. Echo.

164
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:41,581
Mind if l join you?

165
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,097
One more lap
and you'll have it all to yourself.

166
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,172
- How is the water?
- Lovely.

167
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:55,980
- Have a nice swim.
- Thank you.

168
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:30,181
They're switching robes.

169
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,251
Hey.

170
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:59,651
- What are you doing?
- Going for a swim.

171
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,373
- There's a locker room.
- No, l'm fine.

172
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,894
- Where's your swimsuit?
- Don't have one.

173
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,732
l should call security.

174
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:17,537
- You didn't see the sign.
- What sign?

175
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:18,970
l must have been blocking it.

176
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:21,736
Remember l was waiting outside
and you wanted to come in?

177
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,813
- l remember.
- Hackensack Nudist Society.

178
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:27,895
From 1 0:27 to 1 1 :51 ,
the pool is ours.

179
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:31,492
And it's our third annual convention.
Here's Agnes and Agnew right now.

180
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:34,699
He's our president
and Agnes is our social secretary.

181
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:39,017
Hey, guys.
They look funny with clothes on.

182
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:42,375
lnventive. Funny even.

183
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:44,095
But l'm married.

184
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:46,896
So am l.

185
00:13:56,622 --> 00:13:58,180
- Can you hear me?
- <i>Across the street.</i>

186
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:00,572
- Boss. Gotcha.
- <i>Here.</i>

187
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:10,500
Ziva slipped a phoney French passport
and some cash

188
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:15,661
to the woman with the Star of David
l told you about.

189
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:20,016
- l love you, boss.
- How you know the passport's phoney?

190
00:14:20,622 --> 00:14:22,419
Ari's photo, but not his name.

191
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:25,582
- What name is he using?
- Curious to know how l got it?

192
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,818
l assume you improvised
like a good agent should.

193
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:30,576
What an improv. l swear to God
l could get a gig on <i>SNL</i>.

194
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:34,058
Okay, get this. l pretend like l'm this
real goofy guy trying to get--

195
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:36,452
- Pretend?
- That hurt, boss.

196
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:40,774
- What's the name?
- Well, the--

197
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:45,296
- The name?
- René Saurel.

198
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,578
- S-A-U-R-E-L.
- Description?

199
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:50,535
- All l saw was the name and the photo.
- The woman.

200
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:53,331
About 5-foot-9, dark hair,
blue and white jogging outfit.

201
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,770
Big gym bag. Real pretty girl.

202
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:57,052
Looked enough like Ziva
to be her sister. Real pretty.

203
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:58,695
Maybe she is.

204
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:02,053
Mossad's like the Mafia,
one big happy family.

205
00:15:02,222 --> 00:15:04,099
Hey, McGee.
l've got a passport alert.

206
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:08,773
Ari's travelling with a French passport
under an alias, René Saurel.

207
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:13,777
Sierra. Alpha. Uniform. Romeo.
Echo. Lima.

208
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:15,614
- <i>Okay, what alert category?</i>
- Terrorism.

209
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:17,050
<i>On it.</i>

210
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:18,775
That ought to get
Customs' attention.

211
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:21,052
Well, let's make sure
he doesn't get that far.

212
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:22,536
Boss, that's her.

213
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:26,055
- Stay with Ziva.
- What if this girl's meeting Ari?

214
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:27,820
l mean,
you're gonna need backup.

215
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,414
- Let me rephrase that.
- Out.

216
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:35,093
- Thanks for the pizza, boss.
- Thank the night shift.

217
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:36,776
l swiped it from them.

218
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,982
Ari! Get out, Ari!

219
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:10,690
Good grief, Jethro.
Put that weapon down.

220
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:12,739
l've had enough excitement
for tonight.

221
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:15,456
Ari abducts me,
Gerald strips my gears,

222
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:17,374
and now you play chicken
on a wet street.

223
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:19,652
- Where's Ari?
- Well, gone l imagine.

224
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:22,655
We were parked about,
well, a ways back.

225
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,181
He received a cell phone call

226
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:27,175
and then told me to drive
down the street for ten minutes.

227
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:30,892
McGee. Congress Cab number 1 7
picked up a female fare

228
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:33,053
at the Embasero Hotel
ten minutes ago.

229
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:34,615
lf he's en route, l need his 20.

230
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:36,733
lf he's dropped his fare,
then get me an address.

231
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:38,858
And take the BOLO off
Ducky's Morgan. He's safe.

232
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:41,857
Our paths didn't cross by accident.

233
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:45,293
Ari's cell call came from that woman
in that cab l was tailing.

234
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,851
He sent me down this street,
so that you would run into me.

235
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:50,457
Yeah. A cab keeps going.
Picks him up. They're gone.

236
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:53,222
Ari abducts me
to get you off her tail.

237
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:56,573
- Maybe. What'd you talk about?
- Well, my Morgan for a while.

238
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,933
He was surprisingly knowledgeable.
Then Edinburgh Medical School.

239
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,855
Yeah, we were both alumni.
A few decades apart, of course--

240
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,741
Anything important, Ducky?

241
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:08,577
He swore he didn't kill Caitlin.

242
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:11,376
Made a very logical
and passionate defence.

243
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:13,021
You believe him?

244
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:14,575
He was very persuasive.

245
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,097
Said he knows
you'll never believe him.

246
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:19,253
- He's right about that.
- And that it's a shame

247
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:20,815
that one of you has to die.

248
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,142
He's arrogantly confident
that it won't be him.

249
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:27,499
But said on the off-chance that it is,

250
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:31,814
- to keep looking for Caitlin's killer.
- He's a slick bastard, Duck.

251
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:34,337
But he's right.
One of us is gonna die.

252
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:37,295
Jethro... Jethro!

253
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,253
Espresso?

254
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,778
Take it. lt's not a bribe.

255
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,333
- How long have you known l was--?
- Following me?

256
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,533
Since l left the Navy Yard.

257
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,860
- l don't think so.
- Blue sedan.

258
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:09,900
You laid behind a white station waggon
for a while, then a telephone van.

259
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:13,293
- You lost me at the traffic circle on--
- Okay, okay. You knew.

260
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,055
Take it.

261
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:17,780
lt's chilly out here.

262
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:26,539
You shouldn't feel bad.
l was trained by the best.

263
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:29,417
You know,
that's what l like about Mossad.

264
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:32,540
- Our training?
- Modesty.

265
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:36,216
There's a slice in there.

266
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:03,578
l lost my little sister, Tali,
in a Hamas suicide bombing.

267
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,576
She was 1 6 and the best of us.

268
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:11,372
Tali had compassion.

269
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,056
l'm sorry.

270
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:17,895
After Tali's death, l was like Gibbs.

271
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:20,059
All l wanted was revenge.

272
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:22,214
ls that why you joined Mossad?

273
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:24,577
l was Mossad
long before Tali's death.

274
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:26,261
- Old--
- Family tradition?

275
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,652
lsraeli sense of duty.

276
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:30,614
So come on.

277
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:34,692
Who recruited you? Father?
Uncle? Brother? Boyfriend?

278
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:38,531
Aunt. Sister. Lesbian lover.

279
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:42,862
You're good.
You almost got me off the question.

280
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:47,851
- Almost.
- l volunteered.

281
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:26,421
Why haven't you come down
to see me yet?

282
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:29,941
lf you don't peek at the back
of my head, l'll look like l'm asleep.

283
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:36,655
l'm so lonely,
l'd even welcome a visit from Tony.

284
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,530
McGee.

285
00:20:38,742 --> 00:20:41,734
Didn't Tony match the tyre tracks
to a Chevy Suburban?

286
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:45,338
Yeah. Bridgestone Duelers.
Factory issue.

287
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:47,694
- What are you doing?
- We caught a break.

288
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:49,420
NRO orbited a new Key Hole.

289
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:51,260
They're doing calibration tests

290
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:54,101
using the seventh hole
of Norfolk Naval golf course.

291
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:57,140
- Why the seventh hole?
- See? That's why l dig you, McGee.

292
00:20:57,342 --> 00:21:00,334
You think specific.
Whatever the reason, we are grateful

293
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:04,336
because that orbit took the Key Hole
over Newport News.

294
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:07,972
l inputted
the warehouse coordinates.

295
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,494
That's the rooftop.

296
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:19,372
That's me, Tony, Gibbs, Kate.

297
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,814
ls that the building
where Ari's sniper nest was?

298
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:26,620
lt is.

299
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,374
- Ari's not there.
- What do you expect?

300
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,772
- Video of him shooting?
- Well, l was hoping.

301
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:36,934
- Only in flicks, McGee.
- Okay, then why are you so excited?

302
00:21:37,102 --> 00:21:39,536
l don't know. Maybe it's being alone
with you on a rainy night.

303
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:42,058
- Abby.
- Oh, look. Could it be?

304
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:46,101
A black Chevy Suburban
driving down the alleyway.

305
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:47,896
Can you read the licence plate?

306
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:49,939
That depends more on angle
than resolution.

307
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:59,738
lt's not a dress, McGee. You can't look
up it to see what you want.

308
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:08,658
Yes. Yes. Yes!

309
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:14,938
- McGee.
- l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

310
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:17,616
l gotta put a BOLO
out on that plate.

311
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:20,660
- We did good, huh?
- You did great.

312
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:37,571
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- <i>We got Ari's</i>--

313
00:22:37,782 --> 00:22:39,693
Slow down, McGee. Take a breath.

314
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,136
Start with the address.

315
00:22:42,582 --> 00:22:46,655
Seven, two, four.
Tango. Julia. Alpha. Got it.

316
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:02,296
- Shepard.
- <i>l need a partner for the night.</i>

317
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:03,861
<i>You up for it?</i>

318
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:07,696
- Jen?
- Don't you know any other women?

319
00:23:07,902 --> 00:23:09,130
None l can call for backup.

320
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:12,218
- You didn't think l meant--?
- That's what you have

321
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:16,011
- a whole team of agents for.
- Well, McGee's on protection duty.

322
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:17,575
<i>DiNozzo's tailing Ziva.</i>

323
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:19,181
- <i>Since l lost</i>--
- DiNozzo's what?

324
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:21,612
- He's tailing Ziva.
- <i>Well, where are you?</i>

325
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:23,215
Outside.

326
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:35,692
What are the chances
that Ari is still at this house?

327
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:37,773
Zero. Ducky was a diversion,

328
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:40,331
so your friend Ziva could pass cash
and documents to him.

329
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,413
Ziva's a control officer doing her job.

330
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,772
You'd do the same
if the roles were reversed.

331
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:46,700
- She's using you, Jen.
- And l'm using her.

332
00:23:46,902 --> 00:23:50,133
A half dozen Hamas suicide bombers
will not be blowing up our boys in lraq

333
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:52,975
- because of Ziva.
- She's Metsada, isn't she?

334
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,174
The Mossad code name
for that division is Komemiute.

335
00:23:56,382 --> 00:23:59,692
Whatever they name it,
they specialise in assassinations.

336
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:03,737
Excuse me.
Weren't you a Marine sniper?

337
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:06,416
lf l have to go through your friend
to get Ari, l will.

338
00:24:06,622 --> 00:24:07,816
Ziva knows that.

339
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:11,052
You really do like her.

340
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:14,578
She's damn good.

341
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:17,299
And l owe her.

342
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:20,137
She saved my life in Cairo
two years ago.

343
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,934
l can't believe this.

344
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:36,413
l've been a director less than 24 hours
and l'm back on the street.

345
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:39,898
- lt's great, isn't it?
- No, Jethro. lt isn't.

346
00:24:40,102 --> 00:24:42,297
Come on. Come on. You love it.

347
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:45,858
Truthfully? l'd rather be in bed.

348
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:49,010
Sleeping.

349
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:52,771
Remember that stakeout
in Marseille?

350
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:54,381
August.

351
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:57,255
Stuck in that attic with no air,

352
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:01,091
photographing everyone
who boarded that Lebanese trawler.

353
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:04,134
That second night,
that's the first time we--

354
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:05,701
Okay.

355
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:08,096
Shut up.

356
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:20,456
Hand me the binocs.
They're underneath your seat.

357
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:30,016
- What?
- That's Ari's SUV.

358
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,296
- Shooter.
- Stay down.

359
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:07,458
l expected Haswari to be older.

360
00:26:08,982 --> 00:26:10,620
He is.

361
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:24,092
Gunshot number three
is located under the right clavicle.

362
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:28,818
Appears to be a distant wound from
the absence of sooting and stippling.

363
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:34,215
Gunshot number four
is located six centimetres to the left.

364
00:26:34,382 --> 00:26:38,819
Appears to be a distant wound from
the absence of sooting and stippling.

365
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:42,816
lt's a miracle, boss.
He was shooting to kill her, not you.

366
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:45,212
Just like he did with Kate and Abby.

367
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:47,338
lt's funny how he always went
after women.

368
00:26:47,502 --> 00:26:49,140
- Not to imply
- You won't like this, Gibbs.

369
00:26:49,302 --> 00:26:51,372
- that he should have shot at you--
- All of the .308

370
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,420
full metal jacket rounds recovered
from the shooting

371
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:57,574
came from this Bravo-51 rifle

372
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,654
dropped by the sniper
you shot last night.

373
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:04,497
--two years ago. Mohamed Esfiri
was a homegrown terrorist.

374
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:06,334
Born in Cleveland.
He was an ardent follower

375
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,460
- of a radical imam who promised--
- Since Miss Sciuto confirmed

376
00:27:09,622 --> 00:27:12,659
that the sniper rifle we recovered
last night was the weapon used

377
00:27:12,822 --> 00:27:16,656
to murder Special Agent Todd,
and with no evidence to the contrary,

378
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:20,616
it appears that Mohamed Esfiri
was the sniper.

379
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:23,780
l believe it's safe for your team
to go home, Gibbs.

380
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:30,571
Special Agent Todd's funeral
is in lndiana tomorrow afternoon.

381
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:34,259
SECNAV has offered his private jet
to fly us there.

382
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:36,652
Go home. Get some rest.

383
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:56,736
What about you, Jethro?

384
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,217
Mohamed didn't kill Kate
and he didn't shoot at Abby.

385
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:02,977
You are not infallible, Jethro,
no matter what your gut is telling you.

386
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:06,054
Ari isn't trying to kill you,
but this obsession might.

387
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:08,821
- Hey, Jen?
- What?

388
00:28:08,982 --> 00:28:12,019
Why did he only shoot
at your side of the car last night?

389
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:13,581
l suppose you were right.

390
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:15,852
He was trying to kill women
who work with you.

391
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:18,252
How did he know
you were in the car?

392
00:28:18,422 --> 00:28:21,300
l called you
at the spur of the moment.

393
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,294
l parked in the dark.

394
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:26,818
He couldn't see through our windshield
even with a scope.

395
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:31,814
That guy was sent to die, not to kill.

396
00:28:32,622 --> 00:28:35,580
- No. No one's going to do that.
- Come on, Jen.

397
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:39,058
Hamas suicide bombers
blow themselves up all the time.

398
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:41,611
lt doesn't matter how they die
as long as it's for jihad.

399
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:47,340
Mohamed last night, he died
for rivers of honey and 72 virgins.

400
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:53,532
l'm not saying you're right,

401
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:56,256
but if you are, how do we prove it?

402
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:59,374
We? Did you just join my side?

403
00:28:59,582 --> 00:29:02,733
Jethro,
l've always been on your side.

404
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:08,100
- What do we do?
- Kill Ari before he kills me.

405
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:34,898
Told you she looked good.

406
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:38,172
Probie wouldn't believe me, Kate.

407
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:41,691
Thought you'd look like
<i>Return of the Living Dead</i>.

408
00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:47,533
- Did not.
- Don't lie to the dead, McGee.

409
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:50,179
Not nice.

410
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:55,814
l was a little afraid.

411
00:29:56,702 --> 00:29:58,738
Kid was terrified.

412
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:02,977
But it took a lot of guts
to come down here, alone.

413
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:08,811
Showed how much
he cared for you.

414
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:12,661
l really did like you, Kate.

415
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:16,497
A lot.

416
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:31,012
lt's raining, Gibbs.

417
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:47,495
You smell like a wet dog.

418
00:30:48,022 --> 00:30:52,732
Well, there was one here
underneath the bench when l got here.

419
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:56,698
- l put him in the gazebo.
- Why aren't you in the gazebo?

420
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:58,620
Dog smells like hell.

421
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:03,015
So why didn't you leave him under--
Never mind.

422
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:06,696
lf l ask you something, Tobias,
are you gonna lie to me?

423
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:08,136
Depends on the question.

424
00:31:08,622 --> 00:31:11,694
What's Ari Haswari's
real mission here?

425
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:13,215
l'm gonna lie to you.

426
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:18,692
Mossad lies to the ClA.
They lie to us. l lie to you.

427
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:20,011
l don't know who you lie to,

428
00:31:20,222 --> 00:31:24,738
being the bottom of the armed
Fed food chain, and not married.

429
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:26,097
So you don't know.

430
00:31:26,662 --> 00:31:30,052
Correct. l do not know.

431
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:34,332
You ever go to the movies?

432
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:37,217
l build a boat.

433
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:39,174
You and that dog
are gonna need one.

434
00:31:50,062 --> 00:31:53,372
Why don't you get out of the rain,
Jethro, and go watch a movie.

435
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:57,774
You have a film in mind?

436
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:02,180
lt's not in theatres anymore.
But you can rent a DVD.

437
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:06,373
Sounds like a good idea.
Good thing to do on a rainy afternoon.

438
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:10,692
- What's the name of this film?
- <i>The Peacemaker</i>.

439
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,739
George Clooney, Nicole Kidman.

440
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:14,580
Directed by Mimi Leder.
Made it in '97.

441
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:16,813
lt's a real action flick.

442
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:19,542
Clooney and Kidman have to find
this stolen nuclear weapon

443
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:21,141
before it's used by terrorists.

444
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:23,611
- l can't believe you never saw it.
- Where is Gibbs?

445
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:26,093
That's the first question
you asked me when we met.

446
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:29,254
No, the first question was:
''Were you having phone sex?''

447
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:32,181
Ziva.

448
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:35,015
Deputy Director David
is on teleconference for you.

449
00:32:35,942 --> 00:32:39,855
Deputy Director David?
Wouldn't be daddy, would it?

450
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:44,618
- David is a common lsraeli name.
- You didn't answer my question.

451
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:46,611
Did they lose a nuke, boss?

452
00:32:46,822 --> 00:32:50,098
According to the deputy director,
lsrael doesn't have nukes.

453
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,332
- Boss?
- They have a power plant in Dimona

454
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,333
where a small amount of plutonium
is missing.

455
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:57,461
- Hamas is making a bomb?
- They have a core. No detonator.

456
00:32:57,702 --> 00:32:59,693
Ari was to buy a krytron trigger.

457
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:02,376
He delivers it to the Hamas cell
with the plutonium.

458
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,691
Mossad grabs him.

459
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:06,331
Only he's a little behind schedule.
They're getting nervous.

460
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:11,935
Deputy Director David is up there
right now ordering Ziva to cooperate.

461
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:13,171
He her daddy?

462
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,256
No idea. l didn't ask.

463
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:22,010
Do you know why
Ari left his brass behind?

464
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:27,861
- You are a broken tape, Gibbs.
- Record, broken record.

465
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:32,934
A sniper's brass
is like signing your signature.

466
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:35,861
That's why a sniper
always polices his brass.

467
00:33:36,102 --> 00:33:40,653
Lapua .308 casing. Boat-tail.

468
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:42,739
Moly-coated full metal jacket bullet.

469
00:33:42,902 --> 00:33:44,972
That's what you shot
as a Marine sniper.

470
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:47,491
At Mossad,
we use Sierra 6.5 hollow points.

471
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:50,972
How do you know what l shot,
Miss David?

472
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:57,776
She profiled you for Ari.

473
00:33:57,942 --> 00:34:01,059
Not just the boss, that's how you knew
where l was born and went to school.

474
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:03,338
Ari's missions involved NClS.

475
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:04,730
As his controller, of course,

476
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:07,211
l did dossiers on everyone
he might interact with.

477
00:34:07,382 --> 00:34:09,054
lt's S.O.P. at Komemiute.

478
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:12,493
Director. Abs. Tony.

479
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:15,053
Give me a minute alone
with Miss David, please?

480
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:38,017
You found out
about my first wife and my daughter.

481
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:45,299
Yes. l'm sorry.

482
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:47,976
Then we know why Ari
is shooting at women then, don't we?

483
00:34:48,182 --> 00:34:50,377
lf he wanted you to know
he is the sniper,

484
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:52,652
why didn't he use your rifle?
An M40?

485
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:56,258
The Bravo 51 he fired
is called a ''Kate.''

486
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:10,056
l still don't believe Ari is the sniper.

487
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:13,092
What you have said
should be investigated.

488
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:16,578
Well, when the media gets wind
of this, it's going to create a furore.

489
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,057
- You're threatening to go to the media?
- No, not me.

490
00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:21,298
This can stay
between Mossad and NClS.

491
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:24,260
ln exchange for what?
Setting up Ari for you to kill?

492
00:35:24,462 --> 00:35:27,056
No. Setting me up for Ari.
And if l'm wrong about this,

493
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:29,258
- he won't show up.
- And if you're right?

494
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:33,139
Then l'm counting on you
to back me up.

495
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,772
Are you looking for this, Jethro?

496
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:03,172
l want you to know
l wish l hadn't had to shoot Caitlin.

497
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:06,261
Why did you?

498
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:08,574
To cause you pain.

499
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:11,853
l piss you off that much?

500
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:13,974
Not you.

501
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,610
My father.

502
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,737
You have the misfortune
of reminding me of the bastard.

503
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:25,857
He didn't marry your mother, huh?

504
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,931
That's what makes me a bastard,
not him.

505
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:34,254
From the moment of my birth,
he groomed me to be one thing,

506
00:36:34,502 --> 00:36:36,572
his mole in Hamas.

507
00:36:37,302 --> 00:36:39,691
He sent me to Edinburgh
to become a doctor

508
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:42,780
so l could work in the Gaza camps
alongside my mother.

509
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,414
When he had her killed,

510
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:48,341
l had no trouble joining
the lz Adin al-Kassam.

511
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:51,621
You don't really believe your father
had your mother killed?

512
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:56,696
lt was a retaliatory lsraeli strike

513
00:36:57,062 --> 00:37:01,101
on a day l was in Tel Aviv,
visiting him.

514
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:05,058
After decades of planning,
he had his mole in Hamas.

515
00:37:05,462 --> 00:37:08,260
He never knew
how much l hated him.

516
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:11,770
l wish l could see his face

517
00:37:11,942 --> 00:37:15,821
when he realizes
he created not a mole

518
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:17,735
but a monster

519
00:37:18,662 --> 00:37:23,099
eager to strike
at the heart of Mossad and lsrael.

520
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,170
Yeah, l almost feel sorry for you.

521
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:29,458
And l for you.

522
00:37:42,382 --> 00:37:44,896
When Ziva told me
you were placing flowers on the roof

523
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,816
where Caitlin died, l couldn't believe it.
Such a romantic touch.

524
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:51,371
Almost too good to pass up.

525
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:52,977
Almost.

526
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:55,731
Why did you?

527
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:58,980
l need you to commit suicide
with your own rifle.

528
00:37:59,382 --> 00:38:02,021
You never did give me enough credit
in our game.

529
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:05,897
l knew it was a trap before Ziva
told me you asked her to cover you.

530
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:08,297
You'd never trust Ziva.

531
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:13,134
And you need to kill me
to taste the sweetness of revenge.

532
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:18,893
l've killed enough men
in my life, Ari.

533
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:23,015
lt's gonna be just as sweet
watching you die.

534
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,412
Sorry to spoil your--

535
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:59,214
His father is a deputy director
in Mossad?

536
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:01,501
Yes.

537
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:04,654
Not David?

538
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,894
Yes.

539
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:10,731
He's my half-brother.

540
00:40:05,142 --> 00:40:07,702
l was afraid
l wasn't going to make it.

541
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:11,020
Ari?

542
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:14,335
Ziva's escorting his body to Tel Aviv.

543
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:53,415
You're late for my funeral, Gibbs.

544
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:08,893
Sorry, Kate.

545
00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:16,616
- Do you mind if l play a song for Kate?
- She was very fond of you.

546
00:41:17,222 --> 00:41:19,258
Thank you so much.

547
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:21,737
My deepest sympathies.
