1
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:05,246
Do you like Mom's new boyfriend?

2
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:07,204
- Haven't decided yet.
- l like him.

3
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:09,517
You only like him
because he bought us PSPs.

4
00:00:09,687 --> 00:00:11,040
So you don't like him?

5
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:12,845
l didn't say that. l'm just saying--

6
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:14,725
l wouldn't be too nice to him.

7
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:18,880
We play it cool, an Xbox could be
right around the corner.

8
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:21,006
What's up?

9
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,044
lt's already March, Sean.

10
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:25,675
lt's still frozen, see?

11
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:27,075
Come on.

12
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:28,919
Oh, chicken.

13
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:42,482
Who's the chicken now?

14
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:44,046
l'm coming.

15
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,603
Hurry up or l'm gonna tell Mom.

16
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:52,522
Come on, Sean.

17
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:55,083
Apricot oil, aloe vera, shea butter?

18
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:57,602
l didn't know you were so interested
in skin care.

19
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:00,124
Yeah, it's not mine. lt's McGee's.

20
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:02,682
Maybe the probie is gay.

21
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:04,519
l'm not gay, Tony.

22
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:06,962
Are you saying there's something
wrong with being gay, Timothy?

23
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,322
No, that is not what l am saying.

24
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:10,522
Bi-curious.

25
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:13,800
l suppose now you're gonna tell us
that a lot of your friends

26
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,721
are of the homosexual persuasion
and that l should be more sensitive.

27
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:21,039
No, actually, l was gonna tell you
to stay out of my desk.

28
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,562
Right, because you wouldn't
want word spreading

29
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,561
that you're ''deep moisturizing
to bring out your feminine glow.''

30
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:29,240
l have dry skin, okay?

31
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,079
My doctor recommended it.

32
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:37,641
Well, you're walking
a slippery slope there, probilicious.

33
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:40,605
Before you know it you're gonna be
taking bubble baths with your clogs on.

34
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,200
What is wrong with bubble baths?

35
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:43,686
Load up.

36
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,045
Just got a break
in the Ryan Downing case.

37
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,437
- Downing?
- Weapons company first sergeant.

38
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:50,837
Went UA last November
on leave from lraq.

39
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:52,918
Not a peep since.
What's the break, boss?

40
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:54,440
Two kids found the first sergeant

41
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,916
- floating under six inches of ice.
- lce? That means--

42
00:02:57,087 --> 00:03:00,397
You're now going to make
a really juvenile cold-case joke?

43
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,282
lt was a really good one too.

44
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:09,518
- Something wrong, boss?
- Just admiring your feminine glow.

45
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:13,643
Can't say l'm disappointed
this one's yours.

46
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,999
We'll leave the lights
if you guys return them.

47
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,837
Hey, we've worked with NClS before.

48
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:21,157
Okay, guys, up. Here we go.

49
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,555
What do you got?

50
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:25,195
Hopefully not pneumonia.

51
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,005
That could be the death of me.

52
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,839
l'm talking about the dead guy, Duck.

53
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,599
Well, technically,
paramedics have a saying

54
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,837
concerning cold-water drownings,
Agent Gibbs.

55
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:36,238
They say the victim isn't dead
until he's warm and dead.

56
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:39,479
l think we can make an exception
in this case, Mr. Palmer.

57
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:40,636
Not a drowning.

58
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,604
This pond's barely six feet deep.

59
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:46,476
Yes, l once conducted an autopsy on a
man who drowned in his kitchen sink.

60
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,121
Yes, apparently he couldn't loosen
the drain plug

61
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:51,606
and he attempted to use his teeth.

62
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:52,756
Thought you were cold.

63
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:57,566
Yes, well, it will be impossible
to determine the exact cause of death

64
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:59,922
until he thaws.

65
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:04,525
These three holes in his coat
could be crucial.

66
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:06,086
How about time of death?

67
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,080
Yeah, well decomposition
suggests, well,

68
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:12,205
- anywhere from two weeks to--
- Four months.

69
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:16,440
Depending on how many times
the pond has thawed out this winter.

70
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:18,438
- Very good, Mr. Palmer.
- Thank you.

71
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,724
Of course, l'll have to check
the meteorological data for the area

72
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,559
before we speculate further.

73
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:25,878
Let's strap him up.

74
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:29,323
l'm just saying, probie, the whole
metrosexual thing isn't working for you.

75
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:32,445
- l got it, Tony. Joke is over.
- l'm not joking, man.

76
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,280
We all know that the ladies
love a macho man

77
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:36,846
who's in touch
with his feminine side.

78
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:41,683
But l gotta tell you,
l think you're coming off a little gay.

79
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,758
Because he uses body lotion

80
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:46,487
- and likes to take bubble baths?
- Did you forget the manicure?

81
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:49,964
The manicure was only once
and it was because l tore a cuticle.

82
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:53,164
You just set off gaydar
across the entire Atlantic seaboard.

83
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,760
Tony, l am not gay.

84
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,519
This isn't about orientation.

85
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:59,599
- This is about image.
- So now your image is homo-pubic?

86
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,837
The term is ''homophobic.'' And no.

87
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:04,316
Prejudice of any kind
is an ugly thing.

88
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:07,957
Listen, girls like guys who like guys
but they like guys who like guys--

89
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:09,719
- No, Tony, back it up.
- l know.

90
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:11,206
lt's thick soup here, man.

91
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:12,846
The flashlight. Back it up.

92
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,603
What? Tree branch?

93
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:24,363
Wearing a steel-toed boot?

94
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:27,684
- Eagle eye, boss.
- Mark it.

95
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:29,565
Got another one.

96
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,763
These things always come in threes.

97
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:33,724
Already got three, DiNozzo.

98
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,758
Make it four.

99
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,007
l supposed a ''bless you''
is too much to ask for.

100
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,998
Oh, bless you, doctor.

101
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:53,637
l wasn't talking to you, Mr. Palmer.

102
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:57,800
You know, the interesting thing
about the sternutatory reflex

103
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:00,845
is that no one knows exactly
when it first began.

104
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:02,565
Many theories abound.

105
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,479
And you know them all don't you,
Dr. Mallard?

106
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:07,878
Know them? l once wrote a sonnet
on the subject for an old flame.

107
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:10,845
She suffered from
the most horrendous allergies.

108
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:12,838
Yes, how did it go?

109
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:16,684
- ''Doth thy heart skip a beat--''
- l'm not a big fan of poetry, Duck.

110
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:20,078
Well, as it turned out,
neither was she. ln fact--

111
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,965
- Why am l here?
- Why?

112
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:25,915
- Why am l here?
- You were correct earlier on, Jethro.

113
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,681
Our first sergeant didn't drown.

114
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,407
- None of our bodies did.
- They were all shot.

115
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,479
First Sergeant Downing received
the most damage.

116
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:36,046
Three in the chest.

117
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:39,116
Here, here and here.

118
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:41,039
And one to the back,
just below the heart.

119
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:42,276
That's the kill shot.

120
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:45,519
Yes, well it ruptured
his inferior vena cava.

121
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:50,404
As to our walking pictograms,
one bullet each.

122
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:53,764
- Are these gang tats?
- That's not my field of expertise.

123
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:58,125
But l've had Mr. Palmer document
the entire line for further investigation.

124
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:01,040
Some of them were quite explicit.

125
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:05,837
Jethro, this young man was shot
in the front, just below the left clavicle.

126
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:07,599
And this young man...

127
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:10,526
...was shot in the back.

128
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:12,606
This young man...

129
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:17,677
...was also shot in the back
like our first sergeant.

130
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,360
Back, front. Front, back.

131
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:21,520
The pattern is quite random.

132
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:26,124
- l believe the phrase is ''turkey shoot.''
- More like massacre.

133
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:27,561
<i>Definitely gang tats.</i>

134
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:30,801
How can you be sure?

135
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,686
Just a feeling.

136
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,405
l'm sure you know
what those are like.

137
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:35,761
Feeling, DiNozzo?

138
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,157
That, and l faxed a copy to a buddy
at the Baltimore P.D.

139
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,557
He's sending the intel
that he's got back.

140
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,046
What do you got?

141
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:44,596
l have got an upper limit
on the time frame.

142
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:52,245
lt's an ATM receipt.

143
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:54,841
lt used to be an ATM receipt.
The ink's washed off,

144
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,077
but the dimensions
matched the receipt paper used

145
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,124
by Sergeant Downing's bank.
l checked his records.

146
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:01,198
Last withdrawal November 1 8th.

147
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:04,165
- The day he was reported missing.
- No lD on the other ice cubes yet.

148
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:08,400
But the dredge team did find
a weapon. H.P. Browning.

149
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,000
- Ziva brought it down to Abby.
- Brass.

150
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,839
Nothing. lt's pretty far off
the beaten track,

151
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,565
about 500 metres
from the nearest main road.

152
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,638
- You know what that means.
- The bodies were dumped.

153
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:17,684
- By who?
- That's a good question, McGee.

154
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,439
Why don't you find me an answer?

155
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:21,598
Good question. Find me an answer.

156
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:26,524
Okay, if you slide your heel further
back it'll decrease your exposure.

157
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:28,724
Won't that throw off
my lateral balance?

158
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:32,163
Balance isn't usually
the primary concern on a mission.

159
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:34,921
- What is?
- The guy shooting back.

160
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:37,601
Which is what l'm gonna do
if you two don't get back to work.

161
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,042
Gibbs, l was the one waiting for you.

162
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:41,526
What are you waiting for now, Abs?

163
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:44,565
l ran ballistics on the Browning.

164
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:47,161
Rifling patterns indicate
it didn't fire any of the slugs

165
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,045
Ducky pulled from the first sergeant.

166
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,846
Three 9 mm Parabellums
and a .45.

167
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:55,079
Which means Downing was shot by
at least two unaccounted for weapons.

168
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,681
- l got that part.
- The dredge crew is still looking.

169
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,803
Hopefully more weapons
will turn up.

170
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:01,161
The good news is

171
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:05,002
l matched the Browning to the slugs
pulled from the other three victims.

172
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,885
- Any prints?
- No, not by a long shot.

173
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,800
And GSR would be pointless because
it's been underwater for so long.

174
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,003
But l did run the serial number.

175
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:16,399
The gun is registered
to First Sergeant Ryan Downing.

176
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,237
Looks like he went down fighting
for his life.

177
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:21,284
Or committed triple homicide.

178
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,640
MTAC, are you receiving
my video feed now?

179
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,640
Yeah, coming through.

180
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:39,083
- Which kid are we talking about here?
- Should be on your main screen.

181
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:42,361
Jethro.

182
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:44,483
The three bodies found
with First Sergeant Downing--

183
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:48,117
Were killed with his personal weapon.
l heard.

184
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:56,405
- Where are your glasses?
- Oh, l forgot them.

185
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:02,845
l don't like what it says either.

186
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:05,202
First Sergeants don't go looking
for this kind of payback.

187
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,404
- You would.
- l was only a gunny.

188
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,927
The Marine Corps is worried
his company is gonna come back

189
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:12,759
from lraq and look for revenge.

190
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,280
lt could be a bloodbath.

191
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,845
How do you drink that swill?

192
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,245
How much time do l have?

193
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,965
They were to return this week.

194
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,196
Were?

195
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,279
Their rotation's been held up
till your investigation's over.

196
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:34,405
They're still in a war zone
instead of with their families, Jethro.

197
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,003
l don't care if First Sergeant Downing
killed those gang-bangers.

198
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,044
lf he didn't, find out who did.

199
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,560
lf he did, close the case.

200
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,717
You're wrong, Jenny.

201
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,038
You do care.

202
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:54,036
Ziva, if l ask you a question,
you'll be honest with me, right?

203
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:56,118
Of course, McGee.

204
00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:02,279
What Tony was saying
about me before, you know....

205
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:04,678
Do l come off as unmanly?

206
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:07,238
l think Tony was jerking your brain.

207
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,118
Chain? Jerking my chain?

208
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:12,755
Whatever. l think you are
appropriately masculine.

209
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,482
However, perhaps not macho.

210
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:21,563
Tony and Gibbs are tough guys, yes?
They're--

211
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,957
So l'm not tough?

212
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:25,401
lf you have to ask....

213
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,159
These the other victims?

214
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:31,037
Alejandro Marquez, Jorge Rubio,
and Hector ''The Hammer'' Menendez.

215
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,562
All members of the L.V.M.

216
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,287
- L.V.M., boss, that stands for--
- La Vida Mala.

217
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:39,120
- El Salvadorian street gang.
- Not just a street gang, Gibbs.

218
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:41,517
They have 30,000 members
worldwide.

219
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:42,915
They deal drugs, run guns.

220
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:44,566
They also hire themselves out
as hit men.

221
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:48,242
Which is what two of their members
were allegedly doing a year ago,

222
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,001
when they mistakenly shot
a Private First Class--

223
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,921
Martin Reggio. A Marine from
First Sergeant Downing's company.

224
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:58,124
- We couldn't prove it.
- Downing was on a revenge mission.

225
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:01,723
First sergeants don't go
on revenge missions, Officer David.

226
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,957
l would.
Why not a Marine first sergeant?

227
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:05,719
They have more control than you do.

228
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,606
Do either one of you have
anything new to offer to this?

229
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:09,916
Yeah, boss. l think l do.

230
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:12,476
These three here,
they weren't just members of L.V.M.

231
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:14,205
According to the FBl here,

232
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,597
they are all lieutenants
in L.V.M.'s Manassas chapter.

233
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,678
- The boss?
- Miguel Sosa.

234
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:23,644
- Why are we standing here?
- He's missing.

235
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:26,116
He's been MlA since these three
disappeared a few months ago.

236
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,562
Let's go meet his replacement.
DiNozzo!

237
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,046
Where the hell have you been?

238
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,596
l come bearing gifts.

239
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,875
Spent the night
at Rock Creek Park

240
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:40,279
and l found these
when they drained the pond.

241
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:43,645
Oh, that's a big one.

242
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:49,245
- Were you expecting an attaboy?
- l thought it would be nice.

243
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:50,999
Attaboy.

244
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:53,883
- l was just doing my job, boss.
- l know that.

245
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:07,079
You wouldn't think it's the headquarters
of a worldwide crime syndicate.

246
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,316
What did you expect, McGee?

247
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,000
Corporate headquarters building?

248
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:16,637
- They're all armed.
- Keep your eyes open.

249
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,081
Spread out.

250
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:23,999
Who's <i>el jefe?</i>

251
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,883
You are, officer.

252
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:32,639
Hey.

253
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,283
We're not local cops.

254
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:38,721
We're federal agents.

255
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,083
- Who's in charge?
- ln charge?

256
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:48,645
ln charge of what?

257
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,877
The Manassas chapter
of La Vida Mala.

258
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:58,880
lnside.

259
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:08,885
You're either DEA or lmmigration.

260
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:12,084
You're not FBl. They wear suits.

261
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:13,756
NClS.

262
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:17,519
Navy cops.

263
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:21,438
What did we do to piss you off?

264
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,000
Come on, man.

265
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,044
We get blamed
for everything these days.

266
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:27,959
Help me out.

267
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:32,279
- We steal the admiral's car?
- Or his <i>calzoncillos?</i>

268
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,597
You killed two Marines.

269
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:38,884
The first in a drive-by shooting,
the other in Rock Creek Park.

270
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,525
Take me away.

271
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,518
You want one of them instead?

272
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,678
Go with the <i>federales</i>.

273
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:49,405
They need a suspect.

274
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,603
We know who did it.

275
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:58,485
You can keep those.

276
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:03,007
Don't look surprised.

277
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,725
l never seen them before.

278
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:07,320
They used to run your organization.

279
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:08,840
Organization?

280
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,479
We're a social club.

281
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:17,920
You're not <i>el jefe</i>.

282
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:21,720
No? Who am l?

283
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,558
<i>El Gordo.</i>

284
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:33,360
See? Nobody laughs at the boss.

285
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:37,206
You have <i>el jefe</i> give me a call,

286
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,757
or l book him the next seat
on the flight to Gitmo.

287
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:43,316
You can't do that.
We're not terrorists.

288
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,840
- Ziva.
- l'll have Tel Aviv produce an intercept

289
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:49,646
between Al Qaeda
and this social club.

290
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,957
- You want photos?
- That would be good.

291
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:55,164
- lt might take me 24 hours.
- Okay.

292
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:56,476
Twenty-four hours.

293
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,326
Get a surveillance team
on this taco shack.

294
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,318
Actually, it's a <i>pupusa</i> shack, boss.

295
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:13,638
- l'm just saying, tacos are historically--
- Ziva, you make sure they're visible.

296
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,445
Okay, McGee,
you come back here.

297
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,201
You pick up anybody
who's got a La Vida Mala clown tat.

298
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,642
- What for, exactly?
- l don't care, McGee.

299
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,684
Driving around the block.
l don't care, McGee.

300
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,075
Okay, you want us
to shake them up.

301
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,760
lf they're worried
we're on to something

302
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,360
they'll start talking to each other.

303
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:30,724
Get me intercepts on their cell phones,
computers, pagers, smoke signals,

304
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:32,002
any way they communicate.

305
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,600
How are we gonna get
a judge to sign?

306
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,200
Didn't you hear, McGee?

307
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,358
La Vida Mala has ties to Al Qaeda.

308
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:40,316
Well, yeah,
but weren't we just saying that--?

309
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,518
Unbelievable.

310
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:51,320
Heard you rumbled with the sharks.

311
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,955
- The sharks?
- You know:

312
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:58,843
- <i>West Side Story</i>.
- Yes, McGee was quite impressive.

313
00:16:59,007 --> 00:17:00,326
You didn't threaten them, did you?

314
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,395
Sort of.

315
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,684
l had a buddy on the Baltimore
gang unit, did that to the local L.V.M.

316
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:07,997
They found his head
in Crawford Park.

317
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,919
Never did find the rest of him.

318
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:12,647
- Think l'd lie to you?
- Yes.

319
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:15,002
To McGee l would lie.
Never to you, sir. Never to you.

320
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,283
Look out. Look out.

321
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:20,242
l hope you've earned this.

322
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,003
Oh, the director already
hooked me up.

323
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:26,647
She wanted an update.
But l didn't tell her anything, l swear.

324
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:29,640
She's been on her phone
since she got here.

325
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:31,996
Oh, that's mature.

326
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,600
You have something for me?

327
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:36,156
As a matter of fact, l do.

328
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:37,919
You looking over my shoulder again,
director?

329
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:40,396
- Why? You feel a little crowded?
- Yeah, a little.

330
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,921
- How's that?
- Better.

331
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:49,564
These are the four rounds taken
from First Sergeant Downing's body.

332
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:53,604
Three 9 mm Parabellum
and one .45.

333
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,678
l matched the .45 to the Colt.
That's a no-brainer.

334
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,917
The nine-millimetres are trickier.

335
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:00,920
But l got a definite match
on the Beretta and the TEC-9.

336
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,442
That leaves us with this final round.

337
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:06,280
The runt of the litter.
Ducky said it went in through the back

338
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:09,166
- and lodged in the chest plate.
- Kill shot.

339
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:11,204
The rifling was almost stripped.

340
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,803
lt made it almost impossible
to find out which weapon it came from.

341
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:18,277
- But l did it.
- Which one was it?

342
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:19,641
Neither.

343
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,763
We're missing a weapon.

344
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:24,997
Then we're missing a shooter.

345
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:34,317
<i>l understand you got a job to do,</i>
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

346
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:37,320
<i>My Marines have done theirs.</i>
<i>lt's time for them to come home.</i>

347
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:41,084
- l agree, captain.
- <i>Why is my company still in lraq?</i>

348
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:44,683
You lost two Marines to
a Virginia street gang, skipper.

349
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:47,520
Would you like me
to spell it out for you?

350
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:51,040
<i>Headquarters is afraid of reprisals.</i>

351
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:53,118
Not only headquarters.

352
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:55,847
PFC Reggio was killed
in a drive-by shooting

353
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:57,838
one week before your deployment.

354
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:00,397
Now your first sergeant
turns up dead?

355
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,206
<i>You think First Sergeant Downing</i>
<i>was out for revenge?</i>

356
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:07,519
His body was found in a frozen pond
with three dead gang-bangers.

357
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,804
His weapon was used to kill them.
You tell me, captain.

358
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:15,640
<i>No way. Not his style, Agent Gibbs.</i>

359
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,923
What was he doing back
on leave in the States?

360
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,918
<i>His father had cancer. Terminal.</i>

361
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,597
<i>He wanted a chance</i>
<i>to say goodbye.</i>

362
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,402
l hope he got it.

363
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,364
He was shot four times.

364
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:29,643
Kill shot was in his back.

365
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,195
<i>You're a Marine.</i>

366
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,927
<i>Do you know any first sergeants</i>
<i>that would leave their men in combat</i>

367
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:35,884
<i>to go chase after</i>
<i>some street punks?</i>

368
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:37,560
No, skipper. l don't.

369
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:38,876
<i>Neither do l.</i>

370
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,959
<i>What are you gonna do</i>
<i>about it?</i>

371
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:43,765
We're working on the case
on this end.

372
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:46,521
- As soon as l know, you'll know.
- <i>Sir!</i>

373
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,804
<i>You people had a year to catch</i>
<i>Reggio's killers and you didn't do it!</i>

374
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,320
<i>At ease, Lance Corporal Silva.</i>

375
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:54,684
- <i>But, sir.</i>
- <i>At ease, Marine.</i>

376
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,206
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

377
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:58,959
- <i>l didn't mean to</i>--
- <i>Your watch is over.</i>

378
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:00,958
- <i>We'll talk about this later.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

379
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:04,756
<i>l got 1 82 other Marines wondering</i>
<i>the same thing, Agent Gibbs.</i>

380
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:07,521
<i>Don't let them down this time.</i>

381
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,203
You looking over my shoulder again,
Jen?

382
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,279
Not exactly.

383
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,360
He's right, you know.

384
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:21,357
You can't let them down.

385
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,480
<i>El Gordo</i>'s cell phone again.

386
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,802
Probably his <i>mamacita</i>.

387
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:32,563
For a gangster,
this guy leads a pretty boring life.

388
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:43,517
Welcome to the wonderful world
of Tomas Zepeda.

389
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:45,518
He's all yours.
Kill the speaker phone.

390
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:51,003
They are exchanging greetings.

391
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:54,282
The plan for lunch.

392
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:57,439
Oh, and a double feature is scheduled.

393
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,484
- Movies?
- Nope.

394
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:05,035
Two ho's are coming over
for something called a rainbow party.

395
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:07,277
- Rainbow--
- lt's tough to translate slang.

396
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:10,041
- lt's my speciality. l'll take over.
- l know my <i>cholo</i> from my <i>chile</i>.

397
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:13,119
l'll give you the summary.
l'll give you the summary.

398
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:18,641
ls that man-lotion
working for you there, probie?

399
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,763
l didn't shave today.

400
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:22,724
l'm trying a new look.

401
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:25,799
When you say today, you mean
the last couple of minutes or...?

402
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,798
Abby seems to like it.

403
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,717
- Like what?
- lt looks nice, McGee.

404
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:32,764
lt's very manly.

405
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:34,406
May l?

406
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,964
DiNozzo.

407
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:41,122
- Hey, boss.
- Why are you touching his face?

408
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:43,243
l don't know. lt feels good,
like a bunny rabbit.

409
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:45,318
- Don't.
- Sorry.

410
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:47,443
What are the wiretaps telling us?

411
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,086
Not much.

412
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:54,605
Zepeda, the big guy,
U.S. citizen, made five calls today.

413
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:58,362
Twice to his mother, two for food,
and one just now concerning--

414
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:02,520
- Ho's. Slang for--
- l know what it's slang for, Ziva.

415
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,997
The rest of the gang's conversations
are even less promising.

416
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,204
The only member we've been
unable to listen to is Cesar Bernal.

417
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:11,155
Almost invisible, boss.

418
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:14,000
- Almost, McGee?
- He never talks on the phone.

419
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,796
Only sends and receives
text messages.

420
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:19,481
Twenty-two since yesterday.

421
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:21,603
All of them from Miguel Sosa
in San Salvador.

422
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,997
Texts are coded, but it looks
as though Sosa's still making

423
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,123
the day-to-day decisions
for the gang.

424
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:29,766
Then Bernal is his number two.

425
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:31,406
- Tony, get him in here.
- On it, boss.

426
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:33,558
Use your contacts.
Find out everything about Sosa

427
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,036
- and what he's doing in El Salvador.
- Done.

428
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:40,163
- McGee?
- Yeah.

429
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,478
You're trying too hard.

430
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:46,240
On it.

431
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,925
Your friend Zepeda's a chump.

432
00:22:57,087 --> 00:23:00,443
You're probably right.
Zepeda's an idiot.

433
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:02,962
But last l heard,
being stupid wasn't illegal.

434
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:05,243
l'm more interested
in who killed my first sergeant.

435
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:07,682
You're talking to the wrong <i>cholo,</i>
senor.

436
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:09,485
l'm just a small fish.

437
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:12,521
- Talk to the <i>jefe</i>.
- l would.

438
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:15,398
But l can't type.

439
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:18,079
How about you?

440
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:21,155
Why?

441
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:23,795
Do you want to hire me
as your secretary or something?

442
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,446
No. No, because l can't pay you

443
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:28,963
as well as your current employer,
Miguel Sosa. No, l can't do that.

444
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:31,524
You tell him
l wanna speak with him.

445
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:37,278
l delivered your Gitmo threat.

446
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:42,763
Sosa said to ask you why you let
your people live so far from work.

447
00:23:42,927 --> 00:23:48,399
That <i>vato</i> McGee, and the lsraeli
<i>chica</i>, all the way out in Silver Spring?

448
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,046
A long way, <i>si?</i>

449
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:52,004
What if they need you pronto?

450
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:55,718
Threatening my people
is never a good idea.

451
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:57,445
l'm just the messenger.

452
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,167
A messenger that knows
what happened at Rock Creek Park.

453
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,725
<i>Estoy muerto</i> if l talk to you.

454
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:06,277
<i>Estas muerto</i> if you don't.

455
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:13,520
Two Marines called Sosa
to help unload captured lraqi weapons.

456
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:15,723
Two Marines?

457
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:20,920
He sent our people to do a deal.

458
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:24,079
Figured maybe the Marines
would back off, for,

459
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,681
you know, what happened before.

460
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,599
Who was the other Marine?

461
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,238
They don't invite me to these things.

462
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:34,080
l'm just a messenger.

463
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:35,926
l don't know.

464
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:40,438
Three Marines from the company
were on leave

465
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:42,120
at the same time
as First Sergeant Downing.

466
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:44,562
Of those three,
two were nowhere near D.C.

467
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:47,685
Which leaves
Lance Corporal Jose Silva.

468
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,724
Juvenile record, suspected
pre-Corps gang activity.

469
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,196
He was also with PFC Reggio
the night he was murdered.

470
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,359
l want him on a plane. Yesterday.

471
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:06,922
Timothy, l suppose you're here
for the DOD?

472
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:08,202
Department of Defence?

473
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:10,676
- No, no. Date of death.
- Yes.

474
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:12,917
Absence of larvae
from airborne insects

475
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:16,318
indicate the bodies were thrown
into the water soon after death,

476
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:20,002
and were immersed for months
based on the presence of adipocere,

477
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,078
otherwise known as mortuary fat.

478
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:24,477
The first sergeant was stateside
on leave from mid-November.

479
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:27,036
The meteorological reports
from the area

480
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:30,483
indicate that the first hard freeze
was December 9th.

481
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:33,719
ls that aftershave l smell?

482
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:36,685
Old Spice. l had to shave midday.

483
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:40,886
Yes, l've heard about your infatuation
with lotions.

484
00:25:41,047 --> 00:25:43,607
The lotions were--
lt was for a skin condition.

485
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,564
Oh, it's quite all right, Timothy.

486
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:49,515
Skin care is something
we should all take more seriously.

487
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:52,997
ln my opinion,
there's absolutely nothing gay about it.

488
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:57,399
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

489
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:59,319
l've heard.

490
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:01,603
So a hard freeze December 9th?

491
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:06,318
Our key is that the bodies
were not frozen inside the ice,

492
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:07,761
but were below it.

493
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,042
So they died after the 9th?

494
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:11,675
No, no, no. No, human bodies sink

495
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:14,566
until the gases created
by the internal putrefaction

496
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,445
have had time to accumulate.

497
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:17,596
How long does that take?

498
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:20,679
Under the forecasted
weather conditions, ten to 1 4 days.

499
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:24,164
Bodies went into the water between
November 25th and December 9th

500
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:26,841
or they would have resurfaced and
ice would have formed around them.

501
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:28,406
Precisely.

502
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:31,525
Have we any idea what our Marine
was doing there yet?

503
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:35,521
No, Duck, l don't. But we're gonna
find out in 1 1 hours and 30 minutes.

504
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:37,040
Hey.

505
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:46,356
- How was the flight, lance corporal?
- lt was long, sir.

506
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:52,325
- How much trouble am l in?
- Trouble?

507
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,806
Why would you say that?

508
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:56,527
Four NClS agents
escorting one lance corporal?

509
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:59,201
You got it all wrong, Marine.
She's Mossad.

510
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,079
l hope you slept on the plane,
lance corporal.

511
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:12,522
Yeah. lt's gonna be a long night.

512
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:14,837
You wanna get the cash first
or the lraqi weapons?

513
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:23,878
- l'm not scaring you, am l?
- l'm fine.

514
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:27,118
l don't know
what you're talking about, sir.

515
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:31,162
Really? Because you were on leave
with First Sergeant Downing.

516
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,325
Then you were with PFC Reggio

517
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,399
the night he was killed
in the drive-by shooting.

518
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:39,001
- l can't help a coincidence.
- A coincidence, lance corporal?

519
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:41,442
Five dead bodies.
You're our only link.

520
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:46,879
Your company,
your fellow Marines, are stuck in lraq

521
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:48,685
until we solve this case.

522
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:51,361
- You don't think l know that?
- He knows. He just doesn't care.

523
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:52,755
Hey, Silva, you know what?

524
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:56,966
We had a name for guys like you
when l was on active duty.

525
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,237
Bravo Foxtrot.

526
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:00,886
lt's an explicit term for a sexual--

527
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,436
- lt wasn't supposed to happen like this.
- Like what?

528
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:08,118
lf a drive-by killing
isn't solved right away,

529
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,198
the cops forget it.

530
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:11,766
NClS forgot about it.

531
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:17,804
Private Reggio was my best friend.
He died in my arms.

532
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:20,527
l couldn't just let that go, sir.

533
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:23,360
- So you decided to turn a quick buck?
- No.

534
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:27,281
l called Sosa to meet
but not to sell him any weapons.

535
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:28,721
l wanted blood.

536
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:31,321
And your first sergeant
found out about it.

537
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:34,365
l don't know how, but he did.

538
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:36,802
He yanked my leave
and restricted me to base.

539
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,527
And he went to the meeting
in your place.

540
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:43,156
He didn't go down there
to kill anyone, sir.

541
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,318
He went down there to make peace.

542
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:47,999
To end it.

543
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:50,797
He didn't want anyone else
to get hurt.

544
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:55,082
lf l could, l'd switch places with him.

545
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:56,801
l would.

546
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:58,605
Yeah.

547
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:04,004
Yeah, l think you would,
lance corporal.

548
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:06,482
lt checks out.

549
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:09,525
Quantico gate log shows
that Downing restricted Silva to base

550
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:12,360
on November 26th
for the duration of his leave.

551
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:14,677
Lance Corporal Silva
wasn't at the pond.

552
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:15,836
He didn't kill anyone.

553
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:17,918
Thank you. l owe you one, Simon.

554
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:19,645
That was my contact
in San Salvador.

555
00:29:19,807 --> 00:29:22,082
- He locate Sosa?
- No. He's not there.

556
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,363
He has to be. Bernal's texting there
a dozen times a day.

557
00:29:24,527 --> 00:29:27,166
lf Simon says he's not
in San Salvador, then he's not there.

558
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:28,476
- He has to be.
- Gibbs, l'm--

559
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,717
lf not, we've wasted three days.

560
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:33,720
l am not wasting one more
to bring those Marines home.

561
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:36,242
You find him. Now.

562
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:47,157
Men, we are here today
for three reasons.

563
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,836
One, we can't find Miguel Sosa.

564
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:57,123
Two, l'm not even sure
that he exists.

565
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:58,800
And three--

566
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:00,161
Who were you talking to?

567
00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:06,999
You will address me as ''sir,'' soldier.

568
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:10,079
Sorry. Who were you talking to, sir?

569
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:12,559
My army.

570
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:14,519
Major Mass Spec.

571
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,201
Captain Comparison Microscope.

572
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:19,005
- Ensign--
- lsn't an Army rank.

573
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:20,919
lt's actually Navy.

574
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,046
What do you want, McGee?

575
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:26,038
To go over the old text messages

576
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:27,959
between Cesar Bernal
and his boss, Miguel Sosa.

577
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,879
- They're in code.
- l know. But if we break them,

578
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:32,277
we might find where Sosa's hiding.

579
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:36,043
- He's in San Salvador.
- Ziva's people say no.

580
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:39,438
Oh, so if Ziva's people say no,
then we--

581
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:42,360
- Abby, please, just run them.
- Okay.

582
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,997
My Spanish is a little rusty.

583
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:48,646
Mine's not.

584
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:53,927
Okay, in this one
they're asking Sosa if they should--

585
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:56,597
- Wait a minute.
- What?

586
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:58,966
lt's too long.

587
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:02,881
SMS text messages are limited to
1 50 characters. So that means--

588
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:06,164
lt means that it was e-mailed
from a computer, not a cell phone.

589
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:07,999
Can you backtrace it
to a physical location?

590
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:11,364
Just a simple matter of accessing
the e-mail-to-SMS gateway,

591
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:14,200
pulling an lP, linking to an lSP.

592
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:15,800
That's a Virginia address.

593
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:17,923
Ziva's people were right.

594
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:20,681
Let me see if we can get a name
of the account holder.

595
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,122
Cesar Bernal?

596
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:24,800
That doesn't make any sense.

597
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,481
Why would he send messages
to himself?

598
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:30,366
Because he was pretending
he's Miguel Sosa.

599
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:32,563
Okay, but that's stupid.

600
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:34,843
Because Sosa would totally find out
and kill Cesar.

601
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:37,202
Not if Cesar killed him first.

602
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:44,117
What is this meal gonna cost me
this time?

603
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:45,766
Didn't cost you any last time.

604
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:49,721
You mean aside from the thousand
extra calories l didn't need?

605
00:31:49,887 --> 00:31:51,002
l can leave.

606
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,725
l didn't say that.

607
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,762
Salvadorian food?

608
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:58,518
How fried.

609
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:01,245
Sit. l'm sorry.

610
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:08,964
Another Marine was injured
in Captain Arvidas' group.

611
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,401
l know.

612
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,605
l heard you found the man responsible
for First Sergeant Downing's death.

613
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:19,156
His name is Cesar Bernal.

614
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:22,479
Can you make a case?

615
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:26,238
l knew this meal
was gonna cost me.

616
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:29,717
Okay, what do you have so far?

617
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:33,239
Cesar is making a power play
for control of his crew.

618
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:36,126
He's been faking orders
from Miguel Sosa

619
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,847
to the rest of L.V.M.
for the last four months.

620
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:40,918
And Sosa?

621
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:42,406
He's dead.

622
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:45,240
lt's the only way Cesar
could have gotten away with it.

623
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:49,202
So First Sergeant Downing
wasn't the target.

624
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,119
He was Cesar's lure.

625
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:54,518
The real targets
were the three L.V.M. lieutenants.

626
00:32:55,727 --> 00:32:57,718
Cesar was taking out the leadership.

627
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:00,279
Do you have any physical evidence?

628
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:02,517
Nothing linking Cesar
to the crime scene.

629
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:04,759
Jethro, you're gonna need
more than motive

630
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:06,758
to get a jury to convict.

631
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:10,518
Depends on the jury.

632
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:18,320
This is harassment.

633
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:22,879
When l get out of here,
l'm going to get me a fancy lawyer

634
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:25,083
and shove him all the way up your--

635
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:26,521
Come on, it was just getting good.

636
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:28,757
Okay, who wants to take him first?

637
00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:32,044
- l'm gonna take him.
- Oh, no, no, no. l got it, probie.

638
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:35,964
What, do you think
l can't handle this guy?

639
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:37,556
Gibbs said keep him on ice.

640
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:40,287
Not show him the warning signs
of osteoarthritis.

641
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,195
Tony, l can break this guy.

642
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,846
You keep cracking
your knuckles like that,

643
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:45,679
you're gonna break a finger, probie.

644
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:48,202
l'm senior. l go first.

645
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:52,406
- You're always gonna be senior.
- Nice thing about being senior is that--

646
00:33:56,767 --> 00:34:00,077
So l cooperate with you
and this is the thanks l get?

647
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,363
Hauled in like a <i>pescado muerto?</i>

648
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:04,085
lf by cooperate you mean lie, yes.

649
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:06,044
What did l lie about?

650
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:09,244
We know you were at the Rock Creek
Pond the night of the murders,

651
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:12,444
and we know you've been killing off
the L.V.M. leadership to assert control.

652
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:15,201
You must think very highly of me,

653
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,927
because the man who can pull off
something like that,

654
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:20,726
must be a very smart man.

655
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:25,402
You like smart men, <i>bonita?</i>

656
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:31,607
Sorry. You're not my type.

657
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:33,837
You're playing with fire, <i>bonita</i>.

658
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,562
- ls that a threat?
- No.

659
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:44,278
l'm just saying, my <i>éses</i> get
very lonely when l'm not around.

660
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:46,642
And they're not going to be too happy
with the one

661
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:48,399
that's keeping me from them.

662
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,523
l wouldn't worry about it.

663
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:54,157
l'm sure your <i>éses</i> will find something
to do while you're gone.

664
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:05,562
The autopsy of First Sergeant
Downing revealed four entry wounds.

665
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:10,164
However, of interest is the fact
that the three frontal wounds

666
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:12,887
showed no sign
of internal haemorrhaging.

667
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:16,722
The shots were fired after
First Sergeant Downing was dead.

668
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,605
Each of your buddies...

669
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:23,165
...put a bullet in his corpse.

670
00:35:26,647 --> 00:35:27,636
Your point?

671
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:32,280
The point is if your buddies each fired
a round into the first sergeant

672
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:36,326
after he was dead, who shot them?

673
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:48,001
l want to talk to my lawyer.

674
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:52,002
<i>No can do, punk.</i>

675
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:59,558
You've been watching
too many cop shows, know that?

676
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:05,076
Yeah, well you've been watching
too many gang-person shows.

677
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:09,077
l don't think probie's
been watching enough cop shows.

678
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:11,556
McGee is a capable interrogator.

679
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,480
He can be quite intimidating
when he wants to be.

680
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:18,878
You can't keep me here like this.

681
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:20,765
No, actually, l can.

682
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:24,397
You see, La Vida Mala
has suspected ties to Al Qaeda.

683
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:28,960
So all l have to do
is say the word ''terrorist,''

684
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:32,961
and l can keep you in this room
till you grow old and die.

685
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:37,478
That actually was intimidating.

686
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:40,965
We can tell from the rifling patterns

687
00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:43,960
that the slugs pulled
from your three dead L.V.M.'s

688
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:46,800
were from the Browning
found at the scene. Nice tat.

689
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:49,435
Your Draconkreuz?

690
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,518
- The symbol of the ancient order of--
- Abby.

691
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:55,881
Sorry, Gibbs. The point is that
whoever shot your guys

692
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,083
used First Sergeant Downing's gun.

693
00:36:58,247 --> 00:37:00,238
He wanted to make it look like
our first sergeant

694
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:02,079
smoked your <i>muchachos</i>.

695
00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:05,319
Of course, your crew probably
would have only turned their backs

696
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:08,524
to the shooter if it was someone
they really trusted.

697
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:22,397
So, like,
you don't got no questions for me?

698
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:24,476
That's a double negative.

699
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:28,007
''Don't got no'' is a double negative.

700
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:32,206
lt's a non-standard use of two
negative words in the same sentence.

701
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:34,358
They cancel each other out
and create a positive.

702
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:37,564
ln Shakespeare's day, the double
negative was used as an emphatic.

703
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:39,797
But now it's just considered
a mistake.

704
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:43,157
Don't know if that's what
you intended. Pretty sure it's not.

705
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,887
We'll go with the colloquial
idiomatic thing. This is hard.

706
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:48,083
l'm pretty sure you meant:
''Do l have any questions?''

707
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:50,807
And the answer to that question is:
''l have no questions.''

708
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:52,605
l do have some
observations, though.

709
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,439
Cesar. That's an interesting name.

710
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,565
Obviously derived from Caesar.
That was a powerful dude.

711
00:37:57,727 --> 00:37:59,445
My name's Anthony.
Friends call me Tony.

712
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:01,598
Which backwards is ''why not.''

713
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:04,759
Anyway, in the pecking order,

714
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:07,282
l'm guessing that you're somewhere
between the guy that goes out

715
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:10,678
and buys the spray paint
that you use for tagging

716
00:38:10,847 --> 00:38:13,077
and the guy who digs it out
from under your boss' nails.

717
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,399
You don't know who
you're messing with.

718
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:22,359
One word from me
and my crew will have you splattered--

719
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:23,960
- Your crew?
- Yes.

720
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:27,164
Well, that's funny. l thought L.V.M.
was Miguel Sosa's crew.

721
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:32,445
lnteresting.

722
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:34,485
Miguel Sosa.

723
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:37,559
Word on the street is he is hiding out
in El Salvador.

724
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:40,719
Except the FBl has no record
of him leaving the country.

725
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:43,845
Salvadorian authorities
have no record of him coming in.

726
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:47,238
So the only trail we have is the SMS
text messages he's been sending you.

727
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:49,841
The problem is,
he hasn't been sending them.

728
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:52,646
El Salvador country code
has been falsified.

729
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:55,321
Someone faked them to make them
look like they came from Miguel Sosa.

730
00:38:55,967 --> 00:39:00,563
Messages originated from an e-mail
account registered to Cesar Bernal.

731
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:02,841
He killed your boss.

732
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,918
Played you for a fool.

733
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:06,202
Us too.

734
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:09,359
He'll never get a conviction in court
with what l have on him.

735
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,120
Hey, boss.

736
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:24,561
Right. l see.

737
00:39:24,727 --> 00:39:27,480
You were all trying
to throw me off balance.

738
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:30,684
Soften me up for the big guns, eh?

739
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:34,998
Actually,
l didn't know you were still here.

740
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,397
Come on, l'll drive you home.

741
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:41,317
Wear your safety belt.

742
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,646
Door-to-door service.

743
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:51,162
l could get used to this.

744
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,325
What's the matter?

745
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:58,556
You're pissed because whatever game
you tried to play didn't work?

746
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,845
You got a lot to learn
about the streets, <i>cabron</i>.

747
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:09,276
Loyalty means everything in our world.
Without it, <i>estas muerto</i>.

748
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,038
Thanks for the lift.

749
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:28,840
<i>Semper fi.</i>

750
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,164
Goodbye, Cesar.

751
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:47,164
These NClS <i>pendejos</i> just won't quit.

752
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:50,160
l got a message from Sosa.

753
00:40:50,327 --> 00:40:54,081
He thinks we ought to teach them
some manners.

754
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:00,446
What?

755
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:02,359
<i>The victim, a male in his early 20s,</i>

756
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:06,122
<i>was found in this dumpster,</i>
<i>shot repeatedly at close range.</i>

757
00:41:06,287 --> 00:41:08,517
<i>Police have identified him</i>
<i>as Cesar Bernal,</i>

758
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:10,200
<i>a native of El Salvador,</i>

759
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:14,201
<i>and say they believe he has close ties</i>
<i>to gang activity in the Manassas area.</i>

760
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:16,437
<i>ln fact, police say he</i>--

761
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,802
You don't have work to do,
l'm sure l can find some.

762
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:22,277
- No. l got a lot of work to do, boss.
- There's lots of work.

763
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:24,160
Good.

764
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:26,477
l'll be in MTAC.

765
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:36,961
- Captain.
- <i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

766
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,516
<i>l hope you have</i>
<i>some good news for me.</i>

767
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:41,962
Bring our boys home.
