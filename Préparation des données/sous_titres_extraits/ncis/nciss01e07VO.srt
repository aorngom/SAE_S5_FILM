1
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:07,595
- Very, very nice.
- Well, thanks.

2
00:00:07,637 --> 00:00:09,329
You are welcome.

3
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,097
Let's have some champagne.

4
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,285
- Coming true.
- Coming true.

5
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,215
- It's done.
- Good.

6
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:33,545
I gotta go.

7
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,337
.: Team UnderCovers :.

8
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,727
NCIS Los Angeles
1x07 - PushBack

9
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:30,793
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

10
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:35,030
- You don't drink tea.
- No, I don't.

11
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:38,198
- I'm making it for Hetty.
- You're making tea for Hetty?

12
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,416
I promised her I'd try some.

13
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,120
"Yellow Mountain Tribute

14
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:45,705
Chrysanthemum tea."
Nice.

15
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,171
That smells moldy.

16
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,451
Maybe it's supposed to smell moldy.

17
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,875
You think I should say
something to her?

18
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,274
They didn't train you
for that at SEAL school?

19
00:03:00,316 --> 00:03:01,469
Escape and evade.

20
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:05,434
How's our tea?

21
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,104
Right here, Hetty.

22
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,581
Did you warm the pot
the way I told you to?

23
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:11,857
- I did.
- And the water?

24
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,860
- Fresh off the boil.
- Excellent.

25
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,029
You must never underestimate

26
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,365
the cardiovascular benefits of tea.

27
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,035
You'll thank me in the morning.
Mr. Callen?

28
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,161
I'm good.

29
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:28,499
And you can't taste the paper?

30
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:33,712
Well, now,

31
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:37,453
Chrysanthemum tea is
not Chrysanthemum tea

32
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:40,677
without wolfberries.

33
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,012
"Wolfberries."

34
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,097
Now, I want you to savor that,

35
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,142
and consider its calming qualities,

36
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:49,520
not to mention its health benefits.

37
00:03:58,534 --> 00:03:59,530
It's delicious.

38
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,412
That phone call is for you.

39
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,110
Director Vance.

40
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:22,719
Yes, Director.

41
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:25,352
Standby.

42
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:29,385
How does she do that?

43
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:32,354
I don't know, but that's the worse tea
I've ever had in my entire life.

44
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:51,832
Moldy.

45
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:55,627
<i>Got a call from the LAPD.</i>

46
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:58,084
<i>A woman was killed in an apartment</i>

47
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:00,078
<i>overlooking the marina
a couple of days ago.</i>

48
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:02,342
<i>They found a USB micro drive</i>

49
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,102
<i>hidden in her baseball cap.</i>

50
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,229
<i>Had a file...</i>

51
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,934
<i>filled with what looks
like surveillance photos.</i>

52
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,085
<i>Different locations,
different people.</i>

53
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:11,935
- Anyyone we know?
- <i>Yes.</i>

54
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:14,104
<i>You, Agent Callen.</i>

55
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,024
<i>LAPD ran the photos through</i>

56
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,031
<i>a facial recognition program.
Yours is the only one that got a hit.</i>

57
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,881
<i>When they identified
your classified status, they called me.</i>

58
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:28,526
- Who was the victim?
- <i>Haven't been able to identify her yet.</i>

59
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,371
<i>Someone's been watching you.</i>

60
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:34,875
<i>I need to know who.
Need to know why.</i>

61
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,820
<i>Anything you might have forgotten
to tell me about?</i>

62
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:39,796
Not that it would explain this.

63
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,675
LAPD's on board with us
being involved in the investigation?

64
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,177
<i>Full access.</i>

65
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,055
<i>I e-mailed Eric their file, along
with the contents of the flash drive.</i>

66
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,474
<i>If you find anything that links this</i>

67
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,853
<i>to you getting shot six months ago,
I need to know.</i>

68
00:05:54,826 --> 00:05:57,392
<i>Do I need to write that down
for you, Agent Callen?</i>

69
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:00,635
- I think I get it.
- <i>Watch your back.</i>

70
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:09,701
Low-level encryption on a USB drive.
Where do you want to start?

71
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,060
- Paparazzi.
- It's good a place as any.

72
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:17,614
That's near
your old apartment in Venice.

73
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,127
Just before I got shot.

74
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:21,387
You said you felt
like you were being watched.

75
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,891
They carried out surveillance,
pinpointed your home location

76
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,694
and made the hit
right there on the street.

77
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,654
Mixed angles: some high

78
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:30,855
from upper story-level windows,
some low at the street level.

79
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:33,837
- All shot with a telephoto lens.
- Over how many days, G?

80
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:35,311
Two or three.

81
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,722
LAPD file.

82
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,392
Crime scene photos
of our unidentified victim.

83
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,139
Furniture all seems
to be fold-and-carry,

84
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,908
so she brought it in herself.

85
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,440
Maybe the apartment was vacant.

86
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:05,257
That's her.

87
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:07,634
The russian girl.

88
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,619
Who's the russian girl?

89
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:12,597
The last person I saw
before I got shot.

90
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,122
A lot of surveillance photos
of the same guy.

91
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:33,932
None of them very clear.

92
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:37,122
Not a great photographer,
your russian girl.

93
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,875
Not a willing subject.

94
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,994
Can we find out
when they were taken?

95
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,502
The data's embedded in the JPEGs.

96
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,978
All right, oldest photo
was taken eight days ago,

97
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,550
and the most recent was yesterday.

98
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:50,307
The day she died.

99
00:07:51,365 --> 00:07:52,873
Long-term surveillance.

100
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,850
She was working for someone.

101
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:57,601
Whoever this guy is, he doesn't
like having his picture taken.

102
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:00,395
Did you get enough data
to get a match on his face?

103
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,431
I doubt it.

104
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:04,399
I mean, he's either too far away,
partially obscured or blurry.

105
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:08,070
But I will give it a shot.

106
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,170
Some of the photos
were taken at a marina.

107
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:13,165
Including the photos of her.

108
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:16,685
Her body was found in an apartment
in Marina Del Rey, too.

109
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,043
This mystery guy on the yacht...

110
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:26,299
We're going to have to try
to sharpen up these photos

111
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:28,328
before we run them
through facial recognition.

112
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,674
What did I miss?

113
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:32,716
Unnamed dead russian girl
who saw Callen get shot.

114
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,433
Otherwise known as a "lead".

115
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:38,681
Callen's cold case
just got warmed up.

116
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,072
I need access to a personnel file.

117
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,113
In your position
as our headshrinker,

118
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,406
you should already have
complete access.

119
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,492
I think my file's
a little out of date.

120
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,037
What name?

121
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:00,632
Callen.

122
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:21,518
Anything in particular
you're looking for?

123
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,895
The investigation
into Callen's shooting.

124
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:27,816
Still unsolved.

125
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,160
You worried this case
may open old wounds?

126
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,954
I'm hoping we can help heal them.

127
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,792
November, alpha, forslash,

128
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,390
seven, nine, four.

129
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,505
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

130
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:14,949
You sure you want to do this?

131
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:17,199
- I'm fine.
- Sure you're allowed to do this ?

132
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,909
Investigating his own shooting?

133
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,162
It's not my shooting,
it's a Russian girl's.

134
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,413
He'll keep investigating
until someone tells him he can't.

135
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,707
- Someone I have to listen to.
- Rules me out.

136
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,828
You never listen to me
even when you have to

137
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,926
Name one time.

138
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:31,254
- You're not listening to me now.
- Yeah, I am.

139
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,429
No, you're not.

140
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,634
How long you two been married?

141
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:40,353
Thanks.

142
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,607
- Unfurnished.
- It's on the market.

143
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:55,904
She was sitting here.

144
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,520
Back to the door.

145
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,322
Shooter came up from behind her.

146
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,062
See that blood spatter?
It starts low

147
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:06,195
and then rises, which means
she never stood up.

148
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:07,963
Excuse me.

149
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:10,752
Laptop power cable

150
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,476
and video lead right there.

151
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,991
Killer took the laptop
and the video camera with him.

152
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:17,678
Missed the micro drive
that was tucked away in her ball cap.

153
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,279
Hello.

154
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:23,551
I've got three scuff marks here.

155
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,725
Camera was on a tripod

156
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:28,701
right about...

157
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:30,355
here.

158
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:31,940
The angle's about right.

159
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:35,096
The guy she was watching
was on one of those yachts out there.

160
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:39,639
You can't just camp out in an apartment
without anybody knowing.

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,951
- What about the apartment manager?
- He says he didn't know she was here.

162
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:46,102
- So where did she get a key?
- Maybe she didn't have one.

163
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,124
She could've snuck in.
Maybe she's a pro.

164
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,217
She's not a professional.

165
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:53,878
A pro wouldn't leave
their back to the front door.

166
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,341
She had a key.

167
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,561
- How many bedrooms?
- Just me.

168
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:06,521
- Ocean view or marina?
- What's the difference?

169
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:08,384
- About $300.
- A month?

170
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,813
A week, sweetie.
I know some cheap places on Pico.

171
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,274
I'll get you the number.

172
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,234
Listen,
I just need something short-term.

173
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,165
I don't even have
any furniture. I just...

174
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,655
I just need a place to crash.

175
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:22,240
How short-term?

176
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,957
Three weeks.

177
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:27,489
It's going to have
to be cash in advance.

178
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:31,416
I got a vacancy.

179
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:33,732
New owner's moving in
in about a month.

180
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,137
$300 a week,

181
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:39,508
or we could work out
some other sort of arrangement.

182
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,513
Less than 40 seconds.

183
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:47,386
What?

184
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:50,369
Less than 40 seconds!

185
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,438
- She's good.
- She's better than good.

186
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,731
We owe ten bucks.

187
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:56,316
Five a piece.

188
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,860
You bet her she couldn't get him
to make it in under a minute.

189
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,820
And you stood there
and let me do it.

190
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,906
I'm not giving you 5 dollars.

191
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:04,812
- No you're not?
- No.

192
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,355
She's good.

193
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,206
- Who's that?
- Ever heard of NCIS?

194
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,585
FBI? DEA? CIA?

195
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,758
This is just a misunderstanding.
I was trying to help you out.

196
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:22,064
Just like you tried
to help out the Russian girl

197
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:24,214
who was found killed
in the apartment this week?

198
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:27,128
I guess you forgot to tell the LAPD

199
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,016
that you rented her
the apartment for... cash.

200
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,686
- Freddy?
- It's Teddy.

201
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:35,688
Cute.

202
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,489
Security footage
from the apartment building.

203
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:41,964
Funny how the apartment manager
suddenly "remembered"

204
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:43,822
he hadn't deleted
the security footage.

205
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,326
- What did it cost her for the room?
- Her life.

206
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,091
Her body was found Sunday evening.

207
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:55,625
Coroner placed
her time of death at 5:30 p.m.

208
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:57,710
Fast-forwarding to Sunday.

209
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,005
Looking for our killer leaving
with her bag and a camera tripod.

210
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:04,592
Gotcha.

211
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,223
- All right, time stamp says 5:47.
- That's got to be our guy.

212
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,727
He's facing away. Let's see
where he's looking when he arrives.

213
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,904
- He knew the camera was there.
- He's a pro.

214
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:26,646
Yeah, he is good.

215
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:30,535
But he's not great.
He did leave the USB drive behind.

216
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:32,620
That's not the only thing
that he missed.

217
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,207
She was backing up her files
onto a virtual storage account.

218
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,584
From the apartment?

219
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,586
Tapped
into the apartment's wireless router.

220
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:42,755
- Does she have a name?
- User name only: Citizen25.

221
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:47,969
That is a lot of files
to scroll through.

222
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,514
OK, start to beginning.

223
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:03,443
- You want to share, G?
- File named Cossack, Dom.

224
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:07,228
And what's Cossack?

225
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,491
Joint operation in Europe
against the Russian mafia.

226
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:13,745
Boy.

227
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:15,663
Three-man team.

228
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:17,040
Ethan Stanhope.

229
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:19,454
He works for the CIA.

230
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:20,668
Ricky Taylor.

231
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:24,047
DEA. Same as me.

232
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,215
When?

233
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,175
Ten years ago.

234
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:29,969
I got something.

235
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:31,429
Stanhope

236
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,972
and Taylor are both dead.

237
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:35,547
Murdered.

238
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:37,769
Stanhope in Vegas.
Taylor in Chicago.

239
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:40,230
And they were both killed
on the same day...

240
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:41,523
Fifth of May.

241
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,095
<i>Stay with me.
Don't do this to me. Come on!</i>

242
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,571
The same day I should have died.

243
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,004
Traffic cam captured Stanhope
being shot in Las Vegas.

244
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,340
Taylor's shooting in Chicago
was also a drive-by,

245
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,481
- Same as...
- Mine.

246
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,149
Anybody charged for either murder?

247
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,189
When's the last time
you saw those guys?

248
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:21,312
When we were debriefed in Berlin

249
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,773
I haven't seen them in ten years.

250
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,525
Did you ever catch the bad guys?

251
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,937
It was a joint operation
with Russia.

252
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,442
There was a syndicate trying
to manipulate the flow of oil

253
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:33,908
from the Black Sea
into Europe, and...

254
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,952
someone let them know
that were coming.

255
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,974
- How come DEA was involved?
- Loan out.

256
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:42,508
Taylor and I both
spoke fluent Russian.

257
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,294
CIA set it up?

258
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:49,007
Stanhope was their point person.
But we only ever saw him in the bar

259
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,593
drinking expensive vodka
and eating caviar.

260
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:53,886
Did you ever find who betrayed you?

261
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:56,848
So...

262
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,901
some Russian girl gets killed
while running surveillance

263
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:02,467
on an unidentified guy on a yacht,

264
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:05,732
which is somehow connected
to an operation in Russia ten years ago.

265
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:09,074
Who was the Russian contact
for Operation Cossack?

266
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,487
Arkady Kolcheck.

267
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:15,225
He was an officer in the KGB.
Last-known address would be Moscow.

268
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,583
The dead girl had files
of people that were targeted,

269
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,092
not anyone named Kolcheck.

270
00:17:19,344 --> 00:17:20,622
Eric, dead or alive?

271
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:23,446
Alive... and well.

272
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:26,169
And as of 2007,
an American citizen living in...

273
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:27,719
Studio City.

274
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,221
Makes you wonder
where Arkady was on the fifth of May?

275
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:35,053
Eric, I need that address.
Already downloaded into your GPS.

276
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:37,029
I need to know
who that was on the yacht.

277
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:38,486
- Working on it.
- Kensi?

278
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,526
I need a profile on Arkady.
Everything you can get.

279
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:43,647
His friends, his business associates,
allies, enemies...

280
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:46,752
I want to know why he left the KGB
in Russia and who he paid to get here.

281
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:48,035
Work with Nate.

282
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:52,720
- Arkady Kolcheck.
- You know him?

283
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,698
We've met once or twice.

284
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:57,492
Read about him in Callen's file.

285
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,869
- Was there a lot to read?
- Pages.

286
00:18:00,276 --> 00:18:02,357
And 90% of it was redacted.

287
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:06,084
Censored by whomever it is
who redacts things.

288
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:09,102
Can we get an uncensored copy?

289
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,341
Have you ever tried
Egyptian Licorice Mint tea?

290
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,274
Where does she get all this stuff?

291
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:27,647
None of it's redacted,
not a single word.

292
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:30,379
What if she's the redactor?

293
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:32,877
There's a scary thought.

294
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,651
Hetty is the clearing house
for every censored government document

295
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:37,056
released to the public.

296
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,839
That's impossible.

297
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:45,879
Ridiculous.

298
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:47,960
Anyway...

299
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,847
Arkady's done well for himself.

300
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,796
He's a security consultant

301
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:54,799
retained by big business
and foreign governments alike.

302
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:59,262
And it pays well. He's got properties
in New York City, Los Angeles and Paris.

303
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,106
So how does a former KGB agent

304
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:04,627
end up so wealthy, so fast?

305
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:08,648
Because he knows
where the bodies are buried.

306
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,504
Most likely because he's the one
who buried them.

307
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,451
We got a plan?

308
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,254
How about we kick
in his door and ask him

309
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,238
why he's the only one
of us that didn't get shot?

310
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,614
I've used that one before,
it's a very effective plan.

311
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,094
It's good as long as you know
what's behind the door. Always works.

312
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:34,213
Yes, Eric?

313
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,340
<i>All right, good news and bad news.</i>

314
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,011
The bad news is
that Arkady's house is state of the art.

315
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,181
It is seriously impressive.
He spent a small fortune on security.

316
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,819
The grounds are covered with a network
of electronic motion sensors

317
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:50,487
and microphones. He's got infrared
and high-definition daylight cameras.

318
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:52,732
And it's a closed system.
I can't even access it.

319
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:54,927
That's an impressive door.

320
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,250
Might have to kick it a few times.

321
00:19:57,545 --> 00:19:58,846
- Good news?
- Good news is

322
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:01,574
the car's equipped
with a GPS device. I hacked into it.

323
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:02,985
He's on the move.

324
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,744
It is a Maybach.

325
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,324
We're feeding it to your GPS.

326
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,873
It should show up any second
on your screen as a red icon.

327
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,796
He's actually coming towards us.

328
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:15,935
Turning left into...

329
00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:17,590
Left into what?
I need a street name.

330
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,008
Where's he going?

331
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:22,751
We're not going with him if you don't
tell me which street to turn down.

332
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:24,055
Shopping.

333
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,638
He's going shopping.

334
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:27,424
Let's go shopping.

335
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,852
Let's go shopping.

336
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,681
Body guards are tight, discipline.

337
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:44,092
Probably former military.

338
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:45,701
That's him?

339
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:47,855
That's him.

340
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:51,219
You got another plan?

341
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,798
I guess that's plan B?

342
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,714
I got it.

343
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:27,714
Tanner, on your six.

344
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:37,345
- I thought I recognized you.
- Do I know you?

345
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:38,462
Nah, but my fiancée.

346
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,090
- I'm sorry?
- Now you want to apologize?

347
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,426
- "Apologize"?
- You didn't think I'd find out?

348
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:46,670
Everyone, look at this home-wrecker!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

349
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:48,231
- He's even got kids!
- Back off.

350
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,420
I'm not your friend
and I'm not his friend!

351
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:53,202
- What is it with this guy?
- I'm trying to tell him

352
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,062
- I don't know him.
- You got the wrong guy.

353
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,731
Joelene. Tuesdays

354
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,222
and Fridays in the storeroom
behind the florist shop!

355
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:01,277
Don't even try to deny it.
I got witnesses.

356
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,322
I don't know you.
And I don't know Joelene.

357
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,697
A light mustache.
Big-legged Joelene,

358
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:09,327
with the Jheri curls.

359
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,662
All of a sudden now,
you ashamed to know Joelene?

360
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,540
She ain't good enough for you?
That's my girl!

361
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:21,005
Nice car, Arkady.

362
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,254
It's all right, Alex.

363
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,722
Mr. Callen is a friend
from the old days.

364
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,145
- I heard you were dead.
- Like Stanhope and Taylor?

365
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,817
And I alone, unscathed.
You think I was responsible?

366
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:42,860
Were you?

367
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:50,346
Give me a reason to believe you.

368
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,913
I sent someone to warn you.

369
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:57,403
I tried to warn Stanhope
and Taylor as well.

370
00:22:57,629 --> 00:22:59,001
You sent who to warn me?

371
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,712
A Russian girl.

372
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:07,445
- Why didn't you just warn me yourself?
- I know you didn't trust me

373
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:10,763
because of what happened
in Moscow ten years ago.

374
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:14,183
What makes you think
I would trust some Russian girl?

375
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,561
You knew her.

376
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,276
When you were a boy,
you used to bounce her on your knee.

377
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,046
- Her name was...
- Alina.

378
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,410
Her name was Alina.

379
00:23:46,744 --> 00:23:48,340
Nice crib, Arkady.

380
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:52,346
- How did you know about her?
- You told me ten years ago.

381
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,520
When I asked you
where you learned Russian,

382
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:57,646
you said "from a little girl

383
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,937
named Alina Rostoff."

384
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:04,213
I filed it away.

385
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,057
Is there anything
you don't file away?

386
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:10,456
Everything is useful
sooner or later.

387
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:14,127
I heard rumors that...

388
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:16,746
someone had targeted us.

389
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:20,458
I tried to contact everyone,
warn them,

390
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:23,786
- tell them to be careful.
- Seen Joelene?

391
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,158
But Stanhope and Taylor,
they had retired,

392
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:30,342
lost...

393
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,669
to the dream you Americans
so fervently pursue.

394
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:36,773
You were the only one
left in the game, G.

395
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,317
So, I called in a favor, got an address
where you might be living.

396
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,816
I knew... if she found you,
you would believe her.

397
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:47,761
You didn't think I'd believe you?

398
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:51,905
- Do you?
- Not yet.

399
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:59,371
But I barely knew her.
I was 14, she was four years old.

400
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,085
That's how she said
she would greet you.

401
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,837
And you would remember her.

402
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:08,978
She tried once.

403
00:25:15,117 --> 00:25:16,574
I scared her away. I...

404
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:19,433
The second time, it was too late.

405
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:22,391
She wept for you.

406
00:25:25,946 --> 00:25:28,287
She thought you were dead.
We all did.

407
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:31,390
Callen was lucky.
Stanhope and Taylor weren't.

408
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,447
So what does that make you, Arkady?

409
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:34,865
Prepared.

410
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:38,656
The day you were shot,
they came for me.

411
00:25:38,698 --> 00:25:40,570
Since then, two more times.

412
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:43,374
- They're beginning to annoy me.
- Who are they?

413
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:46,210
You remember what

414
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,045
Operation Cossack was about?

415
00:25:48,878 --> 00:25:49,755
Of course,

416
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,774
the Russian mafia was being paid off

417
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,959
to allow the flow
of Russian oil into Europe.

418
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,202
Our job was to try
and infiltrate the syndicate

419
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:58,936
and find out who was being paid off.

420
00:25:58,978 --> 00:26:02,601
And before we could even start...
we were betrayed.

421
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:04,395
Why come after you now?

422
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:06,593
Next week,

423
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,506
they are signing
a billion-dollar deal

424
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:12,501
opening up the flow of oil
out of Russia into Europe.

425
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:15,241
They are legitimizing
their corruption.

426
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,848
The deal was brokered
by an American in the oil business.

427
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,119
His name is John Cole.

428
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:24,552
- He works for the syndicate?
- Maybe he is the syndicate.

429
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,570
For whatever reason,
someone believed it

430
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:30,630
better the four of us not be around
to see the deal signed.

431
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:36,035
And Alina?

432
00:26:41,384 --> 00:26:44,121
I had her find out everything
she could about Cole.

433
00:26:44,614 --> 00:26:46,675
She found out he liked
to stay on a yacht.

434
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:49,773
I set up surveillance.

435
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,278
- So you used her.
- I trained her.

436
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,010
- 'Cause she was a pretty girl...
- She wanted to avenge you.

437
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:04,120
She waited.

438
00:27:04,517 --> 00:27:05,410
She watched.

439
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:07,988
And then finally, there he was.

440
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,598
And one day later, Alina was dead.

441
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,304
Everything I know about John Cole.

442
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:36,108
It worries you how little
there is in his file.

443
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:41,208
Every time I come back to it,
I hope someone has filled in the blanks.

444
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:43,361
But it's still just a single page.

445
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,203
No family history.
No next of kin.

446
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,583
All the things we take for granted.

447
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:58,174
You don't think
I should let him work this case.

448
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,176
I could put in
an official psychological assessment

449
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:05,056
to Director Vance recommending
he didn't.

450
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:09,956
And the Director would be obliged
to accept your recommendation.

451
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,819
And I'd lose the trust
of everyone else on the team.

452
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:19,508
What others may view
as the most inconsequential

453
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,095
of things can be
a revelation to Callen.

454
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:25,243
A thread here, a scrap there.

455
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:29,425
Maybe this time,
a tiny piece of the fabric of his life.

456
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,083
And if it goes badly?

457
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:35,256
Well, then you get to tell me
I was wrong.

458
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:40,091
The Director gets
to rip me a new one.

459
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:45,388
And Callen?

460
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:48,615
Does what he's always done:

461
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:51,228
survive.

462
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:56,149
Okay, let's see
what Arkady has got for us.

463
00:28:57,373 --> 00:28:59,275
Our mystery man
from the yacht has a name:

464
00:28:59,463 --> 00:29:00,320
John Cole.

465
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,280
Lives in the shadows.

466
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,870
He's got an oil refinery company,
which he bought seven years ago.

467
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:07,609
Who's his friend?

468
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:11,748
His friend is... Max Tyrus.

469
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,250
- Could be a bodyguard.
- Could be our killer.

470
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,502
Same height and build
as the guy in the apartment.

471
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,475
So, Eric, what else do we have?

472
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:23,645
Not a lot. This guy has built
some serious firewalls

473
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:25,982
around his personal life
and business operations.

474
00:29:26,024 --> 00:29:27,475
He's even got his own server.

475
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:28,777
Current location?

476
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,600
Usual tricks are coming up blank.

477
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,439
Cole is as close to invisible
as anyone I've ever seen.

478
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,926
He's not leaving
an electronic footprint anywhere.

479
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,965
That hand gesture looked like
a sign of surrender, Eric.

480
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:41,694
I was stretching my arms.

481
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,988
Forget about Cole
for a second, okay?

482
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,407
Find Max Tyrus. You find Max Tyrus,
you're gonna find Cole.

483
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:54,874
Okay, okay. Luck's changing.
Max Tyrus... I got a cell phone number.

484
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:58,586
- GPS is blocked.
- Pulling up his call log.

485
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:02,989
Last call was made
from Cole's refinery

486
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:05,551
to a jet charter company
30 minutes ago.

487
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,945
Planning a trip.

488
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:09,347
When did Arkady say
the deal's being signed?

489
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:11,316
- End of the week.
- Where?

490
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,558
Moscow.

491
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,546
Eric, call that charter company.

492
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,566
<i>Brad Jet Charter.</i>

493
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,631
- Hi, I called about 30 minutes ago.
- <i>Okay. What's your name, please?</i>

494
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:28,199
Yeah, Max Tyrus, it was for West Oil
Consolidated, the charter to Moscow.

495
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,702
- <i>Tyrus?</i>
- That's right.

496
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:32,161
- Can you just confirm the details?
- <i>Departs 6:30.</i>

497
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,425
- And the return?
- <i>No return booked.</i>

498
00:30:35,304 --> 00:30:36,793
What am I thinking?
Of course.

499
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,668
- <i>We'll be ready for you.</i>
- Thanks so much.

500
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:42,129
Leaves in less than four hours.

501
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:44,006
- Returning?
- One way.

502
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:47,488
Guys, we don't have evidence
to stop him from leaving the country.

503
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,624
We're going to get one shot at this.

504
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,097
You got a plan?

505
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:56,637
Well, he already thinks I'm dead.

506
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,655
Let's see how he reacts
when he finds out I'm not.

507
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,709
Got to get in the oil refinery.

508
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:06,112
Attract his attention.

509
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:09,552
If I'm the owner of an oil refinery,

510
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,606
who do I fear the most?

511
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,315
EPA inspectors.

512
00:31:17,785 --> 00:31:18,515
I do.

513
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:23,376
EPA guidelines and credentials

514
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:25,906
to get you guys through the gate.

515
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:28,743
Nice.

516
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,768
And for us, a button cam.

517
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:34,713
You don't know what Cole looks like.

518
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:36,813
Based on the photos,
he's blurry looking.

519
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:38,912
Yeah, but he knows what you look like,
which means

520
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,897
your cover is blown the moment
he sees you.

521
00:31:41,251 --> 00:31:43,733
But he also thinks I'm dead,
which gives me the advantage.

522
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:45,591
You're going in as bait?

523
00:31:46,193 --> 00:31:48,229
You're trying to get him to react,
to attack you?

524
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:50,474
Yeah.
And if he does, we've got him.

525
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,450
Do you have a problem?

526
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:00,476
Look, the first few seconds
will be critical.

527
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,894
Just don't give him time to think,

528
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:07,472
or else he'll see
what you're trying to do,

529
00:32:07,514 --> 00:32:09,525
and he won't react
the way you want him to.

530
00:32:10,193 --> 00:32:10,928
Thanks.

531
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:15,344
I'm good?

532
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,027
I'm in.

533
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:52,377
Callen, good to go.

534
00:32:57,651 --> 00:32:59,888
How're you doing?
EPA.

535
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:03,729
It's time for your unscheduled health
and safety inspection.

536
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,233
I'm going to have to check you
for regulation compliance.

537
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:08,960
Okay.

538
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,785
Thank you, friend.

539
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:23,950
Hey. EPA coming in.

540
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:31,549
We on the air?

541
00:33:33,257 --> 00:33:35,560
- Picture's up.
- Excuse me, ma'am?

542
00:33:36,752 --> 00:33:37,555
EPA.

543
00:33:38,206 --> 00:33:40,484
- Yes, can I help you?
- Is your boss here?

544
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:43,570
Through the breezeway,
first door on your right.

545
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:44,446
Thank you.

546
00:34:01,298 --> 00:34:02,950
Yeah, I got 'em.

547
00:34:03,654 --> 00:34:04,488
Excuse me.

548
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,869
This is the third EPA inspection
we've had this year.

549
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,472
Tell me about it.
It's new paperwork every time.

550
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:12,791
I think it's overkill.

551
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:15,343
I mean, one report with supplementals...
that's all it needs.

552
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,933
Unless, there's an issue.

553
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:20,723
Oh, God, yeah.

554
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,763
Seriously, you don't want an issue.
I mean, filling out those E37s...

555
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:25,269
I want to call your boss.

556
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:27,241
Won't stand in your way.

557
00:34:31,561 --> 00:34:33,694
And I don't think you want
to stand in ours, either.

558
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:39,887
I'm going to need to see
all the usuals.

559
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:42,244
The outflow reports,
the monitoring logs, the test results...

560
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,701
- What's in here?
- It's off-limits to visitors.

561
00:34:46,181 --> 00:34:47,508
You think we're visitors?

562
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:50,336
- This is a working refinery.
- And that's why we're here.

563
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:56,895
G, behind you.
Could be Cole.

564
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:59,232
What seems to be the problem?

565
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:13,694
- They said you were dead.
- They said the same thing about you.

566
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:19,799
Kensi, meet an old friend
from Moscow:

567
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:21,877
Ethan Stanhope.

568
00:35:22,649 --> 00:35:23,901
Now known as John Cole.

569
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:31,295
I think we're just lost
the advantage.

570
00:35:41,758 --> 00:35:44,303
You pay people good money,
you expect them to finish the job.

571
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,307
Maybe you can get a refund.

572
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,893
Must've cost you a lot to falsify
a death certificate in Vegas.

573
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:53,848
- Who did they shoot anyway?
- Someone no one would miss.

574
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,476
World's full of them.

575
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:58,404
Couldn't afford people asking why I had
survived when the rest of you hadn't.

576
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,281
That's why I thought
Arkady was behind.

577
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,199
He said you tried to kill him,
you missed.

578
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,578
Two times.
Third time's a charm, set for next week.

579
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,768
- I misjudged him.
- Lots of people do.

580
00:36:09,574 --> 00:36:11,125
Still fighting the old enemy.

581
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:13,711
Even though the curtain's down,
and the wall is rubble.

582
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,715
I need to remember to apologize.

583
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,634
So this was all about the oil?

584
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:25,663
Deal's about to be signed.
Gonna have to show myself, go public.

585
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,850
And if any of those three men
saw you, then...

586
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,770
Would have been embarrassing.
Not to mention costly.

587
00:36:31,435 --> 00:36:33,420
What is the going rate these days
to sell out

588
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:35,192
to a Russian crime syndicate?

589
00:36:38,116 --> 00:36:39,493
More than I'll ever spend.

590
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:44,016
- How many hits did you take?
- Five. Thanks for asking.

591
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,076
I'll just need one.

592
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:51,916
Sam, you got a shot?

593
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,684
Yeah, but if it goes through him,
I'll hit a gas storage tank.

594
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,673
You don't really think
we came here alone?

595
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:04,222
My car's at the back service gate.
Go!

596
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,123
Don't move!
Don't you move!

597
00:38:59,077 --> 00:39:00,620
- We good?
- We're good.

598
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,275
Turn over, tough guy.
Turn over. Turn over.

599
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:07,843
Put your hands behind you.

600
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:26,237
Not such a bad day after all.

601
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:28,198
Hard call.

602
00:39:29,382 --> 00:39:30,878
But the right call.

603
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,147
Have you ever counted up
the homes before?

604
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:37,474
Thirty-seven.

605
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:41,572
From when he was five
to the age of 18,

606
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:43,893
he changed foster homes

607
00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:46,054
every few weeks,

608
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:48,759
and sometimes every few days.

609
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:53,585
The longest he ever stayed in one place
was with Alina Rostoff's family.

610
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:55,599
Three months.

611
00:39:57,569 --> 00:40:00,648
I checked.
The parents died years ago.

612
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:03,314
Alina stayed on
with the house, so...

613
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:06,735
Three months?

614
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:08,980
Must have been something special.

615
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:12,677
Don't you think?

616
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:28,056
As I live and breathe, a convert.

617
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:30,299
I was tasting the paper.

618
00:40:31,936 --> 00:40:33,012
Anything exotic?

619
00:40:33,445 --> 00:40:34,680
- Just tea.
- Well...

620
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,251
every journey starts
with a small step.

621
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:41,506
From Arkady.

622
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:44,291
Through back channels.

623
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:48,845
Enjoy.

624
00:43:18,632 --> 00:43:21,837
