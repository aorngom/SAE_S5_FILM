2
00:00:04,044 --> 00:00:05,629
Why is everything rusted, Grandpa?

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,881
That's what happens
when junk gets old.

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,566
Well, you're not rusted.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,217
Well, I'm not junk and I'm not old.

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,469
- You look old.
- You want to live to see eight?

7
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:15,507
I'd just shut up,
and pick something out.

8
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:17,808
Do I really get to break
anything I want?

9
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:20,117
It's your birthday.
Take a look around here,

10
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:22,105
see if there's anything
that catches your eye.

11
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,734
Yeah, figured
that'd be just the ticket.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,602
Come on, I got it all locked
and loaded.

13
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:32,150
- Let's see how these fit.
- Cool.

14
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:36,414
Perfect.
There's your control panel.

15
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,362
Now, the most important thing
about this, Tommy,

16
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:40,998
is you do not tell your mother.

17
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,585
What are you waiting for,
some overtime? Hit it!

18
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:54,554
Does it hurt?

19
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:56,514
You sure?

20
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,433
Yeah, it's a car.
It doesn't feel anything.

21
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:00,685
Then why is it bleeding?

The First Amendment:

27

Freedom of the press,
religion, assembly, petition... and...

28
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:50,193
You go get a life,
too, you little pipsqueak!

29
00:01:50,836 --> 00:01:51,838
Speech!

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,573
Clearly they did not have Tony
in mind when writing that.

31
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:59,452
The little rat "nexted" me!

32
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,581
Hi, there.
Hey, I'm Tony.

33
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,708
- What's he doing?
- Annoying me.

34
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:07,126
Besides that.

35
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,112
It's called random chat.

36
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,381
It's through a Web site that
video-connects you to random strangers.

37
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:14,592
Come on!

38
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:17,678
They don't like who they're chatting
with, they just hit next and move on.

39
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:19,161
Let me guess.

40
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,104
Tony keeps getting "nexted".

41
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:23,243
This I must see.

42
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,937
It's not funny, Ziva.
Longest I've gone is ten seconds.

43
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:28,752
Perhaps you're not
as interesting as you think you are.

44
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:31,580
This from coming from a woman reading
the Bill of Rights for entertainment...

45
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:33,035
Get out of here. Back off!

46
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,666
I don't want you taking credit
when I work it out.

47
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,325
Hi, ladies.

48
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,662
<i>What are you, like 40?!</i>

49
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:47,333
Why would you want to talk
to complete strangers anyway?

50
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:50,213
Okay, I'm just going to have
to up my game here.

51
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,469
What can I do?
Finger puppets or...

52
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:54,674
maybe a furry...
barnyard animal.

53
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,717
I got it!

54
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,158
Never fails to please.

55
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,975
- This isn't what it looks like.
- Yeah?

56
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,567
Just out of curiosity,
how exactly does this look?

57
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,236
It looks like we got a dead Marine.

58
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:16,634
Grab your gear.

59
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,998
And a little self-respect, DiNozzo.

60
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:28,110
- You bring your laptop?
- Yeah, why?

61
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:31,655
I bet I'd last longer than 10 seconds in
random chat with this guy as a backdrop.

62
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:33,644
Tony, you really need to stop.

63
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:35,450
- Will you stop?
- I'm not stopping.

64
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:38,676
I stripped the car myself yesterday.
The trunk was empty.

65
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,512
- Do you have any security cameras?
- He's got tons of 'em.

66
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:44,140
But they're not hooked up
to anything.

67
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:45,788
They're just for show.

68
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:54,975
- What's that for?
- Being brave.

69
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,737
And I also heard it's your birthday.

70
00:03:58,127 --> 00:03:58,946
It is.

71
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,824
To whom do we have the misfortune?

72
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,846
Marine Corporal Ray Collins.

73
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,745
Local LEOs identified him,
called us.

74
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,664
Discarded in a junkyard
like a piece of trash.

75
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,584
Did you know
that the word "junk" originally referred

76
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,378
to nautical old rope
of uncertain origin?

77
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:15,713
- Really!
- Yes.

78
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,465
- I did not know that.
- Eventually,

79
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,130
it included any... discarded item.

80
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:24,024
- That's fascinating.
- No, I'll tell you what's fascinating.

81
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,972
Time of death, Duck?

82
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:30,646
Mr. Palmer, let's get our corporal
to a more suitable work surface.

83
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,553
I'm guessing
the killer dumps the body,

84
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,690
hoping the compactor
would eliminate the evidence.

85
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,318
I'm thinking mugging.
Cash and credit cards are missing.

86
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,600
Well, I might agree with you
if that were...

87
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,325
the only thing missing.

88
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,924
Meet Corporal Ray Collins.

89
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:57,415
No family, single,
and according to his CO, no friends.

90
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,382
But his fitness eval
is off the charts.

91
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,341
Guessing that's when he had feet.

92
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:04,556
He was serving
in southwestern Afghanistan

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,847
- until he was court-martialed.
- Charges?

94
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,608
- Everything.
- Larceny, drug dealing, assault.

95
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,396
Might not've ended up doing time,

96
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,407
but he was looking
at a dishonorable discharge.

97
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:16,606
We were unable to trace the Corporal's
movements prior to his murder.

98
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,817
No credit card use.
Didn't have a cell phone.

99
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:21,503
- No ATM camera walk-bys either.
- But look what I found.

100
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,616
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet the Ducati Desmosedici Double-R.

101
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:28,896
DMV records indicate
that Collins bought one last month.

102
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:32,289
- Added it to his Harley collection.
- Ray liked motorcycles.

103
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,126
Motorcycles he shouldn't be able
to afford on his base pay.

104
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:36,544
He was into something.

105
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,045
Unfortunately, with his record,

106
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,892
there are dozens of people
with motive to kill him.

107
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:43,025
Talk to guys in his unit.

108
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:45,207
See if you can find one
that actually did.

109
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:47,775
Me?
Like right now?

110
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:51,081
- Did the Director say what it's about?
- <i>No, he didn't.</i>

111
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:52,766
Can it wait like five minutes?

112
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,690
<i>He wants you here now.
Why five minutes?</i>

113
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:56,689
Because I had
a breakthrough in the case,

114
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,728
and if Gibbs' Gibbsometer
is working, then

115
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:00,919
he should be walking
through my door any second.

116
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,713
I gotta go.

117
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:04,530
Do you know something I don't know?

118
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:06,073
Probably not.

119
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:09,160
Director Vance's office
called and he wants to see me.

120
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:10,924
- About what?
- I don't know.

121
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:13,039
That's just the thing.
It's a bad omen, though.

122
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,243
I remember last time
he wanted to see me...

123
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:17,729
do you know about the last time
the Director wanted to see me?

124
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,920
No sense in mentioning that again.

125
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:22,244
Abs...
you said you had a breakthrough?

126
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,675
- About the case.
- Right.

127
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:26,088
Work. Focus.

128
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,763
Okay. So, Ducky found tissue
underneath our victim's fingernails.

129
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,577
Most likely from the killer.
I ran the DNA. No matches.

130
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:35,198
- Doesn't sound like a breakthrough.
- It's not. But it is helpful.

131
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:37,104
Because all military DNA is on file.

132
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,106
Just means our killer
wasn't in the military.

133
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,400
It rules out Director Vance.

134
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,278
Right. Work.

135
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,457
I heard
that you're having trouble tracking

136
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,240
Corporal Collins' movements.

137
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,655
Luckily, I haven't.
Because he was wearing this.

138
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:53,996
It's a state-of-the-art
GPS runner's watch.

139
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,247
It tracks your progress,
suggests routes.

140
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,041
It holds GPS data for 24 hours.

141
00:06:58,248 --> 00:06:59,610
I can give you a blow-by-blow.

142
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:04,673
So, Corporal Collins,
he went for a jog on base,

143
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,384
and then he went to eat,
he wandered around for a bit.

144
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,930
And, for some reason, spent two hours
standing in the middle of the street.

145
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,751
That's good work.
Get the address to Tony and Ziva.

146
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,072
Nice job.

147
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:18,104
What
the biohazardous material is this?

148
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,623
- It's all they had.
- A mini-POW!?

149
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,056
This is another bad omen.

150
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,444
Gibbs, this does not
bode well for my future.

151
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:27,833
Abby, I wouldn't worry about it.

152
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:29,698
Why's that?

153
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,480
Because I got your back.

154
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:34,177
Always have had.

155
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,349
Always will.

156
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,663
"I cried because I had no shoes.

157
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,363
Then I met a man who had no feet."

158
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:45,702
An old Persian proverb.

159
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,269
A reminder to appreciate
what we have.

160
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,741
Because we can always have less.

161
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:52,440
Or how about...

162
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,599
"Don't count your bowling balls
before they're hatch, Fred."

163
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:56,725
Fred?

164
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,733
Fred Flintstone.

165
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:04,351
It's an unexpectedly profound
series from the...

166
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,112
So good of you to join us.
To join Dr. Mallard in his autopsy,

167
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,781
that I merely assist in.

168
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,994
- What do you got, Duck?
- A mess.

169
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:19,789
And a troubling one. Yes.

170
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,294
Dislocations across his entire
skeletal system.

171
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,088
Likely caused by the car crusher.

172
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:27,417
That how he died?

173
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,091
No, he bled to death.

174
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:32,136
Collins was alive
when his feet were cut off?

175
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:34,471
Alive, but I doubt conscious.

176
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,807
He also has a mandibular fracture.

177
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:39,625
That was not caused
by the car crusher.

178
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:43,147
This particular trauma
is consistent with

179
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,441
a blow to the jaw
with something heavy,

180
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,675
like a wrench or a piece of pipe.

181
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,527
So, someone knocked him out,
and then chopped off his feet.

182
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:53,949
Sawed them off, actually.

183
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:57,244
For reasons I shall leave you
to speculate.

184
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:58,922
You're right, Duck.

185
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:00,590
Troubling.

186
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,541
We haven't shown you
the troubling part yet.

187
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,544
Mr. Palmer, would you turn his head.

188
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,307
It's some kind of welt.

189
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:12,301
To be honest,
aside from being the sign of the Devil,

190
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,250
I have no idea what it is.

191
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,311
Or... how it came to be there.

192
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,688
Thank you, Mr. Secretary,
you're on with Director Vance.

193
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:25,773
He said I was in trouble, didn't he?

194
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:28,665
- Actually...
- Using government bandwidth to make

195
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:31,350
private voice-over IP phone calls,
I know that's against regulations.

196
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:32,738
Even for charity.

197
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:35,950
To help "Save the Children" prevent
the 4 million newborn deaths every year.

198
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:36,908
4 million!

199
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:39,161
Every year! You know what?
I make no excuses.

200
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:42,039
I don't think the Director wants
to talk about "Save the Children".

201
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:45,615
Then the infrastructure database
that I loaned to "Habitat for Humanity"?

202
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:49,013
Okay, then that can just stay
between us?

203
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:50,339
He already knows.

204
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:53,194
So what is it?

205
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,929
Remember Alejandro Rivera,
from the Justice Department in Mexico?

206
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:59,723
- All of him.
- He wants you to fly down to Mexico

207
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,804
to speak at law enforcement symposium
their Justice Department is hosting.

208
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:03,743
Nice!

209
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:05,936
- When do I leave?
- I think today.

210
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,772
The Director
doesn't want you going alone.

211
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,775
Says Mexico
is too dangerous these days.

212
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:11,443
So he's sending an escort.

213
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,599
God, as long as it's not McGee.

214
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:15,787
I mean, he's never any fun
to travel with, anyways,

215
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:17,975
and lately he's been acting
all squirrelly ever

216
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:20,077
since Alejandro tried
to undress me with his eyes.

217
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,706
The Director wanted to see me?

218
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:31,046
Is this it?

219
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:32,840
This is the location Abby gave us.

220
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,128
- Right here.
- By the truck?

221
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:36,885
According to Abby's coordinates...

222
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,973
in the truck.

223
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:49,852
Bet Abby could last longer
than ten seconds playing random chat.

224
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:51,984
- You are obsessed.
- You wouldn't understand.

225
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,225
Why?

226
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:55,410
Because being irritating
is second nature to you.

227
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:57,207
Me, I'm... charming.

228
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:00,326
That's not charming.

229
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,394
That's a bloody table.

230
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,571
<i>Buenos dias, Señorita.</i>

231
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,534
- Slow down.
- I don't want to miss anything.

232
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,069
Like what, the burrito bar?

233
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,839
Are you going to be a party pooper
this entire trip, McGee?

234
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:38,739
Come on.

235
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:49,135
The last time I was in Mexico,

236
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:52,795
Montezuma got his revenge
on me in a very, very big way.

237
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,135
I was sick for a month.

238
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,901
It's called bottled water, McGee.

239
00:11:56,985 --> 00:11:59,051
Maybe this time
you won't be so cheap.

240
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:02,805
You saw the text that Tony sent me.
Look at that.

241
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,515
It's got to be a serial killer.

242
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:06,427
As soon as I go out of town...

243
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:11,063
<i>Bienvenido</i>, Ms. Sciuto.

244
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:15,752
So thrilled you could make it.
I trust your flight was pleasant?

245
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,589
It was. Boy, my...

246
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,321
my arms sure are tired.

247
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,117
Not too tired, I hope.
You're going to need them.

248
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:24,501
For what?

249
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:27,051
We have a stack
of old cold cases waiting for you,

250
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:28,726
and a class of eager students

251
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,958
hoping you'll share
your forensic expertise with them.

252
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,639
Sounds like I'm going to be busy.

253
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:36,088
<i>Sí</i>, but not so busy, perhaps,
that you will not have time for...

254
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,403
Let's just say busy
and leave it at that.

255
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,384
I apologize.

256
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,216
- Agent McGoo, no?
- McGee.

257
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,660
Unfortunately,

258
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:48,379
there is only one room available

259
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,227
at the Justice
Department's guest quarters.

260
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:52,146
Then, we'll check into a hotel.

261
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,830
Yeah, I do not recommend it.

262
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:55,804
The entire reason for this symposium

263
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,527
is the escalating violence
from the local drug wars.

264
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:01,332
I really must insist
you stay here together,

265
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:03,171
however distasteful we...

266
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,080
all may find it.

267
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:12,124
No regard for protocol.

268
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,502
Human remains are to be processed
in the autopsy garage.

269
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:19,178
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say serial killer.

270
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:20,757
A limb. Nice.

271
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,136
Can I give you a hand?
These are terrible jokes.

272
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,999
You got time for jokes, DiNozzo?

273
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,063
- That mean you got our killer?
- Working on it.

274
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:30,561
License plate stolen,
VIN's been scraped off.

275
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:31,560
No prints.

276
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,480
There are over 1,000 similar registered
vehicles with the Maryland DMV alone.

277
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,077
- We'll narrow it down.
- Corporal Collins was unconscious

278
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:41,820
when he was dismembered.

279
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,800
It's safe to assume that,

280
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,709
these were, as well.

281
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:48,285
- Or what's left of them.
- And the rest of them?

282
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,955
I don't think that's soap scum.

283
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,122
Most likely sulfuric acid.

284
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,750
It is the only acid strong enough
to dissolve bone.

285
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,586
Collins' body was dumped.
The rest of them weren't.

286
00:13:57,786 --> 00:13:58,539
Why?

287
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:02,549
I'd have to perform a psychological
autopsy to answer that question.

288
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,230
But I can tell you one thing.

289
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:06,220
We have the killer's trophies,

290
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,931
which means, well,
he'll want to kill again.

291
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:12,058
- We need to find who he's targeting.
- Think I got a lead on that.

292
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,019
Autopsy Gremlin?

293
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,035
Scram.

294
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,856
These look familiar.

295
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:20,274
Motorcycle gang tattoos.

296
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:23,362
Same here.
Same here.

297
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:26,821
Our killer's targeting bikers.

298
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,974
This is gonna be fun.

299
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,116
I've always wanted to be a teacher.

300
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:38,377
Are you going to eat
throughout my entire presentation?

301
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:42,631
I read the local yogurt
is amazing for your stomach.

302
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,748
True.

303
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,426
Lactobacillus aids in digestion.

304
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,388
However, that is unpasteurized.

305
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:51,882
Well, is that bad?

306
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:52,933
In Mexico?

307
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:55,769
You might as well just
shoot yourself now.

308
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,479
Oh, here they come.

309
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:00,227
<i>Hola.</i>

310
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:02,025
<i>Bienvenidos...</i>

311
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,149
<i>encantado.</i>

312
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,696
<i>¿Como estás?</i>

313
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,606
<i>Buenos días.</i>

314
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:09,294
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

315
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,672
My name is Abby Sciuto.

316
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:15,782
I am a forensic scientist with the Naval
Criminal Investigative Service.

317
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,074
And this is...

318
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,627
That was Agent McGee,

319
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,312
who just ate
some unpasteurized yogurt,

320
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,339
and he's probably gonna go make himself
throw up.

321
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:26,560
Any questions?

322
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:31,679
Well, today's lecture is
on the forensics of cold cases.

323
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:35,745
We will be working on an actual case
provided by your government.

324
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:38,145
It's the gangland hit

325
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,544
of a drug trafficker,
almost 20 years old.

326
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:43,639
Doesn't get much colder than that.

327
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:44,860
Any questions?

328
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:51,532
Who told you
the Day of the Dead was in May?

329
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:56,094
Your name is...?

330
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:57,706
Let me guess. Natalia.

331
00:15:58,673 --> 00:15:59,666
You can read.

332
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,396
I can read.

333
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:03,913
I can also tell that you have cats.

334
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,757
Anyone could tell I have a cat.

335
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,801
One orange tabby and two calicos.

336
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,871
You're allergic to citrus.

337
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:15,426
You went bowling last night.
You're vitamin D deficient.

338
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,726
And you're ovulating.

339
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,770
Any more questions?

340
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:25,157
Great. Back to the case.

341
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:28,783
Which, because
of some very shoddy police work,

342
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:30,739
has almost no forensic evidence.

343
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:32,741
So I hope
you brought your walking shoes,

344
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:35,202
'cause we are going in the field.

345
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,288
This is the last biker bar
we're hitting today.

346
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,832
I'm starting to smell
like monkey grease.

347
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:45,837
Somehow I think
you won't mind this one.

348
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:48,778
Hello kitty.

349
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,563
Want to take this, or should I?
'Cause I kind of got a feeling that...

350
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:54,221
You know what?
I got it.

351
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,472
Ladies and gentlemen,

352
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,355
if I could have your attention,
please.

353
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:00,686
I'm... Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.

354
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:02,065
This is my partner.

355
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,814
We'd like to ask you some questions.

356
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:05,649
We're looking for information

357
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:08,276
about this guy,
Corporal Ray Collins.

358
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:11,405
He was murdered, and he's...
he's a very...

359
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:15,409
I've lost my mojo.

360
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,203
Like random chat,
only in the real world.

361
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:21,497
Perhaps it needs
a woman's touch, so...

362
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,208
Not unless that woman's got
a warrant.

363
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,837
- You got a warrant?
- No.

364
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:29,089
We would like
to ask a few questions.

365
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,941
You know what I would like?

366
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:34,219
You to leave.

367
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:35,637
Look, people.

368
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,597
There is a serial killer
on the loose.

369
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,141
He's targeting bikers.

370
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,434
Does that interest you?

371
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:43,333
Only thing that interests me
is you...

372
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:45,710
leaving now.

373
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,111
We're leaving now.

374
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,542
Sorry about that.

375
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,620
Putting on show for the kiddies.

376
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:03,213
If I wanted to stay
in business, yeah.

377
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:04,823
Velvet Road.

378
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:07,252
Let's keep this quick.

379
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:10,297
Yes. So any information
on Corporal Collins?

380
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:13,716
Not much,
but I have seen that guy around.

381
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:17,179
I don't know who he runs with,
but I know who he's been sleeping with.

382
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:19,139
- Who's he been sleeping with?
- Everyone.

383
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:22,799
He probably slept
with the wrong guy's girl.

384
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:24,605
He's not the only one who's dead.

385
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:25,812
I'm not surprised.

386
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:29,733
I know some riders so jealous,
you just look at their girl wrong,

387
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,861
- they'll kill you.
- You got any names?

388
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,397
I got a whole bunch.

389
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:40,373
There are many ways
by which a cold case can be solved.

390
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:41,661
Anyone?

391
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:46,792
New witnesses can step forward.

392
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,014
Alibis can fall through,
or new information can come to light.

393
00:18:51,485 --> 00:18:54,380
This new information usually
comes from forensic evidence.

394
00:18:54,774 --> 00:18:56,823
Which we're going to have
to find on our own, because

395
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,427
this case has virtually none.

396
00:18:58,511 --> 00:18:59,638
What we know is this:

397
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:02,974
20 years ago, a <i>traficante de drogos</i>...
a drug dealer...

398
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,708
named Pedro Hernandez...

399
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:07,637
he left a cafe,
he got in his vehicle to go home,

400
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:11,525
and he was gunned down at point-blank
range in a gang-style shooting.

401
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:14,088
His vehicle was abandoned
after the incident,

402
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:15,654
so that's where we're gonna start.

403
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:19,491
Lesson number one.

404
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,451
Beware shoddy police work.

405
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:24,778
For example, this fracture pattern.

406
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,456
It tells me

407
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:28,364
that the bullet
that shattered the glass

408
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:31,740
was traveling at an unusually
high velocity, which means...?

409
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,713
Agent McGee?

410
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,276
Some kind of long-range weapon.

411
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,832
Which also means
this police report is wrong.

412
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:42,253
He was not shot point-blank.

413
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:46,242
Are we expecting more students?

414
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,153
I don't think those are students.

415
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:58,572
You're trespassing.

416
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,366
- This is public property.
- We were just leaving.

417
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,310
Actually, no.

418
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,161
You're not.

419
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:15,046
Line up.

420
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,089
All of you.

421
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:21,793
It's probably a good time
to start praying, too.

422
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:23,388
Can we just slow down here?

423
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,222
Sorry, I have lunch plans.

424
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:29,468
Would it help you to know that I am
a guest of your government?

425
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:30,760
- Abby...
- What?

426
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,358
Maybe I won't kill you.

427
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:40,989
Maybe I take you hostage instead.
See how much you're worth.

428
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:45,453
My name is Timothy McGee.

429
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,245
I'm a United States federal agent.

430
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,038
I'm worth a lot to them, okay?

431
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:52,483
Now, you just let them go,
you can keep me.

432
00:20:58,195 --> 00:21:00,255
You're a brave man, Timothy McGee.

433
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:02,218
Do you know who I am?

434
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:06,088
My name is Paloma Reynosa.

435
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,418
"Reynosa." As in...?

436
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,868
Reynosa drug cartel.

437
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:12,064
At least,
that's what you would call it.

438
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:15,009
I prefer to think of it
as the family business.

439
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,446
We're screwed.

440
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,777
What's an NCIS agent
doing so far from home?

441
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:20,463
He's my escort.

442
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:24,176
I'm teaching a class
on the forensics of cold cases.

443
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:26,830
And this truck...

444
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:28,828
it's your classroom?

445
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:33,333
We're using the murder of a man
named Pedro Hernandez as a case study.

446
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,332
Old Pedro?

447
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:38,924
That was a long time ago.

448
00:21:39,124 --> 00:21:40,632
What could you possibly learn now?

449
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:46,293
For example,
the police report... it's wrong.

450
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:48,181
He wasn't shot point-blank.

451
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,161
You are correct.

452
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:53,183
He was killed by a sniper,
hiding on a ridge,

453
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:54,813
almost 1,000 meters from here.

454
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,192
How do you know that?

455
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:01,778
Because the killer left behind
a message on that ridge.

456
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:03,697
What message?

457
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,461
Perhaps you will have
more use for it than I.

458
00:22:22,396 --> 00:22:23,591
I'll see what I can do.

459
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:28,487
Love your shoes.

460
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,931
<i>Vamanos!</i>

461
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:31,219
Thanks.

462
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:45,058
Jealousy can sure drive people
to do strange things.

463
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:48,969
As can anything born
of deep-rooted insecurity.

464
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,620
If I chopped the feet off of every guy
that gave Breena two looks...

465
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:57,292
I would be up to my ears
in toe cheese.

466
00:22:58,326 --> 00:22:59,961
- What's that?
- Toe cheese.

467
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:00,795
Right.

468
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,237
Hope you got something for me
more than toe cheese, Duck.

469
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:05,419
Yes, well,
we certainly have a lot of it.

470
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,135
Times like these
I regret not having a window.

471
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:11,389
Although we are saved
from the more insidious odors

472
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,018
by the fact that all these
feet have all been salted.

473
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:16,214
Killer preserving his trophies.

474
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:19,517
Which explains
the mobile drying rack.

475
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,076
It's a good way of preventing
the odors from alerting the neighbors.

476
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,236
Makes it more difficult
to determine a time of death.

477
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:27,196
Difficult but not impossible.

478
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,532
Salt preservation retards

479
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,619
bacterial growth
but not insect activity.

480
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:36,456
I was able to work out
a rough timeline.

481
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:38,124
This one...

482
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:40,943
was the first one cut off.

483
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,712
Roughly two months ago.

484
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,792
- Good work.
- However,

485
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,980
unlike Corporal Collins,

486
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:52,118
all of these victims
were already dead

487
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:54,140
before their feet were removed.

488
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:56,393
Vascular inflammation

489
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,419
suggests that their deaths were caused
by some kind of poison.

490
00:23:59,665 --> 00:24:02,373
Abby will determine just what kind.

491
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,319
Serial killers usually
don't change their MO.

492
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,322
Not after
so many successful kills, no.

493
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,782
So, who do you think she was?

494
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,411
Well, I told you already.

495
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,551
Paloma Reynosa,
head of the Reynosa drug cartel.

496
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:20,359
She took over
after her husband died.

497
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,578
No, I mean

498
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:24,177
who do you think
she was to our cold case victim?

499
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,734
Somebody pretty important,

500
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:27,757
considering she's been carrying it
all this time.

501
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,107
Really don't know much about her.

502
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,526
Got a bad feeling about this case.

503
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,473
Yeah, I got a bad feeling
about this bed.

504
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:37,167
You want to flip for the couch?

505
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,480
Come on, McGee.

506
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:44,065
It's not like we haven't shared
a bed together before.

507
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:46,756
Well, technically,
that was a coffin.

508
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,252
And I'm just letting you know,

509
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,184
that if you and I sleep
in this bed together,

510
00:24:50,268 --> 00:24:52,073
I am a Quasimodo for a week.

511
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,429
Now I know why Ziva
took the couch in Paris.

512
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,082
Tony said that he took
the couch in Paris.

513
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:11,568
Why do you think <i>la policía</i>
didn't investigate this case further?

514
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,024
He was a drug dealer.

515
00:25:15,108 --> 00:25:17,606
And crimes like that...
a dime a dozen down here.

516
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,558
Maybe.

517
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:20,128
Maybe not.

518
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,035
I think I'm developing my own gut.

519
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,995
I was going to mention to you,

520
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,169
you look like you've put
on a few pounds lately.

521
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,360
Come on. I'm kidding.

522
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,612
All right, that was silly.
I'm sorry.

523
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:34,443
Look, you look great.

524
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,744
I actually noticed
that you really...

525
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,796
look great lately.

526
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:41,142
Actually.

527
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,375
Where are you going?

528
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,171
I'm going to sleep on my lab table.

529
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:49,919
Come on.
I said I was sorry.

530
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:53,968
- And you don't know how much.
- What is that supposed to mean?

531
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:57,180
You forgot to use bottled water
on your toothbrush.

532
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:00,183
This is not a room
I want to sleep in tonight.

533
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,482
<i>Hey, baby. I'm the kind of man
that can rock your world.</i>

534
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,513
<i>Come meet the super freak.</i>

535
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:13,596
<i>I'm like a friendly dolphin.</i>

536
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,700
You're pathetic.

537
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:19,608
I've tried everything.

538
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:20,560
Really.

539
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:22,811
No matter what I do,
I can't get past ten seconds.

540
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,958
Maybe you should try
something like working.

541
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,803
We are looking for a serial killer.

542
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,544
I already earned my pay today.

543
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:30,129
Really?

544
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:31,883
What did you find?

545
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:35,956
No way. I tell you,
you tell Gibbs... I got nothing.

546
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,388
I'm not going to steal your discovery.
I have my own.

547
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,474
- Really? What do you got?
- No way.

548
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,643
If I tell you, you tell Gibbs.

549
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,437
Gibbs is gonna find out anyway.
Come on. Let's see it.

550
00:26:48,822 --> 00:26:52,208
Well, our jealous biker theory was
a dead end: all our names had alibis.

551
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,238
We flashed Collins' picture
at every motorcycle club in the city.

552
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,781
Got the same story from everyone.

553
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,926
- People saw him around.
- He comes and goes.

554
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,827
He never stays at one place
for a long time.

555
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,219
And I think I know why.

556
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:04,455
Ray Collins,
you're our serial killer.

557
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,667
On a hunch, I e-mailed
his photo to several

558
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,143
different sulfuric acid suppliers.

559
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:11,921
And bingo.
One of them recognized him.

560
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,246
Said that Corporal Collins bought
a hundred gallons two months ago.

561
00:27:15,477 --> 00:27:16,829
Circumstantial, Alice.

562
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:19,424
Well, circum... yeah, but...

563
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:22,548
Who's gonna have a picture
of the guy drive the foot mo...

564
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:25,917
... bile. You got a picture
of the guy driving the foot mobile?

565
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:29,063
Making an illegal right turn on red.

566
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:31,555
- I also had a hunch.
- Got a timeline match?

567
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:35,176
The killings started just after Corporal
Collins returned from Afghanistan.

568
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,600
That's nice work.

569
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:37,983
Both of you.

570
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:40,825
Be even nicer if you could figure out
who killed Collins.

571
00:28:50,094 --> 00:28:51,084
Oh, my God!

572
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,524
Morning.

573
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,111
I heard what happened yesterday and came
immediately to see how you were doing.

574
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,112
I'm okay.

575
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:02,365
I wish you would have told me
your plans, so I could've said "no".

576
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:04,534
So do I.

577
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:08,329
The Reynosa drug cartel is having
distribution problems at the moment.

578
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,665
It's very dangerous
to go into their territory.

579
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:14,315
Though it appears
your expedition provided some fruit.

580
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,676
Maybe.

581
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,297
As far as cold cases go,
this one's frigid.

582
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:21,020
Looks pretty warm to me.

583
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,261
"Lapua"?

584
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:26,139
It's a favorite of snipers,
is it not?

585
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:29,100
I wouldn't draw any conclusions.
It's also

586
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,811
popular with competitive
shooters and

587
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,210
apparently, as jewelry.

588
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,692
Something is bothering you.

589
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,261
Whose idea was it for me
to come down here?

590
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,655
Was it yours or was it
Director Vance's?

591
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:45,886
Your director simply approved.

592
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:47,618
The idea was all mine.

593
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,428
Who assigned me this case?

594
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:58,921
I don't know exactly.
Someone on my staff.

595
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:00,332
Why?

596
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:02,216
How well do you know your staff?

597
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:04,760
Does this have something
to do with your cold case?

598
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,217
You solved it?

599
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:08,556
Not yet.

600
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,981
But if I'm going to...

601
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,146
I need you to exhume
the body of Pedro Hernandez.

602
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:18,566
That could be arranged.

603
00:30:19,623 --> 00:30:22,068
And I need it sent back
to my people in DC.

604
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:26,518
They're the only ones I trust.

605
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,911
And we certainly wouldn't want
to convict the wrong person.

606
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:31,902
No, of course not.

607
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,593
The body of a drug dealer
from 20 years ago?

608
00:30:35,677 --> 00:30:37,182
I don't think anyone will mind.

609
00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:39,879
For you,
I will make the arrangements.

610
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,673
<i>Hola</i>, McTaco. How was Mexico?
Did you bring anything back for me?

611
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:25,117
An exhumed corpse,

612
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:27,552
20 years old.
Like I wasn't sick enough already.

613
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,804
Where's Abby?

614
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,182
She's already in the lab,
checking the DNA on your victims.

615
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,894
Since I heard we're not the only ones
with an unsolved case.

616
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,770
We solved the serial killings.

617
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,564
What?

618
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,649
Yeah.
You would've loved it.

619
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,318
Marine Corporal poisoned his victims

620
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,071
and then he cut off their feet.
Bloody stumps.

621
00:31:47,297 --> 00:31:49,865
Then he would take their bodies
and put them in a vat of acid.

622
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,867
Yeah, and they would become
these viscous,

623
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:55,621
gooey, molten, fleshy, bowls of...

624
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,583
Of course, we still don't know
who killed our killer.

625
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,901
Well, maybe it was for revenge.

626
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,004
Maybe it's one
of the victim's family members?

627
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,510
- Yeah. It's Gibbs.
- Or a copycat killer.

628
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,217
Corporal Collins' body was mutilated
just like his victims.

629
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:09,748
I'm on my way, Duck.

630
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:12,597
Not much in Corporal Collins' background
was actually helpful.

631
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:15,308
- Go back over it.
- We already went over it, Boss.

632
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,594
Go back over it.

633
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,837
But we're going to go over it again.

634
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:23,774
Wanted to see me?

635
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,986
I do hope that's not another victim
I haven't heard about.

636
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,155
A victim, yes, but not our case.

637
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:31,271
I'm helping Abby with one of hers.

638
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,493
It's a cold case
from her Mexican symposium.

639
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,171
Meet Pedro.

640
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,998
Remarkably well-preserved

641
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,238
for a 20-year-old corpse.

642
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:42,335
Pedro?

643
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,034
I believe so. Mr. Palmer?

644
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,714
Pedro Hernandez.

645
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:51,854
Apparently, a sniper gunned him down
outside a small town in Mexico.

646
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,513
The bullet that killed him

647
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,370
ricocheted inside his skull...

648
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,309
inside his skull...

649
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,165
Abby thinks she might be able
to trace the bullet, but...

650
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:10,773
it's pretty old.

651
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,368
Yes, however,
I didn't call you down here

652
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,775
to discuss ancient history.

653
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:21,833
I've finished my psychological profile
of our dead serial killer.

654
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,295
Although, I personally do not believe
he was a serial killer.

655
00:33:26,782 --> 00:33:28,348
Don't get me wrong, Jethro.

656
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:32,046
I don't doubt that Corporal Collins
committed those murders,

657
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,886
but he shows

658
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,888
none of the psychopathology

659
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,891
that normally motivates
a serial killer.

660
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:41,118
Yeah, what motivated him?

661
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:42,818
I don't know.

662
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,024
And until we know that,
we know nothing.

663
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,194
I think I have it.

664
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,288
Jethro, if...
you would be so kind?

665
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,430
Mr. Palmer,
would you run this up to Abby?

666
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:18,857
I got it, Duck. I got it.

667
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:21,477
Thank you, Jethro.

668
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:56,111
Got one more computer
to network to the search.

669
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:59,221
I just want to let you know
I am up to speed on this case.

670
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:01,932
McGee is helping me run the DNA

671
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,352
- from the serial killer's victims.
- I got one more I.D. to make,

672
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:09,064
over here,
program the computer to search

673
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,178
for any similarities
between the victims.

674
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,145
Is that another tissue sample?

675
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:28,959
I identified the poison

676
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,420
that the serial killer
used to kill his victims.

677
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,631
It's a snake
venom-derived neurotoxin.

678
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:37,301
It causes the rapid degeneration
of synaptic nerves, and then the death.

679
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,387
The snake itself is very rare...
the Asian sand-viper.

680
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,557
Found exclusively
in southwest Afghanistan, which was...

681
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,267
That's where Collins was stationed.

682
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,521
The amounts he would've needed easily
could've gotten past military customs.

683
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,189
We got a ding.

684
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:51,732
Pardon me.

685
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,196
All victims were members
of a motorcycle gang. Knew that.

686
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,657
All have various criminal records.
Figured that.

687
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,579
There is one, and only one,
crime that they all have in common.

688
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,498
Our serial killer's
targeting drug dealers.

689
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:11,085
The problem is Ducky doesn't think
Collins was a serial killer.

690
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:14,588
He's cutting off people's feet.
Who does that other than serial killers?

691
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,675
I know who.
Drug cartels.

692
00:36:17,994 --> 00:36:20,445
By definition, wouldn't they be selling
drugs and not feet?

693
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:21,368
They do.

694
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:24,890
That's what the violence in Mexico's
been about: controlling distribution.

695
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,246
Killing off your competition.

696
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:29,491
Exactly.

697
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,023
I mean, the cartels hire freelancers
to do their hits,

698
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,513
and the way that the hit men prove
how many they've killed

699
00:36:36,054 --> 00:36:37,945
is with the severed feet
of their victims.

700
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,056
Corporal Collins
is not killing for fun.

701
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,662
He was killing for hire.

702
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:46,412
Then who killed him?

703
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,597
That's easy.

704
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:49,415
Whose drug dealers
was he taking out?

705
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:54,461
Gonna have to send you
on field trips more often.

706
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:56,749
Though I am glad you're back.

707
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:57,882
Thanks, Tony.

708
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,885
It's nice to have someone to talk to
for more than ten seconds at a time.

709
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:03,920
About that.

710
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,946
All right, I programmed your browser

711
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,352
to auto-next you out of video chats
every ten seconds.

712
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,796
That wasn't nice.
Why would you do something like that?

713
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,815
I don't know.

714
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,736
Why create a fake profile last year and
put me with a girl that doesn't exist?

715
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,481
Can I get back to you on that?

716
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:34,026
You gonna tell me why I'm here?

717
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:39,928
I got ten dead bodies,
all with one thing in common.

718
00:37:40,012 --> 00:37:41,383
Yeah? What's that?

719
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:43,110
You.

720
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:45,429
Sit down.

721
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:50,100
According to the DEA,

722
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,730
they sold drugs for you.

723
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:54,813
Allegedly.

724
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:58,810
At least until Corporal Collins
started killing them.

725
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:02,983
And that's why you killed him.

726
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,741
Doesn't look familiar.

727
00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:09,745
How about that?
That look familiar?

728
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:16,669
Very nice ring you're wearing.

729
00:38:17,717 --> 00:38:20,916
Any chance that there's still
some of Collins' DNA in that?

730
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:27,238
Because I know we've got some of yours
from underneath his fingernails.

731
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,393
<i>You've got this wrong.</i>

732
00:38:36,165 --> 00:38:37,758
Collins tried to kill me.

733
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:40,943
Tried to poison me
with some kind of snake venom.

734
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:43,862
- You don't look poisoned.
- 'Cause I'm immune.

735
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,865
These aren't just for show.

736
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:48,872
I own two pythons and a cobra.

737
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:50,881
I've been bit more times
than I can count.

738
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:55,900
Two nights ago,
I come home, have a drink.

739
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:59,033
And the next thing I knew,
I wake up in some truck.

740
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:00,629
Collins was there.

741
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:02,950
Clocked him pretty good with a pipe.

742
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:05,092
Didn't mean to kill him.
It was an accident.

743
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:08,020
Was cutting off
his feet an accident, too?

744
00:39:13,056 --> 00:39:14,494
He was killing my dealers.

745
00:39:14,832 --> 00:39:17,937
I had motive to take him out.
Who'd believe that it was self-defense?

746
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:20,894
I just tried to make it look
like he's another serial killer victim.

747
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,652
Who hired him
to take out your dealers?

748
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:26,697
- I don't know. They weren't local.
- Who hired him?

749
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,828
I think it was the Reynosa Cartel.

750
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:35,409
They're everywhere now.

751
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:52,181
Hi, Gibbs.

752
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:54,679
Hey, Abs.

753
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:57,251
Can I come in?

754
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:00,397
Yeah. You're already in.

755
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,334
Right.

756
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:20,793
It was nice talking to you.

757
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:25,596
Why are you here?

758
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:28,425
You know why I'm here.

759
00:40:40,665 --> 00:40:43,272
I matched the bullet
in Pedro Hernandez' head

760
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:44,858
to your sniper rifle.

761
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,885
You killed him.

762
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:52,709
In cold blood.

763
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,828
I mean, I know what he did, Gibbs.

764
00:40:58,014 --> 00:41:00,796
He killed your wife
and your daughter.

765
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,951
But, Gibbs...

766
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:05,373
I know.

767
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:08,876
Gibbs doesn't do things like that.

768
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:11,561
Or does he?

769
00:41:11,645 --> 00:41:12,933
Now I don't know.

770
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:15,174
I don't know anything.

771
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:18,790
The only thing

772
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:22,698
that I do know is
that I didn't find this out by accident.

773
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:26,441
Rule 40.

774
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,590
"If it seems like someone is out
to get you, they are."

775
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:33,529
Just...

776
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:38,954
You have no idea
how much I wished it was yesterday.

777
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:43,880
Maybe if I could just close my eyes
and open them again,

778
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:45,863
it will be.

779
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:01,602
Do you realize the situation
that I'm in now?

780
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:03,770
- I know.
- I mean, do you understand

781
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,783
- the choice I have to make now?
- I know.

782
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:07,191
Stop saying, "I know".

783
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,692
What do you want me to say?

784
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:11,420
Tell me that I'm wrong.

785
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,235
Tell me that I made a mistake

786
00:42:14,626 --> 00:42:16,241
with the ballistics or...

787
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:22,287
No, I can't say that.

788
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:24,467
Then...

789
00:42:26,218 --> 00:42:28,694
Tell me how much I've been like
a daughter to you...

790
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:30,677
and how much you love me...

791
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:36,524
Will that help?

792
00:42:42,491 --> 00:42:44,184
What I really need to know,

793
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,274
is if you're going to love me,

794
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:52,823
no matter what.

795
