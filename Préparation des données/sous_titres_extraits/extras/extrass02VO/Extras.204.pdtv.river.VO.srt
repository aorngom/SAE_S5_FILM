00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,141
Hi, I'm Andy Millman.

2
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:04,966
What would you rather do?

3
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:08,465
Have your child die of thirst,
or dysentery?

4
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:10,968
That's not a choice
that you'll have to make, is it?

5
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:14,280
But 1 in 5 people don't have access
to clean drinking water.

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:17,823
Everyday, millions of people have to
drink the only water available to them.

7
00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:19,841
And they run the risk of dying.

8
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:22,213
You can help put an end
to that terrible risk...

9
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:24,353
by pledging just five pounds.

10
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:25,740
Please help.

11
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:27,477
Cut!

12
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,283
- Was that alright?
- That was fantastic.

13
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:31,498
Thank you so much,
that was so wonderful.

14
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:33,009
Chris, hi!

15
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:35,108
- How are you?
- What's this for, today?

16
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:37,689
It's for people in the Third World
who don't have clean drink.

17
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:39,129
This screen...

18
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:40,862
You're gonna project
anything on that?

19
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:42,950
We don't know yet, but I'm sure...

20
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,305
Cause we have a album coming out,
Greatest Hits.

21
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:47,878
Maybe just put a picture
of the album cover on it.

22
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:49,566
Just simple.

23
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:51,509
Probably,
if we're gonna project anything,

24
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:54,885
we'll show pictures of people dying
because of the lack of clean water.

25
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,430
Could they be holding the album?

26
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,413
Not really, no...

27
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:00,874
I think that might be
a bit inappropriate?

28
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,623
I presume at some point,

29
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,627
you're gonna have some footage of
these people looking sad, miserable.

30
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,159
What about some music?
Check this out.

31
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:16,938
- Is that one of yours?
- Yeah, yeah, "Trouble".

32
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:19,961
Just say at the bottom:

33
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,109
"This is available,
Coldplay Greatest Hits."

34
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,359
- I just don't quite know...
- Easy. Easy.

35
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,042
So easy. Alright, ok.

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,040
- Now, where do you want me to stand?
- Just there.

37
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,054
- Hey, I know you.
- You alright?

38
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,967
"Are you having a laugh?"

39
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:42,149
"Are you having a laugh", yeah.

40
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:43,734
I could come on your show.

41
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:45,527
What's the audience?
5 or 6 million?

42
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:46,592
That'd be fab!

43
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:50,054
I don't know, it's a bit weird,
celebrities just popping up in a sitcom.

44
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,383
It'd be good, I could play myself.

45
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:55,346
Right. What would Chris Martin be doing
visiting a factory in Wigan?

46
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:56,433
You'll work it out.

47
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:57,866
- We will.
- We won't.

48
00:01:57,934 --> 00:01:59,584
- When do you shoot?
- Thursdays.

49
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,422
- I can't do Thursdays.
- I don't mind.

50
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:03,141
- I can do Wednesdays.
- We can move it.

51
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:04,834
- We can't move it.
- No, we can!

52
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,765
Move it.

53
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:07,526
Can we get on with this?

54
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,034
I got to do AIDS, Altzheimer's
and landmines this afternoon.

55
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,990
I don't wanna get back
for "Deal or no deal".

56
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,024
Plus, Gwyn is making drumsticks.

57
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,456
Do some bloody work.
What's up with you lot?

58
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:24,488
- We're depressed, Mr Stokes.
- Why?

59
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:26,438
Radio's broken, Mr Stokes.

60
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:31,673
Statistics prove the work is much more
productive with musical accompaniment.

61
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:35,059
You having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

62
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,714
We can't work without music.

63
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:44,043
Can't work without music?!
Who are you, seven bloody dwarves?

64
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:46,940
You'll just have to buy us another one.

65
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:48,768
I'm not made of money!

66
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:50,531
And we've spent budget
for the year, so...

67
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:53,072
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

68
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:55,566
Maybe I can help.

69
00:02:56,616 --> 00:03:00,066
I don't believe it.
It's only Chris Martin from Coldplay.

70
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:06,640
Chris, what are you doing here
in a factory in Wigan? It's mental.

71
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,518
Well, Ray, I'm just in the area
to promote our new album,

72
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:10,981
Coldplay, the Greatest Hits.

73
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:14,450
And... I thought I'd pop on over,
say hello.

74
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:16,598
When's that due out?

75
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,520
It's coming out
on the 17th of this month.

76
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:19,945
And it's gonna be really great.

77
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:24,006
Oh, fantastic. Well, this is gonna sound
absolutely ridiculous...

78
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:26,444
but do you mind performing
a song for us?

79
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:28,020
Are you having a laugh?

80
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,239
"This week, 'When the whistle blows'
sunk even lower

81
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:46,531
in its desperate attempt to appeal to as
many of the great unwashed as possible

82
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,101
by roping in the services
of rock star Chris Martin...

83
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:53,059
whose inexplicable appearance
was the latest attempt by Andy Millman

84
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:55,731
to shamelessly prop up
his lame duck of a sitcom."

85
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,438
I told you.
I told everyone.

86
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:00,139
- Why did I let people convince me?
- Calm down.

87
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:01,383
Muffin?

88
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:05,310
- Have a lovely bit of muffin.
- I don't want any.

89
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:07,450
Do you mind if <i>I</i> have
a little bit of muffin?

90
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:09,385
Thank you.

91
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:11,802
- Bar?
- <i>Yo.</i>

92
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:13,707
- I'm having the muffin.
<i>- I'll come through.</i>

93
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,141
- Why is this an event?
- It's exciting.

94
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:19,891
Hi, Shaun.

95
00:05:19,938 --> 00:05:22,451
- Lovely bit of muffin.
- Hello, you.

96
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,917
Go on. Go, lick.

97
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,408
Why is he eating like that?

98
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,134
Yeah, why are you eating like that?

99
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:30,628
Me hands, I've been cleaning
the toilets with no gloves.

100
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:34,014
You shook my hand
when you came in.

101
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:36,124
It was polite,
listen to this.

102
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,178
Just being polite.

103
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:39,193
We're celebrating
with a lovely bit of muffin.

104
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,052
What'd be the best news
you could get today?

105
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,777
You're going full time
at the Carphone Warehouse.

106
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:44,713
I don't work
at the Carephone Warehouse anymore.

107
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:47,331
I do saturday mornings
while Norinda's pregnant.

108
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:50,679
What news would mean you finally got
the critical respect you wanted?

109
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:53,463
Don't know, being on a comedy
with catch-phrases and stupid wigs

110
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:56,035
filmed in front of a live
studio audience of morons

111
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,543
is suddenly considered cool.

112
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,073
That's never gonna happen, is it ?

113
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:00,761
No, you've been nominated
for a BAFTA.

114
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,735
- Best Comedy Performance.
- Really ?

115
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:08,316
Not gonna win that.

116
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,780
Sommat classier than this'll win.

117
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:12,900
I was thinking the same, then I was
looking at the list of nominees...

118
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,907
And it's all crap this year, so
you've got as good a chance as anyone.

119
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:17,226
Cheers.

120
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:20,417
More good news as well:
I had a call from a toy manufacturer,

121
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:22,847
and they're quite keen to put out
a Ray doll, for Christmas.

122
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:24,925
You press a button, he goes
"You having a laugh?"

123
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,866
- Who's gonna buy that?
- Same people who watch your show!

124
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,763
Thick kids and their thick parents...

125
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:32,668
Yeah, thick people, I get it,
that's what I'm going for.

126
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:35,720
Don't slag it off, those people
spend a fortune on this sort of tack.

127
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,381
And ringtones as well!
Oh, that crazy frog made millions.

128
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,910
Where is he now?

129
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:48,712
Probably working on a follow-up album,
or trying to crack Japan.

130
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:49,643
Not bad for a frog.

131
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:51,947
He's very good for a frog Bar,
if you don't mind me saying.

132
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:54,894
I think he's probably the 2nd
richest frog in the world after Kermit.

133
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:57,700
Kermit, yeah!
And his nephew, Robin?

134
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:58,764
Oh, Robin was good.

135
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,652
Looked set to take over
the empire for a while.

136
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:01,992
He was a good
actor and singer.

137
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:04,047
- "Half way up the stairs" ?
- Good song.

138
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,526
I've never been
to an awards ceremony before.

139
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:08,261
Nor have I.

140
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,921
- There'll be photographers there.
- Probably.

141
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:14,160
What if I fall,
or dribble something down my front?

142
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:15,537
What're you, a toddler?

143
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,013
Oh some nice frocks in here.
Come on and have a look,

144
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,845
- choose something.
- I'll wait out here.

145
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,208
How much is this one?

146
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:52,274
That's £2,500.

147
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,512
- It's a bit much.
- Yes.

148
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:01,071
- Are there any of these that are...
- It's all very expensive.

149
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:03,239
I don't think
you can afford anything.

150
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,697
How do you know
what I can afford?

151
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,198
Just a hunch.

152
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,777
Hunching hunch...

153
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:14,769
Nothing.

154
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,338
- Nothing in there?
- No, nothing. Come on, let's go.

155
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:31,063
- Where are we going now?
- Somewhere, just anywhere else.

156
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:32,222
What are you looking for?

157
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,947
A place where people
aren't quite as rude.

158
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:37,291
- Who was rude?
- Her, in there!

159
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,083
What happened?

160
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:41,804
She just looked at me like I shouldn't
be there, like I was a piece of dirt.

161
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:44,266
Come on.

162
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:01,995
Good day.

163
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:04,457
My friend here
was looking for a dress.

164
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:07,358
I wonder if we could help her
with that Gold card.

165
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:09,453
- I'm sure we can.
- Good.

166
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:11,636
I think she was looking at this one.

167
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:14,039
Oh, wonderful.
How much is that?

168
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,603
£2,500.

169
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:22,683
- Do you want that?
- Yeah.

170
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:26,478
- If you don't want it, don't have it.
- No, I want it.

171
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,657
I can definitely afford it,
it's just a matter of...

172
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:31,496
Is it the right dress?

173
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,474
Could we bring it back?

174
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,760
If there's something wrong with it,
say, after this coming Sunday?

175
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:40,888
We don't do refunds.

176
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,584
But if it didn't fit?

177
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:46,295
- Well, she should try it on.
- I know. What if she got fat?

178
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,405
- By Sunday?
- No. What if...

179
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,673
the stitch in there was to be
pulled apart slightly.

180
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:54,280
Just kind of apart.
Just normal...

181
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,222
Wear and tear. The...

182
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,492
Sweat rot,
under the old armpit.

183
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:02,001
Cuts through the old stitches.

184
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,276
Could we...

185
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:07,290
Let's make absolutely sure, okay?
Always good to be sure.

186
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:08,522
Sorry about this.

187
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:09,898
You're not thinking.

188
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:14,132
I'm gonna ask you a question now.
Consider the answer.

189
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:19,891
Do you really want me to spend
£2,500 on that dress?

190
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:22,397
She does!

191
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,455
We all learnt a lesson today.

192
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:31,746
There's a chance it won't fit.

193
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:35,115
It's not even tax deductible.

194
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:39,160
Do you do...

195
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,475
celebrity discount?

196
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,200
- I don't know who she is.
- She's nobody!

197
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:46,031
You having a laugh?

198
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:48,507
No, we don't do discount.

199
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:50,998
Not "are you having a laugh".
Watch this and comprehend.

200
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:52,800
Are you having a laugh?

201
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:55,189
Does no one here know...

202
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,933
Is she having a laugh?

203
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,863
- Oh, yeah, you're from that sitcom.
- Correct.

204
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,181
Any good?

205
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,441
Not really.

206
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:05,269
It's a bit broad.
Relies on catch-phrases and funny wigs.

207
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,779
Sorry, did I ask for a critique?

208
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:09,006
's like coming round to the store and
me saying you ain't swept up right, mate.

209
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:10,097
Unbelievable.

210
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,115
So you don't do
celebrity discount?

211
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,166
Not 1%?
Can you give me 1%?

212
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:17,155
Okay, I'll do you a 1% discount.

213
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,283
What's that?

214
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:21,404
On 2, 500?
25£.

215
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:22,986
Not worth it.

216
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,580
I'd rather you stuck it on,
if anything.

217
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:28,862
Well, shall we just leave it as it is?

218
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,181
That's your Christmas <i>and</i> birthday!

219
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:37,053
Never have spent that much.

220
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,269
Those are £600.
They're very expensive.

221
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:48,746
I was laughing they weren't
expensive enough.

222
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:51,236
That's what tickled me
when I first saw the 600...

223
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:52,598
What do you think?

224
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,401
- Do you think it's alright?
- Yeah.

225
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:02,079
Can I get it?

226
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,060
- Will you win tonight?
- Oh, it's just...

227
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:33,903
- flattering to be nominated.
- Is that your girlfriend?

228
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:34,856
Alright.

229
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:37,595
Always tell journalists the truth,
let them change the facts later.

230
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:39,310
And who are you wearing?

231
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:40,732
Maggie.

232
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,549
- No.
- Who are you <i>wearing</i>?

233
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:43,633
Maggie Jacobs.

234
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,916
- No, whose dress is that?
- Me.

235
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:47,856
Okay, thank you,
she won the competition.

236
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:50,136
Don't speak to anyone else tonight.
Not even to me.

237
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:59,015
Toby Anstis.

238
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:00,893
Have you ever eaten a worm?

239
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,442
I don't even know
what a "worrum" is.

240
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:06,520
There's a 'R' in it.
You should prrronounce it.

241
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:08,308
Old girlfriend.

242
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:13,084
- You alright?
- I'm good, thanks.

243
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:17,202
- You do well!
- Yeah, all downhill for me.

244
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:22,609
Were you...

245
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:28,733
Are you BAFTA tonight?

246
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,913
Yeah, as part of "The Hobby".

247
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:35,049
- Good luck with...
- Thanks.

248
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:37,877
- And good luck to you.
- Absolutely.

249
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:46,376
- Yeah, I'll see you later.
- Good luck with the...

250
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:49,673
- Good luck.
- See you later. Cheers.

251
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:54,479
- Who was that?
- The most boring woman in the world.

252
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:56,222
Really?
How do you know her?

253
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:59,021
I went out with her for a while
when I was an extra on Holby City.

254
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,131
- And she dumped you?
- No, I dumped her!

255
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,963
- You dumped her?
- Yes.

256
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,560
- Really?
- Yes, it does happen.

257
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,494
- When was this?
- Couple of years ago.

258
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:09,108
Was it before or after you lost
your virginity to the one

259
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,156
- that looked like Ronnie Corbett?
- After, obviously! It was 2 years ago.

260
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:15,343
So you lost your virginity
a long time ago then, did you?

261
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,160
- I'm in my fourties!
- I know, but when?

262
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,401
- A long time ago!
- That's exactly... What age?

263
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,453
- I don't know.
- What, sixteen?

264
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:23,168
Seventeen?

265
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,280
Were you older than that?

266
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:29,283
What is it with all these questions?
I lost my virginity, full stop!

267
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:31,716
Why were you attracted
to Ronnie Corbet?

268
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,309
I wasn't. She started
to look like Ronnie Corbett.

269
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,621
It was the bank's Christmas do,
I was drunk, alright?

270
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,892
At the bank's Christmas do?

271
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,281
But you didn't start working
until you were 28.

272
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,244
Who are you, Columbo?

273
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:45,930
Leave it!

274
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,362
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage...</i>

275
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,101
<i>Davina McCall!</i>

276
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:08,712
Good evening, and welcome to the
British Academy Television Awards.

277
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:10,251
And in front of me,

278
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:13,415
our whole host of understandbly
anxious stars wondering

279
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:17,276
whether they're going to walk away
with that most coveted of awards,

280
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,019
<i>the BAFTA mask.</i>

281
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:23,019
<i>Now, to our first category
this evening, it is the...</i>

282
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:30,595
<i>I also want to thank
our inspiring and bossy...</i>

283
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:34,713
<i>...goes to... Oh, my favourite,
"Jamie's Prison Dinners"!</i>

284
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:39,401
<i>...terrific production team.
You are family and thanks...</i>

285
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:44,192
<i>...newspaper, our TV news rooms
have to remain impartial...</i>

286
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:52,325
<i>The winner is...
"The woman who gave birth to herself!"</i>

287
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:56,492
<i>The white in my eyeline,
on all fours,</i>

288
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:59,305
<i>- like a dog...
- The BAFTA goes to...</i>

289
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:01,870
<i>"South Bank Show,
Dick & Dom special".</i>

290
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:18,368
- Everything alright here?
- We could do with...

291
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:20,903
some more wine please, waiter.

292
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:24,185
Comedy gold.
Absolute comedy gold.

293
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:28,639
No, I'm actually here
in official capacity

294
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:31,453
for the Best Drama nomination.

295
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,273
For Paul Abbott's,
"Cock of the North".

296
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:37,028
- I imagine you saw it.
- I didn't.

297
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,226
I had quite a large part.

298
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:41,321
It was good, you know.
Best Drama.

299
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:44,031
The Holy Grail.
BAFTAs.

300
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:48,881
And you're... of course,
you're here with your sitcom.

301
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:51,592
- Good luck.
- And you, mate.

302
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:55,298
It deserves, you know, it's...
I understand it's very popular.

303
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:56,250
Good luck, mate.

304
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:59,070
- I'd better get back.
- See you later.

305
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:00,982
Drams crowds, as it were.

306
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,526
- Catch you later.
- Cheers, mate.

307
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:12,670
<i>Many of you at home
and in this room</i>

308
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:15,659
<i>probably don't recognise
Len Shearman.</i>

309
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,165
But you certainly
recognize his work.

310
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:22,048
Len was one of the most influential
and passionate drama producers

311
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:23,704
in the history of television.

312
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,759
Excuse me.

313
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,848
Oh, for f...

314
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,950
- Sorry I'm a bit late...
- Shut up!

315
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,782
Richard Briers!

316
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,419
I'm a bit a late cause
I was waiting for this,

317
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:50,256
which is the prototype
of the Ray doll.

318
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,517
I don't care.

319
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:57,505
There he is.

320
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,058
Who's gonna buy that?

321
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,874
Like I said before, stupid people.

322
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,892
- Who are these stupid people?
- That's brilliant, can you buy them?

323
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:05,402
You'll be able to buy them.

324
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:08,801
What're you doing?

325
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:13,080
<i>I was with Len...</i>

326
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:16,318
only a few days before the end.

327
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:17,636
<i>Is he having a laugh?</i>

328
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,687
And he didn't have long...

329
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:22,222
Just take the batteries out.

330
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,328
I need a tiny screwdriver...

331
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:29,929
His wife...
He leaves his lovely wife...

332
00:18:53,137 --> 00:18:54,910
Tacky shit!

333
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:14,516
Don't do that.

334
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,953
Put the trousers on.

335
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,316
Andy's friend, Maggie.

336
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,524
He didn't introduce us, so hello.

337
00:19:45,147 --> 00:19:47,140
God, you two used to go out!

338
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,224
For about ten minutes.

339
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:51,023
Why did he let you go?
Look at you, all lovely!

340
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:53,294
Bit of a catch for him.

341
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:55,521
A man that didn't lose his virginity
'til he was 20

342
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,953
and that was to a woman
who looked like Ronnie Corbett.

343
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:04,443
What did you say when he said
he couldn't go out with you anymore

344
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,333
'cause he thought you were boring?

345
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:12,384
He said it was
because I was boring?

346
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,193
He told me it was because he just
came out of a long-term relationship,

347
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,201
he wasn't ready for something else.

348
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:25,922
Not boring.
He didn't say you were boring.

349
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,797
He said that the BAF...

350
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,889
The ceremony, the clapping...

351
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:34,699
That it was gonna be boring, 'cause...

352
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:50,521
Coming up, we have the prestigious
BAFTA Fellowship, but first,

353
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,866
the award for Comedy Performance,

354
00:20:52,954 --> 00:20:56,455
to please will you welcome
Harry Hill!

355
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:08,185
Commiserations again, Andy.

356
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:10,407
I knew I wouldn't win.
I'm not into the awards anyway...

357
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:13,686
Still, it's nice to have some
recognition from one's peers, isn't it?

358
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,074
Listen, it's not really
my business, but...

359
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:18,711
Have you considered doing something
without a laughter track?

360
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:20,462
They're considered rather
old-fashioned.

361
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:22,946
You know, if you wanna pick up
one of these old gongs.

362
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,276
Not bothered, as I say.
Not in it for the awards...

363
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:29,394
But wigs and silly glasses?
A bit undignified for men of our age.

364
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:32,368
- We're not the same age, but... Cheers.
- Looks a bit desperate.

365
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:35,255
- Is all I'm saying.
- I don't feel desperate.

366
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,610
As I say, it's a knock-about comedy.
I'm not into high arts.

367
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:40,500
But as Oscar Wilde
so wonderfully put it,

368
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:44,471
"we're all in the gutter, but
some of us are looking at the stars."

369
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:47,285
It was probably about
men's trousers, the old puff.

370
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:48,501
Sorry?

371
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:52,230
He was looking at the...
stars, yeah.

372
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:55,058
That's right. I'm off to look at
some stars myself right now.

373
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:56,537
You'll be seing stars in a minute.

374
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,149
- What?
- Nothing.

375
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:00,479
Why do you keep coming back in?

376
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:09,823
Come in here,
it's all kicking off in here.

377
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,164
I'm not coming in there.

378
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,065
What are you doing? What?

379
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:18,695
Who's that?

380
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,672
How you doing, alright?

381
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,002
He's one of us, don't worry.

382
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:28,248
I'm not into this.

383
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:31,281
Just have a little bit,
it'll cheer you up.

384
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,230
What's going on in there?

385
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,790
I'm just finishing up,
excuse me for five minutes!

386
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:38,461
Why're you doing
a woman's voice?

387
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:40,175
How many people
are in there?

388
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:42,989
- One.
- That's a different voice!

389
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,480
Two, including the woman
you just heard.

390
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:46,915
<i>Open the door.</i>

391
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,944
Let me explain.
I was here and I was leaving,

392
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:58,460
- and he... That's my agent.
- Darren Lamb, nice to meet you.

393
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:01,514
You shouldn't say your name,
never tell'em your name.

394
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:06,614
Well, he knows who...

395
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:13,882
It was your fault.

396
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:14,740
Why?

397
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:17,897
Because he saw your head
over the cubicle door.

398
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:19,684
They saw your head
<i>under</i> the door.

399
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:22,365
There's no point in
argumenting ourselves with...

400
00:23:24,108 --> 00:23:26,233
Well, well, well...
The three Stooges.

401
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:27,435
Sorry, something funny?

402
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,178
- Your joke...
- Shut up.

403
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:31,596
Corbett.

404
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:34,395
It's always bloody Corbett.

405
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:36,753
It's expected of him.

406
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:39,047
You're the new kid
on the block, aren't you?

407
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:40,878
How did you fall in
with this crowd?

408
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:46,050
Is this it?
Or is there any more?

409
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:53,259
Just a bit of whizz you know,
to blow away the cobwebs.

410
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,003
Hand it over.

411
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,450
Where did you get it?

412
00:23:59,047 --> 00:23:59,941
Don't remember.

413
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,315
Don't piss me up, Grandma.
Where did you get it?

414
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:04,425
Don't remember.

415
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:07,165
Is it Moira Stuart?

416
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:09,861
I can't say.

417
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:12,132
Look, we don't want you.

418
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:15,062
Just give us a name,
and you can walk free.

419
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:17,905
You don't get it, mate, do you?
I don't remember!

420
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,030
Alright, here's something
you <i>will</i> remember.

421
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:21,876
You're banned from BAFTA.

422
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:23,545
You can never win a BAFTA now.

423
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,963
- What, me as well?
- Yeah, all of you.

424
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,190
You can never attend
any of our varied events,

425
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:31,780
you can't come to the Film BAFTAs,
you can't come to the TV BAFTAs.

426
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:33,920
You can't even come
to the Children's BAFTAs.

427
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,898
What about Welsh BAFTAs?

428
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:38,316
Would you attend the Welsh BAFTAs
if you were asked?

429
00:24:38,403 --> 00:24:44,206
Probably.
Okay, expect a call.
He'll come to the Welsh BAFTAs
if you want.

430
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:47,371
Yeah, we're after... you know,
more respected comedians.

431
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:48,675
Makes sense.

432
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:51,810
Get out of my sight.
That's all of you, yeah?

433
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:53,582
"Makes sense"?

434
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,248
I reckon I could've
had him in a fight.

435
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:58,881
You f... idiot.

436
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,678
<i>And the winner is...</i>

437
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,926
<i>"Holby City"!</i>

438
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:23,869
Thank you all,
very very much indeed.

439
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:25,554
I'd like to thank...

440
00:25:25,642 --> 00:25:27,591
Is that the girl
you lost your virgnity to?

441
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:28,206
Who?

442
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,507
That one that looks
like Ronnie Corbett.

443
00:25:31,092 --> 00:25:32,880
That <i>is</i> Ronnie Corbett.

444
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,997
Why would she be wearing a tuxedo?

445
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:38,784
She might be a lesbian.

446
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:41,904
And why would I lose
my virginity to a lesbian?

447
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:45,457
Don't know, but she might have turned
lesbian after you slept with her.

448
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:49,919
...on a personal note, thank you
to my partner, once again...

449
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:52,761
Well, I can never win a BAFTA,
as long as I live.

450
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:54,828
- Why?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

451
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,450
This is a shitty night.
Can't get any worse, though.

452
00:25:57,524 --> 00:26:00,660
I'd just like to say
to Andy Millman...

453
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:02,594
Right?

454
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:04,879
I may be boring,

455
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:10,227
but at least I didn't lose
my virginity when I was 28!

456
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:14,768
To a woman that looks like
Ronnie fucking Corbett!

457
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,852
Prick!

458
00:26:22,754 --> 00:26:24,571
No explanations needed.

459
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:26,271
What's up next?

460
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:30,462
Huw Wheldon Award for
Specialist Factual. Brilliant.

461
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,911
Subtitles: Quarkienette & Nathbot

Watch the credits till the end ;)

463
00:27:08,622 --> 00:27:11,010
- Can we get a cab?
- No, we walk.

464
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:11,977
I'm joking.

465
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:14,028
Sell the dress,
we can get a limo.

466
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:15,596
Can I get an autograph, please?

467
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,025
Jay Sproten.
