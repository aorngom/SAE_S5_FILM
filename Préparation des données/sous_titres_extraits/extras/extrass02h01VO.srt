1
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:13,359
Day 7 - all the housemates
are in the kitchen.

2
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:19,373
Shut up!
I'm talking about her!

3
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:23,331
- For God's sake!
- Shut up!

4
00:00:23,598 --> 00:00:25,234
Listen to me!

5
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:32,732
SIX MONTHS EARLIER

6
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:46,611
Rita, what on earth are you doing?

7
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:48,996
I'm learning to play the recorder.

8
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:50,071
Why?

9
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,452
They say that every now and then
you should swap places with your child

10
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:56,842
so each of you gets to see
how the other half lives.

11
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:59,218
So I'm learning
how to play the recorder.

12
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:00,833
What's your daughter doing?

13
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:05,203
She's sat at home with a bottle of gin
thinking about her failed marriage.

14
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:07,454
Rita, you are a card.

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,418
Yeah, the joker.

16
00:01:13,284 --> 00:01:15,635
Oh, it's no good.
It's too difficult.

17
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:19,222
Rita, I used to play
the recorder at school,

18
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:20,955
let me help you learn...

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,851
- Oh, thank you, Brains.
- OK.

20
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,781
Yes, Mr Yamaguchi.
No, Mr Yamaguchi.

21
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,478
If I just say, one more time,

22
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:29,149
I am velly, velly solly.

23
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:31,369
I mean I'm very, very sorry.

24
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:34,612
Yes, ah soles to you, too,
ah soles to you, too, goodbye.

25
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,650
Rita, just relax.

26
00:01:40,648 --> 00:01:42,681
But it's so hard.

27
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,018
Just take it in your hand.

28
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:50,301
And blow.

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,758
Don't suck.

30
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:56,025
Oh, that's good.

31
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,080
What the bloody hell's going on here?!

32
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:03,876
Oh, sorry, Mr Stokes, I don't know
when I'm blowing and when I'm sucking.

33
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:07,129
She's learning to play the recorder.

34
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:08,907
What does it record?

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,306
What does it record?

36
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:12,890
It doesn't record anything.

37
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,135
What's it called a recorder for, then?

38
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:16,552
I don't get it.

39
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:20,505
Are you havin a laugh?
Is he havin a laugh?

40
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:31,836
Sometimes, Gobbler...

41
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:34,068
- Raymond...
- Oh, my God!

42
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:35,939
- What is it?
- Raymond...

43
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:39,048
It's only my bloody twin sister...

44
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,975
- Hello, Raymond.
- What are you doing here?

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,513
<i>A young girl gets lonely.</i>

46
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:50,753
<i>Maybe so,
but what are you doing here?</i>

47
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:27,602
Mr Millman?

48
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:29,659
Hello there, sorry to bother you,

49
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:32,640
I saw you in here.
My name's Richard, I'm the manager.

50
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,332
- You've got to help me.
- Why?

51
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,506
Would you mind signing
a few of these?

52
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,698
What, now?

53
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,084
They're not moving.
Just as many as you can manage.

54
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:43,231
If you sign ten, that's ten we've got
more chance of selling.

55
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:45,018
I thought the public'd lap
this tat up,

56
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,127
but they're more discerning
than I thought.

57
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:50,243
Even the Kramer doll's selling
better than this.

58
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:52,447
<i>I'm out there, Jerry...</i>

59
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,773
<i>And I'm loving it!</i>

60
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,228
<i>Shut up!</i>

61
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,766
<i>Fifty years ago we had you upside down
with a fucking fork up your ass!</i>

62
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:06,458
It's cheap and ugly,
I suppose that's the problem.

63
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,131
Yeah, it is ugly.

64
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,650
<i>Are you havin a laugh?
Are you havin a laugh?</i>

65
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:16,549
Who'd have thought people
would eventually find that irritating?

66
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:20,321
Thing is, you've got to order these
things like a year in advance. Still...

67
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:22,503
I won't make the same mistake again.

68
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,392
I'll make my money back
next Christmas.

69
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:27,592
I've ordered 10,000 Sanjaya dolls.

70
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:30,223
Well you're laughing, then, aren't you?

71
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,206
What would you rather do, right?

72
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:40,131
Never celebrate Christmas ever
or have Christmas every day?

73
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,804
If it's Christmas every day,
what do I have to do?

74
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:46,671
Nothing. You just sit at home,
watching telly, having the day off.

75
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:50,094
So no-one works? There's no industry,
no government? It's chaos.

76
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:52,185
So you'd rather
never celebrate Christmas?

77
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:54,382
Well, yeah, if that was the choice.

78
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:56,744
So you'd be jewish?
They don't celebrate Christmas.

79
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:58,844
Why would I suddenly be jewish?

80
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:01,787
I don't know
what you're talking about.

81
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:06,642
Ready?

82
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:08,383
Yes.

83
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:23,750
Oh, look, it's Greg in a film.

84
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:26,078
Come on,
we can't watch telly in the day.

85
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,559
Wait, I wanna see.

86
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,847
No man has the right
to kill his brother.

87
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,809
<i>It is no excuse to do so in uniform.</i>

88
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,482
<i>It merely adds the infamy of
servitude to the crime of murder.</i>

89
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:38,001
I love Clive Owen.

90
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:42,174
Clive - good name for a film star.

91
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,770
<i>If we must have a tyrant, let him be
a gentleman bred to the business,</i>

92
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,693
<i>and let us fall by the axe,
and not by the butcher's cleaver.</i>

93
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,067
Greg seems good in it.

94
00:05:58,647 --> 00:05:59,875
It'll be a bit part.

95
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:02,717
<i>... Clive Owen and Greg Lindley Jones,
the two leads in the film.</i>

96
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:04,068
He's one of the leads.

97
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:06,871
In a terrible film.

98
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,625
<i>- I thought it was brilliant.</i>
- He thought it was brilliant.

99
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,260
I can hear!

100
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,681
<i>It was an action film
as well as a period drama.</i>

101
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:16,169
<i>Clive, you're Byron, of course,
but Greg, you play Shelley,</i>

102
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:20,185
<i>and it's one of the most exciting
breakthrough performances ever.</i>

103
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:21,675
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

104
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:24,896
<i>How was it for you working with
such an established star as Clive Owen?</i>

105
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,123
<i>I hope you don't mind me saying this,
he is such a down-to-earth guy.</i>

106
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:29,307
<i>He is just so real.</i>

107
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:31,508
<i>We had a good time, didn't we?</i>

108
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,992
<i>We got on, and I know
a lot of people say that,</i>

109
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:36,805
<i>but we really,
really did get on well.</i>

110
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:39,443
I can't believe you persuaded me
to do these things.

111
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:41,497
They're not even selling, apparently.

112
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:43,655
There's going to be
loads of them lying around

113
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:46,021
in bargain bins for ages, cheap tat.

114
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:48,258
They've cut the price
to try and shift a few

115
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:51,493
but they're so cheap to manufacture,
we're still getting like 40p a time.

116
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:52,956
They're made in sweat shops.

117
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,856
Thank God
for the exploitation of children!

118
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,976
Absolutely. And that's your key
demographic as well, kids.

119
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,933
Even if they do a 14-hour day
they probably have a whale of time.

120
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:04,332
"Are you havin a laugh?"
They enjoy themselves.

121
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:06,683
Hope it doesn't distract them.
They'll get a beating.

122
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:07,997
I don't wanna hear this.

123
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:10,057
They wouldn't work there
if they didn't like it.

124
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:11,558
I doubt they get a choice.

125
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:13,549
As Henri Matisse once said,

126
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:16,313
"Derive happiness in oneself
from a good day's work,

127
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:18,838
from illuminating the fog
that surrounds us."

128
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:20,525
Yeah, what you working on today?

129
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:22,833
I'm trying to get
this dog muck out of his shoe.

130
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:25,748
Next door's Great Dane.
The stench is unbelievable.

131
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:28,607
I've seem them feeding it
hard-boiled eggs. It's mad, isn't it?

132
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:30,199
- Really, I don't care.
- Sure?

133
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,953
I don't wanna be
associated with that.

134
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:34,706
To the public, there's no difference
between me and that doll.

135
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:36,600
Little fat ugly thing, pathetic?

136
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,187
No, I put on...

137
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:41,031
I put on a wig
and shout a catchphrase.

138
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:42,923
I wanna be associated
with credible stuff.

139
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,703
We've had offers.

140
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:48,190
Part in the BBC's jewel
in the crown, Doctor Who.

141
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:51,390
Er, Hotel Babylon?

142
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,251
No, I don't wanna do...

143
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,451
camp, frothy nonsense,
I wanna do something classy.

144
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:58,271
Celebrity Big Brother?

145
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,065
- You're not listening.
- Good money.

146
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,691
Not in a million years.
What happened to films?

147
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:06,422
Well, you know this Byron film
everyone's raving about?

148
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:08,460
Right, well they're making a sequel.

149
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,287
Should be classy, should be good.

150
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,094
It's about what it means to be a man,
about honour, integrity.

151
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:15,090
- They wanted you to audition.
- Right.

152
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,987
Obviously I said no,
but it was positive.

153
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:19,738
- Why say no?
- They wanted someone who's 36,

154
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,704
handsome, dashing,
and I thought it was safer...

155
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,109
Always do the audition.

156
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:27,279
But, look at you, that's insane.
I might as well send Barry.

157
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:29,862
Call them back and say
you've got the perfect person.

158
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:31,015
- Who?
- Me!

159
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,930
I don't wanna waste their time.

160
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,426
I'm trying to persuade my agent
to get an audition.

161
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:37,069
It should be the other way round.

162
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:39,187
But they'll think
I don't know what I'm doing.

163
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,174
No-one could think you're a waste of space
and shouldn't be in the industry.

164
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,017
Thanks, but you'd be surprised.

165
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:47,881
Get me the audition.

166
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:56,006
That's a ten-minute break, everyone,
sandwiches are over here.

167
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:01,739
Could you just let the actors and
the crew have theirs first, please?

168
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:21,940
Could you hold on?

169
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,439
- Are you Maggie?
- Yes.

170
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:07,071
Andy wants to see you
in his dressing room.

171
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:09,899
- What, now?
- Yeah, chop chop.

172
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,726
Oh, hello, Mrs Millman, is Andy in?

173
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:27,489
It's a face pack,
don't make me laugh.

174
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,248
- What for?
- For a film role.

175
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:30,822
You going for a film?

176
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:33,746
Yeah, right.
OK, help me out, don't comment.

177
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,674
Is that a girdle?

178
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:39,383
No, it just helps firm up the...

179
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:40,303
Flab?

180
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,272
Come on, then, quick.

181
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,802
Are you serious? I've got to...

182
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:46,898
It's not going to work.

183
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:49,515
- Course it is, I'll breathe in.
- Six inches.

184
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:50,928
Come on then, go.

185
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,733
Don't make me laugh,
don't make me laugh.

186
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,425
Go on then, go on, go.

187
00:10:58,545 --> 00:11:01,316
- Oh, my God.
- Where do your organs go?

188
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:03,971
- My fingers are spasming.
- Do they just get closer together

189
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,514
or am I going to cough up
a kidney in the audition?

190
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:09,963
Natural.

191
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:15,424
He was just... I don't think
he was good as I thought he was...

192
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,474
- Andrew Millman.
- Greg.

193
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:22,330
You're looking good.
Been working out, innit?

194
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:25,579
Sorry, must declare
an interest, actually.

195
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,745
Me and Andy are very old friends,

196
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:30,859
we've been climbing
the slippery showbiz ladder together.

197
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:34,071
Some of us got
a little further than others.

198
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,145
Anyway, I won't be biased.

199
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:41,025
- So which role are you here for?
- Henry Milligan.

200
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:44,902
Hang on, you can't be Henry Milligan,
says here "aged 36".

201
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:49,295
Yeah, I took that as being
mid-to-late thirties.

202
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:51,379
We'll change it to "late thirties".

203
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:57,665
Hang on, you can't be Henry Milligan.
It says here "late thirties".

204
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:01,616
Shall we do one? Yeah?

205
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,868
Do you want to stand up?

206
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,296
Yep. Easy.

207
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,634
Yep, from your line, thanks.

208
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,632
Ah, Henry Milligan,
allow me to introduce myself.

209
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,611
Your reputation precedes you,
sir, and it is one that...

210
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:20,214
Sorry, can we just stop there?

211
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,651
Something seems to have happened
to Andy's midriff.

212
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,842
Can we just rewind that
and see what happened?

213
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,254
I don't know
if everyone else saw that.

214
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:30,048
<i>Your reputation precedes you,
sir, and it is one that...</i>

215
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:32,792
There, look at his belly.

216
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:35,598
Andy, has your diaphragm just collapsed?

217
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:39,155
Oh, dear,
he seems to have scuttled off.

218
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:45,407
<i>Hello, it's me. Leave a message after
the tone and I'll get back to you.</i>

219
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:46,601
<i>Did that record?</i>

220
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:51,573
<i>Hi, it's me, do you fancy some lunch,
at the Ivy, I'll pay?</i>

221
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:54,207
<i>I can tell you all
about my brilliant audition...</i>

222
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:58,219
All right, give us a call back,
cheers, bye.

223
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:00,484
Andy Millman.

224
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,389
All right, Bunny. What you doing?

225
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:04,928
Waiting.

226
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:06,162
Waiting?

227
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:08,633
- For what?
- Cock.

228
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,935
Yeah, never too early for that, is it?

229
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:14,129
- Don't you know about this area?
- No, I've just moved in.

230
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,412
This area's famous for it.
I'm here all the time.

231
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:20,005
This is known as the waiting bench!

232
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,217
Oh, by the way, loving the show.

233
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,196
- Cheers.
- "You having a laugh?"

234
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,058
Keep walking, keep walking.

235
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:36,159
She'll never get anything
in the daylight.

236
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,279
Hello, Bunny.

237
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:39,115
Oh, hi, George.

238
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,532
- Any action?
- No.

239
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:49,707
I've only got 20 minutes, actually.
I'm on my lunch break.

240
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:50,878
Lunch break?

241
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,698
- Yeah, I'm doing community service.
- Ah, you still doing that?

242
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,009
Oh, no, I'm doing another one.
I'm picking up litter now.

243
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,550
All right.
What did you do wrong this time?

244
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:03,139
Fly tipping, believe it or not.

245
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:07,437
I was helping Annie Lennox out
with an old fridge freezer,

246
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,581
and she said,
"Shall I call the council?"

247
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:12,505
I said, "Don't bother -
there's a skip at the end of my street."

248
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:16,807
So, 2.30 in the morning,
we're tipping it in there,

249
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,703
and the fucking police show up.

250
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:20,633
How did they get involved, then?

251
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:24,196
Well, it was Stewart Copeland's skip,
and he called Sting

252
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:28,110
and Sting called the fucking council
cause he's a fucking do-gooder.

253
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,741
And now me and Annie
are picking up litter.

254
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,239
I better get going, you know, I'm going
to have to get back to work soon.

255
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:38,293
Come on then, you.
I'll give you a quickie.

256
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:40,443
Oi, I'm not that desperate, matey.

257
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:41,601
Cheeky bastard.

258
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:44,499
Do me a favour and
look out for for paparazzi?

259
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,054
I'm gonna go and try over there.

260
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:47,305
- Love to.
- Yeah.

261
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:48,731
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

262
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:51,622
I've had him before, you know.

263
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,292
In his car.

264
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,212
Wasn't that a bit cramped?

265
00:14:56,332 --> 00:14:58,511
And he was swerving
all over the bloody road.

266
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,360
Keep an eye out for me
as well, will you?

267
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:03,475
That old queen can't have got too far.

268
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,602
Hello!

269
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:09,702
- I don't know what this bench is for.
- Eh? What did you say?

270
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,204
Why are you sitting there?

271
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:15,105
I live across the road,
and just fancied a sit down.

272
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:16,956
Well, why not sit in your garden?

273
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:18,751
No bench.

274
00:15:19,507 --> 00:15:22,245
Wanna sit in the garden, fine,
but you'll be sitting on the grass.

275
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,366
Yeah, but why you sitting
on the queer bench?

276
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:26,803
Have you seen George Michael?

277
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,888
Strange question.

278
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,479
My editor wants a picture
of someone famous acting bent

279
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,572
and all I've got is you
sitting on a queer bench.

280
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,105
I'm not involved, so don't...

281
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:38,599
I know he's been here.

282
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,221
How do you know?

283
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:42,159
A joint...

284
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:44,270
... and a kebab.

285
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:46,814
- He's in the bushes.
- Thank you very much.

286
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:09,898
Thank you very much, cheers.

287
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:21,227
We haven't booked. I wonder
if you've got a table for two.

288
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,075
You have to book, I'm afraid.

289
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,523
Couldn't you just squeeze us in?

290
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:26,943
We won't have a starter.

291
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:29,698
- I'm sorry, there's nothing.
- Or a pudding.

292
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:32,150
- We'll be 20 minutes, in and out.
- I'm sorry.

293
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:33,998
You don't, er...

294
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,338
- We are...
- ... The management.

295
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:38,828
No, I am the manager.

296
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,238
No, on TV, we used to do these
characters called The Management.

297
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:46,531
- The Stonk?
- Le Stonk? Is that a restaurant?

298
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,925
No, it's a song we did.

299
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:51,887
I'm really sorry,
there's nothing available

300
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:53,932
but you can book up
to three months in advance.

301
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:56,590
We don't know where
we're gonna be in three months.

302
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:58,646
Might not be alive in three months.

303
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,023
What would you rather do?

304
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:04,095
Be on the Planet Of The Apes,
you're human but you can't speak,

305
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:07,213
or be the first ever monkey on Earth
to speak like a human,

306
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,599
but you're a monkey?

307
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:11,538
- Do I know I'm a monkey?
- You know you're a monkey.

308
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:13,176
Sorry, we haven't booked.

309
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,610
No problem.
I'm sure I can squeeze you in.

310
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,080
Thank you, cheers.

311
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:19,986
Oh, look, it's them two.
What's their names again?

312
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,115
- Hale and Pace.
- Hale. Pace.

313
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:23,777
Like Ant and Dec?

314
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:25,928
Without their money.

315
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:28,341
They just throw money
at performers now.

316
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:31,846
- Should have invested more wisely.
- Can we not do this in public?

317
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,244
It was your idea
to buy the racehorse.

318
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:36,602
It was your idea
to ride it, wasn't it?

319
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,564
You couldn't help us get in,
could you?

320
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:42,021
I don't think there's...

321
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:44,206
It was nice to meet you.

322
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,283
Cheers.

323
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:52,300
Oh, look, there's what's her name...

324
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:54,151
- Jade Jagger.
- That's it.

325
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:57,420
- What does she do?
- Fashion or something.

326
00:17:57,899 --> 00:17:59,494
Jade Jagger.

327
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:02,575
How do you think
she got her big break?

328
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,051
I wonder.

329
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,138
And what does Sadie Frost do?

330
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:10,466
She's friends with people.

331
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,977
- I didn't know that was a job.
- It is, yeah.

332
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:16,697
- Not the sausages.
- Oh, oh, right, OK.

333
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:18,757
Don't look, don't look yet, right.

334
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:21,012
The woman over there,
an amazing face.

335
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:24,132
OK? Red top, I want you
to turn and look at her

336
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:26,012
- and I'll say her name.
- OK.

337
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:27,649
Three, two, one.

338
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:28,968
Elmer Fudd.

339
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:34,742
That's the only woman
I've ever seen with a comb-over.

340
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:37,608
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you,
my name's Tre Cooper,

341
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:39,372
I represent Greg Lindley Jones.

342
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:42,009
You went in yesterday
for Byron, didn't you?

343
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:43,704
Yeah, I wasn't right for that.

344
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,535
You weren't right for <i>that</i> role.

345
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:47,774
There are a lot of film people
mentioning your name

346
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,073
- and roles you'd be right for.
- Really?

347
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:52,970
I also heard you're not
entirely happy with your show.

348
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,216
- It's not how I wanted it to be.
- Really?

349
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:57,037
You should be
on top of the world.

350
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,320
What does it get each week?
Seven million viewers?

351
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,732
- Six.
- Just six.

352
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,904
Seven million viewers
watch your show every week

353
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,787
because they respond to
what you do, and the reviews...

354
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:08,331
Don't listen to the reviews.

355
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,386
No-one's down the pub
talking about reviews,

356
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:12,971
they're talking about your sitcom,
and you know what?

357
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,200
And there'll always be people who
don't like what you do. So what?

358
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,002
If someone shouts,
"You're a wanker", you go,

359
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:20,730
"Look at my sports car."

360
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,738
If they shout, "You're still a tosser!",

361
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,627
say, "How many catchphrases
have you come up with? None."

362
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,958
And if they're still shouting at you,
just drive away.

363
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:32,281
I would.
Drive to the bank, laughing.

364
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:33,540
Who's your agent?

365
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,068
Darren Lamb.

366
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:37,413
I'm not being funny,
but I've never heard of him

367
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,347
and I've been
in this business 15 years.

368
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,534
- Where did he come from?
- Bristol.

369
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:44,311
- No, which company did he start with?
- He never did.

370
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:47,552
Yes he has, he worked part time
at the Carphone Warehouse.

371
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:49,607
Look, I don't know the guy.

372
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,478
Why would you?
You're in the business.

373
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:54,602
I don't want to disrespect him,
but business is business

374
00:19:55,122 --> 00:19:57,366
and if there's any deadwood
in your organisation,

375
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,336
you have got to get rid of it.

376
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,026
It may seem harsh but life's cruel.

377
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:05,011
No-one's gonna help
your career but you.

378
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:08,149
I'm an extra, and I love Clive Owen.

379
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:10,197
Can I get a part in that Byron film?

380
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:12,688
- Sorry.
- It's all right, she's hustling.

381
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,066
Well done.

382
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:15,570
Consider it done.

383
00:20:15,956 --> 00:20:16,956
My card.

384
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:20,029
And seriously,
if l can be of any help, call me.

385
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:22,249
- Sorry for interrupting your meal.
- All right.

386
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,338
Oh, catch of the day, Dover sole -
it is superb. Have a great lunch.

387
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,059
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

388
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,892
Oh, Elmer's looking over.

389
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:34,396
Hello.

390
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:38,193
I recommend the wabbit,
the rabbit.

391
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,320
She doesn't know, does she?

392
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:43,492
How the hell did you do that?

393
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:46,015
- I don't know, they get stuck.
- That is...

394
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,786
That's stuck fast, if I...

395
00:20:48,906 --> 00:20:50,794
- ... that's gonna break...
- Don't break it.

396
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,462
I'll put it up over your head.
Ready?

397
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:56,215
You just pull back, all right?
OK, go...

398
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:58,883
Just pull, Darren.

399
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,925
What about my head, brainiac!

400
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,751
Just pull back. I can't help you
if you don't pull back.

401
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,397
I am pulling back.

402
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,076
What exactly is your plan?

403
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:10,714
What are you actually
intending to do now?

404
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:12,418
Just you pull back.

405
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:15,271
<i>Did you learn nothing
in the fame academy, all right?</i>

406
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,980
<i>Power is not everything.
You just need to be subtle.</i>

407
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:21,298
<i>Don't sing everything
like it's bloody Mustang Sally.</i>

408
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,269
OK, Clive...

409
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:31,526
You, over here, please.

410
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:33,320
Quickly, quick sharp, yep, yep.

411
00:21:34,786 --> 00:21:37,748
So Byron's just spent the night
with a prostitute. All right?

412
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:41,055
As he leaves in the morning,
he could just turn,

413
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:43,396
and then throw the money
on the floor with contempt,

414
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,682
and your line,
"Thank you for your hospitality."

415
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:47,308
I'm not very happy with this.

416
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,141
I know it's a bit aggressive,
but it's just a character point.

417
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:52,221
No, I mean this one
being the prostitute.

418
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:54,607
I wouldn't pay for that.

419
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:57,730
Right.

420
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:00,919
- Must be a better one than this.
- Clive, seriously,

421
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:04,357
they sent me a truckload of absolute
hogs and this is the very best one.

422
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,601
Really? Jesus.

423
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,792
I don't want to be difficult.

424
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:14,848
It's just I would never pay for
a prostitute that looked like that.

425
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:18,613
What if she wasn't a prostitute,
she was just a slut, so it was free?

426
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,094
Yeah, I still could do better, though.

427
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:25,380
OK, what if she is a prostitute,
but you just refuse to pay?

428
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,348
You don't throw money on the floor,
you just...

429
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:30,608
throw food and make her
eat it like a dog.

430
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:32,309
If I'd slept with that,

431
00:22:32,474 --> 00:22:34,985
I wouldn't throw food on the floor,
I'd throw it in her face.

432
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,663
What food would you throw,
cos I gotta get props on to that?

433
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,708
It should be some kind of gruel

434
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:42,426
as if I've found some oats
on the stable floor,

435
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:45,607
mix it with shit and like,
wet cabbage.

436
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:47,326
What would be great is like

437
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:51,627
when it claps into her face it just
sort of looks like a rancid cowpat.

438
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:52,832
OK...

439
00:22:52,978 --> 00:22:55,567
No, I like that.
Can we get the shit...

440
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:59,046
and the dung and the cabbage together,
make sure it sticks to the face?

441
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,171
- It will.
- OK, let's try that then, please.

442
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,243
- OK, for rehearsal then...
- Excuse me.

443
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,430
I'm not happy with that.

444
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,056
Sorry?

445
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:11,454
I'm not happy with that.

446
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:13,426
I don't want the dung on my face.

447
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,697
You get extra money,
if you're worried about that.

448
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:18,864
Don't care, not bothered,
I just don't want to do it, full stop.

449
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:21,638
Right, OK, you either do it,
or you go home.

450
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:31,034
- OK. Right.
- See you, then.

451
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:35,275
Honestly, I mean, you give
these people a chance.

452
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:38,514
Got to get another on.
OK, you, over here, please.

453
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,925
Oh, fuck off, I'm Clive Owen!
That's mental.

454
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:06,739
- Which muppet did your contracts?
- I know who.

455
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,706
But the BBC
are taking the proverbial.

456
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:12,067
Seriously, the money you're getting
for the show is an insult.

457
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,137
I'll get tough with them and we'll
get this sorted for the next series.

458
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:16,638
I don't think I wanna do one.

459
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:19,091
I've been thinking of
knocking this on the head...

460
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:21,903
With the right management,
there's a lot of money to be made.

461
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:25,200
I don't care. I'm not proud...
I want to do better.

462
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,611
I'm not proud of having
Britain's No 1 Catchphrase.

463
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:29,186
Is there an Oscar for that? No.

464
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:32,280
But they are thinking of introducing
a British Comedy Award for it.

465
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,038
Course they are.

466
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,599
Look, I want to hold my head up.

467
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:39,482
To me, saying you've got
Britain's No 1 Catchphrase

468
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:41,983
is like saying you've got
Britain's No1 Wasting Disease.

469
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:46,106
You're not Britain's
No 1 Catchphrase any more.

470
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:48,478
- I'm not.
- You're not No 1 any more.

471
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:53,378
Good. To be totally...

472
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:55,163
Who's number one?

473
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:57,232
It's... "Am I bowered?"

474
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,686
What am I, No 2?

475
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:01,159
No. No 2 is,
"You are the Weakest Link, goodbye."

476
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,246
Then No 3 is "You're having a laugh."

477
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:06,754
In at No 3, it changes depending on
what survey you are doing?

478
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,201
What survey is that?

479
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:10,673
It's a survey of 8 to 11-year-olds.

480
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,293
Well, if they want catchphrases
I'll give 'em catchphrases.

481
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,632
I don't get it.

482
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:18,385
Is he havin a laugh?

483
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:20,094
I need a man!

484
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:21,677
Join the queue.

485
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,440
Oh, bugger me!

486
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:27,124
He's out and about!

487
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:33,576
# Christmas time...

488
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,353
# Mistletoe and wine...

489
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:38,689
# Children singing Christian rhyme

490
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:42,570
# With logs on the fire,
Gifts 'neath the tree... #

491
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:44,232
Any messages, mate?

492
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:46,952
- Yeah, couple. BT called.
- British Telecom?

493
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:49,962
- What did they want?
- To know if you were happy.

494
00:25:50,085 --> 00:25:51,085
Very happy.

495
00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:53,340
I told them,
but they wanted to talk to you.

496
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:55,269
They would do -
my name's on the bill.

497
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:58,173
And apparently you could have
free evening and weekend calls.

498
00:25:58,346 --> 00:26:00,811
That's very generous.
Do they want me to call back?

499
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:03,551
- No, they said they'd call back.
- I don't mind calling them.

500
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:06,262
I said you'd be back about two.
It's ten to now. Just wait.

501
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:09,097
Just after two, if they haven't called,
give them a bell.

502
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:11,367
- It's an 0800 number so...
- Free.

503
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,490
Anything else?

504
00:26:13,111 --> 00:26:14,783
Yes, Andy's new agent called.

505
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:16,920
Andy's fired you and
is with a new bloke

506
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,705
so you're no longer to have any
dealings with him whatsoever.

507
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:23,334
Sorry, I was thinking about free calls.
What were you saying?

508
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:24,896
Andy Millman's fired you.

509
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:29,048
- What do you mean?
- You're no longer Andy Millman's agent.

510
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:32,295
Why are you telling me now?
Why did you tell me the BT stuff first?

511
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:33,844
Chronological order.

512
00:26:34,087 --> 00:26:36,379
I was excited about the BT stuff,
now I'm depressed.

513
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,388
If I'd said, number one,
Andy's fired you and number two,

514
00:26:39,553 --> 00:26:41,758
BT has offered you
a generous new tariff,

515
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:45,136
the good news would have been
soured by the bad news anyway.

516
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:48,946
He's fired me?

517
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,907
Let me ask you - where do you
want to be in five years' time?

518
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,527
Sat in a Hollywood mansion
watching my butler polish my Oscar.

519
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:06,993
That's good, thinking big,
nothing wrong with that.

520
00:27:07,113 --> 00:27:09,943
But first,
what we need to concentrate on is...

521
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:11,107
Excuse me.

522
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,837
<i>- Richard Curtis for you.</i>
- Oh, God.

523
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,855
- Does he wanna talk about Africa again?
<i>- I think so.</i>

524
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:19,886
Tell him to donate the profits
from the Vicar of Dibley.

525
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,344
- They'll soon be eating like Dawn.
- Harsh.

526
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:23,894
Life's cruel.

527
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:26,998
Tell him you can't get hold of me,
tell him I'm snowboarding.

528
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,442
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

529
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:30,320
Profile.
We need to boost your profile.

530
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,035
Success is all about
getting your face seen.

531
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,444
Truth is, at the moment,

532
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,648
you're top of the C-list, but I'm gonna
get you on top of the A-list.

533
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:42,300
I can't do that overnight - you need
to win an Emmy or direct something -

534
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,073
but we can get you to the top
of the B-listjust by making sure

535
00:27:45,193 --> 00:27:49,102
you're seen out and about, movie
premieres, celebrity gay weddings...

536
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:51,622
- You're single, aren't you?
- Yeah.

537
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,290
Good, so firstly what we want you
to do is be seen

538
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:57,499
coming out of clubs and restaurants
with some newsworthy trollops.

539
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:00,699
You shagged any of those
tabloid beauties?

540
00:28:04,397 --> 00:28:05,197
No.

541
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:06,854
Not even her?

542
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,400
- No.
- She's had everyone.

543
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,982
- Not me.
- What you been doing?

544
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:13,219
She's got a cancellation next Friday
so we'll set something up for then.

545
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,770
No, no, I'm not into that.
I don't want to do it that way.

546
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,281
Do you wanna get on the B-list?

547
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:19,694
Yes, but not the Hepatitis B list.

548
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:23,869
Right, OK, no, that's not a problem,
I've got contacts at the broadsheets.

549
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:28,237
Paula, can you get me Emily Whitford
at The Guardian, please.

550
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,873
QUALIFIED SKILLED EXPERIENCED

551
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:40,585
MUST HAVE QUALIFICATIONS

552
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:48,604
PART-TIME CLEANER

553
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:01,273
So what do you do?

554
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:02,906
I was a film extra.

555
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:04,873
- Oh, glamorous.
- It's not really.

556
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,561
I'm not doing it any more,
it's too depressing.

557
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:10,536
I'm too old to be at the bottom
of the pile being told what to do,

558
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:13,398
scrabbling about in the dirt
for a few quid an hour.

559
00:29:13,592 --> 00:29:16,258
- What do you do now?
- I'm a cleaner.

560
00:29:18,338 --> 00:29:21,274
I scrabble about in the dirt
for a few quid an hour.

561
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:26,242
So here's the place.

562
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,238
Here we go.

563
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,357
Carpets...

564
00:29:56,915 --> 00:29:57,715
Spider?

565
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:00,117
Yep.
That won't be bothering you any more.

566
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:03,882
You just gonna leave it there?

567
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:05,410
If you want.

568
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,206
No, I don't, not particularly.

569
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:11,128
Fine, that'll all be professionally
cleaned. Scraped off.

570
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:15,641
- Where's the bedroom?
- No, it's all in here.

571
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:17,955
What, this is it?

572
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:20,397
Tiny little kitchen over here

573
00:30:20,662 --> 00:30:23,242
and there's a lavatory.

574
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,076
It's everything you need.
You'd never have to leave this place.

575
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:27,780
If the worst comes to the worst,

576
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,277
if you were bedridden with
a spinal injury - heaven forbid -

577
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,818
then it's all here, should that happen.

578
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:36,086
Where do I sleep?

579
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:48,043
Look at that.
That's good, isn't it?

580
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:50,072
That's like james Bond or something.

581
00:30:50,512 --> 00:30:51,645
From Russia With Love.

582
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:53,774
No, er, Live And Let Die.

583
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:56,662
I can't put anything
underneath that, can I?

584
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:58,487
Course you can,
coffee table or whatnot.

585
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,569
- Move it before you go to bed.
- Every night?

586
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:03,989
A chimpanzee makes a nest every night
in a tree. He doesn't complain.

587
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,862
No.

588
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:09,689
I hadn't planned to live
like a chimpanzee.

589
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:12,215
This is the only place
in your price range, so...

590
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:13,874
I know.

591
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:16,286
What's the area like, then?

592
00:31:17,163 --> 00:31:20,049
OK... I'm gonna be honest with you.

593
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,416
There is quite a large
black and Asian community,

594
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:25,659
there's some Chinese and it does
get very Araby towards the high street

595
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,602
but there's nothing
we can do about that...

596
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:30,874
No, I meant in terms of the amenities,
is there a supermarket?

597
00:31:31,314 --> 00:31:33,278
Oh, yeah, yeah, supermarkets, yes,

598
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,021
there's loads of lovely
different shops around here.

599
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:38,494
It's a very cosmopolitan area for food.

600
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,758
I mean, do you like Chinese food?
Asian food?

601
00:31:41,892 --> 00:31:43,705
Good for Halal meats.

602
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:46,599
Do you like jerk chicken,
just like momma used to make?

603
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:47,950
There's one of those.

604
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,722
In fact you can probably
see it from the window.

605
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,962
Yep, there it is.

606
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:08,700
Where you been? We said three o'clock.

607
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,873
Sorry, I've been looking at flats.
I'm gonna have to downsize.

608
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:14,180
Tell me later.
I'm about to do an interview,

609
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,182
Weekend Guardian, good publicity,

610
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:19,273
sort of the "man behind the silly wig".
When she gets here,

611
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:21,013
- open the door for me.
- Why me?

612
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:22,256
Say you're my PA.

613
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:25,612
Give the illusion of success, right?

614
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:27,128
Then, come in and go,

615
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:29,858
"Oh, Andy, sorry,
Ridley Scott's on the phone."

616
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:31,720
- Who?
- Ridley Scott.

617
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,556
- Who's that?
- Oscar-winning director.

618
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:35,765
- Gladiator, Blade Runner.
- When's he gonna call?

619
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:38,500
- He's not really gonna call.
- No?

620
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:42,471
You say he's on the phone
and then she'll think I'm a player.

621
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:44,154
That's her. Right.

622
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:48,196
Answer the door and just look
a bit secretarial. Do something...

623
00:32:54,526 --> 00:32:56,168
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

624
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:01,125
- Andy.
- Hi.

625
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:10,613
Thank you, Mr Millman.

626
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,226
Thanks for doing this.

627
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:15,751
My absolute pleasure.
Welcome to my humble abode.

628
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,457
You don't talk
like I thought you would.

629
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:21,001
You've seen me in character.
There's more than silly wigs.

630
00:33:21,163 --> 00:33:23,274
No, on chat shows
you don't speak like that.

631
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,159
There's the writer, the actor,
the charity worker...

632
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,386
- Sorry, what was that?
- Slash this slash that...

633
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,115
That's how I thought you talked.

634
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:33,497
How do you want me to talk?

635
00:33:33,617 --> 00:33:35,929
- Just normal, like you're at home.
- I am at home.

636
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:39,294
- Just speak like that then.
- Tone it down. OK, come on.

637
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:43,891
So, you mentioned your charity work.
What charities are you involved with?

638
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:45,354
Africa.

639
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:48,369
The main one that
people care about, innit?

640
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:51,482
You're not going to release an awful
comedy single, are you, for charity

641
00:33:51,652 --> 00:33:53,805
so you can get in the charts
and boost your profile?

642
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:57,018
- Not just to boost my profile, no.
- You are releasing a comedy single?

643
00:33:57,199 --> 00:34:00,872
Well, it's not, it's me as Ray
doing a cover of Nine To Five

644
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:04,827
and it's a fun video, cos we've got
loads of sort of celebs in it.

645
00:34:05,656 --> 00:34:08,447
We've got Craig Charles, Sam Fox,

646
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:10,542
- Jade Goody's mum.
- God!

647
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,924
Bunch of saddos.

648
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:13,686
The good ones didn't want to do it.

649
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:15,564
We had to use lookalikes
for some of them!

650
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,518
They will be sorry, though,
when it gets to number one.

651
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:22,605
It will, so let's not slag it off
before it's saved some Ethiopians.

652
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:27,350
In a hurry?

653
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,818
Oh, no, sorry, I've got
another interview to get to.

654
00:34:30,046 --> 00:34:32,406
- I'm a little nervous actually.
- What, about meeting me?

655
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:35,638
No, God, no.
Have you seen the Byron film?

656
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:37,894
I'm interviewing Greg Lindley Jones.

657
00:34:38,073 --> 00:34:39,579
Why are you nervous about him?

658
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:43,083
He's got a sort of brooding intensity.
He's like a young Richard Burton.

659
00:34:44,104 --> 00:34:45,905
Young Richard Simmons, more like.

660
00:34:47,048 --> 00:34:48,922
I'm not slagging him
off but let's not...

661
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:51,139
Mr Millman,
the phone call has just come in.

662
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:52,259
Who is it?

663
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:55,122
- Is it Wiggly Scott?
- Ridley Scott, yeah?

664
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:58,432
The award-winning director
of Gladiator and Blade Runner.

665
00:34:58,992 --> 00:35:00,382
What does he want?
Cheers.

666
00:35:00,554 --> 00:35:01,728
Sorry about this.

667
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:04,563
Hey, Ridley, I can't talk now,
I'm out with a journo.

668
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:06,903
- Say hello from me.
- What?

669
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:10,414
We know each other from Cannes.
Say hello from me. Emily Whitford.

670
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,190
Emily Whitford.

671
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,694
- What's he say?
- Nothing.

672
00:35:16,195 --> 00:35:18,375
- Ask him how is ankle is. He'll laugh.
- Will he?

673
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:21,269
How's your ankle?

674
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,603
- Is he laughing?
- Sort of.

675
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:26,490
Let me speak to him.

676
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:27,789
Let her speak to him.

677
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:29,780
- Let me speak to him.
- Hold on.

678
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:37,369
Oh, what's he done?
Hung up.

679
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:39,636
Why's he done that?
Sorry about that. Cheers.

680
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:44,475
Can I ask you a few questions?

681
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:47,647
What about? I'm not very good
at general knowledge.

682
00:35:48,424 --> 00:35:50,967
- No, about working for Andy.
- Probably not a good idea.

683
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,723
If you are in a hurry...
Cheers for that, it was...

684
00:35:53,843 --> 00:35:55,722
So how long have you worked for Andy?

685
00:35:57,264 --> 00:35:58,902
- Three hours.
- No.

686
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:00,639
- Three hours?
- Think.

687
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:04,039
What's she talking about...?
Be honest, go on.

688
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,431
Three ears?

689
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,842
No, three YEARS.

690
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,552
- That makes more sense.
- Certainly.

691
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:15,038
And, erm, what's he like as a boss?

692
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:17,001
- A wanker.
- No.

693
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:19,246
- He's a wanker?
- She didn't mean that. Listen.

694
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:21,079
Listen, listen to her.

695
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:24,509
He plays darts all the time.

696
00:36:24,942 --> 00:36:27,354
I love darts. I don't know why.

697
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,708
I've just I've always wanted
to be like Eric Bristow.

698
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:32,903
- Is she actually your PA?
- Is she...?

699
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,066
- Is she actually your PA?
- Who?

700
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:38,231
That lady there,
is she actually your PA?

701
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,818
Sorry, I don't know
what you mean by "actually".

702
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:43,033
- Do you employ her?
- Employment's a strong term.

703
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:44,271
In what sense?

704
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:47,374
It's weird to ask someone
about their PA during an interview.

705
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,827
Just clarification, really.

706
00:36:49,997 --> 00:36:51,711
She said that,
I went along with it,

707
00:36:51,873 --> 00:36:53,713
so how do you assess the situation?

708
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:56,210
I get the impression
she's not your PA.

709
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,091
Opposite impression that I would want...

710
00:36:58,256 --> 00:37:00,447
Did Ridley Scott
actually phone you earlier?

711
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:01,699
According to her.

712
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,467
So he'll remember phoning you
if l speak to him later?

713
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,170
What's his memory like?

714
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,869
- You spoke to him earlier.
- Couldn't hear him.

715
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:10,897
But you were relaying
my messages to him.

716
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,006
Yes, well done,

717
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:16,630
and I am saying now,
admitting I couldn't hear a word.

718
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:19,813
Could you just answer
the question - is she your PA?

719
00:37:26,526 --> 00:37:28,003
No, it's a joke.

720
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:33,394
Course she's pretending.
It's a wind-up.

721
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,499
- We always do it with journalists.
- You always do it?

722
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,561
What do you mean by always?

723
00:37:39,102 --> 00:37:41,127
Do you need a PA in real life, Andy?

724
00:37:41,247 --> 00:37:42,047
No.

725
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,948
Cos I could do with the money.

726
00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:51,457
Shall I pack that?

727
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:53,166
Yeah, may as well.

728
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,723
Bought that as a gift for Andy.

729
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:57,444
Didn't want it, wasn't interested.

730
00:37:58,085 --> 00:37:59,946
Should have known then
something was brewing.

731
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:01,367
How about these?

732
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,305
Nothing in 'em.

733
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:05,646
Just put 'em up there
in case the local kids run by

734
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,537
and peer in and shout insults.

735
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:09,934
Kids can be cruel. Eh?

736
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,724
Yeah, they can.

737
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:13,869
- What do they say?
- You know what they say.

738
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,980
- Lanky four-eyed twat?
- Yeah.

739
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:18,482
- Weirdo goggle-eyed gimp?
- Sometimes.

740
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:20,300
Frankenstein's albino gonk?

741
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:21,968
I never heard that one.

742
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:24,826
It's so easy to have a go
at a bloke who looks like you,

743
00:38:24,946 --> 00:38:26,389
you're just easy pickings.

744
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:29,851
- Sheep shagger they said as well.
- I thought sheep shagger was Welsh?

745
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:32,562
- It can be Bristol as well.
- I thought it was inbreeding.

746
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:36,483
Sheep shagging, inbreeding, slavery.
We're famous for loads of stuff.

747
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,710
Oh, right.

748
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,409
- Bar?
- Yeah.

749
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,691
I could do with a hug, mate.

750
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:52,647
- Queers!
- Ignore him.

751
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:19,885
Show me the money.

752
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:22,821
So, When The Whistle Blows,
BBC are begging for a Christmas special.

753
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:23,998
No.

754
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:25,936
I don't wanna do it any more.

755
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:27,617
You'd be mad to say no.

756
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:29,588
I wanna do a Hollywood film

757
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:32,575
or TV but cool TV, American TV.

758
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:35,069
We've got cool TV over here.
I've had offers.

759
00:39:35,245 --> 00:39:37,875
- Do you wanna be an alien in Dr Who?
- No.

760
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:40,608
They've offered you
a guest part in Hotel Babylon.

761
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:42,831
What part of "cool"
don't you understand?

762
00:39:43,268 --> 00:39:45,113
All right, well we've had
a movie offer.

763
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:46,386
- Right.
- British film.

764
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:49,664
No, no, listen,
it's a comedy starring Rob Schneider

765
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:52,496
as a horny deliveryman
who looks like the Prime Minister.

766
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,729
Rob will be playing both parts.

767
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:56,229
Get me a Hollywood film.

768
00:39:58,505 --> 00:40:02,581
Andy, with all due respect, I can't see
Martin Scorsese in his London hotel room

769
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:04,670
flicking through the channels going,

770
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:08,199
"I've never seen this bloke before,
but I've got a wig that will fit him."

771
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:09,577
Why are you saying that?

772
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,001
Because you've chosen
a very specific path.

773
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:13,246
I wanna get off it.

774
00:40:13,408 --> 00:40:16,030
If that's what it takes to get respect,
then I'm gonna finish it.

775
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,394
I don't want to come up
with more wacky characters,

776
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:22,121
shouting catch-phrases
amongst kids and morons.

777
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:24,083
I want to do something credible.

778
00:40:24,252 --> 00:40:26,782
I might want to direct one day
and I'm not gonna get respect

779
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,219
so I'm finishing the sitcom.

780
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:30,431
That's mad.
That's killing a cash cow.

781
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:33,305
I'm ending the sitcom.
There you go. Done.

782
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,644
Well, you could do that

783
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:39,638
or you could think, people
are still watching, let's milk it.

784
00:40:40,527 --> 00:40:43,219
People are stupid enough,
let's keep on giving it to them.

785
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:44,935
They've seen it all before,

786
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:49,259
they've seen everything, every sketch
slightly rewritten, every character.

787
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:52,611
They've heard every catchphrase
shouted 1,000 times.

788
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:56,640
Yes, but have they seen
an episode set in Spain?

789
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:04,823
That's great, thanks.

790
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,888
Excuse me, Andy,
sorry to bother you.

791
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:14,798
I'm an extra
but I'm an actor, really,

792
00:41:14,941 --> 00:41:17,773
and I know you've been
in my position and,

793
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:20,708
I was wondering if there's a line,
or a few lines,

794
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,857
I'd appreciate the opportunity.

795
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:25,315
I'm not really involved with casting.
What's your name?

796
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:27,759
- Phil.
- I'll speak to the Floor Manager.

797
00:41:27,879 --> 00:41:30,073
If anything comes up,
I'll put a word in for you.

798
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:31,664
Thanks. Sorry to bother you.

799
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,385
- Why are the extras coming up to me?
- Sorry?

800
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:43,369
Why are the extras bothering me,

801
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:45,624
and not in their paddock
or wherever you keep 'em?

802
00:41:45,744 --> 00:41:48,580
They look up to you
cos you were in their boat.

803
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:51,844
Shall I sit down with 'em
and reminisce about old times?

804
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:55,055
Or shall I get on with my job,
that pays their wages and yours?

805
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,975
Sorry, I didn't realise.

806
00:41:58,805 --> 00:42:00,361
I'll tell him not to do it again.

807
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:03,148
He won't do it again,
because he won't be around again.

808
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,923
Hey, my man.
Darren Lamb.

809
00:42:40,096 --> 00:42:42,646
I'm here to see Andy Millman,
star of When The Wind Blows...

810
00:42:42,832 --> 00:42:45,118
- Whistle.
- Whistle. Yes, if I could just...

811
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,466
Do you have a pass?

812
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:49,808
No, I'm a friend of his.
I'll just go in, it's not a problem.

813
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:52,042
I can't let anyone in without a pass.

814
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:53,112
No?

815
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:56,571
We are friends but we've had
a bit of a falling out.

816
00:42:56,696 --> 00:42:59,189
I don't want to hassle you with it,
but if I could just...

817
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:02,120
I can't help you, sorry sir.
All right.

818
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:04,304
Thanks a lot.

819
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,390
What's happened?

820
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,722
I think we both know what's happened.

821
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:24,092
What's happened is I've tried
to jump the barrier

822
00:43:24,212 --> 00:43:26,083
and that ain't panned out as I hoped

823
00:43:26,218 --> 00:43:28,275
and so if you just let me free,
I'll go home

824
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,025
and say nothing more about it.

825
00:43:30,145 --> 00:43:32,940
We'll both have a lovely Christmas.
That sounds like a plan.

826
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,862
- What are you doing?
- I know this woman.

827
00:43:35,997 --> 00:43:37,150
They won't let me in.

828
00:43:37,337 --> 00:43:38,896
- Have you not got a pass?
- No.

829
00:43:39,072 --> 00:43:40,508
I was just trying to see Andy.

830
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:42,781
Every time I phone him,
he's always on voice mail.

831
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:45,076
- Can she just walk me in?
- No, not without a pass.

832
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:47,710
- All about the pass with you, innit?
- Can I get him a pass?

833
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,170
Why not?

834
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:51,274
I'll go and get a pass from Andy.
Wait there.

835
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:52,299
Cheers.

836
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:01,802
Oh, there you are.

837
00:44:02,114 --> 00:44:04,023
Andy, I've just seen Darren out there

838
00:44:04,232 --> 00:44:05,645
and he says he can't get in.

839
00:44:05,807 --> 00:44:07,056
Why are you telling me?

840
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:09,570
He keeps trying to call you
but your phone's switched off.

841
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:12,720
No, it's not, I just don't answer it
when I see it's him.

842
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:15,646
Can I not just get him a pass
and he can sit up at the back?

843
00:44:15,788 --> 00:44:17,249
I don't want him in here.

844
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:19,928
I know, but I told him
I would get him in.

845
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,735
Well, you lied.

846
00:44:22,384 --> 00:44:23,967
He says he really wants to see you.

847
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,246
Life's cruel.

848
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:27,661
I've got to go and tell him
he can't get in?

849
00:44:28,944 --> 00:44:29,794
Maggie?

850
00:44:31,344 --> 00:44:32,974
You can't keep coming up to me.

851
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:34,465
I can't what?

852
00:44:34,627 --> 00:44:36,933
You can't talk to me
in front of the other extras.

853
00:44:37,053 --> 00:44:38,955
They see you, they go,
"Oh, she's an extra,

854
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,804
she's his equal,
maybe we're his equal."

855
00:44:41,118 --> 00:44:43,457
- I'm not an extra.
- No, you were.

856
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:45,843
So were you.

857
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,127
I'm a little bit busy.

858
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:00,919
- All right?
- Yeah...

859
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:03,696
Andy can't get you a pass.

860
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,096
He said he's really sorry and that
he would love to have you in there

861
00:45:08,226 --> 00:45:11,587
but he just can't bend the rules,

862
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:14,932
fire regulations or something.

863
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:18,910
Makes sense. I imagine the fire
regulations are quite strict at the BBC.

864
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:22,472
All right, thanks for trying.

865
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:24,571
It's OK.

866
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:27,971
- Nice to see you again.
- You too, bye.

867
00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:51,162
0h, oh, it's good to be back,
but what a perfect holiday

868
00:45:51,464 --> 00:45:53,324
and everything has
worked out brilliantly.

869
00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:55,132
It certainly has.

870
00:45:55,382 --> 00:45:58,167
I'm getting married
to the man of my dreams.

871
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:00,359
I got that promotion I wanted.

872
00:46:00,578 --> 00:46:04,183
And ever since Gobbler fell off
that donkey, he's not been the same.

873
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:06,252
Indeed not.

874
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:09,556
As Confucius once said,
"They must often change,

875
00:46:09,722 --> 00:46:13,022
who would be constant
in happiness and wisdom."

876
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:14,986
I don't get it.

877
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:18,340
Brains is so much happier
now that he's out of the closet.

878
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:19,469
Oh, I am.

879
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:23,860
Infact, last night I went on
a wonderful date with a lovely man.

880
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,257
He took me to a seafood restaurant,

881
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:29,523
fed me my favourite meal.

882
00:46:30,116 --> 00:46:31,874
- Fish Stew?
- No, he certainly did not!

883
00:46:33,795 --> 00:46:35,875
It was our first date.

884
00:46:36,242 --> 00:46:39,505
I didn't mean did he fist...
I meant... are you havin a laugh?

885
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:41,573
Is he havin a laugh?

886
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,363
- Now he gets it.
- I get it.

887
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,597
- I'm getting it.
- We're all getting it.

888
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:57,639
Merry Christmas, everyone.

889
00:47:13,182 --> 00:47:14,182
Thank you.

890
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:16,993
- Thank you very much.
- We love you, Andy!

891
00:47:18,917 --> 00:47:19,995
You havin a laugh?

892
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:21,665
I'm not actually,

893
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,980
which is why this will be the last ever
episode of When The Whistle Blows.

894
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:29,782
Well, I never have to wear
this stupid wig again...

895
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,869
If truth be told,
it's gone on for far too long.

896
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:42,195
I think three series
should be enough for anyone...

897
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:43,451
I don't get it!

898
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,243
Obviously,
not enough for some people.

899
00:47:45,373 --> 00:47:47,230
Andy, why you stopping the show?

900
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,257
Because it's not what I wanted to do,
y'know, with my life,

901
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:54,102
shout a catchphrase
to a load of morons for a living.

902
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:58,123
Well, don't...

903
00:47:59,732 --> 00:48:01,020
Merry Christmas...

904
00:48:07,615 --> 00:48:10,085
Thank you very much...
Who do you think you are?

905
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:13,344
You've just announced to the audience
you are quitting the show,

906
00:48:13,479 --> 00:48:15,722
without consulting us,
or even telling us?

907
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,647
- It's nothing to do with you.
- What?

908
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:18,981
If I wanna stop, that's it.

909
00:48:19,143 --> 00:48:22,070
No, it the lack of professionalism,
Andy, it's the arrogance...

910
00:48:22,906 --> 00:48:26,555
When I first got into this, you were
the great "I am" holding me to ransom.

911
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,158
Now you don't like it, do you?

912
00:48:28,278 --> 00:48:31,767
If I want to stop, I'll stop.
I want to do other stuff, move on.

913
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:34,381
Live with it. You stay here
if you want, chasing ratings,

914
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:35,905
but I wanna do something else.

915
00:48:36,077 --> 00:48:37,981
Really interesting way
of looking at things

916
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:40,351
after everything we've done for you.

917
00:48:40,506 --> 00:48:41,670
Life's cruel.

918
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:45,610
Yes, it can be. Good luck. You've got
lots of things lined up, have you?

919
00:48:45,996 --> 00:48:48,723
Don't worry about me.
Phone won't stop ringing.

920
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:08,114
Tre Cooper, please? Andy Millman.

921
00:49:10,366 --> 00:49:12,076
Yeah, good, listen to this.

922
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:14,533
What's hot - Greg Lindley Jones,

923
00:49:14,653 --> 00:49:16,980
who charmed the nation this week
on Desert Island Discs

924
00:49:17,172 --> 00:49:20,947
with a stream of hilarious anecdotes
that recalled Peter Ustinov at his best.

925
00:49:21,135 --> 00:49:22,897
What's not - Andy Millman.

926
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:25,612
Are we having a laugh?
For about five minutes we were,

927
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:28,131
but Andy Millman's Christmas special
hit an all-time low.

928
00:49:28,251 --> 00:49:30,592
The jokes were filthier
than Mrs Slocombe's pussy

929
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:32,554
and with no new projects
on the horizon,

930
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:35,143
Millman is fast becoming
as out of date as his gags.

931
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,307
Aren't you meant to get me some
decent work? I quit three weeks ago.

932
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,001
Excuse me, is it OK if I go?
It's nearly half past...

933
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:52,262
- OK, see you tomorrow.
- Thanks.

934
00:50:12,898 --> 00:50:14,467
Where've you been? You're late.

935
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:15,589
Sorry.

936
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:17,366
Look at this.

937
00:50:17,894 --> 00:50:18,894
Worst table.

938
00:50:19,498 --> 00:50:21,527
I'm just happy to be sitting down.

939
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:24,188
Look, it's your friend, Vernon Kay.

940
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:27,313
- Danny Millman!
- Andy.

941
00:50:27,846 --> 00:50:29,361
- See ya later.
- What?

942
00:50:30,751 --> 00:50:34,570
If he's forgetting my name, how the
hell is he going to read an autocue?

943
00:50:35,975 --> 00:50:38,702
Look at this,
the Guardian stitched me up.

944
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:41,313
"There's a whiff of desperation
about Andy Millman.

945
00:50:41,457 --> 00:50:44,710
Our interview was more bizarre than
an episode of When The Whistle Blows.

946
00:50:44,964 --> 00:50:47,797
Every answer he gave sounded like
he was reading from a press release

947
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:52,186
full of boasts, hyperbole and
the occasional bare-faced lie.

948
00:50:52,328 --> 00:50:54,459
He seemed desperate
for the headline to be

949
00:50:54,588 --> 00:50:57,381
'All's Well In the Millman Camp.
Next Stop Hollywood.'"

950
00:50:58,737 --> 00:51:01,102
This is going to be
a fun lunch, then.

951
00:51:01,244 --> 00:51:02,219
Eh?

952
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,167
It's just we never seem
to have a laugh any more.

953
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,805
When you had nothing and we were
both extras, we had more of a laugh.

954
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:11,260
- No, we didn't.
- I hated it, it was shit.

955
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:16,157
I was always moaning.

956
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:17,858
You're always moaning now.

957
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:20,288
You moan about the Ray dolls

958
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:23,172
but they did buy you a house
that overlooks Hampstead Heath.

959
00:51:23,362 --> 00:51:25,960
You moan about the sitcom
that gets six million viewers

960
00:51:26,103 --> 00:51:30,246
but it's the wrong six million... but
at least it gets six million viewers.

961
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:35,046
You've accomplished something, even if
it's not exactly what you wanted.

962
00:51:36,446 --> 00:51:38,090
I've accomplished nothing.

963
00:51:38,517 --> 00:51:41,189
I have brought nothing to the world.

964
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:43,710
Look at that,
Harold Pinter and his wife,

965
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:45,840
having lunch with Geri Halliwell.

966
00:51:46,217 --> 00:51:47,698
Why am I not over there?

967
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:51,444
Do you like Geri Halliwell?

968
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:56,429
No, why I am not having lunch
with Harold Pinter and his wife?

969
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,253
Well, I'm sorry you're
stuck at this table, then.

970
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,936
I'm not sure you should
actually even come here.

971
00:52:03,056 --> 00:52:04,979
This place just seems to annoy you.

972
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,273
You're always saying, he's got
an acting part that you wanted or...

973
00:52:08,408 --> 00:52:10,954
he's got credibility
and he doesn't deserve it.

974
00:52:11,581 --> 00:52:13,685
If you worry about things like that,

975
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:15,415
you're never going to be happy,

976
00:52:15,613 --> 00:52:17,587
no matter however successful you are...

977
00:52:17,757 --> 00:52:19,426
you'll never be famous enough.

978
00:52:21,823 --> 00:52:23,714
Thank you, Dr Freud,

979
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:24,992
next conversation.

980
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:31,913
What would you rather be?

981
00:52:32,193 --> 00:52:35,997
A penguin that can't fly but it swims
around in the water like a fish...

982
00:52:36,434 --> 00:52:37,582
but it is a bird...

983
00:52:37,702 --> 00:52:42,013
or a flying fish that can fly
but is essentially stilljust a fish...

984
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,041
Maggie, I can't do these stupid
questions any more, seriously,

985
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,231
we're grown ups.

986
00:52:51,991 --> 00:52:53,810
You probably
want to turn to page 17,

987
00:52:53,953 --> 00:52:56,058
a rather perceptive interview
with yours truly.

988
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:58,600
The one that says
Next Stop Hollywood.

989
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,954
- I've seen it, nice photo.
- Thank you.

990
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:03,558
Apparently I've have
a "brooding intensity".

991
00:53:04,377 --> 00:53:07,479
I'm gonna love you and leave you.
Don't let him have a pudding.

992
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,108
We don't want him bursting out
all over the place.

993
00:53:23,888 --> 00:53:24,979
Cheers.

994
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:28,457
- Do you want me to sign that?
- No, you're all right, mate.

995
00:53:29,577 --> 00:53:31,860
- There's no one else in there.
- Leave it.

996
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:33,763
You'll never get it filled.

997
00:53:44,051 --> 00:53:45,877
How's it going?
Just getting lunch.

998
00:53:46,178 --> 00:53:48,267
- What've you gone for?
- Fillet O'Fish.

999
00:53:48,474 --> 00:53:49,461
Tasty.

1000
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:51,658
Good for you, isn't it, fish?

1001
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:53,668
You're meant to have
two portions a week.

1002
00:53:53,788 --> 00:53:57,022
It's got fatty acids, which are
good for you apparently, and omega.

1003
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:02,254
You all right?

1004
00:54:02,374 --> 00:54:03,683
Good, yeah. Excellent.

1005
00:54:03,803 --> 00:54:05,491
I'd better crack on.

1006
00:54:05,674 --> 00:54:07,063
Darren, it's quarter past two.

1007
00:54:07,246 --> 00:54:09,441
Calm down, mate,
you're not the boss of me.

1008
00:54:11,688 --> 00:54:12,751
All right, Andy?

1009
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:15,123
You were due back 15 minutes ago.

1010
00:54:15,243 --> 00:54:17,381
Keep your hair transplant on.
I'm coming in.

1011
00:54:18,223 --> 00:54:20,120
- See you later.
- See you later.

1012
00:54:22,328 --> 00:54:23,925
- All right?
- Good, good.

1013
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:27,053
- No hard feelings.
- No, sure.

1014
00:54:27,219 --> 00:54:29,342
I needed someone to further my career...

1015
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:32,784
We all know he wasn't
the best agent in the world,

1016
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,495
- but he was loyal.
- Yeah.

1017
00:54:34,615 --> 00:54:36,408
- And he tries hard.
- Yeah.

1018
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:38,041
Be careful, mate.

1019
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:41,434
Fame is a mask
that eats into the face.

1020
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:46,126
Barry, can you stop nattering?
Dean's got a question for you.

1021
00:54:46,256 --> 00:54:48,386
Did you tell someone
the Nokia 8600 came with...

1022
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,164
Hello, mate.

1023
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:51,573
"You having a laugh?"

1024
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,145
Thought you were lying
when you went on about him.

1025
00:54:57,265 --> 00:54:59,402
I didn't go on about him,
I didn't mention him...

1026
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,383
See you later.

1027
00:55:09,714 --> 00:55:11,480
Were you really his agent once?

1028
00:55:13,195 --> 00:55:15,582
- I need a new agent.
- Why?

1029
00:55:16,374 --> 00:55:18,491
Cos I'm working
in Carphone Warehouse.

1030
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:47,637
I quit the show five months ago.

1031
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,066
I'm sat here like a lemon...
You're not getting me anything.

1032
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:55,093
I've told you a thousand times, I'm not
gonna play an alien in Doctor Who.

1033
00:56:55,826 --> 00:56:56,999
Don't do it, Schlong!

1034
00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:59,809
You leave me no alternative, Doctor.

1035
00:57:07,585 --> 00:57:09,222
What's happening to us?

1036
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:10,637
He's hyper-podulating.

1037
00:57:11,702 --> 00:57:15,768
He's using his molluscian glang valves
to internally vibrulate our DNA.

1038
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:18,271
What does that mean?

1039
00:57:18,544 --> 00:57:21,051
It means we'll both turn into slugs
in about 30 seconds.

1040
00:57:21,756 --> 00:57:23,951
Unless... I can reach
that sodium chloride...

1041
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,899
What's sodium chloride?

1042
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,328
You probably know it as...
table salt!

1043
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:47,008
Tre Cooper...

1044
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,152
OK, do you know where he is?

1045
00:57:53,957 --> 00:57:56,059
Tell him to call me. Cheers.

1046
00:57:57,137 --> 00:57:59,084
It's Andy Millman again.

1047
00:58:00,162 --> 00:58:01,955
Can you get him to call me, please?

1048
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,497
I've been calling him
every day for two weeks.

1049
00:58:04,617 --> 00:58:06,767
He's never there.
Where is he? Snowboarding?

1050
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:13,037
No, I've told him,
I don't want to do Hotel Babylon.

1051
00:58:13,463 --> 00:58:15,583
No, I'll tell you what,
I am going to see him today,

1052
00:58:16,321 --> 00:58:19,957
because he's my agent and
he takes 12.5% of my wages, OK?

1053
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:23,589
Yeah, and if he really is at lunch,
where is he?

1054
00:58:23,724 --> 00:58:25,752
Please tell me where he is.

1055
00:58:25,926 --> 00:58:27,099
Thank you.

1056
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:30,953
A very wise decision,
if you don't mind my saying.

1057
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:32,923
Good little phone,

1058
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,563
fun ringtone on there as well,
I've actually got the same one.

1059
00:58:45,675 --> 00:58:48,933
You can see that would be enjoyable,
with your friends, so,

1060
00:58:49,106 --> 00:58:51,178
just pop your card in there
if you would...

1061
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:52,739
Enter PIN.

1062
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:54,103
Don't let him see it.

1063
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,589
Libellous.

1064
00:58:55,709 --> 00:58:57,737
Just let it phone its girlfriend.

1065
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:00,529
That should be it. Extract.

1066
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:04,981
Deano, a Motorola Accessory Pack,
s'il vous plat.

1067
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:06,115
Sure, Shauny.

1068
00:59:07,487 --> 00:59:09,615
- Thar she blows.
- I thank you.

1069
00:59:10,477 --> 00:59:11,441
Enjoy.

1070
00:59:12,472 --> 00:59:13,781
- Nice lady.
- Yeah.

1071
00:59:15,596 --> 00:59:16,596
All right!

1072
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:19,349
How's it going,
do you need a phone or something?

1073
00:59:21,102 --> 00:59:23,639
I need some work, really.

1074
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:25,098
Any jobs going?

1075
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:27,680
Not really, no.

1076
00:59:27,805 --> 00:59:30,122
Aside from the intensive
training needed,

1077
00:59:30,288 --> 00:59:32,253
we are a bit overstaffed as well.

1078
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:35,849
The only way there'd be a vacancy is
if one of these guys got an acting job.

1079
00:59:36,278 --> 00:59:38,574
- Or if one of us dies.
- That is more likely.

1080
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:39,979
Statistically, yes.

1081
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:42,001
So, no room at the...

1082
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:43,536
at the inn.

1083
00:59:46,455 --> 00:59:48,046
You all right?

1084
00:59:49,563 --> 00:59:50,922
Dean, tissues.

1085
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:54,718
Don't worry...

1086
00:59:57,738 --> 00:59:59,181
I'm sure something will turn up.

1087
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:01,262
It's not about the job.

1088
01:00:01,781 --> 01:00:03,412
It's everything, really.

1089
01:00:04,592 --> 01:00:06,400
I've just wasted my life,

1090
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:08,769
I haven't done anything,

1091
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:10,644
I haven't seen anything,

1092
01:00:10,764 --> 01:00:12,883
I haven't been anywhere,

1093
01:00:14,507 --> 01:00:16,478
never even left the country.

1094
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:19,086
I haven't even been abroad.

1095
01:00:20,109 --> 01:00:23,378
I just live on my own, in one room,

1096
01:00:23,514 --> 01:00:25,300
with no money

1097
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:28,532
and I can't even get a job
at the Carphone Warehouse.

1098
01:00:28,678 --> 01:00:29,944
That's not true.

1099
01:00:30,691 --> 01:00:31,990
It is true.

1100
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,115
It's true of this branch,
but there are other branches,

1101
01:00:35,235 --> 01:00:36,715
particularly in rougher areas.

1102
01:00:36,835 --> 01:00:38,793
They're always desperate for staff,

1103
01:00:38,913 --> 01:00:41,713
because the ones they've got
are always being assaulted or stabbed,

1104
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:43,619
sometimes in the face.

1105
01:00:46,023 --> 01:00:46,895
Sorry.

1106
01:00:48,226 --> 01:00:49,356
<i>Hi. Where are you?</i>

1107
01:00:50,056 --> 01:00:51,501
No. Nowhere.

1108
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:53,454
<i>Can you meet me at the Ivy ASAP?</i>

1109
01:00:53,652 --> 01:00:56,157
I'm trying to track down my agent.
He's worse than Darren.

1110
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,156
He was useless
but I knew where he was.

1111
01:00:58,484 --> 01:00:59,721
Why do you need me?

1112
01:00:59,908 --> 01:01:02,802
I don't wanna go in by myself.
I'll look like a complete loser.

1113
01:01:02,922 --> 01:01:05,820
- Can you meet me or not?
- Okay.

1114
01:01:06,002 --> 01:01:07,311
Good. See you later.

1115
01:01:09,554 --> 01:01:10,656
I have to go.

1116
01:01:11,913 --> 01:01:13,399
Thanks for your help.

1117
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:16,979
I've had a piece of that.

1118
01:01:17,405 --> 01:01:18,725
- Have ya?
- Yeah.

1119
01:01:18,933 --> 01:01:21,172
- He's a bit of a player!
- It was one date.

1120
01:01:21,292 --> 01:01:23,127
- All right, Bar...
- One date's enough.

1121
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,891
- Nothing happened.
- How do you know?

1122
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,217
You told me you blocked
the toilet up and she left.

1123
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:29,600
That was for your ears only,

1124
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:31,138
thank you very much.

1125
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:37,627
That's my mum.

1126
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:39,212
She's ill.

1127
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:41,692
Mum. Hello. She's gone...

1128
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:03,722
You all right?

1129
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:06,231
I'm having a bit of a nightmare.

1130
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:07,935
I can't get hold of this agent.

1131
01:02:08,055 --> 01:02:11,230
I've had to do Dr Who and Hotel Babylon
to keep my profile up,

1132
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:14,212
now he wants me to do Robin Hood.

1133
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:16,234
- You've had it tough.
- Nightmare.

1134
01:02:16,637 --> 01:02:18,612
Apart from the TV work,
you're doing OK.

1135
01:02:20,548 --> 01:02:22,293
Hi, we haven't booked...

1136
01:02:22,486 --> 01:02:24,548
We're very busy today, sir.

1137
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,119
- Andy Millman...
- Yes.

1138
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:28,705
You should have booked ahead.

1139
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:31,002
- It's usually all right.
- Sorry.

1140
01:02:33,257 --> 01:02:34,851
- All right?
- Very all right, Sir.

1141
01:02:34,971 --> 01:02:37,414
Byron number one, UK box office,

1142
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:40,885
- number two in the USA...
- Unlucky.

1143
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:43,885
I'm off round Europe next week
to promote the old film.

1144
01:02:45,634 --> 01:02:47,376
- What about you?
- Oh, great. Good.

1145
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:49,446
- You got lots on?
- Mental.

1146
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:53,502
Saw you as a slug in Dr Who.
Very convincing.

1147
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,955
Space serpent.

1148
01:02:55,267 --> 01:02:56,992
What's our agent like though?

1149
01:02:57,187 --> 01:02:58,919
Has he gone AWOL?
Hiding from the tax man?

1150
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,059
I hope he hasn't,
I'm having lunch with him.

1151
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:04,193
You're having lunch with him?
Don't bother, it goes to voice mail.

1152
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:08,658
- Oh, you're here. I'm outside.
- There's something wrong...

1153
01:03:08,793 --> 01:03:11,294
I'll come straight in.
See you later.

1154
01:03:11,414 --> 01:03:12,993
Something wrong with the signal.

1155
01:03:13,149 --> 01:03:15,207
These girders... Sometimes it...

1156
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:19,269
It's weird how things pan out?
He's more famous than you are now.

1157
01:03:19,459 --> 01:03:21,865
Why would you say that?
Why say that to me?

1158
01:03:22,156 --> 01:03:24,653
He's not more famous than me,
not amongst my demographic.

1159
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:26,805
Don't talk about things
you don't understand.

1160
01:03:26,966 --> 01:03:29,459
- That's bollocks.
- All right.

1161
01:03:29,984 --> 01:03:30,961
Gordon?

1162
01:03:32,706 --> 01:03:34,587
- Andy Millman.
- Yep. You all right?

1163
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,592
- Can't have a word, can you?
- Just leaving...

1164
01:03:37,712 --> 01:03:40,636
If you're in the industry,
they'll let me through...

1165
01:03:40,756 --> 01:03:43,063
- Can't.
- You can't or won't?

1166
01:03:43,354 --> 01:03:44,476
Won't.

1167
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:47,561
At least go make me
a cheese sandwich. You cook!

1168
01:03:47,737 --> 01:03:50,981
Cock?! Haven't you had enough
cheese sandwiches, fat boy?

1169
01:03:51,101 --> 01:03:52,950
You pound puppy-faced git.

1170
01:03:53,118 --> 01:03:55,787
You catchphrase shouting,
wig-wearing wannabe...

1171
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:59,455
You publicity hungry,
failed footballing fuck.

1172
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,590
You're a has-been, go home.

1173
01:04:01,752 --> 01:04:04,968
You think you're hard cos you shout
at people. Who works in kitchens?

1174
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:08,547
Women and gays, and the French.
Oh, you're well hard.

1175
01:04:08,786 --> 01:04:10,539
Let's just leave it there.

1176
01:04:11,174 --> 01:04:12,878
I don't want to get into a fight.

1177
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,046
I've heard your girdle
could explode at any minute.

1178
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,175
You... I was gonna...

1179
01:04:18,352 --> 01:04:21,126
- Come on, let's just go?
- No, I'll wait for him to come out.

1180
01:04:21,313 --> 01:04:22,941
If I can't go there
for five minutes?

1181
01:04:23,061 --> 01:04:24,943
- I'm sorry.
- Can I have a drink?

1182
01:04:25,121 --> 01:04:27,251
- Do you want a drink?
- Not really, no.

1183
01:04:27,444 --> 01:04:30,577
- Got something better to do?
- No. I'm going.

1184
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:32,549
- Where you going?
- Home.

1185
01:04:32,673 --> 01:04:34,331
Don't leave me here by myself.

1186
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:36,144
Where is my home?

1187
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,733
- What?
- Where do I live?

1188
01:04:38,252 --> 01:04:39,252
You've moved?

1189
01:04:39,687 --> 01:04:41,046
Yeah, where to?

1190
01:04:41,328 --> 01:04:42,662
What, an exact address?

1191
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:44,212
No, just the area.

1192
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,798
What am I, your postman?

1193
01:04:48,022 --> 01:04:49,726
No, you're my friend.

1194
01:04:50,278 --> 01:04:52,048
- Look, I'll see you...
- Come on.

1195
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,548
Oh, for fu...

1196
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,444
Excuse me!

1197
01:05:53,905 --> 01:05:55,742
- What are you doing?
- What are <i>you</i> doing?

1198
01:05:55,862 --> 01:05:57,248
You haven't returned my calls.

1199
01:05:57,426 --> 01:06:00,399
There's not been that much
since you told the BBC to piss off.

1200
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:04,149
There's other channels, aren't there?
You're meant to generate work.

1201
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,369
I can't magic things out of thin air.

1202
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:08,321
They either want you or they don't.

1203
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:09,468
Life's cruel.

1204
01:06:10,255 --> 01:06:12,251
I'm up to my eyeballs
with other clients...

1205
01:06:12,428 --> 01:06:13,582
Guilty as charged.

1206
01:06:15,218 --> 01:06:16,266
But what about me?

1207
01:06:16,771 --> 01:06:18,239
Listen to me, Andy.

1208
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:20,679
I don't know
what it is that you want.

1209
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,232
Every time you come in my office,
something different.

1210
01:06:23,352 --> 01:06:25,419
One day it's all about
being an artist,

1211
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:27,750
the next day you just want
your face in the paper.

1212
01:06:28,466 --> 01:06:29,529
What do you want?

1213
01:06:30,513 --> 01:06:31,964
To be a famous movie star

1214
01:06:32,084 --> 01:06:34,836
or to be the tortured genius
creating great art?

1215
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:37,762
Look, do you want fame and fortune

1216
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:40,369
or do you want integrity and respect?

1217
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:41,946
- Both.
- Right.

1218
01:06:42,536 --> 01:06:45,545
There are only a few people
who have both of those things

1219
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:46,989
and you...

1220
01:06:47,535 --> 01:06:49,289
... will never be one of them.

1221
01:06:52,636 --> 01:06:54,095
What do you want?

1222
01:07:01,304 --> 01:07:03,490
Rich and famous and on the telly.

1223
01:07:05,735 --> 01:07:06,758
OK then.

1224
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:09,867
Will you do the stuff
you keep turning down?

1225
01:07:10,398 --> 01:07:11,920
Comedy panel shows?

1226
01:07:12,044 --> 01:07:14,652
Do you know you will have
to make your jokes look ad-libbed?

1227
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:16,523
I know how they work.

1228
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:19,341
Fit club.

1229
01:07:19,824 --> 01:07:22,378
Good, yeah. This is great!

1230
01:07:22,607 --> 01:07:24,873
I'd much rather have a client
that will do anything

1231
01:07:25,038 --> 01:07:28,634
than someone who goes, "I don't want
to do that" or "It's beneath me."

1232
01:07:28,756 --> 01:07:29,756
Hold on.

1233
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:32,757
There is one other thing,
I might have to pull some strings.

1234
01:07:33,362 --> 01:07:34,362
Pull 'em.

1235
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:45,621
<i>Last night, the celebrity housemates
arrived in the Big Brother house.</i>

1236
01:07:48,779 --> 01:07:50,275
- Lisa Scott Lee.
- Hi, Lisa.

1237
01:07:50,438 --> 01:07:51,873
Hi, Scott. Hi, Lee.

1238
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,489
- Chico.
- Toby.

1239
01:07:53,657 --> 01:07:54,657
How's it going?

1240
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:57,843
- Welcome to the house.
- Oh, cheers.

1241
01:07:58,575 --> 01:07:59,575
Hi, Andy.

1242
01:08:05,387 --> 01:08:06,467
Lionel Blair.

1243
01:08:07,133 --> 01:08:08,609
- Andy.
- Good.

1244
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:10,884
He's happy.

1245
01:08:16,423 --> 01:08:18,555
I don't know
who any of these people are.

1246
01:08:18,717 --> 01:08:20,014
Who's that in the dress?

1247
01:08:20,657 --> 01:08:22,875
That's Amy,
she is in all the lad's mags.

1248
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:24,835
Her boyfriend was accused of rape.

1249
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:27,514
Opportunity knocks.
And who's that one?

1250
01:08:29,727 --> 01:08:31,847
- Her son was murdered.
- Murdered?

1251
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,158
What's she doing in here?

1252
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:36,489
- She's got a single coming out.
- Course she has.

1253
01:08:36,772 --> 01:08:37,749
Cheers.

1254
01:08:45,675 --> 01:08:47,130
It's Chico time.

1255
01:09:00,145 --> 01:09:02,411
<i>11.22pm.</i>

1256
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:05,549
<i>All the housemates are in the lounge.</i>

1257
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,271
I knew he was filming us at it

1258
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:11,081
but I didn't think it was going
to end up on the internet.

1259
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:14,214
- How did it end up on the internet?
- Someone must have stolen it.

1260
01:09:14,694 --> 01:09:16,549
- Where from?
- From the flat.

1261
01:09:16,742 --> 01:09:18,796
You probably put it
on the open window sill

1262
01:09:18,916 --> 01:09:20,712
next to the apple pie
cooling down,

1263
01:09:20,832 --> 01:09:23,599
some ruffians came by,
they've put it on the internet.

1264
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:24,941
I'm glad they did,

1265
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:27,716
because the lads mags
called and said,

1266
01:09:27,962 --> 01:09:29,279
"We saw those,

1267
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,220
we thought they looked great
in motion,

1268
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,770
do they look as good still?"
And they did.

1269
01:09:33,915 --> 01:09:36,539
So they put them in the magazines,
and luckily...

1270
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:38,718
was reading one of them.

1271
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:40,867
You went out with F... for a while.

1272
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,389
We didn't really go out,
I shagged him a few times.

1273
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:46,484
And I also shagged...

1274
01:10:00,473 --> 01:10:03,208
Andy has come to the Diary Room.

1275
01:10:03,357 --> 01:10:05,677
You might be sued
under the Trades Descriptions Act,

1276
01:10:05,797 --> 01:10:07,247
calling it Celebrity Big Brother.

1277
01:10:07,929 --> 01:10:09,633
I didn't know some of them were.

1278
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:11,410
I just think,

1279
01:10:13,655 --> 01:10:15,385
<i>I don't think
this is doing me any good.</i>

1280
01:10:15,505 --> 01:10:18,612
<i>It'll make me look bad if anything
because people won't go,</i>

1281
01:10:19,953 --> 01:10:22,187
"he's the biggest star in there,"
they'll go,

1282
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:24,939
"well, if he's in there,
he must be as..."

1283
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,651
<i>Day Three.</i>

1284
01:10:34,477 --> 01:10:36,602
<i>Lionel is dancing again.</i>

1285
01:10:44,362 --> 01:10:45,948
I've pulled my bloody back...

1286
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,094
There we go.
Easy does it, lay back, lay back.

1287
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:55,751
Why are you doing this?

1288
01:10:56,533 --> 01:10:57,946
Just keeps up the profile.

1289
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,204
But you've been performing for 40 years.

1290
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:03,607
Aren't you bored with, just,
having to be on all the time?

1291
01:11:04,638 --> 01:11:06,126
I ache as well.

1292
01:11:06,758 --> 01:11:08,686
I wake up in the morning and I ache.

1293
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:10,736
That's why I've done my bloody back,

1294
01:11:10,856 --> 01:11:12,261
I didn't stretch because

1295
01:11:12,485 --> 01:11:13,771
it aches to stretch.

1296
01:11:16,353 --> 01:11:18,447
Do you know what I look forward to?

1297
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,666
Death.

1298
01:11:22,984 --> 01:11:24,195
Oh, save me some wine.

1299
01:11:24,978 --> 01:11:26,058
It numbs the pain.

1300
01:11:32,762 --> 01:11:34,538
<i>Day Four.</i>

1301
01:11:34,806 --> 01:11:37,680
<i>Big Brother has set
the housemates a task.</i>

1302
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,270
<i>The housemates must
rank themselves in order of fame.</i>

1303
01:11:41,461 --> 01:11:43,422
With one being the most famous

1304
01:11:43,889 --> 01:11:46,684
and eight being the least famous.

1305
01:11:47,132 --> 01:11:48,300
I've worked hard.

1306
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,559
What have you done,
dropped your knickers?

1307
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,204
OK, all right,
but at least I'm on the way up.

1308
01:11:53,324 --> 01:11:55,614
My fans are watching
so I should be here.

1309
01:11:55,734 --> 01:11:58,454
I've been famous for ten years,
you've been famous for ten minutes.

1310
01:11:58,936 --> 01:12:01,695
- I've been in this business 50 years.
- Granddad's talking now.

1311
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,698
Never mind about Granddad.

1312
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:06,408
Spit it out.

1313
01:12:06,568 --> 01:12:09,393
I had two programmes in the top 5,
Give Us A Clue and Name That Tune.

1314
01:12:09,513 --> 01:12:11,150
When have you been on the telly?

1315
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,040
Everybody who watched are in homes.

1316
01:12:13,686 --> 01:12:16,471
Look, I don't care if Lionel
wants to go number one...

1317
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:18,771
I'll swap with Lionel
but I'm not swapping with her.

1318
01:12:18,891 --> 01:12:21,749
I don't mind,
I mean, all I say is,

1319
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:24,885
my show was getting seven million
every week on BBC One.

1320
01:12:25,045 --> 01:12:27,596
Everyone shouts my catchphrases.

1321
01:12:27,756 --> 01:12:30,182
Even four-year-olds
shout my catchphrase.

1322
01:12:30,342 --> 01:12:31,948
Four-year-olds shout my catchphrase.

1323
01:12:32,068 --> 01:12:34,313
They're five now but
that's not the point...

1324
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,438
<i>I'm sorry, mate,
you're a reality winner...</i>

1325
01:12:36,598 --> 01:12:38,729
<i>Hold on, hold on,
hold on a second.</i>

1326
01:12:40,144 --> 01:12:42,027
<i>Actually, you didn't even win.</i>

1327
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:45,029
Out of 75,000...

1328
01:12:45,858 --> 01:12:48,575
My son's murder was
on the news at ten...

1329
01:12:53,073 --> 01:12:54,331
And I met Gordon Brown.

1330
01:12:54,492 --> 01:12:56,709
He paid for me to come up
to London and everything.

1331
01:12:57,916 --> 01:13:00,587
Still, it must have been
a terrible time.

1332
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,548
It was an absolute tragedy.

1333
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,899
It was number one, this.

1334
01:13:17,097 --> 01:13:18,342
Shoulders everybody.

1335
01:13:22,155 --> 01:13:24,778
<i>Andy has come to the Diary Room.</i>

1336
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:26,883
I don't know why I did this.

1337
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:29,863
I just don't...

1338
01:13:30,295 --> 01:13:33,478
What is this?
This is a blip, is this a blip?

1339
01:13:33,598 --> 01:13:35,233
Is this a blip in my life?

1340
01:13:35,474 --> 01:13:37,320
Will I do something embarrassing?

1341
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,572
I don't know.

1342
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:44,382
I don't know what's
the best that can happen.

1343
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:46,177
I know what the worst is

1344
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:50,076
but I don't know
what the best isthat can happen.

1345
01:13:56,525 --> 01:13:59,403
<i>Is there anything you miss
on the outside world?</i>

1346
01:14:07,481 --> 01:14:08,562
<i>Loads of stuff.</i>

1347
01:14:18,005 --> 01:14:20,997
<i>The housemates
are talking about fame.</i>

1348
01:14:22,617 --> 01:14:24,838
When did you first realise
you wanted to be famous?

1349
01:14:25,838 --> 01:14:27,007
- Me?
- Yeah.

1350
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,213
I didn't think l did
just want to become famous.

1351
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,845
I thought I wanted something...

1352
01:14:32,005 --> 01:14:33,882
But I do,
just want to be famous,

1353
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:37,269
why else would I put myself here
with a load of other desperate people.

1354
01:14:37,761 --> 01:14:39,421
What? I'm not desperate.

1355
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,689
- No?
- No.

1356
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:44,900
I'm doing this to broaden my career.
I want to be a serious journalist.

1357
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:47,063
Yesterday, June,

1358
01:14:47,593 --> 01:14:51,864
you spent 20 minutes making
porridge in high heels and a thong.

1359
01:14:52,317 --> 01:14:53,158
So?

1360
01:14:53,318 --> 01:14:55,411
I don't think Katie Curric
started out like that.

1361
01:14:55,571 --> 01:14:56,370
Who?

1362
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,851
- Good luck with the Pulitzer.
- Are you patronising me?

1363
01:14:58,971 --> 01:15:00,519
I'm not having a go.

1364
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:02,269
I'm saying we must be desperate.

1365
01:15:02,389 --> 01:15:04,002
Why else would we come onto a show

1366
01:15:04,163 --> 01:15:06,296
where you have to hand in
your dignity at the door?

1367
01:15:06,456 --> 01:15:08,382
I haven't handed in my dignity.

1368
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:19,369
<i>I'm not gonna get married
for a while but if I did get married,</i>

1369
01:16:19,903 --> 01:16:22,372
<i>I would definitely
let someone pay for it,</i>

1370
01:16:22,532 --> 01:16:24,983
<i>because a decent wedding
is going to cost about 50 grand.</i>

1371
01:16:25,103 --> 01:16:26,919
<i>I'd let Hello pay.</i>

1372
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:31,167
<i>And, apparently, they pay you
for every celebrity you get along.</i>

1373
01:16:32,094 --> 01:16:35,260
- You'd come, you're worth a few quid.
- Definitely.

1374
01:16:36,078 --> 01:16:37,874
Would you come to my Hello wedding?

1375
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,682
To your Hello wedding?

1376
01:16:43,387 --> 01:16:44,436
Are you all right?

1377
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:50,221
What are we doing?
Selling ourselves, selling everything.

1378
01:16:50,429 --> 01:16:52,665
Happiest day of my life?
Oh, quick.

1379
01:16:52,865 --> 01:16:54,810
I'd better do the invites
and bake a cake.

1380
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:56,949
Must have a press tent,
it's a wedding.

1381
01:16:57,514 --> 01:17:00,762
I must see pictures of myself with
other people I'm in a programme with.

1382
01:17:01,026 --> 01:17:03,295
Now I'm pregnant,
we must televise the birth.

1383
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:05,149
Get Ryan Seacrest to present it,

1384
01:17:05,269 --> 01:17:08,043
maybe it'll make E channel's
<i>100 Greatest Caesareans</i>.

1385
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:10,044
I'm not having a go at you,

1386
01:17:10,164 --> 01:17:14,034
I'm sick of these celebrities living
their life out in the open all the time.

1387
01:17:14,154 --> 01:17:15,380
Why would you do that?

1388
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,042
It's like these pop stars

1389
01:17:17,162 --> 01:17:19,695
who choose the perfect moment
to go into rehab,

1390
01:17:19,815 --> 01:17:22,038
they call their publicists
before they call a taxi,

1391
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:24,058
then they do
their second autobiography,

1392
01:17:24,178 --> 01:17:25,920
"Love Me Or I'll Kill Myself".

1393
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,276
Kill yourself, then.

1394
01:17:27,933 --> 01:17:29,504
<i>And the papers lap it up.</i>

1395
01:17:29,624 --> 01:17:32,330
They follow us round and that makes
people think we're important

1396
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:34,516
and that makes us think
we're important.

1397
01:17:34,636 --> 01:17:37,864
If they stopped doing that, people
wouldn't take to the streets going,

1398
01:17:38,024 --> 01:17:40,357
"I need a picture of
Cameron Diaz with a pimple."

1399
01:17:40,477 --> 01:17:42,661
They wouldn't care,
they'd get on with something else.

1400
01:17:42,821 --> 01:17:44,504
They'd get on with their lives.

1401
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:46,623
You open a paper,
see a picture of

1402
01:17:46,783 --> 01:17:49,022
Lindsay Lohan getting out
of a car and the headline is,

1403
01:17:49,142 --> 01:17:51,475
"Cover Up Lindsay, We Can See
Your Knickers." Of course!

1404
01:17:51,595 --> 01:17:56,133
Your photographer's lying in the road
with his camera up her dress.

1405
01:17:56,584 --> 01:17:58,689
<i>You're literally the gutter press.</i>

1406
01:18:00,018 --> 01:18:02,572
<i>And fuck you, the makers
of this show as well,</i>

1407
01:18:02,692 --> 01:18:05,142
you can't wash your hands of this,
you can't keep going,

1408
01:18:05,302 --> 01:18:08,135
"It's exploitation but
it's what the public want." No.

1409
01:18:08,255 --> 01:18:10,272
The Victorian freak show
never went away,

1410
01:18:10,713 --> 01:18:13,525
now it's called Big Brother
or American Idol.

1411
01:18:13,685 --> 01:18:16,820
We're in the preliminary rounds,
we wheel out the bewildered

1412
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,457
to be sniggered at
by multi-millionaires.

1413
01:18:20,425 --> 01:18:22,576
And fuck you
for watching this at home.

1414
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:24,786
Shame on you.

1415
01:18:25,673 --> 01:18:26,712
And shame on me.

1416
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:28,436
I'm the worst of all,

1417
01:18:28,556 --> 01:18:30,200
cos I'm one of
these people that goes,

1418
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,353
"I'm an entertainer,
it's in my blood."

1419
01:18:32,473 --> 01:18:34,950
Yeah, it's in my blood
because a real job is too hard.

1420
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,478
I'd love to have been a doctor.

1421
01:18:36,598 --> 01:18:38,300
Too hard,
didn't want to put the work in.

1422
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,883
<i>I'd love to be a war hero</i>

1423
01:18:41,071 --> 01:18:42,220
<i>but I'm too scared.</i>

1424
01:18:43,482 --> 01:18:45,729
<i>So I go, "Oh, it's what I do,"</i>

1425
01:18:46,295 --> 01:18:49,198
<i>and I have someone bollocked
if my cappuccino's cold,</i>

1426
01:18:49,318 --> 01:18:51,171
<i>or if they look at me the wrong way.</i>

1427
01:18:53,034 --> 01:18:55,014
<i>Do you know what a friend
of mine once said?</i>

1428
01:18:55,134 --> 01:18:58,026
<i>That I'll never be happy
because I'll never be famous enough,</i>

1429
01:18:58,408 --> 01:18:59,664
<i>and they were right.</i>

1430
01:19:04,292 --> 01:19:06,413
<i>And if you are watching this,
I am so sorry.</i>

1431
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:09,176
<i>You're my best friend,
you're my only friend...</i>

1432
01:19:11,466 --> 01:19:13,609
<i>And you never did anything wrong,</i>

1433
01:19:14,401 --> 01:19:15,869
<i>it was everything else.</i>

1434
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:18,549
<i>I'll never do that again,
I'll never treat you like that again.</i>

1435
01:19:19,947 --> 01:19:22,506
<i>And it's eating me up.
You asked me a stupid question once</i>

1436
01:19:22,626 --> 01:19:24,513
<i>I could've answered it
and I didn't,</i>

1437
01:19:24,935 --> 01:19:26,234
<i>because I was...</i>

1438
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,416
<i>I'll answer it now.</i>

1439
01:19:29,805 --> 01:19:31,019
<i>I'd be the penguin.</i>

1440
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,314
<i>Cos I could eat the flying fish.</i>

1441
01:19:36,635 --> 01:19:39,700
<i>I know what you're thinking,
why doesn't the fish fly away?</i>

1442
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:42,447
<i>Well, it can't really fly,
it sort of glide and flap.</i>

1443
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:44,709
<i>They should be called
glidey flappy fish.</i>

1444
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:50,463
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

1445
01:19:51,507 --> 01:19:53,294
I've been waiting
to hear that, mate...

1446
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:55,965
- I don't think he means...
- He's a good guy.

1447
01:19:58,977 --> 01:20:00,744
I'm going to go now,
cheers everyone.

1448
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:04,494
Andy. That was amazing.

1449
01:20:04,614 --> 01:20:06,365
- Cheers.
- I'm gonna come with you.

1450
01:20:08,133 --> 01:20:11,518
Just give me 5 minutes, there's
paparazzi, I'll put on a bikini.

1451
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:33,163
Andy's through there.

1452
01:20:36,553 --> 01:20:39,865
Seriously, mate,
you are a fucking genius.

1453
01:20:39,985 --> 01:20:41,362
Where did that come from?

1454
01:20:41,885 --> 01:20:44,572
Have you seen the mob out there?
It's gone mad!

1455
01:20:44,692 --> 01:20:46,394
The phone's been going mental,

1456
01:20:46,514 --> 01:20:49,248
I've had calls from the papers,
all the chat shows...

1457
01:20:49,368 --> 01:20:51,954
We can charge a fortune for this.

1458
01:20:52,074 --> 01:20:53,074
Well done, mate.

1459
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:56,396
Elton john wants you to be seen
at one of his 60th birthday parties.

1460
01:20:56,923 --> 01:20:58,141
He's 61 now, isn't he?

1461
01:20:58,261 --> 01:20:59,976
He's got a lot of parties
to get through,

1462
01:21:00,096 --> 01:21:01,318
still on the 60th ones.

1463
01:21:01,478 --> 01:21:05,664
Posh and Becks are being photographed
on a private beach "against their will"

1464
01:21:05,784 --> 01:21:08,033
and wondered
if you wanted to be there.

1465
01:21:10,528 --> 01:21:13,263
When you go through there,
don't say too much.

1466
01:21:13,383 --> 01:21:16,722
We wanna be able to sell your story.
Just a few words, then in the car.

1467
01:21:16,842 --> 01:21:18,871
I've got you a hotel suite.
Let's get down there,

1468
01:21:18,991 --> 01:21:21,755
and assess our options,
but seriously, mate,

1469
01:21:22,163 --> 01:21:23,840
the world is your oyster.

1470
01:21:24,157 --> 01:21:25,383
You ready?

1471
01:21:25,543 --> 01:21:27,651
Let me say a few words,
then I'll bring you out.

1472
01:21:32,842 --> 01:21:34,976
Hello.
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

1473
01:21:35,575 --> 01:21:39,064
Andy's been through a lot so he won't
be answering many questions now,

1474
01:21:39,224 --> 01:21:41,650
<i>there will be a chance
for that at a later stage.</i>

1475
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:43,394
Get your cheque books open.

1476
01:21:44,151 --> 01:21:46,792
All right so, ladies and gentleman...
Andy Millman.

1477
01:21:50,143 --> 01:21:51,520
Oh, he's a deaf bugger.

1478
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:11,525
Hello.

1479
01:22:12,048 --> 01:22:13,531
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1480
01:22:14,817 --> 01:22:16,059
I saw you on the telly.

1481
01:22:16,219 --> 01:22:17,223
Did you?

1482
01:22:18,411 --> 01:22:19,271
Good.

1483
01:22:19,431 --> 01:22:20,765
Where are we going?

1484
01:22:21,045 --> 01:22:23,573
Somewhere where
no-one cares who I am.

1485
01:22:23,768 --> 01:22:25,185
Back to the Ivy then?

1486
01:22:28,432 --> 01:22:29,432
Seriously,

1487
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,242
somewhere where no-one knows me.

1488
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:34,601
- Hollywood?
- The hits keep coming.

1489
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:40,500
What do you want me to tell them?

1490
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,383
They've been sitting
for three hours!

1491
01:22:42,503 --> 01:22:44,293
"Oh, sorry, we lost him"?

1492
01:22:44,413 --> 01:22:46,089
Move, fucking find him.

1493
01:22:52,128 --> 01:22:53,809
Seriously,
where do you want to go?

1494
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,898
What, can I go anywhere?

1495
01:22:56,732 --> 01:22:57,732
All right then.

1496
01:22:58,614 --> 01:23:00,145
Where do the flying fish live?

1497
01:23:00,265 --> 01:23:02,681
- In the sea.
- Let's go there, then.

1498
01:23:02,801 --> 01:23:05,394
Two first class tickets
to the sea, please.

1499
01:23:15,418 --> 01:23:17,952
