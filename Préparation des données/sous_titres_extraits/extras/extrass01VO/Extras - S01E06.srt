1
00:00:01,237 --> 00:00:06,027
To the dread rattling thunder,
have I given fire

2
00:00:06,117 --> 00:00:09,951
and rifted Jove's stout oak with his own bolt.

3
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:15,390
The strong-based promontory
have I made shake.

4
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,946
And by the spurs
plucked up the pine and cedar.

5
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:26,789
Graves at my command
have waked their sleepers.

6
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:33,396
Op'd and let 'em forth by my so potent art.

7
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:38,907
Here's one. What would you rather be?

8
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:41,789
Is now the best time to do this?

9
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,518
Right. Would you rather be you,

10
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:49,750
with your face and your legs
and the brain of a chimpanzee...

11
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:51,237
Brilliant.

12
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:54,833
...or would you rather be a chimpanzee,
but with your brain?

13
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,111
I can't answer that.

14
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,349
It's too inane, even for you.
That's the worst one yet.

15
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:05,551
...and deeper than did ever plummet sound.

16
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:08,548
I'll drown my book.

17
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,551
DIRECTOR: And cut!

18
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,992
Good. Very good.

19
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,355
DIRECTOR: Patrick, happy?

20
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,037
Okay, so we're...

21
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:32,668
Oh, for...

22
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,589
- All right?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,318
- Now that is acting.
- Yeah, I know what acting is, Greg.

24
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,674
Well, you know what watching acting is.

25
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:46,070
Actually, you can watch me later.
I've got a line.

26
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,952
"All's lost. To prayer, to prayer, all's lost."

27
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,837
- That's embarrassing.
- You don't know what it means, do you?

28
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,990
- Not the way you did it, no.
- But you don't know what it means?

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,435
- I don't care what it means so...
- You've no idea?

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,592
No, because while you were at school
swotting up on Shakespeare,

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,398
I was out living a real life, shagging birds.

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,789
You told me you didn't have sex
till you were 22.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,711
- Why are you joining in?
- Interesting.

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,994
No, it's not.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,594
You said your mum
wouldn't let you bring girls home.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,591
- Why are you still joining in?
- The plot thickens.

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,433
The plot doesn't thicken
because I could have been lying to her.

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,158
- Calm down!
- Lf you were lying,

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,199
why did you say that you lost your virginity
to a woman that looked like Ronnie Corbett?

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,033
And it's good night from me.

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,311
- Rubbish.
- I've got to go. That's great. Good luck.

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,109
I hope you have better luck with the acting
than you clearly have had with the ladies.

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,633
You don't know anything.

44
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,551
- See you later.
- Bye.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,398
I'd love to show him.

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,676
Don't worry.
You will get off with another woman.

47
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,594
I mean my acting career!
I get off with birds all the time.

48
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,114
Sorry.

49
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,476
Why did you tell him
about the Ronnie Corbett woman?

50
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:49,676
I don't know.

51
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,554
PATRICK: Enter.

52
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,156
Oh, hi. I'm probably going to get fired
for even being here.

53
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:11,553
I'm an extra in this, but I'm an actor, really.

54
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:15,077
And, well, I'm desperate
and as I said, I'm really sorry but...

55
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,755
Oh, come on, don't apologise. Sit down.

56
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:21,072
You're hustling. Acting is a noble
profession but it's a tough one.

57
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,277
So how are you getting yourself out there?

58
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:26,638
Well, I'm just getting my face around
in anything I can,

59
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:30,158
but, you know, I suppose I'm networking,
but I've written a script.

60
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:32,836
You see, writing, you see, that's the key.

61
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,675
- I'm writing myself at the moment.
- Right.

62
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:39,721
You see, as actors,
the only choice we have is yes or no.

63
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:44,034
Whereas if you're writing your own material,
you're creating your own opportunities.

64
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,760
Well, this is my thinking, yes.

65
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:47,719
I'm writing this screenplay

66
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:51,636
and I find the whole process
absolutely exhilarating.

67
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:54,077
What's yours about,
if you don't mind me asking?

68
00:03:54,162 --> 00:03:55,834
How best to explain it?

69
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:57,594
- You've seen me in X-Men?
- Yes.

70
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:59,832
The character I am, Professor Charles Xavier,

71
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:03,961
if you remember, he can control things
with the power of his mind.

72
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,158
- Yes.
- Make people do things and see things.

73
00:04:06,242 --> 00:04:09,359
So I thought,
"What if you could do that for real?"

74
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:12,321
I mean, not in a comic book world
but in the real world.

75
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:15,076
- Oh, right.
- So in my film I play a man

76
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:19,156
- who controls the world with his mind.
- Right. That's interesting.

77
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:23,316
Yes. For instance, I'm walking along
and I see this beautiful girl

78
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:26,759
and I think I'd like to see her naked
and so all her clothes fall off.

79
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:29,395
All her clothes fall off?

80
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:32,475
Hm. Yes, and she's scrabbling around
to get them back on again

81
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,839
but even before she can get her knickers on,
I've seen everything.

82
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,879
You know, I've seen it all.

83
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:41,839
- Okay. It's a comedy, is it?
- No.

84
00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:46,233
It's about what would happen
if these things were possible.

85
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,520
- What's the story, though? What's the...
- Well, I do other stuff.

86
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:52,356
Like, I'm riding my bike in the park
and this policewoman says,

87
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:55,594
"Oi! You can't ride your bike on the grass,"
and I go, "Oh, no?"

88
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:57,402
And her uniform falls off.

89
00:04:57,484 --> 00:05:00,794
And she goes, "Ah!" and she's trying
to cover up but I've seen everything.

90
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,923
Anyway, and I get on my bike, I ride off.
On the grass.

91
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:11,395
So, it's mainly you sort of going around
seeing ladies' tits.

92
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:12,673
Mainly.

93
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:15,722
And I do other stuff like,
I go to the World Cup Final

94
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:19,194
and it's Germany versus England
and I wish that I were playing.

95
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,639
And suddenly I am
and I score the winning goal.

96
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:24,955
They carry me into the dressing room
and there's Rooney and Beckham

97
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:27,604
- and then Posh Spice walks in and...
- Her clothes fall off?

98
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:28,912
- Instantly.
- Sure.

99
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:30,995
- She doesn't know what's happening.
- No.

100
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:33,154
- But I've seen...
- Seen everything.

101
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:34,757
Again.

102
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:39,757
Good. Is there a narrative at all?
Is there like a story in the film or is it just...

103
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:44,316
- Well, I'm a sort of James Bond figure.
- Right.

104
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:47,841
And I have to go to Iraq
to rescue these hostages.

105
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:51,235
And I get there and I rescue them,
but they're all women.

106
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:54,203
And they're naked
because their clothes had rotted off.

107
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:57,880
But I get them into the helicopter
and I'm flying the helicopter,

108
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:01,275
but I can still sneak a look in the mirror
and I can see everything.

109
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,959
You know, one of them is bending over,
two of them are kissing.

110
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:07,003
- They've turned lesbian?
- Because they'd been in the camp so long.

111
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:10,634
It can happen. Well, good luck with that.
I've just written a sitcom,

112
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,637
but I wonder if you could give it
to anyone you know, you know.

113
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,124
- Yes.
- In film or TV...

114
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:17,036
- Is there any nudity in it?
- Any...

115
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,922
- Any nudity in it?
- Not really.

116
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,235
- Oh.
- Well, there could be.

117
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:22,678
Men or women?

118
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,843
- Either.
- Oh.

119
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,678
Well, just women.

120
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:29,801
- Right.
- I'd need to rewrite, but...

121
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:33,481
in the meantime, if you could give it
to anyone in TV or film or...

122
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:36,034
Yes, definitely. I will make it so.

123
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:41,435
You've seen Star Trek: The Next Generation?

124
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,916
- I haven't, no.
- Your wife won't let you have it on?

125
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,597
- I'm not married.
- Oh. Your girlfriend, then?

126
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:51,075
I have no girlfriend. I live alone.

127
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,920
You're not married, you haven't got
a girlfriend and you don't watch Star Trek?

128
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:57,564
No.

129
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,445
Good Lord.

130
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:04,557
You're probably wondering why
I called you in for an unscheduled meeting.

131
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:08,400
- Got the wrong day?
- No, not at all, no. These are exciting times.

132
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:09,805
I know you've been busy.

133
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:13,243
I've been busy as well generating
a lot of heat about your sitcom script.

134
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:14,555
- Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:17,844
Took the liberty of sending the script to
a production company, Picard Productions.

136
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:22,284
They sent it to the BBC comedy department,
who got in touch, and there's a lot of buzz.

137
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,959
What, the BBC have called you?

138
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,765
Yeah. They just say, "We love the script.

139
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:29,157
"We'd like to get you in and
have a meeting, a chat and brainstorm."

140
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:32,159
- Brilliant. Who's the production company?
- You wouldn't have heard of them.

141
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:36,126
A little company called Picard Productions
set up by Patrick Stewart. I sent it to them...

142
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,926
- You sent it to Patrick Stewart?
- "This is dynamite stuff..."

143
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,599
- Recently?
- About two months ago.

144
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:43,645
No, you didn't. I gave it to him on set.

145
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,246
Even if I haven't done anything
towards this...

146
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:59,479
please can I still have
my twelve-and-a-half percent?

147
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:01,081
Please.

148
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:06,088
- Yeah, why not?
- Yeah? Thank you.

149
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:09,004
I mean, that's sort of the way it's done so...

150
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,477
Have you thought about
who could play the main character?

151
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:13,524
- I'm playing the main character.
- Really? Are you sure?

152
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:17,317
You're a bit of a nobody. I'm not sure
they'd cast a nobody in the main role.

153
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,126
Well, we'd insist.

154
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,768
I think the obvious choice
is right under your nose. Barry.

155
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:24,408
Yeah. No offence, Shaun.
I'm playing the lead character.

156
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,285
Are you sure 'cause he's really versatile?

157
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:28,598
- I'm sure he is.
- I'm not sure what it is you can do.

158
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:31,566
Barry can do all sorts. Do your serious.

159
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:34,606
You do love me, Janine, you do.
I know you do.

160
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:37,725
- Yeah. Do your comical.
- Pat, you've trodden on my foot! Get off!

161
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,844
- He's a singer as well.
- # Mustang Sally #

162
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:42,966
- Loud, isn't it?
- He did a gig once without a microphone.

163
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,482
There wasn't a microphone there.

164
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:46,764
He turned up for this gig,
there was no PA system, nothing.

165
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,646
- Tell him.
- They were going to cancel the gig.

166
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,845
I said, "You're having a laugh!
I don't need a microphone.

167
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,124
- "Microphones are for wimps."
- He said microphones are for wimps.

168
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,326
I belted it out, just like that,
in front of what, 140-odd people.

169
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:58,843
And they were really spread out
because it was a thousand-seater venue.

170
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:01,363
Lot of empty seats, didn't faze him,
just went for it. Go on, do it.

171
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:04,247
# All you want to do is ride around Sally #

172
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:07,082
- Sing it with me now!
- # Ride, Sally, ride #

173
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,444
- What are you doing?
- Just having a little sing-song.

174
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,407
I'm doing the lead in this, okay?
I'm playing the lead character.

175
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:14,366
That's it, I don't want to discuss it.

176
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:15,848
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

177
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,807
I don't know...
You've never struck me as a funny bloke.

178
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:20,242
Sorry?

179
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:23,048
You always come in here
and you're really negative and a bit...

180
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,642
Doesn't that tell you something?

181
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,197
I know what you're saying but
I don't get Barry any work and he's happy.

182
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,246
- Not entirely happy.
- Calm down, mate.

183
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,720
Giving it all this in front of a client. If you've
got an issue, have a meeting with me.

184
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,007
You've been hanging around with him
too much, giving it this.

185
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,610
- Hi, hello.
- Hi.

186
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,126
- Lain Morris, Head of New Comedy.
- I'm Andy. This is my agent.

187
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,130
- Darren Lamb. Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Nice to meet you. Good.

188
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,246
- Okay, well, take a seat.
- Thank you.

189
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,443
Okay, we're just waiting for one more person.

190
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,567
I want you to meet Damon Beesley.
He's a producer here,

191
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,847
but he's also a great writer
and he's a script editor and I'd like to...

192
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,921
(HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER)

193
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,561
Room for a small one? Cheeky,
you started without me. Not for the first time.

194
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,960
What's he been saying? It's all lies.

195
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:22,087
Lucky for you, I haven't said anything at all.

196
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:23,650
- Andy, this is Damon.
- Hi.

197
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:27,519
Oh, bloody hell, we're not worthy,
we're not worthy.

198
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:30,079
Je t'aime your script. I wet myself laughing.

199
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,004
At last, some real talent at the BBC.

200
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,968
- Cheers.
- He's happy.

201
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,325
Where are we?

202
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:39,209
I just wanted to find out
where you see this project going.

203
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,883
- BBC 1.
- No, I don't actually.

204
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:42,689
- BBC 3?
- No, BBC 2.

205
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:45,239
I think that's just really good for comedy.

206
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:47,845
I think if you come up
with a new project on BBC 1,

207
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:50,365
you've got to really water it down,
you know?

208
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:52,726
- I don't want a laughter track.
- No laughs.

209
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,006
- There'll be laughs.
- There'll be big laughs.

210
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:57,651
But I just want it to be...

211
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,610
I don't want it to be a comedy
aimed at people without a sense of humour.

212
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,808
I want people to be able to think about it.

213
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:05,486
I don't want it filmed in front
of a live studio audience.

214
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,564
Unless you guys disagree with that,
in which case we can change all that.

215
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:10,483
- Just do whatever you want to do.
- No.

216
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,528
No, there's no need to do that.

217
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:15,763
What I would say, though,
is because this is your first project,

218
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,366
I would like you to initially write
with someone else.

219
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:20,090
- He will write with anyone.
- I won't.

220
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:23,084
He will not write with anyone,
that's a deal breaker.

221
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:25,208
No. I'd like to write it myself

222
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:28,762
just because it's based on
my own experiences, really.

223
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:31,730
The character is based on a boss
I used to work for.

224
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,531
And I just generally think
the best things are auteured.

225
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:37,365
Turd?

226
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:40,607
No?

227
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,613
All right, I'm happy for you
to write it yourself

228
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:48,810
but I would feel happier getting Damon
just to work with you as script editor.

229
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:52,681
Someone to bounce ideas off, just tidy up
the first script. I think it's a bit flabby.

230
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:55,651
Yeah, it's just a bag of ideas at the moment,
but yeah, fine.

231
00:11:55,733 --> 00:12:00,409
I think the best thing to move this forward
is to get you two together in a little room.

232
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:02,484
- Oh!
- Shh!

233
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:06,409
Inappropriate at a meeting at the BBC, that.

234
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,802
- Okay, that would be great.
- Okay.

235
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:12,647
Okay, let's talk cash because,
as you know, this script is piping hot.

236
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,531
- So we're looking for big bucks.
- We don't need to talk cash now.

237
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,444
We need to talk a little bit about cash.

238
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:21,162
Just get some money up front for,
you know, supplies, pencils.

239
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:24,131
- I could probably find you a computer.
- You happy with a computer?

240
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,488
- Yes.
- He's happy with that. We'll go with that.

241
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:27,767
Okay, good.

242
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,333
- You sure you're happy?
- Yes.

243
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:30,927
- Thanks.
- Great.

244
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:33,289
- Thank you very much.
- Nice to meet you.

245
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:44,847
# Celebrate good times, come on #

246
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:47,528
Did you get it? Oh, brilliant.

247
00:12:47,614 --> 00:12:49,286
- Oh, well done!
- Oh, yes.

248
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:50,648
Someone's celebrating.

249
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:53,692
What, a wealthy old relative
popped her clogs, has she?

250
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,492
No. So why am I celebrating?

251
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,611
Could be because of the TV show
the BBC have just given me.

252
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,492
- TV show?
- Yeah, pilot for a sitcom. So...

253
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,929
- What sitcom?
- The sitcom I wrote.

254
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:06,926
- You're not funny.
- Well, the BBC beg to differ.

255
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:10,723
- What's it about?
- It's about my old boss I used to work for.

256
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,088
Write about what you know.

257
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:17,124
I'd just like to say I've got something for you,
just to say thanks for all the great times.

258
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:20,252
Just a few crumbs from the table.
Share the wealth.

259
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,974
I am devastated, really,
to be leaving you lot behind.

260
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:25,285
We've had such great...
Especially you, Julie.

261
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,764
- Lucy.
- Whatever. Shouldn't you be in costume?

262
00:13:27,855 --> 00:13:29,732
- I am in costume.
- Yeah?

263
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:32,648
Why did we never...
And you, will you please call me?

264
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:36,165
- I haven't got your number.
- Yeah, 079... (MUMBLING)

265
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,689
- 07 what?
- Listen up. 0793334...

266
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:42,450
All the threes, put them all in otherwise
it doesn't work. And in a particular order.

267
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:43,968
- Get it off Julie...
- Lucy.

268
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,454
- Whatever.
- I haven't got your number.

269
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:47,253
- I'll text it to you.
- You haven't got my number.

270
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:49,929
I know, but I'll work it out.
Then we'll all have it, won't we?

271
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:53,724
Then we can arrange the camping trip
we've always talked about.

272
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:56,010
- Anyway, I'll see you later.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

273
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,767
See you later, man.

274
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:01,690
You all right? You look a bit pale.
Could you get some rouge for Greg?

275
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:04,006
- I'm fine.
- You all right? You look a bit sick.

276

(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

277
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:36,533
I think structurally,
we're all higgledy-piggledy-pew

278
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:40,450
and I think we can get to the boss coming in
quicker and set him up straight away.

279
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:44,211
Well, we could start with him actually
walking in to work, in the first scene.

280
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,652
He just actually comes in
and that's when you see him.

281
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:50,412
The real Ray used to come in to work
every day without fail.

282
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:52,453
He'd just walk up to someone
and say something like,

283
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:54,846
"Have you done those invoices?"
And they'd go, "No."

284
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,327
And he'd go, "Is he having a laugh?
Are you having a laugh?"

285
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,487
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

286
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:04,286
Brilliant. We're having that.
That's super, that's funny. Do it again.

287
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:06,766
That's what he used to do,
just go up to someone

288
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:10,770
and go every time, "Is he having a laugh?
Are you having a laugh?"

289
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,493
That's great. That will be a catchphrase.

290
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:16,011
- I'm not sure about catchphrases.
- No, it'll be great.

291
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:19,248
People can say it. "Is he having a laugh?
Are you having a laugh?"

292
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:22,215
- I just think catchphrases are too easy.
- Are you having a laugh?

293
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,288
I think it could get a little bit
annoying after a while.

294
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:27,574
Do you fancy a coffee?
I haven't had one in about 20 minutes.

295
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:30,297
Shall I get one from upstairs
or do you fancy one from Costa's?

296
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:33,051
- It might take me a bit longer.
- That one, then.

297
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:35,606
Are you having a laugh?

298
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:39,373
- Oh, hello. Can we help?
- Hi. It's my friend Maggie. Come in.

299
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,813
- This is Damon.
- Oh, you cow, I love your bag.

do you want one?

No, it's fine. I'm just here for a wee minute.

Okay, well, lovely to meet you.
See you again, hopefully.

- Bye.

- Welcome to our world.
- Look at you.

- I will.

the corridor going, "I want a cappuccino."

Oh, he's too gay, he's too gay.

315
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,969
- What do you mean?
- No one needs to be that gay.

316
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,653
- What do you mean he's too gay?
- He's a cliché of a gay.

If I was doing Give us A Clue and
the clue came up "A gay bloke", I'd do him.

318
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:33,894
- Unbelievable.
- Well, that's just a wee bit homophobic.

319
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:37,813
It's not homophobic.
No, I don't care how much arse sex he has.

320
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,174
But why does he have to be that camp?

321
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,489
Screaming and clapping.
When does that happen?

322
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:45,855
When do you suddenly think,
"Well, I prefer a nice little saveloy

323
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,409
"to a battered cod
so I'd better walk like this."

324
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,774
- I liked him.
- Of course you do.

325
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:55,408
- Women like you love the gays.
- What do you mean, women like me?

326
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:57,694
Wrong side of 30, six out of ten for looks.

327
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,247
You've got someone to go to the disco with,
haven't you?

328
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:03,252
And you walk in with him and you go,
"No, I'm not sharking, I've got a bloke."

329
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,253
But if a bloke comes up that you fancy,
you go, "Oh, him? He's just my gay friend."

330
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,729
- Perfect. It's a safety net.
- Six out of ten.

331
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,017
- Yeah.
- Is that all I get? Six out of ten?

332
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,058
- I don't know...
- Look me in the eye and say six out of ten.

333
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,290
Shall I look you in your wonky eye
or your good eye?

334
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,452
I have got one eye a wee bit higher up
than the other one.

335
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,099
- See you.
- Bye.

336
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,013
I was going to ask you,
how are you getting on with Andy?

337
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,376
He's lovely, isn't he?
He's very talented. Very funny script.

338
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,610
You've not run into
any of his funny little ways?

339
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,578
- No.
- Well, he can be quite odd sometimes.

340
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,333
I just wanted to let you know
that he is like that with everybody.

341
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,776
- How do you mean?
- Well, like noise.

342
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,771
He's got this thing about noise.

343
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,011
Like, I've seen him at a restaurant,
somebody at the table nearby

344
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,252
is cutting their meat too loudly and
he's getting himself all annoyed about it.

345
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:54,174
Oh, note to self. Cut meat quietly.

346
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:57,890
Yes. And you might find you might want
to just tone it down a little bit.

347
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:02,133
- Tone what down?
- Well, you're quite camp, which is great,

348
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,179
but I think maybe sometimes
he thinks you're too gay.

349
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:07,534
Did he say that?

350
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,454
Yeah, but I mean, he wasn't being nasty
about it. I just think...

351
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,339
Oh, no. I've said the wrong thing.
I shouldn't have, should I?

352
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:15,616
No, no, I'm fine. I'm glad you told me.

353
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:19,137
Oh, good. Thank God for that.
I thought I'd put my foot in it by telling...

354
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:20,734
- Not at all.
- Okay.

355
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:24,131
- Well, it was lovely to meet you.
- Absolutely. Lovely to meet you.

356
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:26,132
- See you again.
- I'll take it on board.

357
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:27,734
Bye.

358
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:38,414
You have one message. Message one.

359
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:39,651
(BEEP)

360
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:43,735
Hello, dear. It's your daddy here, er...
with your mummy.

361
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,178
- Erm... nothing important.
- MUM: Oh, give it to me.

362
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:51,460
Hello, dear. Great news about Andy.
We're so pleased for him.

363
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:55,899
And it just got us thinking that maybe you
should try and do something with your life.

364
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:59,139
I mean, your dad and I aren't expecting
anything spectacular.

365
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,100
We were just thinking maybe a wee job
you could be proud of.

366
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,572
You know, we love you so much,
we hate to think of you growing old

367
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:09,450
and being poor and living in squalor
and dying a spinster.

368
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:12,136
So, just give us a call
to put our minds at rest

369
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:15,214
that you're not just frittering your life away,
would you? Okay?

370
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:18,932
And if things get any worse, you can always
come back home. We've still got your room.

371
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:20,934
DAD: Well, it's sort of my study now.

372
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:24,060
MUM: We could easily squeeze in
a tiny wee single bed.

373
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,657
All right then, give us a call, sweetheart.
Bye for now.

374
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:28,017
DAD: Bye dear.

375
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:29,172
Bye.

376
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:32,780
(SIGHING)

377
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:38,137
Okay, great. Well, I love the changes.
I think this is looking great. Well done.

378
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:41,215
- Oh, thank you.
- I think we're ready to move things forward.

379
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:45,421
I'd like to shoot a non-broadcast pilot
with a view to making a series.

380
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:48,176
Oh! Okay, thank you.

381
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:49,776
- All right.
- Brilliant.

382
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:52,502
So, are you happy with the way
things have gone so far?

383
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,619
- Definitely.
- You happy working with Damon?

384
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:58,059
- Definitely.
- No problems with the working relationship?

385
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:00,782
- Nothing you want to discuss?
- No.

386
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,263
Okay.

387
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:04,619
- I'm not too gay for you, then?
- Damon.

388
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,855
I'm sorry. I said I wasn't going to say
anything but he's lying through his teeth.

389
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:09,696
Excuse me.

390
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:15,375
Your friend, Maggie, is it?
She told him what you said about him.

391
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,932
- What did I say about him?
- That he's too gay.

392
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:22,939
- Oh! No. She's an idiot. She's an idiot.
- So you didn't say that?

393
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:26,861
Yes, but he wasn't meant to hear it.

394
00:20:27,624 --> 00:20:31,583
It concerns me if you're so homophobic,
you couldn't work with a gay person...

395
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,939
No, no, no, no, I'm not homophobic.

396
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,299
In fact, I actually said to her,

397
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:40,463
I said,
"I don't care how much arse sex he has...

398
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:44,583
"he's just too..." What was it?
I can't remember what I said.

399
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,813
You're aware that I'm gay?

400
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,224
Didn't...

401
00:20:51,305 --> 00:20:54,138
Well, no, you didn't... And you don't make
a song and dance. You don't go,

402
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:56,136
"Ooh, hello! I'm..."

403
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:58,341
- No, I didn't.
- I'll stop you there.

404
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,574
Go on.

405
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:02,054
What concerns me is
we've all got to work together

406
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:03,976
and if this is where we are
when we've only just started,

407
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:06,101
where the hell are we going to be
a month or so down the line?

408
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:08,983
It won't be a problem
because I'll just apologise to Damo.

409
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:12,455
Everyone gets wound up with
the people they work in close proximity with.

410
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:14,422
Little things wind you up,
so it doesn't matter.

411
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:18,214
It's not a case of being straight or gay.
It's my neuroses and I'll just, you know...

412
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:21,024
Do you think you could put your
hang-ups and your neuroses on hold?

413
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:23,175
- Yes.
- He won't be around for long.

414
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:26,734
- What, AIDS?
- Sorry?

415
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:29,860
Is it AIDS?

416
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:32,819
No. I mean the pilot
will only take a couple of months.

417
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:34,419
Oh, yeah.

418
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:37,703
Right. Listen, talk to Damo, I'll talk to him.

419
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:41,865
We'll see where we are and if we feel
we can go forward with this project or not.

420
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:45,143
We can... Okay, I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to him now.

421
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:47,057
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

422
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:50,694
- Okay, I'll go and talk to him.
- All right, bye.

423
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:53,141
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

424
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:55,501
- Hello.
- Hi. Do me a favour. Stay out of my business.

425
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:58,180
- Andy, what? Come in.
- I may have lost the pilot thanks to you.

426
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,415
- Why?
- Why?

427
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:01,383
Because you stuck your nose in
where it wasn't needed.

428
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:03,900
Telling Damo I thought he was too gay.
What were you thinking?

429
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:06,705
I was thinking that you were stressed
and I just wanted to help you.

430
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:10,620
That's helping me, is it?
I just can't believe your stupidity sometimes.

431
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,539
Andy, don't be like this, I can't cope.
I'm having a bad time at the moment.

432
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:15,537
Sorry. What's a bad time for you?

433
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,935
Tie-dyed the wrong T-shirt?
You lost a kooky broach?

434
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:21,258
I was just about getting to where I wanted
to be and you may have fucked it up.

435
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:23,303
- I've been grovelling all day at the BBC.
- What do you mean?

436
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:25,901
I've got a meeting there at 4:00,
they may pull the plug.

437
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:28,455
Imagine if they pull the plug, how am I going
to look you in the face again?

438
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,219
- Do you want me to say something?
- You're not listening.

439
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,140
I'm sorry, Andy.
I don't know what you want me to say.

440
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,741
- I was just trying to help you.
- I don't want you to help me anymore.

441
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:39,581
I want you to stop living like a child,
floating through life like everything's okay

442
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,419
until it actually affects someone, okay?

443
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:45,341
So really, my advice to you is,
you've got to grow up.

444
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:51,105
Clean up, just sort your own mess out
before you get involved in my life, really.

445
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,343
- Do you want to follow me?
- Yeah.

446
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:34,501
It's unfortunate we've ended up
in this position, Andy.

447
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:36,783
I'm not going to speak for Damon.

448
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:38,904
Damon, come on.

449
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:41,821
- Well, things were said that were very hurtful.
- Yeah.

450
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:44,704
But your apology means a lot to me.

451
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:49,180
So, if you're happy to work with me,
then I'd like to carry on working with you.

452
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,180
Definitely. Definitely. Yeah.

453
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:53,225
I'm such a huge fan of this project.

454
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:55,823
- I'm a big fan of yours, so...
- Great.

455
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:57,342
- Happy?
- Definitely.

456
00:23:57,429 --> 00:23:59,784
- Water under the bridge.
- Wonderful.

457
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:03,739
Okay, let's get some dates sorted
and get the ball rolling on his project.

458
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:06,707
- Yeah.
- Come on, silly. Huggy Bears.

459
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:11,028
DAMON: Now.

460
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:12,224
Okay?

461
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:13,503
- Do you want one?
- No.

462
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:16,342
- Just normal? Okay, brilliant. Okay, thanks.
- Yes.

463
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:20,782
Cheers.

464
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,303
Cut. Great.

465
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,948
Thank you.

466
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,621
- See you.
- See you. That's me done.

467
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,507
- Oh, I'll see you soon.
- Yeah, bye.

468
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,704
Maggie.

469
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,630
- Hi.
- You all right?

470
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:21,269
Yeah.

471
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:23,182
- And you?
- Yeah.

472
00:25:23,951 --> 00:25:25,862
Here, look.

473
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:29,270
Okay, now.

474
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:31,630
PATRICK: Hello, Maggie.

475
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:34,145
- Hello.
- This is Patrick Stewart here.

476
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:37,029
And the reason you're hearing
my rich, sexy voice

477
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:40,342
is that Andy is not man enough
to apologise himself,

478
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:42,342
even though he knows he's in the wrong.

479
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:44,626
That's why he's asked me to do it for him.

480
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:50,101
Please, look at his fat, expressionless face.
He doesn't mean any of the things he said

481
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:52,944
and he knows you don't have
a malicious bone in your body

482
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:55,465
- and were just trying to help.
- Thank you.

483
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,900
If you can find it in your heart to forgive him,

484
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:02,825
then please... make it so.

485
00:26:05,552 --> 00:26:07,782
Have you seen
Star Trek: The Next Generation?

486
00:26:07,912 --> 00:26:10,631
Er, no, I haven't, actually.

487
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:13,943
Never mind.
Incidentally, Maggie, are you an actress?

488
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,421
Because I'm writing a film
and I'd love you to be in it.

489
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:18,821
Okay. No, she can't. Okay, thanks.

490
00:26:19,352 --> 00:26:20,546
Cheers.

491
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:24,022
- What was that about a film?
- You don't want any part of it, trust me.

492
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,863
- Your hair looks really nice.
- Shut your face.

493
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:31,512
- What? It does.
- Well, thanks.

494
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:34,106
- The pilot's fine, by the way.
- Thank God for that.

495
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:37,301
I just wanted to let you know
that I have taken on board

496
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:40,509
all that stuff that you were saying
about growing up.

497
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:42,947
- Oh, don't please, shut up.
- Well, I have.

498
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:45,102
- Oh, don't.
- Well, you know what I mean.

499
00:26:45,192 --> 00:26:47,342
- Well, I'm mortified.
- No, I know, but you were right.

500
00:26:47,432 --> 00:26:50,345
I wasn't right. You're about the most
grown-up person I know.

501
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:53,630
- I'm sort of the only person you know.
- You win by default.

502
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,151
Correct.

503
00:26:57,393 --> 00:26:59,031
I'm really sorry.

504
00:26:59,713 --> 00:27:01,943
Can you let go of my hand, please?

505
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:09,585
Of course. Aren't my hands lucky? 'Cause
that would ruin everything, wouldn't it?

506
00:27:09,673 --> 00:27:12,506
- He's quite a nice one, though, isn't he?
- He's fine.

507
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:15,824
I've been working up to saying hello to him
for the last couple of days.

508
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:17,665
- Sure.
- What do you think?

509
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:19,106
- You know what I think.
- What?

510
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:21,104
I think you're a tart.

511
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:22,865
Go on, then.

512
00:27:23,353 --> 00:27:25,071
- Work your magic.
- Yeah, I will.

513
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:26,381
I'll see you later, yeah?

514
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:28,145
- See you.
- See you.

515
00:27:36,994 --> 00:27:38,552
ANDY: That was quick.

516
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:41,990
I couldn't think of anything witty to say.
He was on the phone anyway.

517
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:44,866
ANDY: What would you rather do...

518
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,548
(MAGGIE LAUGHS) Go on, then.

519
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,670
Wake up and your teeth
have sort of fallen out,

520
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:52,188
wake up and your hair's fallen out,

521
00:27:52,274 --> 00:27:56,153
or wake up and your toes have fallen off?

522
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:57,826
(MAGGIE LAUGHING)

523
00:27:57,954 --> 00:28:00,468
Er... what, is my hair gone for good?
