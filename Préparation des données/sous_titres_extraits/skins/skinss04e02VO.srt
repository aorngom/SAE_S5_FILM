1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,056
The police would like
to interview you all.

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:05,329
Somebody gave that girl drugs.

3
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:07,491
- So?
- I'll fucking...

4
00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:09,435
Thomas! It was me! Cook
dealt me the powder.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,171
What?!

6
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,785
I slept with someone who wasn't you.

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,641
What?!

8
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:14,155
I told him I never want to see him.

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,638
Well done. He needs to
think about what he did.

10
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:20,018
I'm going to... expel you.

11
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,995
The postman just looked at my tits!

12
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,344
Yeah, he does that.

13
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,064
You're supposed to be planning
us a route across Mexico.

14
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,260
Sorry, I got bored
waiting for my garibaldis.

15
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:17,926
Can you turn away a minute?

16
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:24,501
Turn back.

17
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,072
I saw these a while ago, and...

18
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:44,697
I love you.

19
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,321
Yeah, I know.

20
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,904
Don't forget it, though.

21
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:53,747
How do I look?

22
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,932
What are you doing?

23
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,791
Just clearing some space.

24
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:34,211
Fitch hug.

25
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:45,577
You too, big man.

26
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:49,119
Oh, Mum. He wants to hug me again.

27
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:51,141
Hug your father.

28
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,416
Emily, in here, please.

29
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,139
Can you take that stupid
thing off your head?

30
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,571
We need to talk about
your options for next year.

31
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:24,384
I'm going to Mexico with Naomi.

32
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:27,732
Don't worry. It's all worked out.

33
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,404
Well, a lot can change in a year, missy.

34
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,042
Why don't you look at
these in the meantime?

35
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:36,597
Have you seen my phone?

36
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:41,432
You have six missed calls.

37
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:44,396
All from me.

38
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:04,921
Morning, Jenna. You're
looking very beautiful today.

39
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:27,103
See you at lunch.

40
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:28,685
Yeah. See you.

41
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:39,606
What's the matter?

42
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,853
Forgot for a second.

43
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:43,054
About what?

44
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:44,055
It's nothing to do with us.

45
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:48,734
Ah, girls. Good. Follow me.

46
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:50,411
Actually, don't. We're late.

47
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:52,904
Frankly, Emily, I don't give a damn.

48
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,023
The police are back and they want to
talk to you both about Sophia Moore.

49
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:59,772
So come along, ladies. This way.

50
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:05,542
So, how close were you to Sophia?

51
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:09,647
We didn't know her.

52
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:13,436
- Did you know her, Emily?
- No.

53
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,372
You sure?

54
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:17,629
We heard you three were quite chummy.

55
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:20,718
Well, we weren't.

56
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:22,384
Have you ever used MDMA?

57
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:26,167
Uh... it's illegal.

58
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:29,820
We found traces of it in Sophia's blood.

59
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:33,086
We think she might have
bought it in the club.

60
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:35,731
Did you see Sophia at the party?

61
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:38,081
We only saw her...

62
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:41,465
We were only at the party
for ten minutes or so.

63
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,814
We went home long before...
before the accident.

64
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,586
We didn't see her.

65
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:48,323
Emily said you did.

66
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:55,371
Um... no. I meant since the party.
There's been posters everywhere.

67
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,449
What are you looking for, exactly?

68
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,643
Just want more of a complete picture.

69
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:07,628
We just want the truth.

70
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,071
Why did we just lie to the police?

71
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:17,032
Hey.

72
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:20,207
It's me. What's going on?

73
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:34,264
I did see her at the party.

74
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:37,166
It was me who sold her the MDMA.

75
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,461
Since when are you dealing?

76
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:43,106
I needed some money and I thought
if I just went in on this MDMA...

77
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:45,389
I could have lent you some money.

78
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,799
It was for these.

79
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,606
I thought I could keep you safe.

80
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,187
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,528
Who gave you the MDMA?

82
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:04,635
- Why did you give them our names?
- Em, calm down.

83
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,284
Course I didn't, man. Chillax.

84
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,760
- They ain't got nothing on us.
- And you know that, do you?

85
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:12,093
I nicked the fella's briefcase.
He's a fucking Bristol Rovers fan.

86
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:15,291
His mum leaves notes in his
sandwiches. Look at that.

87
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:18,087
- But what if they do know?
- That's what'll fuck this.

88
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,000
Getting scared, poking around, causing
a fucking scene in the corridors.

89
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:24,649
- He's right.
- Mum's the word, girls.

90
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:30,220
Don't you want to know
why they had our names?

91
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:30,777
No!

92
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,318
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to go to jail.

93
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:37,175
Could you just mind your own
fucking business for once, please?

94
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,788
Ok. Sorry.

95
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,958
We just have to act
like everything's fine.

96
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:59,506
See you later.

97
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,314
Hello.

98
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:25,777
Hi.

99
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:28,508
I'm a friend of Sophia's.

100
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:36,809
Thank you for the flowers.

101
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,517
Sorry. What was your name again?

102
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:40,968
Nancy.

103
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,347
She never mentioned a Nancy.

104
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:48,643
But that's Sophia for you.

105
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,855
Secretive.

106
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:55,430
How did you know her?

107
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:58,423
Just from... college and stuff.

108
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:01,865
Are you in with Naomi
and Emily and that crowd?

109
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:08,231
Um... yeah. I see them sometimes.

110
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:11,727
I thought they'd have called round by now.

111
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:15,377
- Sophia talked about them nonstop.
- Did she?

112
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:20,556
Did she ever talk to you about me?

113
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:21,796
Yeah...

114
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,678
Yeah.

115
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:27,933
She really... loved you.

116
00:10:29,353 --> 00:10:31,150
You're lying to me.

117
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,754
It's kind of you.

118
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:41,672
Hi, Matt. This is Nancy.

119
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:45,082
Friend of your sister's.

120
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,715
I'm going upstairs.

121
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:57,846
Would you like to see her room?

122
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,117
She never used to let me go in there.

123
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:07,666
It was always so messy.

124
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,568
If you want a memento, just...
just let me see what you've taken.

125
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:21,807
I'll leave you to it.

126
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,200
What are you doing?

127
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:23,502
Nothing.

128
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,065
What's your name again?

129
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,184
- Nancy.
- Sophia never mentioned a Nancy.

130
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:37,065
Did you know someone gave
her drugs the night she died?

131
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,849
I didn't know.

132
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:41,179
Were you her girlfriend?

133
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:44,029
What? No. Girlfriend?

134
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:47,427
You're fucking lying to me.

135
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:51,878
They're saying she killed herself.

136
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:53,411
That's bollocks.

137
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:57,448
I know she didn't do that. How?

138
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,971
Cos she didn't say goodbye to me.

139
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:05,904
I'm so sorry.

140
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:08,529
I found this.

141
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,983
Get out.

142
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:27,250
Hi, chicken. What's the matter?

143
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:29,779
Is my mum here?

144
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:33,705
Is it... whatshisname? JJ?
Your mum said he was nice.

145
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,650
JJ?

146
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:39,281
Now, if he's cheated on you, love,

147
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:40,911
the thing to remember about young boys

148
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,767
is that most of them would fuck
a snake if you put make-up on it.

149
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:46,305
You can't take it personally. Hmm?

150
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:53,503
You told Graham I was straight?

151
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:56,325
Well, he's known you since
you were a little girl.

152
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,558
He's gay as a window!

153
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:01,244
He's an adult. He's
earned the right to be gay.

154
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,215
You're too young to know what you are.

155
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,400
I know, Mum.

156
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:08,586
Oh, you bastard!

157
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,066
You think you know.

158
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:15,877
Is there any specific reason why
you've been crying? Maybe Naomi?

159
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:18,520
No, we're fine.

160
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:23,587
You should go travelling to find yourself.

161
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,520
Wouldn't she just get in the way?

162
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:28,000
She's my fucking girlfriend!

163
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:30,155
You've got nothing to do with this.

164
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,019
All right. All right!

165
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:34,497
Wouldn't you like to
set out on an adventure on your...

166
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:38,206
No! Get used to it!

167
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,644
So... what if I was to give you £1,000?

168
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,291
- Would that change things?
- What?!

169
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:46,410
- Now you're bribing me.
- Oh, Emily. You're mine!

170
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,344
I'm just trying to help you.

171
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:50,203
Naomi's not right for you.

172
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:52,097
And there's something about her...

173
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:53,680
something I don't quite like.

174
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:55,818
I'm just telling you.

175
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:58,122
Shove it up your tits.

176
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:02,298
Please, they're
planning work down there.

177
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:38,258
- So how was your bath?
- What bath?

178
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:41,401
The one you popped home to
take about three months ago.

179
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,788
Right. I went to Italy.

180
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:46,232
Italy?

181
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:49,023
Si. How was your summer?

182
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:50,933
Not bad. Got chlamydia.

183
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:54,738
- Wow! Exotic.
- That's what I said.

184
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:56,874
Then I realised Cook had it as well

185
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:00,745
and it didn't feel quite so
special, if you know what I mean.

186
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,491
I bet it liked you more.

187
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:06,022
So, who gave it to who?

188
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:09,117
We didn't. There was an intermediary.

189
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:11,707
And you're... all clear now?

190
00:17:12,952 --> 00:17:14,786
Oh! Yeah, fine now.

191
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:16,579
Clear as a... bell.

192
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:20,277
Not sure about him, though.

193
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,910
It's you I spent all
summer thinking about.

194
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:45,952
So what is it?

195
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:48,308
Is it my food or my
winning personality today?

196
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:58,060
Have you ever... loved someone and then...

197
00:17:58,095 --> 00:18:00,376
something happens and...

198
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:03,641
you wonder if perhaps you
didn't ever know them at all?

199
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:07,493
Do you trust her?

200
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:09,596
What? No?

201
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,576
- What? No, I don't need to.
- But... if you two got together,

202
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:16,282
wouldn't you be worried
she might fuck Cook again?

203
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:17,831
That hurt!

204
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,561
Emily, I'm sorry.

205
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:22,600
I'm just a bit busy at the minute, ok?

206
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:52,587
Why didn't you tell me you knew her?

207
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:55,556
I met her once, at an open day.

208
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,844
What open day?

209
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:59,196
It was an open day. What does it matter?

210
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:01,970
We're going travelling
next year. We decided.

211
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,154
You decided.

212
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:06,854
Look, I went to an open day,

213
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:09,961
I met a girl, we talked... that's it.

214
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:11,409
You should have told me.

215
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:13,801
Well, how could I, without
telling you where I met her?

216
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:17,522
I didn't want a referendum on our
relationship over a stupid open day.

217
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,374
- Did you know she was gay?
- I met her once.

218
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,403
Did you fuck her?

219
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:27,730
No! You think I'd shag some
random girl behind your back?

220
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,622
I'm not saying you did it.
Well, what are you saying?

221
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:33,457
- I'm just asking.
- Why are you acting like this?

222
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,484
- Her mum seems to think we knew her.
- What?

223
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:40,746
I went to her house today.

224
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:44,336
You promised me you'd stay out of it.

225
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:46,334
Stay out of it.

226
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:49,819
Do you know what this is for?

227
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,853
Something to do with the Army.

228
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,145
Probably her cadet locker key.

229
00:20:00,146 --> 00:20:02,285
How do you even know that, Naomi?

230
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:08,291
Where are you going?

231
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:10,431
I'm going to find out if you're lying.

232
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:12,563
Oh, nice!

233
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:14,661
Let's go, then.

234
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:16,527
Fine.

235
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,228
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

236
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,923
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

237
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:49,643
<i>What the fuck?</i>

238
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:13,595
That's my old toothbrush.

239
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,137
It's your bracelet.

240
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:17,628
Is this the one you lost?

241
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:31,970
She went through my rubbish.

242
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,680
Close it.

243
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:37,899
Please, close it.

244
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:52,564
It's ok.

245
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,549
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

246
00:21:56,584 --> 00:22:00,964
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right!
Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

247
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:02,592
<i>Left! Left!</i>

248
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:04,143
<i>Right! Left!</i>

249
00:22:04,178 --> 00:22:08,365
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

250
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,565
<i>Left! Right! Left!</i>

251
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,859
<i>Return!</i>

252
00:22:26,543 --> 00:22:28,342
She stalked me.

253
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:32,655
You're very stalkable.

254
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,701
Sam's a post room co-ordinator.

255
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:40,591
Oh, very nice.

256
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:44,187
Oh, yeah. He's, like,
responsible. Aren't you, sweetie?

257
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,329
Yeah, babe.

258
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,893
No more room for carrot flan, Rob?

259
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:54,147
Think I've had too much
of a good thing, love.

260
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:58,008
I love carrots. This stuff
is off the hook, Jenna.

261
00:23:57,843 --> 00:24:01,534
Oh, thank you, Samuel.
That is so sweet of you.

262
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:03,633
This one's a keeper,
isn't he, Katie-kins?

263
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:07,263
He's an arse-licker is what he
is. But we're letting that one go.

264
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,325
Well.

265
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,448
Is Naomi coming?

266
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,251
No, Naomi couldn't make it.

267
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:14,445
Oh. I wanted to show her my new number.

268
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,330
Stop calling it a number.

269
00:24:16,565 --> 00:24:19,250
A lot of boys become very
curious in women's clothing

270
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:20,694
once they approach pub-erty.

271
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:23,424
It's called pu-berty, little dude.

272
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,460
Sam's really clever. Ain't you, babes?

273
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,286
- Why is he here?
- Because he's my new boyfriend.

274
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:31,527
- Eat your flan.
- You said Naomi couldn't come to a family dinner.

275
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:35,334
This is a six-seater table,
Emily. What do you want me to do?

276
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:41,141
Anyway, this dinner is a happy time

277
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:45,185
because yesterday I got my
kick-starter takeoff loan approved.

278
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,450
Loan?

279
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,244
As from next week, I'm quitting the salon

280
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,774
and will become the managing director

281
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:55,461
of Bristol's premier new
wedding-planning service...

282
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,156
Let's Get Fitched!

283
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:00,594
Let's Get Fitched?

284
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:03,375
Let's Get Fitched... get it?

285
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,677
Yeah. That's good.

286
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,806
Yeah, but... I thought we
were going to talk about that.

287
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,224
We did, Rob. And we decided.

288
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:12,921
This is my shimmering dream.

289
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:14,632
Ah! Toast?

290
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,265
Word.

291
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,450
Got the really expensive stuff as well.

292
00:25:19,793 --> 00:25:21,795
I've lost the gym.

293
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,624
What?

294
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:28,379
I've lost it, love.

295
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:33,238
No! But that's your gym, Rob.

296
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:36,383
It's the bank's gym now.

297
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:37,982
You're unemployed?

298
00:25:38,017 --> 00:25:39,166
YYeah, love.

299
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:43,286
I'm bankrupt. But don't worry.

300
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:46,870
I've got an inside tip that they're
going to be recruiting at Virgin Active.

301
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:53,144
But what about money?
I mean, we need money.

302
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,531
I was going to give Emily money.

303
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:57,642
- I don't want it.
- What money?

304
00:25:57,677 --> 00:26:00,572
She was going to bribe me not
to go travelling with Naomi.

305
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:03,567
It is not a bribe. It's just
money I promised my daughter.

306
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:05,474
Yeah? Well, where's my money?

307
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:07,107
No-one's getting any money.

308
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:10,568
- I'm giving Emily money.
- I don't want it.

309
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:14,077
Don't you get it? I want Naomi.

310
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:15,235
I want to fuck Naomi.

311
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:19,016
What? I do. Get over it.

312
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:20,897
Rob!

313
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:22,915
Did you just hear what he said?

314
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,643
She is attractive, love.

315
00:26:24,678 --> 00:26:26,692
Fuck, Rob! He said "fuck"!

316
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:30,340
Now do you see what
she's done to our family?

317
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:34,085
- I'm moving out.
- Don't be rash, love.

318
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,753
Britney, stop saying
"fuck". Emsy, sit down.

319
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:39,374
No. I don't want to live here any more.

320
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:42,177
Fine. Get out. Go on. Get out!

321
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:44,642
You're not welcome in this home any more!

322
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:46,844
You or Naomi!

323
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:56,530
That's my top.

324
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:00,346
You know Mum doesn't
mean to be a total bitch.

325
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:01,985
Yes, she does. And you let her.

326
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,532
She's trying to help you.

327
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,897
It's all fake.

328
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:08,043
This whole family's fake.

329
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:09,044
I'm not fake.

330
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,265
Fake tan? Fake boyfriend.

331
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,801
Fake concern.

332
00:27:12,836 --> 00:27:15,360
I am concerned! Bitch!

333
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:18,573
And for your information, I was
in the sun for five hours today.

334
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:21,118
And as for my boyfriend, he may be little,

335
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:22,521
but for your further information,

336
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:25,433
he's sweet, trustworthy
and totally hung, ok?

337
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:28,162
Who said I was little?

338
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:31,091
Can you get the fuck out, babes?

339
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:33,074
He's definitely a keeper.

340
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,623
God, you're a selfish cow.

341
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,072
- Oh, fuck off, Kate.
- Please don't go.

342
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:39,611
I'll back you up.

343
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:02,862
You want to pick a better
fake name next time.

344
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,576
There's no Nancys at Roundview.

345
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:06,538
And only one red-haired
girl with a moped.

346
00:28:06,573 --> 00:28:08,950
- You've been checking up on me?
- You lied.

347
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,504
I think it's pretty clear.

348
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:35,817
She killed herself.

349
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:38,018
Was it you?

350
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,219
Was it you, she killed herself?

351
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:42,619
No. And it wasn't Naomi, ok?

352
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:45,501
She didn't know either of
us. She lied about that.

353
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,835
- She wouldn't lie to me.
- She lied to everyone!

354
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,958
I'm sorry you feel angry at her but
it's really not my fucking problem.

355
00:28:51,193 --> 00:28:53,475
I need the truth.

356
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,421
This isn't all of it.

357
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:58,198
No.

358
00:28:59,752 --> 00:29:02,152
Emily, what are you scared of?

359
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,958
We can help each other.

360
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:22,913
Is it so out of the question
that I might know what's best?

361
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:25,620
I'm not talking to you.

362
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:28,304
Emily.

363
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:31,415
I don't want you to move out.

364
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:32,823
I don't care.

365
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:35,692
I'm just trying to help you!

366
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:37,898
Fuck off!

367
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:09,401
"What is it, Sophia?
What did you lock up?"

368
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:49,368
Yes. Fucking...

369
00:30:49,603 --> 00:30:51,878
Oh, no. It's ok. It's just Emily.

370
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:56,537
Bonsoir.

371
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:59,125
Who was that?

372
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,302
Oh, just my mum.

373
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:02,965
What's all this?

374
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,549
I'm moving in.

375
00:31:04,584 --> 00:31:05,630
Where?

376
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:06,983
Here.

377
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:12,242
Uh... isn't that the sort of
thing people usually discuss?

378
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:14,728
I need to, ok?

379
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:16,393
OK.

380
00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:18,381
- Ok?
- Ok!

381
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:21,331
Although, in many ways,
it's sort of a violation.

382
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:23,658
But fuck it. It's ok.

383
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:24,494
Really?

384
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,606
Really! It'll be great.

385
00:31:26,641 --> 00:31:28,684
You can be my pyjamas.

386
00:31:32,796 --> 00:31:35,419
You need to do something
about your moustache.

387
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:37,136
What?

388
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:04,542
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

389
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:28,806
This is just kind of terrible.

390
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,089
Yeah.

391
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,507
Fuck it!

392
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:35,967
If it's rubbish, we'll
just go back to ours.

393
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:37,968
Where?

394
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:41,804
Ours.

395
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,824
Naomi!

396
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:02,792
Stay alive! I will find you.

397
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,629
Hi.

398
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:10,643
How you doing?

399
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:13,173
This is the worst party I've ever been to.

400
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:14,885
The worst.

401
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,127
Really?

402
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:19,044
Panda's giving Thommo a dose
of the old look-at-me routine.

403
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:20,994
You know how it is...

404
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:24,327
letting your exes know
that you're out there,

405
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:26,095
that other people find you attractive...

406
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:29,324
That everything you
thought you had together...

407
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,987
they can do without it.

408
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,016
That they don't need you.

409
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:38,829
That guy over there keeps staring at you.

410
00:33:38,864 --> 00:33:40,991
I merely observed.

411
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:57,093
Let it go.

412
00:33:57,128 --> 00:33:59,835
Let it go before you screw everything up.

413
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:04,881
Cook, excuse me?

414
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:07,157
I don't want to see your muff.

415
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:12,647
Emilio looks jealous.

416
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:16,300
It's probably still not too late
to be overcome by desire with me.

417
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:18,250
I could turn you, deffo.

418
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:18,959
Fuck off.

419
00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:20,629
No, I'm serious.

420
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:24,248
It's probably been a while, innit,
since you've seen one of these.

421
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:28,168
Look, mine is totally oustanding, man.

422
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:31,878
What's up, Emilio, man?

423
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:35,803
Why are you hiding in the pisser?

424
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,073
Do you ever get jealous, Cook?

425
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,771
If your shag's a shag,

426
00:34:40,806 --> 00:34:44,908
then you're always going to get your
heart ripped out somewhere, aren't you?

427
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:46,610
What do you do about it?

428
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:48,750
You just burn, kid.

429
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:50,856
You just burn. You just
keep it on the inside.

430
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:52,098
Is that possible?

431
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:53,049
Yeah.

432
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:55,554
Cos you look a bit stupid
if you don't, don't you?

433
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:57,890
Look at me, love. Happy.

434
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:03,589
Effy.

435
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,264
You don't tell any of my secrets
and I won't tell any of yours.

436
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:10,418
Or we could just go out
there in a blaze of glory.

437
00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:12,519
Dance, muff monkey?

438
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,268
- You got it.
- Come on, then, kid.

439
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:31,309
Oh, sorry.

440
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:35,629
- Cook!
- Get off me now. Get off!

441
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:53,668
Who fucking wants one now?

442
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,738
<i>"I need to see you.</i>

443
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,379
<i>No, now.</i>

444
00:36:52,714 --> 00:36:55,206
<i>I've got something I need to show you.</i>

445
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:56,962
<i>Tonight."</i>

446
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:05,655
Why did you?

447
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:20,894
Why here?

448
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:23,300
I dunno.

449
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:26,187
This is where it ends.

450
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,291
I've got something to show you.

451
00:38:28,326 --> 00:38:30,769
I think she wanted you to have this.

452
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,853
I got it from her cadet locker.

453
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:40,743
I need to know what's in there.

454
00:38:40,978 --> 00:38:43,001
Me too.

455
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:46,615
It's her work... her diary, you know?

456
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,380
Can't we just leave it?

457
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:54,588
I don't think we can, Naoms.

458
00:38:55,797 --> 00:38:59,348
She's dead. Let it go.

459
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:01,778
I can't.

460
00:39:01,813 --> 00:39:03,457
See you round.

461
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,510
Can't we just go home?

462
00:39:10,622 --> 00:39:12,615
Matt, come back!

463
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:17,588
Emily, please!

464
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,133
Emily! Wait!

465
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:39,366
Please!

466
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:41,096
Can't we just go home?

467
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,208
I don't think so.

468
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:49,310
I made this for her.

469
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:52,019
Woodwork, you know?

470
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:54,964
Yeah.

471
00:40:36,716 --> 00:40:38,871
<i>"I can't stop crying.</i>

472
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:42,128
<i>I've tried to stop
thinking, but it doesn't work.</i>

473
00:40:42,163 --> 00:40:44,252
<i>You don't expect stuff to happen.</i>

474
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:45,852
<i>You can't control it.</i>

475
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:47,556
<i>You can't control anything.</i>

476
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:52,531
<i>So I'm at this stupid open day
and everyone's snotty and rude,</i>

477
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:54,734
<i>and then I see someone.</i>

478
00:40:55,774 --> 00:40:57,927
<i>I'd never even spoken to her at Roundview.</i>

479
00:40:57,962 --> 00:41:02,098
<i>It didn't seem to matter because
then everything got really fun.</i>

480
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:03,636
<i>And by the time we were on our way home,</i>

481
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,565
<i>we were telling secrets.</i>

482
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,619
<i>I wanted to move my hand.</i>

483
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:09,639
<i>I wanted to move it so much.</i>

484
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:13,610
<i>And then she moved hers.</i>

485
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:18,254
<i>I wish I'd told Naomi how easy
it is for me to love someone.</i>

486
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:24,241
<i>We're all lonely and all
we want is for someone to...</i>

487
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:26,743
<i>you know, pay attention</i>

488
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,421
<i>and tell us we're beautiful and cute</i>

489
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:31,863
<i>and say that they want to..."</i>

490
00:41:44,576 --> 00:41:46,216
I don't believe it.

491
00:41:47,603 --> 00:41:51,118
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

492
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:20,139
You've ruined it.

493
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:24,410
You don't want anyone to care.

494
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:33,533
I could be dead in a second.

495
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:36,604
Everything's...

496
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,279
so... fragile.

497
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:43,087
Didn't you realise that?

498
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,873
We were special.

499
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:07,834
- I was scared!
- You're always scared.

500
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,674
Emily!

501
00:43:11,932 --> 00:43:13,511
Emily!

502
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:35,206
Naomi cheated.

503
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:40,122
And... I don't know why she did that.

504
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:43,061
Oh, love.

505
00:43:44,662 --> 00:43:46,362
Sweet girl.

506
00:43:46,697 --> 00:43:48,095
I hate her.

507
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,194
- I know you do.
- I hate her!

508
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,636
I know, love. It's ok.

509
00:43:55,814 --> 00:43:59,113
Listen, I want to tell you something.

510
00:43:59,148 --> 00:44:00,856
Listen to me.

511
00:44:05,485 --> 00:44:07,555
You know, I cheated on your mum once.

512
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,054
What?

513
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:13,879
I was young. I was too young. I was 19.

514
00:44:13,914 --> 00:44:15,445
I'd been married for two years.

515
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,870
Her family always saying what's what.

516
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:21,046
Scottish people.

517
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,969
God knows I regretted it.

518
00:44:25,525 --> 00:44:29,217
Your Aunty Julie's no better-looking
now than what she was then.

519
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:30,817
Her sister!

520
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:34,096
People do stupid things

521
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:37,016
when they're trying to act
like they're not trapped.

522
00:44:37,451 --> 00:44:39,644
Was it ever the same again?

523
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:43,542
It was worse.

524
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:45,473
And then it was ok.

525
00:44:45,608 --> 00:44:47,369
Then it got better.

526
00:44:48,711 --> 00:44:50,113
And then we got you.

527
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:52,282
We got all the things we love.

528
00:44:56,482 --> 00:44:58,996
Did she hate herself for taking you back?

529
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:00,481
What?

530
00:45:00,516 --> 00:45:02,695
Hate herself? What for?

531
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,425
She didn't do anything wrong.

532
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,500
She hated me, though.

533
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:09,723
For a very, very, very long time.

534
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:13,141
She's tough, your mum, you know.
You want to be glad of that.

535
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:16,781
