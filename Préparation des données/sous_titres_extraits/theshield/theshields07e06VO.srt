1
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,117
That I could live with.

2
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:48,584
I've kept you out of the mix.

3
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:51,217
I'm in this so deep, and I don't
know how to get myself out.

4
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,750
You're talking
to the right guy.

5
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:54,584
Hanging with shane
is gonna push our heads under.

6
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,017
We need shane right now.

7
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:57,684
You know what's at stake
here for me.

8
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,984
Shane's Armenian friends

9
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,484
can get to our families
anytime they want.

10
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:02,783
Shane?

11
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,284
Lem, I'm sorry!

12
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:05,451
And the way he died...

13
00:01:05,517 --> 00:01:06,750
shit.

14
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:07,984
And he never turned on us!

15
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,718
You killed him
because you were scared.

16
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:11,750
He was strong,
and you were a coward!

17
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:15,150
All I was doing was following
your game plan, coach!

18
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:17,150
You don't get to do
what you did for free.

19
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:18,384
You're gonna pay that Bill.

20
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:26,883
It's the third time
this month.

21
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,351
If our chip's too close to
the place, the thing goes off.

22
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:34,017
I got the back.

23
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:59,517
D-d-don't shoot.

24
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:04,150
Sir, you all right?

25
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:05,917
Where are your clothes?

26
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:10,484
Just stay where you are.

27
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:13,718
Stay where you are.

28
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,351
You got a moment?

29
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,950
I just put a call in to
one of my contacts at justice.

30
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,251
Regarding what?

31
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:29,517
It's time to end this

32
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,517
and turn over
the blackmail box to them.

33
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,150
And I'm giving you the opportunity
to come with when I do it

34
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:34,618
so we can share the credit.

35
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:35,950
I want Pezuela in jail,

36
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:38,317
and not for 30 days
on some pissant charge

37
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:40,351
his lawyer can plead down
to a fine.

38
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:43,117
Hey, I'm the one still washing
Robert Martin's blood out of my suit.

39
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:46,050
So this off-the-books
investigation is done.

40
00:02:46,117 --> 00:02:47,417
What about Olivia?

41
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,150
If you turn over
that box now,

42
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:52,050
you're throwing a good woman
and her career under the bus.

43
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:54,217
She got herself
into that jam.

44
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:55,718
All she did
was to get arm-twisted

45
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:57,883
into helping a couple
of illegals cross the border.

46
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,783
She doesn't even deal
with Pezuela directly.

47
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,384
She got blackmailed into
committing an illegal act.

48
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:04,651
She's the only link
we know about for sure,

49
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,584
so if she's got to get dragged
down to bust Pezuela, so be it.

50
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:10,618
Iook...

51
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:14,351
Pezuela uses a guy named rios
to do his dirty work.

52
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:17,251
Now, if I can catch
rios red-handed...

53
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:19,783
and make him give us
Pezuela...

54
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,750
but if you can do that,
so can the feds.

55
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:23,084
I'm on the inside.

56
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,251
I'm the only one now
who can get Pezuela to trip up.

57
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,651
You've had your chance.

58
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,184
Just give me one more day.

59
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,750
If I can't pull this off...

60
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:33,950
we can both walk into
your buddy's office

61
00:03:34,017 --> 00:03:35,451
the day after tomorrow.

62
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:37,251
All right, you get 36 hours.

63
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,750
But that box
is getting turned in

64
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:39,850
whether you sting rios
or not.

65
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:48,184
He had blood on his hands
and chest.

66
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,417
No visible lacerations or cuts,
though.

67
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:51,651
What happened to his clothes?

68
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:52,984
He was naked
when we found him.

69
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,351
Seemed scared.

70
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:57,651
He thinks he hurt somebody
but can't remember anything.

71
00:03:57,718 --> 00:04:01,317
Trying to get someone to come
down, run a test, psych exam.

72
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:02,718
This time of night,
good luck.

73
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:04,251
You guys want him
when we're through?

74
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:05,684
Steve?

75
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:09,017
I'm a little busy here.

76
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:12,284
Any naked girls show up, though,
you give me a holler?

77
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,017
If psych doesn't want him, I'll
take him in the morning. Okay.

78
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:28,684
The last time
we were here...

79
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,417
shane stood
right next to us.

80
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:36,484
He watched as I vowed to get
the guy who killed Lem.

81
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,317
All this time has passed,

82
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,417
and I still haven't made good
on my promise.

83
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:49,184
Why are we here?

84
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:53,517
Aceveda's taking the box
to justice day after tomorrow.

85
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:59,084
We're gonna lose
a lot of leverage with Rezian

86
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,950
when he finds out that box
is out of play.

87
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,750
What do we do?

88
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:05,417
I've been standing here
for the last two hours

89
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:07,050
trying to figure that out.

90
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:09,750
I think I've come up with a way
to dig us out of our hole.

91
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:11,251
Which one?

92
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:13,017
All of 'em.

93
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:16,684
I got a plan that's gonna get rid
of our Armenian problem for good...

94
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,451
take care of Pezuela in a way
that secures my badge

95
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:22,150
and that'll give Lem
the justice he deserves.

96
00:05:22,217 --> 00:05:23,783
You were right.

97
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,184
We can't just wait around

98
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,817
until shane makes a mistake
that's gonna drown us.

99
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:32,217
As long as he's around, we'll
never breathe free air again.

100
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:34,217
Wait a second.

101
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:37,184
If we go through with what you're
talking about, there's no turning back.

102
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,950
Never thought I'd have to
convince you. You don't.

103
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:42,084
But doing this, in a rush,
to meet some deadline?

104
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,150
We're bound to make
a mistake.

105
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:47,484
Iook, it's time we made good
on our vow.

106
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:48,917
We owe it to Lem.

107
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,317
What's the plan?

108
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:59,384
What I'm thinking about
won't ever lead back to us.

109
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,901
Where you guys been?

110
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,467
We've been talking.

111
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:22,333
I may have let
the rough patch between us

112
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,767
make me a little hardheaded
about the blackmail box.

113
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,734
I told Vic about that
conversation that we had.

114
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:29,901
As soon as that thing
is back in Pezuela's hands,

115
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,867
Rezian's eternally grateful...

116
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,333
we can move past all this.

117
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,168
The problem is
Pezuela is not gonna want to pay

118
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,134
for something
he considers his.

119
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:39,567
But Rezian might.

120
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,801
Our third and final wish
to the armenians.

121
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:44,168
And considering all the hell
we've been through,

122
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:46,801
might as well earn
a little scratch for it.

123
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,201
Call Rezian.

124
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:53,333
Tell him the owner of the box is
willing to sell it for a price.

125
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,767
Okay.

126
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:58,500
We get a couple of cholos to
play the role of our sellers.

127
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,467
I'd say we could milk
at least 100 grand out of this.

128
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:01,801
I'll find the cholos.

129
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:04,168
You get us some face time
with Rezian this morning.

130
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:06,500
We got to agree to terms
before we make the delivery.

131
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,967
Yeah, sure.

132
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,234
I got to tell you,

133
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,400
it's gonna feel real good
to move past this.

134
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,667
I already feel like there's
this weight...

135
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,101
oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

136
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,567
Look what crawled in.

137
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,834
Tavon.
How you doing?

138
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:27,734
I, uh...

139
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:29,067
I'm pretty good.

140
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:30,767
Just got off disability
a few weeks ago.

141
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,268
Still have some physical therapy
to do, though.

142
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,500
That's great, man.

143
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,767
Yeah, they got your boy
working Hollywood now.

144
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:39,867
Hollywood?
Blow jobs for b-listers.

145
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:41,734
Sounds like
good therapy to me.

146
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:42,934
It's not so bad.

147
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,767
It's, uh...

148
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,767
hey, Julien.

149
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,134
Oh, you went out and found
yourself another brother?

150
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,801
They letting you ride
in the front of the bus yet?

151
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,101
Sorry.

152
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,667
Yeah.
It doesn't matter.

153
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:01,333
Listen, Julien, these guys,
they might be tight,

154
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,467
but they're not unbreakable.

155
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:08,867
Listen,
my sympathies about Lem.

156
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:12,667
Uh, thanks.

157
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:15,067
What brings you
to the Barn?

158
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:18,467
Oh, I actually came to talk
to that guy.

159
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:20,268
Uh, you got a minute
to run upstairs

160
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,734
and chat
with your captain?

161
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,201
Yeah.
What about?

162
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:24,734
Gary barba.

163
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:26,101
Hope he fell
into a meat grinder.

164
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:27,600
Actually, he popped back up
on the grid,

165
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,034
and he landed
right in my lap.

166
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:33,300
Sure, yeah.
Let's go.

167
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,300
I'll, uh...
I'll catch you guys later.

168
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,234
Yeah, see you later.

169
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,234
Who's Gary barba?

170
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,467
A blast from shane's past.

171
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:45,734
Don't worry.
He won't slow us down.

172
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,567
I liked barba for a rape

173
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:50,300
back when Vic and I
were working vice.

174
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,734
We couldn't get enough
to bring him in.

175
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:56,134
Piece of shit goes off and
kills his family a week later.

176
00:08:56,201 --> 00:09:00,367
Only survivor was his
10-year-old daughter, camille.

177
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:02,001
And he's been a fugitive
ever since.

178
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,134
I mean, completely off the radar
for six years,

179
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,101
until this week,
when he reached out to camille.

180
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:07,367
No shit.

181
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:08,734
Yeah, her foster family
lives in Hollywood.

182
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,567
They contacted us
two days ago.

183
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,001
How's cammy doing?

184
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,400
She's in bad shape.

185
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:17,101
I mean, he's been
calling her every day.

186
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:19,834
At first, he wasn't even
talking, just... breathing.

187
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:22,234
And now he's trying to get her
to meet face-to-face.

188
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,767
Camille told me
that she was close to you.

189
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:27,101
I stayed with her
in protective custody

190
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:30,400
while we were trying to track
down her... asshole of a dad.

191
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,067
Camille isn't comfortable with
going face-to-face with her old man,

192
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:35,034
even with a battalion
of undercovers around her.

193
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:37,600
She said she'd only do it
if shane was there with her.

194
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,134
Can Ronnie spare you?

195
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:40,901
For this?
Yeah.

196
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,134
You know what?

197
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,467
I got to wrap up
a few things here first.

198
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:50,300
I'll, um...
I'll met you there?

199
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:53,067
Yeah, listen, before we get into
all this...

200
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,500
I just really want
to apologize to you...

201
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,801
for hitting Mara that night.

202
00:09:57,867 --> 00:10:01,001
Iook, what happened in the past
is exactly that.

203
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,034
I've moved on.

204
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,834
And so has my wife.

205
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:08,634
I really am sorry.

206
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,400
Okay.

207
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,500
Anything interesting?

208
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,400
Barba's back.

209
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,634
We got a chance to take
him today. I'm gonna assist.

210
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,300
We got that other thing today. I know.

211
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,567
I'll set it up, but then I'm
gonna have to go back and forth.

212
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:32,001
I need you to appreciate the seriousness
of what we're trying to do here.

213
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,001
I do.

214
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,500
But barba is here today.

215
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,700
Tavon say anything else?

216
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,268
No.

217
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,101
No, he still thinks he
smacked Mara around. Good.

218
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:46,101
Got enough problems
as it is.

219
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:57,034
What's the daily word
from the streets?

220
00:10:57,101 --> 00:11:00,268
More like a whisper.
Nothing worth repeating.

221
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,067
Nothing on the armenians?

222
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:08,433
Let me decide that.

223
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,400
I might have heard
something.

224
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,234
But I'd rather not
tell you about it.

225
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,001
'Cause I'm afraid of what
you'd do with the information.

226
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,333
I don't pay you
to be afraid.

227
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,067
You don't pay me enough
to stand by

228
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:22,333
while you assassinate
city officials, either.

229
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,634
It made my point.
Yeah.

230
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,367
And it scared the real Armenian
targets right into hiding.

231
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,201
And do you know
where they are?

232
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,168
Look, I need to be sure

233
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,867
there will be no more
civilian casualties.

234
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:37,333
I already made my point.

235
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,767
All right, the word is
the Armenian board of directors

236
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,268
is meeting,
all of them, in one spot.

237
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,134
Where and when?
Tonight.

238
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:47,600
I'll have
all the details soon.

239
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,801
Coordinate with rios.

240
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,967
Give him the details.

241
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:53,700
If you're gonna go through
with this,

242
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:56,767
it's gonna burn hot and bright
for a long time.

243
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:00,300
Now, it might be best if
your boys get lost afterwards.

244
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,667
Real lost.

245
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,168
Why would he come back now?

246
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:08,268
Baby, your old man
is a bad penny.

247
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,567
He was bound to show up
sooner or later.

248
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:12,467
The important thing
is I am here,

249
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,600
and I am not going anywhere

250
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,734
until you're safe
and he's under arrest.

251
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,201
Shane and I will be listening
the whole call.

252
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:22,500
Okay? And he can guide you
through any bumps.

253
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,367
You ready for when he calls?

254
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,834
I'm ready.
Are you?

255
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,400
Look, you don't want him
out there,

256
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,201
never knowing
when he's gonna show up again.

257
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:30,801
And trust me, cammy,

258
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:33,934
you are better off
dealing with trouble now

259
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:36,767
than looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life.

260
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,400
Okay?

261
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:45,134
Oh, God.

262
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,934
Jesus, I've been calling you
all morning.

263
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,467
I practically beat in
the front door.

264
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:52,067
I thought you were supposed
to be at the hospital.

265
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:54,467
I took a personal day.

266
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:56,634
Are you all right?

267
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,034
Yeah, yeah.
What's going on?

268
00:12:58,101 --> 00:12:59,700
We were supposed to meet,
remember?

269
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,734
To talk about counseling
for cass.

270
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:03,934
Can we do it tomorrow?

271
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:06,134
You've been bitching to me
about being more involved.

272
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,467
Now you want to do it
tomorrow?

273
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:08,834
I just...

274
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:12,567
are you... let me look at you.
Are you on something?

275
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,967
God damn it, you're high.

276
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,801
I couldn't sleep last night.
I had these pills.

277
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,134
What kind of pills?

278
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:21,134
The kind
that help you sleep.

279
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,268
Well, looking at your eyes,
they look like downs.

280
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,433
Do you have any idea how
addictive those things are?

281
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,801
Between shane kidnapping us and
your ex-cop buddy guarding us,

282
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,967
I haven't had
a lot of rest lately.

283
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:32,901
Our three children
are living in this house

284
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:34,400
under your supervision.

285
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:35,867
If you have to pop downs

286
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,934
in order to handle
what's happening,

287
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:40,268
maybe we should figure out
a different plan.

288
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,600
That's just great.

289
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:44,634
Let that be the last thing
you say before you leave.

290
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:51,034
Our daughter's falling apart,
and you're snoring the day away?

291
00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:02,400
I can't remember anything
after 11:00 last night.

292
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,400
Where were you then?

293
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:06,834
Watching the news at home.

294
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:08,734
I must have fallen asleep.

295
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:09,867
I sleepwalk.

296
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,734
Really?

297
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:14,967
You ever woken up
in strange places before?

298
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,634
Most of the time,
I come to in my house.

299
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,300
Garage or the kitchen.

300
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,767
Most of the time?

301
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,134
Once, I woke up
at a convenience store.

302
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:26,168
I was arrested
for public indecency.

303
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:28,101
I was naked then, too.

304
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,901
How does your...
girlfriend feel

305
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:31,901
about you running
all over town naked?

306
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,834
I don't have a girlfriend.
I'm married.

307
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:37,168
Well, been separated
six months.

308
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:40,467
Do any drugs last night?
Have anything to drink?

309
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:41,934
No, I'm recovering.

310
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:44,101
Any idea
who you might have hurt?

311
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:46,067
I was sleepwalking.

312
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,168
You ever see a doctor
about this problem?

313
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:51,534
I know how it sounds.
I'm just scared I hurt someone.

314
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,001
I want to make sure
they're all right.

315
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,534
Officer Hanlon took a sample
of the blood that's on you.

316
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,300
As soon as we get a type,

317
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,201
we can match it against
any reported assaults,

318
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,700
murder victims in the area.

319
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,168
Was somebody murdered?

320
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,867
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

321
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:09,001
What happened to your wrists?

322
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:12,134
Um... sometimes
I tie myself up at night.

323
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:14,101
Stop myself from leaving.

324
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:17,034
Okay.

325
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:22,101
This isn't the first time he's
been caught waving his willy.

326
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:23,168
Yeah, he told me.

327
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:24,500
Iooks like unis responded

328
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,734
to a 911 call
from his wife six months ago,

329
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,201
right around the time Jeff said
they were separated.

330
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:30,634
Could be our victim.

331
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,634
Let's track her down,
find out.

332
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,667
How's that tavon thing
coming along?

333
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,400
Stopped by
to check on camille.

334
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,001
She looks great, man.

335
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,333
Ought to see her.

336
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,567
She's really grown up
in the last few years.

337
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:43,634
Really likes her new family,
too.

338
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,400
Hey, you got a lockdown
on this old man yet?

339
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,700
'Cause we got to tell Rezian
what time this thing's happening.

340
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,901
Iooks like barba wants
the meeting in the park.

341
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,367
This is gonna be
this afternoon.

342
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,001
Got to tell you,

343
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:56,967
it's gonna feel really good
righting that wrong.

344
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:58,433
Let's go get paid.

345
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,400
Okay.

346
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:06,767
Open up, you shitheads!

347
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,700
Come on, open this door.

348
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,134
Goddamn.

349
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:14,934
Smells like dog's ass
in here.

350
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,333
You boys forget to slap on
some deodorant?

351
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,300
Till my people
stop getting slaughtered,

352
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,801
I'll be interested in survival,
not luxury.

353
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:24,534
You said you have the box?

354
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,433
I don't.
But I found out who does.

355
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,801
Someone
in the mexi organization

356
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:30,333
has been pulling a fast one
on his bosses,

357
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,667
pointing the finger at you

358
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,734
while he plays God
with his little box of intel.

359
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:35,700
And now that the heat's
getting too high,

360
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,700
he wants to offload the box
once and for all.

361
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,234
Asking price is $100,000.

362
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,467
As far as I'm concerned,
that's cheap.

363
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,034
You're gonna make 10 times that
in blackmail alone.

364
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:47,500
Or sell it back to the mexis
for twice as much...

365
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,300
and end this war.

366
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,101
This sounds like
a Mexican problem.

367
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:52,967
Let their gang handle it
internally.

368
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,667
The Mexicans think
you still have it,

369
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:56,201
so it's gonna stay
your problem.

370
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:58,967
And eventually, you're
gonna run out of lamb kabobs,

371
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:00,500
have to poke your head out.

372
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,567
Now, hopefully you won't catch
a bullet anywhere it hurts.

373
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:06,433
Forget it.

374
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,634
I'll have no problem
getting another buyer.

375
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,433
Can I see this box?

376
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,700
9:00 tonight.

377
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,634
That is, if you can
get the cash that soon.

378
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,734
The money is not a problem.
Good.

379
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,734
The sellers want to bring
a full crew,

380
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:21,333
guarantee their protection.

381
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,700
Then I want a full crew, as well. Fine.

382
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,534
You bring your three lieutenants
with you, no weapons.

383
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,067
I'll screen the Mexicans,

384
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,168
make sure no one has
an itchy trigger finger.

385
00:17:30,234 --> 00:17:31,433
Absolutely not.

386
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,767
You're asking me to expose
myself and my men

387
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,901
while there's a target
on our heads?

388
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:38,067
I'll be there with you,
armed.

389
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:41,168
Anything looks out of place,
I'll pull the plug.

390
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:46,700
Can't get a better guarantee
than that.

391
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,867
Here you go.
Thanks.

392
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,734
What's this?

393
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,567
Composite sketches
of the Robert Martin shooters.

394
00:17:55,634 --> 00:18:00,333
Mayor wants them hung
in every precinct.

395
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,767
Help yourself.

396
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,700
A man attacks you
in the line of duty,

397
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,168
and this is the first time
I'm hearing about it?

398
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:08,101
Army surplus room
was supposed to be cleared.

399
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:09,967
I didn't want to get
another officer in trouble.

400
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:12,567
You understand if you had
stepped forward sooner...

401
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,767
I spent hours looking through
mug shots on my own time.

402
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,101
This guy wasn't
in any of them.

403
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:18,500
I mean,
this is the first time

404
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:20,534
I've even come across his face
since that night.

405
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,534
New intel which makes
the Robert Martin shooters

406
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,567
the same
as our body draggers.

407
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,967
I need the strike team
to look into where they are.

408
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:30,234
Any gangs you can roust.

409
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,934
I know where shane is.
Where's Vic?

410
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:34,834
He's on his way here now.
From doing what?

411
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:36,567
He's running down a lead.

412
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,700
On what?

413
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,034
On this ongoing
Mexican/Armenian shit.

414
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,433
The shit is what
you're trying to feed me.

415
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,201
I put you in charge
of the strike team

416
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:46,801
so that I can have somebody
who could be held accountable.

417
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,333
Captain, he's running down
a lead.

418
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
If I wanted to be lied to daily,
I would have left him in charge.

419
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:54,001
Now, the truth is that he is
running around out there

420
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,567
doing God knows what
while you are content

421
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:59,234
to sit back and
cover his ass repeatedly!

422
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,001
Now, I've told you
time and time again,

423
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,634
so a reprimand
goes in your jacket.

424
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,433
One more,
you lose the team,

425
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,234
plus your job,
if I can manage it.

426
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,400
You understand?
Yeah.

427
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:15,467
I am prepared to make it through
putting up with Vic's bullshit

428
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:16,834
till the hearing.

429
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:20,767
The question is, who's gonna be
left after he's gone?

430
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:23,201
Hey.

431
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:25,134
Where you off to?

432
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,400
Somebody connected a few dots.

433
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:28,001
Claudette knows
that the Martin shooters

434
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,801
are the same guys
who did the body draggings.

435
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:31,567
She connected them
to rios yet?

436
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:34,168
No.

437
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:35,700
What happened with Rezian?

438
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,201
He's in.

439
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:40,034
Shane even offered to ride
the deal from the Armenian side.

440
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:42,201
I didn't even have to
suggest it to him.

441
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:44,834
I think he's already spent
his share of the 100 g's.

442
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,367
Holy shit.

443
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:49,467
This is gonna work,
isn't it?

444
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:55,867
Blood tests on the naked guy
came back.

445
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,268
Can you believe this?

446
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,700
My lawyer says my disability
case is hanging by a thread.

447
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,300
I'm lucky to get payment
for days missed.

448
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,500
Um, sorry?

449
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:05,934
Where we at
on Mr. Basada?

450
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:08,333
Blood on his hands and chest
came back ab-negative,

451
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,867
as in not his,
but get this.

452
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:12,600
The wife's 911 call was because
he was choking her in her sleep.

453
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,268
Claims he doesn't remember
doing it.

454
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,867
Because he was sleep-killing.

455
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:18,201
I think the parasomnia claim
is bullshit.

456
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:21,234
He lied to cover up what he did,
just like he lied to the ex-wife.

457
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,500
We don't find the victim,

458
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,433
he just comes off
as paranoid.

459
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,067
We do, he's already established
his defense.

460
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:28,433
That Lloyd kid burned you,

461
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,367
gets away with shooting
a school buddy,

462
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:33,001
you start taking out everybody
who walks through that door?

463
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,767
Quit projecting on this guy.

464
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,700
Uh, I would hardly say
Lloyd burned me.

465
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,634
And haven't you got a lawsuit
to lose?

466
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,867
Sounds like it's time to have
another talk with Mr. Basada.

467
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:45,201
I'd love to, but I got a legal
catastrophe on my hands here.

468
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:48,201
Dutch boy's gonna have to
screw this one up without me.

469
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:49,767
I guess I'm on my own?

470
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,567
I could use the diversion.

471
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,801
You okay?
What's wrong?

472
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,834
I just got a call
from rios.

473
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:02,333
He says he needs safe passage
out of the country

474
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,634
for himself and two others
late tonight.

475
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,500
Something big
must be going down today.

476
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,734
I haven't heard any lip-flapping
on the street.

477
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,767
I've been thinking
of turning myself in.

478
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:12,667
Deal with this the way that
I should've from the beginning.

479
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,801
You've done nothing
but try to protect your brother.

480
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:16,534
Don't worry.
I will keep you clear of this.

481
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,834
This is my litter box.

482
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,367
I'm not worried
about myself.

483
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:21,600
But why is it that people
like Pezuela walk around free

484
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:23,234
while you're
falling on your sword?

485
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,567
Because I don't have
any other options right now.

486
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:26,767
Because I did wrong.

487
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,201
You always have
other options.

488
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:33,767
Let's say you were gonna help
these guys with this task.

489
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,433
I'm not.

490
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,034
I'm just trying to figure out
a way to string them along,

491
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,333
buy us some time.

492
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,634
Time to do what?

493
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,834
If we can deliver rios
on something solid,

494
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,300
we can get him
to turn on Pezuela.

495
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,901
Whatever
they're planning today

496
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:47,567
sounds like
a perfect opportunity.

497
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:49,967
And if we don't figure out
what they're up to in time?

498
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:52,201
Vic, I can't have any more blood
on my hands.

499
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:53,567
We'll never let it come
to that.

500
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:55,300
Now, just call rios,

501
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,767
tell him that you're trying
to get his paperwork together.

502
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,034
Meanwhile, I'll find out

503
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:00,700
why he's in such a rush
to leave, okay?

504
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:03,567
Yeah.

505
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:07,201
I'm gonna take care of you
on this.

506
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:12,400
Señor rios.

507
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,300
You give lube jobs
dressed like that?

508
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,934
You have information
for me?

509
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,801
Witnesses made two of your boys
for the Robert Martin killing.

510
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,700
Same two guys who dragged
a couple of Salvadorans around

511
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,168
like tin cans on a limo.

512
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:25,767
Are these the same two guys
you plan on using

513
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,034
for our thing tonight?

514
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,967
Half the force is already
out looking for them.

515
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:32,034
Make sure
they can't be found.

516
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,367
They won't be.

517
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:35,367
How's your exit strategy
coming along?

518
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:37,234
How are your boys
skipping town?

519
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,667
That's not your concern.

520
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,201
With my badge on the line

521
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:42,634
and Pezuela about to be
my only paycheck,

522
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,567
you bet your ass
it's my concern.

523
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:46,367
Call has been made.

524
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,500
I'm not gonna do this dance
after every question.

525
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,734
How is it being handled?

526
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:53,367
I received confirmation that our
new identification is being drafted.

527
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:54,734
Satisfied?

528
00:22:54,801 --> 00:23:00,134
Be at the armo junkyard on
bradwell, little after 9:00.

529
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:01,667
Everyone will be there?

530
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,134
Everyone that counts.

531
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:05,500
You put one of them
in the ground...

532
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,433
you better make sure
you put them all there.

533
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:13,284
Anyone having better luck
than me finding these assholes?

534
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,917
South side door-to-door got me
nothing but blank stares.

535
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:17,984
Byz lats
are in the dark, too.

536
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:19,584
How'd the takedown go?

537
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,117
Asshole dad sent something
and almost canceled.

538
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:25,318
So I'm gonna have to push that
other thing a little bit later.

539
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:28,817
Uh, show me which locations
we have left to hit.

540
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:37,151
I don't think this other thing
can wait until later.

541
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:38,750
Why not?
You know the cholos, right?

542
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,151
Just tell them
to push an hour.

543
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,017
What if Rezian gets cold feet
because of these changes?

544
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:44,684
It's a couple of hours, man.

545
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,417
Which is it?
One hour or a couple of hours?

546
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:49,584
All right, fine.

547
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,984
I'll make sure
our Mexican proxies know

548
00:23:52,051 --> 00:23:53,784
the meeting has been pushed,

549
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:56,584
but make sure you and the armos
are there on time, okay?

550
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,750
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

551
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:01,117
Okay.

552
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:04,617
I was grabbing sophia,
not choking her.

553
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:06,051
I was asleep when I did it.

554
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:07,884
That's not what you told
your wife.

555
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:10,383
In fact, you told her you didn't
remember what you did.

556
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,218
I didn't know what was happening
at the time.

557
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,717
I was embarrassed.

558
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:16,318
Let's, uh... talk about your trip
to the convenience store

559
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:17,584
a month earlier.

560
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,750
I was asleep then, too.

561
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:22,450
I was. I swear.

562
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:24,084
I have a disorder.

563
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:26,151
It's called parasomnia,
Jeff.

564
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:28,383
And if you'd really had a problem
this severe these past six months,

565
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,884
I think you'd know what
the proper name for it was.

566
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,318
I wasn't really diagnosed.

567
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,984
And yet it's your excuse
for everything,

568
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:37,617
and yet you won't see
a doctor about it.

569
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,284
You're a recovering alcoholic,
Jeff.

570
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,151
You'd hurt someone
while drunk last night

571
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:42,717
and still be
accountable for it.

572
00:24:42,784 --> 00:24:44,617
It doesn't mean
that it isn't true.

573
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:45,717
It doesn't.

574
00:24:50,017 --> 00:24:52,851
You want to know
what I think?

575
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,151
I think the demise
of your marriage

576
00:24:55,218 --> 00:24:57,184
was making you
feel powerless.

577
00:24:57,251 --> 00:25:00,084
Being naked in public was a way
to get that power back.

578
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:04,951
In truth, you like making people
experience discomfort.

579
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:06,984
Most exhibitionists do.

580
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:09,784
That's the rush.
Until it doesn't work anymore.

581
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:12,584
You amp it up.

582
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,951
Attack someone.

583
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:16,350
I think you probably
got into some kinky sex.

584
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:19,084
That would account for
the rope burns on your wrist.

585
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,984
Only last night, things went
a little too far.

586
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:26,450
She got scared.

587
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:27,650
So you silenced her.

588
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:30,450
Unburden yourself, Jeff.

589
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:31,984
You did a bad thing.

590
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:34,184
Don't make it worse
by lying about it.

591
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:36,517
I'm not lying.

592
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:39,383
Just tell us
who the victim is.

593
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,851
I never...

594
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:45,584
I never meant to hurt
anybody.

595
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,051
I swear,
I'm not a bad person.

596
00:25:49,117 --> 00:25:54,650
Why don't you leave Mr. Basada
and me alone for a moment, Dutch?

597
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:58,483
I ran rios
through the database at I.c.E.

598
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,550
Yeah, there's nothing.

599
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:00,884
There was nothing.

600
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:02,984
But today, I ran him again,
and he was flagged.

601
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:05,017
They put him
on a federal watch list.

602
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:06,984
Bank accounts, travel,
and surveillance.

603
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:08,951
What kind of surveillance?

604
00:26:09,017 --> 00:26:12,984
Camera cops documenting his
whereabouts and contacts, 24/7.

605
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,383
Audio, too?

606
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,517
I don't know.

607
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:17,084
Vic, if he gets grabbed,

608
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:19,483
I'll be the first name
out of his mouth.

609
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,917
I need to turn myself in now
while I still have some control.

610
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:26,117
Turning yourself in might clear
your conscience for a few hours,

611
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,617
but it's not gonna stop
what rios has planned.

612
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:30,483
And if he thinks
you're a burden,

613
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,051
he's gonna disappear
for good.

614
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:34,584
I can arrange a meet
to give him the fake ids

615
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,917
and arrest him there.

616
00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:38,017
That way, I can turn myself in
with him.

617
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:40,817
You still could get him
red-handed, get you out clean.

618
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:45,318
What's done is done, Vic.
I'll never be clean of this.

619
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,550
Feds are running visual
surveillance on rios.

620
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:53,017
Could be audio, too.

621
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:54,417
Shit.

622
00:26:54,483 --> 00:26:56,483
Photos
of me and rios chatting

623
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,550
on the same day
this thing goes down?

624
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,650
It's gonna be hard
to deny involvement

625
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:02,483
when we arrest him
for the armo hit.

626
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,817
Do we call it off?

627
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:07,483
If letting rios and his shooters
slip through the cracks

628
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,750
means my family being safe,

629
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:10,417
that's worth
going through with it.

630
00:27:10,483 --> 00:27:12,584
It might delay us
getting Pezuela,

631
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,550
but at least we get Rezian
and his crew members

632
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,951
who knew about me
and the money train.

633
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:19,151
And shane, finally.

634
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:22,184
I'll call you.

635
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:26,318
Who told you this?

636
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:27,917
Believe me, it's solid.

637
00:27:27,984 --> 00:27:30,450
With the feds watching rios,
he's of no use to us.

638
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:32,350
Find a way
to get a message to him.

639
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,051
Tell him to stay clear
of that junkyard, too.

640
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:35,784
I'll have his men
do the job without him.

641
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:38,584
We have to assume that whatever exit
rios has planned was compromised.

642
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,350
Got to find another way
to get these guys out.

643
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:43,784
Understood.

644
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:47,017
You said earlier that you were
embarrassed to tell your wife

645
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,584
that you were asleep
when you tried choking her.

646
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,650
Why?

647
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:52,350
It's hard to explain.
Try me.

648
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,051
Well, it's disgusting.

649
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:58,117
That I did that
in my sleep...

650
00:27:58,184 --> 00:28:00,617
shows those feelings
actually exist some...

651
00:28:00,684 --> 00:28:01,650
somewhere in me.

652
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:02,917
It must be difficult.

653
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:05,817
That moment when you awoke...

654
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:10,417
and she said what you did
while subconscious,

655
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:14,851
I'm guessing that's a lot of
shame with that loss of control.

656
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:17,483
Must be tiring, too,
having to defend your actions

657
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,450
no matter how unacceptable
it may seem to other people.

658
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:27,650
I thou...
thought about hurting sophia.

659
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:30,517
I wanted
to make her pay for...

660
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,517
for trying to take
my daughter away.

661
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:34,984
That's understandable.

662
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:38,084
I know you must love
your daughter a great deal.

663
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:40,817
Who thinks that about...

664
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:43,417
about the mother
of their own child?

665
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:45,450
I thought about
other things, too.

666
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,650
I don't know why.

667
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:50,717
My brain just goes places.

668
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:52,251
Like where?

669
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:59,350
Remember that... story
about the football player

670
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,951
in the news last year?

671
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:03,350
He got in trouble
for dog fighting.

672
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:06,550
Put the female dogs in a box
to keep them trapped

673
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:09,750
so the male dogs could
have sex with them for breeding.

674
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:11,051
They called it
the rape stand.

675
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,483
I don't know why,
but I...

676
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,550
I couldn't stop thinking
about that.

677
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:17,184
I started to wonder

678
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:22,550
whether I could build
one of those for women.

679
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:26,184
I even made some sketches.

680
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,318
What normal person
would do that?

681
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:30,284
We can figure this out,
Jeff.

682
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,984
And...

683
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:37,084
whatever you have to tell me,
the faster we can resolve this,

684
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:40,884
can maybe even save whoever
you attacked last night.

685
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:42,318
I get these flashes.

686
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:47,450
Blond hair and... young,
I think.

687
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:49,851
I see her screaming.

688
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:51,750
I think
I wanted to kill her.

689
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:56,784
You're doing fine, cammy,
just fine.

690
00:29:56,851 --> 00:29:59,717
You got six cops
protecting you.

691
00:29:59,784 --> 00:30:01,184
I'm scared, shane.

692
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:03,817
Iook, you're not scared, baby.
You're brave.

693
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:05,383
Okay, this is almost over.

694
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,184
What time is it?

695
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:08,784
He's not due
for another 10 minutes,

696
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:11,817
but let's keep the chitchat down
in case he's early.

697
00:30:11,884 --> 00:30:13,350
You're good with her.

698
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,750
Hey, look,
I was wondering...

699
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:23,318
would you tell me
what happened that night?

700
00:30:26,851 --> 00:30:30,017
I thought Lem told you.

701
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:31,917
He did.

702
00:30:31,984 --> 00:30:34,350
It's just...

703
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:38,350
I-I've been replaying it
all in my mind all this time,

704
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:40,584
what I can remember,
at least,

705
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,251
and I just can't understand how
I'd do something like that.

706
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:47,617
We got a 16-year-old girl out
there who's scared to death.

707
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:51,017
Maybe this isn't the right time
for this, you know?

708
00:30:58,383 --> 00:31:00,717
Picked a bad day
to come out of hiding.

709
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:02,550
I need to tell her
I'm sorry.

710
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:04,884
Yeah, that should make it
all better, right?

711
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:07,550
You killed her mom,
two brothers.

712
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:11,151
You almost killed her.

713
00:31:11,218 --> 00:31:14,017
Promise me you'll tell her
I'm sorry.

714
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:16,650
Please.

715
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:19,117
I'm sure she knows I mean it.

716
00:31:19,184 --> 00:31:21,151
You know what, buddy?

717
00:31:21,218 --> 00:31:23,517
Sometimes it's too late
to apologize,

718
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:25,517
no matter how much
you mean it.

719
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:29,051
Now, do the right thing, Gary.
Confess to all of it.

720
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:30,917
Maybe I'll tell camille
you did that.

721
00:31:30,984 --> 00:31:34,251
Nice collar.

722
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:36,917
Yeah, old-style strike team,
right?

723
00:31:36,984 --> 00:31:38,817
Yeah, a long time coming.

724
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:40,117
I need a minute.

725
00:31:40,184 --> 00:31:41,717
Okay.

726
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:43,284
Good job.

727
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,051
Yeah, thanks.

728
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:48,517
Need that guy's booking slip.
His lawyer called.

729
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:54,884
Rezian get the money?

730
00:31:54,951 --> 00:31:56,284
As far as I know.

731
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,684
Okay, just... get there early
and make sure he stays calm.

732
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,817
I know what to do.

733
00:32:04,251 --> 00:32:06,450
I just want to make sure that
we don't miss out on a payday.

734
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:07,617
That's all.

735
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:09,884
You won't, man.

736
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:11,284
Okay?

737
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,167
Listen, I was wondering
if you'd be cool

738
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:25,167
with me stopping by
this weekend.

739
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,433
I'd really like
to apologize to Mara.

740
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,634
That's not necessary.
I'll pass it along.

741
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,700
Iook, shane, I'd really, really
like to talk to her in person.

742
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:35,101
I need to try to make some peace
with myself over all this.

743
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:36,667
Iook, I appreciate it, tavon,
really.

744
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:39,667
I just don't think that Mara
will be too comfortable with it,

745
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:40,800
man, honestly.

746
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:42,234
Yeah, sure.
Sure, I understand.

747
00:32:42,301 --> 00:32:43,734
I mean, hey.

748
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,567
After all, she might not have
her iron ready this time, right?

749
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,101
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

750
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,500
It's like I said, man.

751
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,101
I've been thinking about that
night for a long time now.

752
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,167
And I...

753
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:55,967
I could remember
almost everything...

754
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:58,167
everything
except for hitting Mara.

755
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:01,567
You want to know why I can't
remember that one thing, shane?

756
00:33:01,634 --> 00:33:04,700
Because it didn't happen.
Did it?

757
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,167
You must've gone through that
windshield harder than you thought.

758
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,301
You lied to me!

759
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:09,800
And then your ass used Lem
to cover it up

760
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,901
so you wouldn't get
in trouble.

761
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:13,934
And I'm guessing it wasn't
the first time

762
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,767
that you had these guys
cover your ass.

763
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,800
What's wrong?

764
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,734
Oh.

765
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,268
Oh, yeah.

766
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,101
Ain't got nobody here
to get your back.

767
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,667
But now I know
who you really are.

768
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:31,734
And so do you.

769
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,467
Hey.

770
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:44,067
Thought you were headed
to the junkyard.

771
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:45,667
I am.

772
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,268
I, uh...
I just forgot something.

773
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,734
Iook, you know what?

774
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,967
Um...

775
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:54,667
maybe I've been
looking at this thing

776
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:56,134
from my side
this whole time.

777
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,901
Maybe you guys
would be better off...

778
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,867
you know,
with a fresh start.

779
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:01,001
Without me around.

780
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:02,967
It's just that, uh...

781
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:05,101
I don't know
that we'll ever be able to put

782
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:07,234
all this shit behind us, man.

783
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,567
Really.

784
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:10,934
So, when this is done,
and your family's safe...

785
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:15,368
if you want me
to transfer out, I will.

786
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:17,634
You do what you need to do,
but...

787
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,634
Ronnie and me,
we got no ax to grind.

788
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,433
Okay.

789
00:34:25,368 --> 00:34:27,500
Okay, I'll, uh...

790
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:29,334
I'll see you
on the other side.

791
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,334
Can you believe the balls
on that guy?

792
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:43,101
Hey, superstar.
How's the canvassing going?

793
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:45,400
No one's seen these shooters
or even heard of these guys.

794
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:48,667
Splitting up
has gotten us nowhere.

795
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:50,001
The three of us should
roll together as a team.

796
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:52,667
See if we can shake things up
that way.

797
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:54,201
I wouldn't mind coming.

798
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,800
I'll see you there.

799
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,201
Hey, give me a minute?

800
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:10,034
You come to raid
the evidence locker?

801
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:11,400
Here.

802
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:14,600
I've only been taking them
for a week.

803
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,533
I just wanted
some peace of mind.

804
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,467
I'm exhausted, Vic.

805
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,967
And I know I am not doing
the best job

806
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:22,667
of handling all of this,

807
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:24,934
but it's the best
that I can do.

808
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:26,600
Those kids
mean everything to me,

809
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,901
and I don't care how many times
Cassidy screws up.

810
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:32,101
I will never give up on her.
Never.

811
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,834
So, please...

812
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:36,967
don't try to take them
away from me, please.

813
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:40,234
Corrine, I'm not gonna try
and take the kids from you.

814
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:42,234
How could you even
think that?

815
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:44,134
We need to figure out
a new plan?

816
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:45,433
I know you, Vic.

817
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,334
I don't have the energy
to raise these kids

818
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,800
while I'm fighting you, too.

819
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:50,800
I'm begging you.

820
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:53,500
You think my first move would be
to rip the kids from you?

821
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,101
That's who you think I am?

822
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,567
We both know who you are.

823
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:59,967
Just please don't dodo it.

824
00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:07,967
Victim is Fiona perski, 34.
Was found in a dumpster.

825
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:11,167
How far away
from where we found our guy?

826
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:12,734
A few miles.

827
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,967
He walked all the way without
anyone seeing his bare ass?

828
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,634
No, it just means
he knew what he was doing.

829
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,800
Drove away from the scene,
got undressed to sell his story.

830
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,767
Stabbed five times.

831
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:26,967
We're running some tests
on the blood.

832
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:30,467
But if you recognize her
as the woman you remember,

833
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:33,634
you'd be doing yourself a favor
by admitting it now.

834
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,268
Jeff, do you remember
what you did to her?

835
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:42,034
I'd like to call a lawyer,
please.

836
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,567
We got to stall
about five more minutes.

837
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:53,634
We got to pull shane
out of there, man.

838
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,967
What?
I can't do this.

839
00:36:56,034 --> 00:36:58,600
Vic, it's done.
It's all set up.

840
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,867
We're never gonna get another
chance this clean.

841
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,167
I don't care!

842
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:05,034
It's not too late.
We still have a choice.

843
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:08,500
Do you think
that shane gave Lem a choice?

844
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:12,167
I'm not shane.

845
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:23,867
Don't answer that.

846
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,134
This'll just take a second.

847
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,167
Hello?

848
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:28,134
Hey, baby.

849
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:29,700
Can you do me a favor?

850
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,268
Now's not the best time.
Can I call you back later?

851
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,567
I just need you to stop by
the pharmacy

852
00:37:34,634 --> 00:37:37,134
and pick up Jackson's prescription
on the way home tonight.

853
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,134
Yeah, sure, honey.

854
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:40,734
I got to go.
I'm getting another call, okay?

855
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,067
Okay. Bye.

856
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:45,567
I said no phones,
no distractions.

857
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:46,867
Give it to him
or we're leaving.

858
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,834
I see any calls to Armenia,
I'm coming after you.

859
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:57,567
Hey, there, it's shane.
Leave a message.

860
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,634
Something's wrong.

861
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,101
Shane should be answering
his phone.

862
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,034
Hey, Ronnie, didn't, uh...

863
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:06,334
didn't shane tell you

864
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,867
he was gonna be seeing
the armenians today?

865
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,934
Yeah, I think so.

866
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:11,800
Did he say where?

867
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,600
No. No idea.

868
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:18,734
Maybe we should roll by
little Armenia anyway,

869
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,934
see if we get lucky.

870
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:21,301
Captain was pretty clear

871
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:23,234
about wanting us to stay on task
with the shooters.

872
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,234
Shane should be
answering his phone.

873
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:27,368
Plenty of reasons
he might not be.

874
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:29,767
We're looking out
for one of our own.

875
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:31,334
I'm not gonna sit back

876
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,334
while a team member falls
off the map in a red zone.

877
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:45,134
This is taking too long.

878
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:46,734
You trust this seller
of yours?

879
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,500
If Vic says it's solid,
it's solid.

880
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:52,368
Trust me. We want this over
as much as you do.

881
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:54,700
You know what?

882
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,368
I'll take a look around.

883
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:59,134
He's still not answering.

884
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:00,867
Can we pick up the pace
a little bit?

885
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:02,767
One tango 13...

886
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:06,767
shots fired in the area
of 5959 bradwell avenue.

887
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:08,667
Isn't the armo junkyard
right around there?

888
00:40:08,734 --> 00:40:09,734
No further.

889
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,767
Code 2.

890
00:40:40,034 --> 00:40:41,734
Anyone else?

891
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,034
We just got here.

892
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:02,301
Shane.

893
00:41:02,368 --> 00:41:03,634
Sorry, I'm late.

894
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,067
I, uh... forgot to sign
tavon's arrest report.

895
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:07,967
Had to... stop by Hollywood.

896
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,967
No problem.
I'm just glad you're here.

897
00:41:14,034 --> 00:41:15,634
Where the hell did you get
those Mexicans, man?

898
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,901
I almost got
my dick shot off.

899
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:19,467
I just got some late intel.
I tried to call you.

900
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:22,134
Yeah, Rezian
took my cellphone.

901
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:24,433
Jesus Christ, shane.
Thank God.

902
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,867
Yeah, no shit.
I'm still shaking.

903
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:30,234
I don't see any money.

904
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:32,800
Iooks like our Armenian
problem's solved, though.

905
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:35,201
At least your family's safe.

906
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:46,834
Found a victim
for our naked guy.

907
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:48,600
We already got her.

908
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:50,234
Captain's working on
a confession now.

909
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,967
No, the mission cross
just called.

910
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,900
Says they have a blood match
for a girl.

911
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:55,967
Says she had a run-in
with a naked man

912
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,834
after leaving a bar
late last night.

913
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,534
I had
a few too many maitais.

914
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,000
I felt sick,

915
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:03,800
and my friend took me outside
to get some fresh air.

916
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:05,434
But I tripped on the curb,

917
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:08,067
and I smacked my head
into a fire hydrant.

918
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:10,468
Suddenly, he just came
running up to us.

919
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:11,967
Did he say anything to you?

920
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:13,201
He just stood over me.

921
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:15,201
He kept grabbing on my arms
to pull me up.

922
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,934
He was, like, naked.

923
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,767
So, I mean,
he was a freak.

924
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:23,468
I just shoved him off me,
and I ran back to the bar.

925
00:42:23,534 --> 00:42:26,534
Did he try to assault you at all
or act inappropriately?

926
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,967
No.
He just gave me the creeps.

927
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:38,568
Officer!

928
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:41,101
Help me open this door,
please.

929
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:51,234
Oh, shit.

930
00:42:54,568 --> 00:42:56,667
Call an ambulance!

931
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:14,301
Vic.

932
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:16,000
Didn't want to wake you.

933
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:17,834
You didn't.
What's wrong?

934
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,134
I just wanted to come by
and tell you, uh...

935
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:22,967
you're safe now.

936
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:25,134
I, uh... I let Carlson go.

937
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:26,468
It's all over.

938
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:29,334
It's just you and the kids.
Nothing to worry about.

939
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,134
Really?

940
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:33,468
Get some sleep, Corrine.
You've earned it.

941
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:42,767
So the city is countersuing

942
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:44,834
against my pursuing
legal recourse

943
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,633
for getting hurt
on the job.

944
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,401
Negligent lawsuit
or some bullshit.

945
00:43:48,468 --> 00:43:49,633
And then my bitch-dyke lawyer
won't take the case

946
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,334
without a retainer,

947
00:43:51,401 --> 00:43:53,867
but I can't afford the retainer
without winning the case.

948
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,201
Nice legal system, huh?

949
00:43:55,267 --> 00:43:56,501
You gonna eat that?

950
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:59,201
You know, Steve,
someone died here tonight.

951
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:01,600
Yeah, well,
the guy sounded like a nut job.

952
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:04,067
Maybe, but I missed it.

953
00:44:04,134 --> 00:44:06,167
I couldn't close Lloyd,
either.

954
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:09,267
Having a bad month.
Happens to the best of us.

955
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:12,568
I did my best work when
Claudette was my partner...

956
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:16,234
because she challenged
my assumptions.

957
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:18,568
Forced me
to prove my theories.

958
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,900
For better or worse,
you are my partner now.

959
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:28,267
And I need the help.

960
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,534
Okay?

961
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,934
Yeah.

962
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Sure.

963
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,733
Hey.

964
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,334
You okay?

965
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:50,800
Someone
should call the wife.

966
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:52,067
Tina put in a call.

967
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:55,900
Maybe we should, uh...
talk about what happened.

968
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:59,468
I'm going home, Dutch.

969
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,767
Where you been?

970
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:35,434
I been looking for a place
to hide $100,000

971
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:37,600
where Vic won't find it.

972
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,401
$100,000?

973
00:45:39,468 --> 00:45:40,900
My God.

974
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:45,067
Where'd it come from?

975
00:45:45,134 --> 00:45:47,501
It's a consolation prize.

976
00:45:47,568 --> 00:45:49,401
For what?

977
00:45:49,468 --> 00:45:52,367
Vic and Ronnie
tried to kill me tonight.

978
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:53,834
What?

979
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,201
Yeah.

980
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:00,201
Are you sure?

981
00:46:00,267 --> 00:46:05,301
Yeah, they set me up.

982
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:09,600
It's sheer luck
I'm even alive right now.

983
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:13,434
And, you know...

984
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:20,034
you know
what the worst part is?

985
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:26,834
Is they think I'm too stupid
to even realize it.

986
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,900
Welcome to www.1000fr.com
