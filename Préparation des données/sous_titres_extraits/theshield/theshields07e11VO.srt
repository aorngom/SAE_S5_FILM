1
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:03,258
Previously on "the shield"...
Guillermo Beltran...

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:04,968
the Guerrero drug cartel
head of security.

3
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:07,023
You heard Vic turned in
his badge yesterday?

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,838
That leaves me to be
your most important instrument

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,038
in the Guerrero cartel
investigation.

6
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:14,338
We're not sure you're valuable
to this investigation.

7
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:17,538
Just give me some time to get
cozied up to this Beltran guy.

8
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:18,704
You want to prove yourself
to me?

9
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:20,804
I never want to see
Pezuela again.

10
00:00:21,172 --> 00:00:22,004
Beltran sent me
to kill you.

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,105
Lucky for you,
I work for Olivia Murray.

12
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:26,271
I'm gonna need you
to give me back her file

13
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:28,038
before I can bring you in.

14
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:30,271
We have to convince Beltran
that I took out Pezuela.

15
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:32,371
A colleague of yours
committed suicide tonight.

16
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:35,004
That means there'll be a hole
in your organization.

17
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:36,238
Where do I submit
an application?

18
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:39,405
Shane Vendrell hired you
to kill Gardocki?

19
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,538
Why does Vendrell
want you dead?

20
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:44,205
Vic thinks that Shane was
waiting at his place last night.

21
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:46,771
There's a reward waiting
for anyone who can deliver him.

22
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,238
Your cop buddy's paying 10 g's
for your head, ese.

23
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:50,771
You got almost 100 grand
in there.

24
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:52,405
That's more than enough
to keep walking.

25
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:54,771
As punishment for the
shit you tried to pull today,

26
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:57,038
there is a written confession
of one of your many sins

27
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:59,171
on its way to the Barn,
addressed to claduette Wyms.

28
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:01,771
Since you caused us
to lose all of our cash today,

29
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,171
you're gonna replace it.

30
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:05,298
We got to figure out a way
to put a hundred grand

31
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,405
- in Shane's hands by tomorrow afternoon.
- I'm gonna run.

32
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:09,338
Give me one last shot.

33
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:11,737
If I fail,
we'll both run.

34
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:12,904
Mara,
this is Claudette Wyms.

35
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:15,472
All I want from this
is Vic Mackey.

36
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,238
Corrine's working
with the police.

37
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:34,505
Think Mara
changed her mind?

38
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,171
Does anyone want
any coffee?

39
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:38,438
Uh, thanks, but no.

40
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:49,105
Hello.

41
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:50,343
Put on Claudette.

42
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:52,261
She wants to talk to you.

43
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:54,889
I'm glad you called.

44
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,849
My husband's given Vic
a 5:00 deadline

45
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:59,518
to come up with $100,000.

46
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,853
Okay.

47
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:03,522
Corrine is supposed to hand
the money to Shane

48
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,271
by the fountain
in Hollenbeck park.

49
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:08,138
I appreciate you
working with us.

50
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:09,653
Promise Shane won't
get hurt.

51
00:02:09,938 --> 00:02:11,338
I promise.

52
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,771
'Cause I know how some suspects
wind up dead getting booked.

53
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:18,438
You are going to make sure
that every cop in that park

54
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,771
understands that Shane
going after Vic and Ronnie

55
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:23,138
was self-defense.

56
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:25,920
So, he'll cooperate
with us?

57
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,704
I can get him to cooperate.

58
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,538
But he's gonna have to
get something in exchange.

59
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:33,305
I'll do everything I can.
That's not good enough.

60
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,763
You need to guarantee
that he'll get a light sentence.

61
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:39,600
Otherwise, I will blow this
whole thing out of the water!

62
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:46,505
I will work it out
with the D.A.

63
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:48,572
Just make sure
he's treated okay.

64
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:56,909
That's beautiful.

65
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:58,405
That was beautiful, baby.

66
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,604
We just walked Vic and a bag
of dirty money into a bust.

67
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,938
We never have to worry

68
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:06,438
about that prick coming after us
ever again.

69
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,804
The only problem
with getting Vic arrested

70
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:11,371
is that we lose any leverage
to negotiate a deal

71
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:12,771
if we ever get caught.

72
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:14,572
Well, that's why we absolutely
can't get caught,

73
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,071
'cause I'm not going
to prison.

74
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,739
And I'm sure as hell not
gonna let you end up there.

75
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:22,771
When Vic makes contact
with you,

76
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:25,171
you're hearing all this
for the first time.

77
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:27,105
You go along with it
reluctantly.

78
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:28,604
Don't sign on too easily.

79
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:30,538
Believe me,
having a problem with all this

80
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:31,737
won't be a stretch.

81
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:33,704
I don't want you wired
for your initial meet.

82
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:35,438
Vic's a master
at smelling a setup.

83
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:36,971
But when he hands over
that money,

84
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:38,338
we'll be recording it.

85
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,911
How does Vic not figure out
that I set him up?

86
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,472
We'll play as if he's been
under surveillance for a while.

87
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,671
We'll go
through the motions

88
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:47,543
of arresting you
to sell your cover.

89
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:49,305
I don't like this.

90
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:52,305
I mean, what if Vic finds out or
something goes wrong with Shane?

91
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:54,004
We will take
every precaution.

92
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:56,138
You came to us
to get Vic out of your life,

93
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:57,904
to close the book on him
forever.

94
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,438
Let's do that.

95
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:03,171
How does somebody
get witness protection?

96
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:06,305
You'll have to testify.

97
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:07,838
That's not gonna happen.

98
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:09,838
Like I said,
Vic can never find out

99
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:11,637
that I helped put him in prison.

100
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:12,904
It's his own doing.

101
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:18,491
Then why do I still feel ashamed
about this?

102
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,238
Little overdressed
for your paper route.

103
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:26,904
Pezuela's grieving widow.

104
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,438
Obit mourns "an international
business guru's tragic suicide."

105
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:31,971
His shrink should be sued

106
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,704
for not recognizing
the seven warning signs.

107
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:36,509
Only Pezuela wasn't
suicidal.

108
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:38,538
Oh, it just goes
to show you...

109
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:41,737
you never really know what's
going on inside someone's head.

110
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:43,938
Suicide my ass.
Beltran had him whacked.

111
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:46,871
The only question is whether
or not he used you to do it.

112
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,704
Hey, whoa, you're giving me

113
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,238
a hell of a lot
of credit there, Dave.

114
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:53,438
Olivia's not returning
any of my phone calls.

115
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:55,904
Now you drop a body
in the middle of my campaign?

116
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:58,737
Well, you were the last one seen
mud wrestling with Pezuela.

117
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:01,071
You're not screwing up
my investigation

118
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:04,305
and costing me the mayor's job
with one last scandal, Vic.

119
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:07,804
Nice to know that justice is
still your number-one priority.

120
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:18,004
Hello.

121
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:20,671
Corrine, I need to see you
A.S.A.P. It's important.

122
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:22,871
I'm on my way to work, Vic.
What's up?

123
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:24,771
It's not something I can
get into over the phone.

124
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:25,904
Can you take
a personal day?

125
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,171
What's wrong, Vic?

126
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,505
Meet me by the fountain
in Hollenbeck park.

127
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:31,871
How soon can you be there?

128
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:35,205
Vic, this is crazy.

129
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:36,771
It's gonna be fine.

130
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:38,538
Just meet me here
at 5:00.

131
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,971
And you're gonna give me
a bagful of money

132
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:43,205
to give to the guy
who tried to kill you.

133
00:05:43,372 --> 00:05:45,305
So Shane can take his wife
and his kid

134
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:48,171
and this whole Vendrell
shitstorm out of the country.

135
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:49,938
What if he tries
to hurt me?

136
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:53,138
He saved you once
from the armenians.

137
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,796
It's me he wants to hurt,
not you.

138
00:05:57,938 --> 00:06:00,838
Maybe we shouldn't
do this, Vic.

139
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,572
When Shane calls,

140
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:05,971
tell him he's on his own
or blame it on me.

141
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:07,405
I...

142
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:10,771
I just need you to do
this one last favor for me.

143
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:25,005
You certainly
caught yourself a break...

144
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:28,238
Pezuela's narrow-mindedness
being cremated

145
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:29,771
along with the rest
of him.

146
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:31,071
Narrow-minded how?

147
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:35,971
I can understand him
being down with la raza,

148
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,338
but 40% of the drug trade
in this city

149
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:40,171
is black-owned
and -operated.

150
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:42,472
Never could
get that prick interested

151
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,038
in affirmative action.

152
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,737
Our experience with the blacks
in phoenix, San diego

153
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:47,971
has never been good.

154
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:50,472
Well, that's because
you don't have a trade rep

155
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,771
fluent in the culture,

156
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:54,138
and that's costing you
market share.

157
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:56,138
You would be
an upgrade, huh?

158
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:58,138
A white cop
who's made a career

159
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,737
cracking the heads
of low-level gangbangers.

160
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:03,138
You would be surprised
at how much sense

161
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:06,205
I've knocked into some
of those heads over the years.

162
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:08,505
If I was interested...

163
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,105
well, then,
I'd set up a meet and greet

164
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,904
with you and the black board
of directors,

165
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:14,704
offer to become
their exclusive supplier

166
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:16,871
below current
wholesale cost.

167
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,138
Year or two,
you'd have a monopoly.

168
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:21,938
I don't meet and greet.

169
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:26,105
Sure, want to minimize your
exposure to law enforcement.

170
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:31,205
I'd be happy to take
the meeting, negotiate terms.

171
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:36,138
I would need
a substantial security deposit

172
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:39,038
from the blacks
as a show of good faith.

173
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:41,105
Of course.

174
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:43,271
What you need, Mackey?

175
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:47,505
Well, back in the day,
we had an understanding.

176
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,971
We did?
I don't recall that far back.

177
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,904
Just two dinosaurs
sitting down now.

178
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:57,071
I need to arrange a meet
with your board of directors.

179
00:07:57,238 --> 00:07:59,004
I got
a business opportunity.

180
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:01,438
Business? What do you know
about our business?

181
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:04,305
You and your five-o crew
only swarm on the street level.

182
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:06,171
Thought it was about time

183
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,771
I started using
my entrepreneurial skills...

184
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:10,604
go to work
for the other side.

185
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:13,105
Mm-hmm, so, you come to me
and the board with this

186
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:17,338
'cause Vic Mackey is all about
the black man rising?

187
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:20,171
I don't give a shit
about the black man.

188
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:22,038
I'm just looking to earn.

189
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,671
I'm guessing that's
the first honest thing

190
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,038
you've said in a month.

191
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:31,004
I'm gonna need to think on this
for a minute.

192
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:33,538
Beltran's still
taking my temperature,

193
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:35,105
but he'll come around.

194
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:37,472
The goal is getting him
to trust you to the point

195
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,938
where you have access
to the cartel's inner workings.

196
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:41,971
Has he mentioned
any illegal dealings yet?

197
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:44,771
He's still
playing it quiet.

198
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:46,472
Pezuela
give you anything?

199
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,271
Besides attitude?
He's an uncooperative shithead.

200
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:51,438
No worries...
only a matter of time

201
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:53,804
before I know everything
he knows and more.

202
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:55,171
I hope that includes

203
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:57,171
what he did with
the blackmail box and my file.

204
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:59,338
I turned his world upside down
looking for it,

205
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,271
and still no luck.

206
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:04,338
Good news is,
with Pezuela in custody,

207
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,938
he can't get to it
to use it against you.

208
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:09,538
It doesn't mean
somebody else won't.

209
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:11,305
Iook, I got two jobs...

210
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,804
gathering enough intel
against Beltran and the cartel

211
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,505
to deliver I.C.E.
Their biggest bust to date

212
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:18,971
and cover your ass
by finding that file.

213
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:21,138
I intend to come through
on both.

214
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:25,472
Yeah.

215
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,105
Meet is on.

216
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:30,938
72 pine bluff, inglewood.

217
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:32,804
2:00 P.M.
That was quick.

218
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,305
What you think, man?

219
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:37,272
Men's jail is headquarters,
baby.

220
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:48,804
Something you need?

221
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:52,038
This new guy handing out
the mail must be dyslexic.

222
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,904
They keep
mixing up our mail.

223
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,271
When's Danny coming back?

224
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:56,472
Unis responded
to a shooting.

225
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,121
Victim pronounced
at the scene.

226
00:09:58,457 --> 00:10:00,004
Steve!
Need you, too!

227
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:02,271
Kid's name
is Cardell Rhodes,

228
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:04,538
gunned down
outside his house.

229
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:05,971
Cardell Rhodes?
The football player?

230
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,505
You know him?

231
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:09,338
Yeah, coached him in
pop Warner. I'm sorry.

232
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:11,604
I need you and Steve
to get on over there.

233
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,238
But I thought I was still supposed
to be riding a desk? Well, not today.

234
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,071
I've got everyone available
sweeping the streets

235
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:17,704
ahead
of the presidential motorcade.

236
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:19,771
Stash houses, dealers,
hookers, the whole nine.

237
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:21,971
Well, much as I want out
of my forced detention,

238
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,205
Julien's history with the kid
gives him a leg up here.

239
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:25,505
You're right.
Go with Ronnie.

240
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:27,771
What's up?
Uh, never mind.

241
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:29,671
There was another victim,
minor injuries...

242
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,938
he was treated
at the scene.

243
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:32,338
I'm going back
to my crosswords.

244
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:35,704
I'll meet you outside.

245
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:39,305
Hey, Steve. Steve.
I need you to do me a solid.

246
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,138
I took a bedroom tumble
with a woman on the force.

247
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:45,472
She found out she's not the only
teeter-totter on the playground,

248
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,737
got pissed,

249
00:10:46,904 --> 00:10:47,938
now she's trying
to jam me up with Claudette.

250
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,405
This chick wrote a letter
to Claudette

251
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:52,138
laying the whole thing out.

252
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:54,071
Should stand out as personal.

253
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,338
I've been trying
to intercept it,

254
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:56,671
but now I got to work this case
with Julien.

255
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:59,071
You know, Ron, you and me,
we've had our friction.

256
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:00,637
But in a world
of crazy coozes,

257
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,171
trust me,
I got your back.

258
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:04,904
That poison pantygram
won't hit Claudette's desk.

259
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:06,238
Thanks, man.

260
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,704
First mail delivery came in...
nothing.

261
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:15,171
Shit.

262
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:17,105
Might not come until
this afternoon, maybe tomorrow.

263
00:11:17,272 --> 00:11:19,238
Or maybe not at all. He could
just be screwing with us.

264
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:20,538
Ah, we can't
take that chance.

265
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,737
Good news is,
you're trapped at the Barn.

266
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:25,604
Was. Claudette just put me
on a 187 with Julien.

267
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:26,572
You can't bail?

268
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:28,838
Believe me, I tried.

269
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,238
How's that other thing
going?

270
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,238
One minute.
One minute.

271
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,305
I think I see a play
with the cartel.

272
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:35,438
More on that later.

273
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:36,804
That sounds kind of iffy.

274
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:39,538
I don't do "if."
I'm only about "when."

275
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:41,472
Hey, wake up.

276
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:57,671
All right, I put something
over here for safekeeping.

277
00:11:57,838 --> 00:11:59,472
You all know
what I'm talking about.

278
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,804
Now, where the hell is it?

279
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,205
Huh?

280
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:07,871
You think your quality
of life sucks now?

281
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:09,704
You wait till I get done
with you.

282
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:11,572
Now, where's my gun?

283
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:14,338
Huh?

284
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:25,771
Hey, dog's ass!

285
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:28,138
I got to talk to you.

286
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:29,938
Think pink
while you can, hero.

287
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:34,838
You die now amongst the
righteous and the urine savior.

288
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:41,038
It's not loaded, pigpen.

289
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:44,938
I've arranged
the trade summit...

290
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:46,305
all the Senior management.

291
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:48,737
Just need to know
how much weight you can provide.

292
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:50,737
It's a tempting opportunity

293
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,238
to eliminate the competition
in one fell swoop.

294
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,637
Absorbing them into
your corporate structure

295
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:57,871
means less waves,
more profit.

296
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:00,038
Pezuela was here for how long

297
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:02,305
and he never moved
past the byz lat level?

298
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:04,505
Pezuela.

299
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:06,305
Pezuela
was a waste of clothes.

300
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:08,971
But he did manage
to renovate this place

301
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:12,038
and build a few others
to store our product...

302
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:14,604
over budget
and behind schedule.

303
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:18,305
You're gonna fill
this whole place with drugs?

304
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:21,804
The blacks...
they understand the terms?

305
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:22,838
They will.

306
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:25,305
Disagreeable people.

307
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,071
Well, they've gone through
some shit over the years.

308
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:31,871
I'm gonna be walking
into an adversarial situation.

309
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:34,405
You got a few guys
I can borrow?

310
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:35,804
You forget, huh?

311
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:38,238
My background
is professional military.

312
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:43,071
Cardell and I are talking,

313
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,904
he dives on top of me,
pulls me down.

314
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:47,171
Then I hear gunshots.
Kid saved my life.

315
00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:48,438
How'd you know Cardell?

316
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:50,171
I'm out here
on a recruiting trip.

317
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:53,038
Cardell was my prize get...
had him all but committed.

318
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:55,472
He was on his way to a heisman,
had a special talent.

319
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,472
Yeah, his field vision
was one of a kind.

320
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,472
That kid had eyes
in the back of his head.

321
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,971
I coached him
a while back.

322
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:03,004
You guys vet these kids
pretty thoroughly.

323
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:04,671
Any problems
in his personal life?

324
00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:06,205
Enemies?
Look around.

325
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:09,071
Shit you have to put up with
to get a bcs bid...

326
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:10,671
take a banger to brunch.

327
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:13,138
- Rhodes was affiliated?
- No way.

328
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:14,604
I had to get permission
from the shot caller

329
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,739
just to get a sit-down
with the kid.

330
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:18,205
I'll talk to his mother.

331
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:24,338
He was a child of God.

332
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:26,904
But I don't
have to tell you that.

333
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,405
You knew my baby.

334
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:32,804
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

335
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:36,838
Why would
anyone want to hurt my baby?

336
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:42,238
No!

337
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:52,004
Hard to understand
why the good lord

338
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,338
would let something
like this happen.

339
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:56,804
I see it every day,
all day.

340
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:58,671
Tests my faith,
believe me.

341
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:01,737
Mister,
faith is all we got.

342
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:04,904
I lost my son
last year, too.

343
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,904
He was killed
in a drive-by.

344
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:08,338
Sorry to hear that.

345
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,472
So, they're saying
that all this happened

346
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,904
because Cardell was
running around with a gang.

347
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:14,704
You think that's what
this is about?

348
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,038
No.

349
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,938
Here's my card.

350
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:20,272
If you hear anything,
give me a call.

351
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:29,338
Recruiter says Cardell
was repping acorn park.

352
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:31,572
How in the hell does he know
what goes on around here?

353
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:33,038
Well, you heard him.

354
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,205
He had to have a sit-down with
o.g. S just to talk to Cardell.

355
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:37,572
That wasn't Cardell.
I knew him.

356
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:38,938
I get your history
with the kid,

357
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,871
but we got to look
at everything.

358
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:42,505
That kid was the closest
thing to a hero

359
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:43,938
this neighborhood ever had.

360
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:45,704
And nothing would make me
happier than to be proved wrong.

361
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:46,838
Let's chat
with the warring factions.

362
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:48,804
You get with acorn park,

363
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:51,505
and I'll discourse
with spook street.

364
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:53,637
You're using
the I.C.E. Sting on Beltran

365
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:55,671
to scam 100 grand
off of Beenie Spears' guys?

366
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:57,138
Hail Mary,

367
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:59,371
but I don't know how else
to come up with the money

368
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,171
to buy off Shane,
given the time frame.

369
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:03,338
Playing both sides like this
is crazy dangerous.

370
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,704
How long before Beltran
or the board

371
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:05,871
figure out
they're getting jacked

372
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:07,572
and this thing goes nuclear?

373
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:10,505
I only need to keep it together
a couple of days...

374
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:12,771
enough time
to get Shane ghost,

375
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,438
walk Beltran into a jackpot
so I.C.E. Can take him down

376
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:19,271
in exchange for giving us
an overall deal and immunity.

377
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,704
Jesus.

378
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,704
I got Billings
back at the Barn

379
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:25,438
intercepting Shane's letter...
nut-job plan.

380
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:27,737
The wheels are coming off
the whole goddamn thing.

381
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,871
I'm on the way
to this fund-raiser.

382
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:32,737
I could really use some backup
that speaks inglés.

383
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:36,737
Can't. Claudette's got me
hip-deep in some shit.

384
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:38,105
Okay, no worries.

385
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:44,739
God damn it.

386
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,305
You know, you don't have to be
on the stakeout

387
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:50,704
if you're not feeling
up to it.

388
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:52,472
If you have
to take me there

389
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,771
on a damn stretcher
with I.V. S running,

390
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:57,838
I'll be there to take down
Vic Mackey and Shane Vendrell.

391
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:01,938
You need help
finding something?

392
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,938
I'm looking for my medicine.
It was here a minute ago.

393
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:06,705
Um, is this it?

394
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:12,637
Take it easy.

395
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:15,004
How's Vic
gonna get the money?

396
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:16,639
Somebody could get hurt
or worse.

397
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,271
You wanted me?

398
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:23,438
Vic been in communication
with Ronnie at all today?

399
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:27,071
Ronnie's gotten a couple
of calls. Don't know who.

400
00:17:31,272 --> 00:17:33,271
We're moving on intel
that we're pretty convinced

401
00:17:33,438 --> 00:17:34,637
will give us Shane Vendrell.

402
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,371
We have reason to believe

403
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:38,205
we're gonna be making
another arrest...

404
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:41,004
Vic Mackey
for aiding and abetting.

405
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:43,572
If you're free
of the other case,

406
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:44,771
I'd like you involved.

407
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:50,405
I'll make myself available.
Just let me know when.

408
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:51,871
I just want to give you
a heads-up

409
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,637
so that you could
mentally prepare yourself

410
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:55,538
to throw bracelets
on your former colleagues.

411
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,405
Also, Ronnie and Vic
might be planning something.

412
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:58,405
We don't know what.

413
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:00,305
They were your teammates.

414
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:03,038
It's pick-a-side time.

415
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:05,371
If I get wind of anything,
you'll be the first to know.

416
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:09,004
Good. I'm also borrowing backup
from rampart.

417
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,671
I'd like you to take point.

418
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:12,637
Is any of this
gonna be a problem?

419
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:14,572
Not at all.

420
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,271
Changing suppliers
benefits us how?

421
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:22,637
Lower cost,
unlimited supply,

422
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:25,604
highest-quality product
on the market.

423
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,438
We've been
with the same wholesaler

424
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,438
since before
you had a cowlick.

425
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:37,305
This meth came
from pure Mexican ephedra,

426
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:40,238
cooked up
in a state-of-the-art laboratory

427
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:43,138
by a team
of PhD chemists.

428
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,538
Clean
as a virgin's whistle hole.

429
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:49,038
And a lot cheaper than the shit
that you're getting.

430
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:52,705
You sure you want an undercut
on your price on the street?

431
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:57,071
We pass.

432
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:59,838
But you haven't even, uh,
sampled the blow.

433
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,938
We got love for Beenie.

434
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:04,737
Only took this meeting
as a courtesy to him.

435
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:07,371
We got too much history
with our connect

436
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:09,472
to just go astray
for some cop...

437
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,405
a peckerwood cop at that.

438
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:16,938
I lay out a proposal

439
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:20,271
with enormous financial upside
to you people

440
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:22,938
and you just dismiss it
out of hand?

441
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,038
Why don't you take a look
outside that window?

442
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:30,338
That's what's in your future.

443
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,238
I asked my boss
for a little backup today.

444
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,038
That's what he sent.

445
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:39,971
Your spik boss wants
to throw down, bring it.

446
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,405
'Cause I see two trucks eight
deep with Mexican gardeners.

447
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:45,171
They hear a shot out there,

448
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:47,405
there'll be an rpg
in this living room

449
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:48,771
before I hit the floor.

450
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,438
Put that shit away.

451
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:57,405
Let me tell you
about the landscaping job

452
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:58,971
those gardeners did.

453
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,671
In rosarito beach, Mexico,
last year,

454
00:20:01,838 --> 00:20:05,438
them and a convoy of amigos
rolled up on a police station,

455
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,572
murdered everyone inside.

456
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:12,538
47 people...
cops, dispatchers, janitors.

457
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:15,704
That was my, uh, spik boss' plan

458
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:17,971
for gaining market share
in the area.

459
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:21,271
Now, if they're willing to do
that to their own countrymen,

460
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:22,971
imagine what
they're willing to do

461
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:27,238
to a handful of, uh,
stubborn soul brothers.

462
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:34,138
And you think I'm a peckerwood.

463
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:38,505
This ain't no proposal.
This is a gank and grab.

464
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,604
I'm just trying
to increase the peace

465
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:44,671
and promote racial harmony
through economic opportunity.

466
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:47,038
Buy-in's 200 large.

467
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:51,691
I can wait if you need
to run to the atm.

468
00:20:58,238 --> 00:20:59,238
Jefe.

469
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:01,000
Wrong way.

470
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:03,044
Señor Beltran's
in the other direction.

471
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:05,238
I'll catch up to you.
I got an errand to run.

472
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:06,255
No, jefe.

473
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:09,342
Our instructions are
to be your seguridad.

474
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:11,438
We got to get the money back
to Beltran right now.

475
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,553
He's waiting.

476
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,055
Oh, shit.

477
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:17,391
Uh, I'm gonna need
some gas...

478
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,227
gasolina.

479
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:57,372
Yeah?

480
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,038
Code red...
third and alvarado.

481
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:02,472
Gas station, men's room,
trash can... there's a package.

482
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:03,804
You know what to do.

483
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:05,537
Highest priority.

484
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,192
Oh, you get your ass over here

485
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:10,438
as fast as you can,
and I mean soon.

486
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:12,971
All right, sweetheart,
daddy has to work late.

487
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:15,105
I'll see you later, okay?
Love you.

488
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,995
Kids are terrific, huh?
You got any?

489
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:21,138
Sí. Cinco.

490
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:24,709
Vanbro!

491
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:27,604
Yo, docki, my man.
What's good?

492
00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:29,088
What's up, black?

493
00:22:29,405 --> 00:22:31,704
Hey, I heard what happened
to the strike team, man.

494
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:33,738
I guess you must be
the last cat standing.

495
00:22:33,905 --> 00:22:35,219
Upright and breathing.

496
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:37,005
You signify your own path,
you won't get caught up

497
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:38,637
in other folks' bullshit
and tribulation.

498
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:40,138
That's how I do.

499
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:43,604
And look at me, standing strong
and doing the damn thing.

500
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:46,738
But, vanbro, what is up with this? Huh?

501
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:48,271
You used to have talent.

502
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:51,235
Hey, that's nonrepresentational
art right there.

503
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,696
It worked for basquiat.
It'll work for vanbro.

504
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:55,938
Take it. Nah, nah. We
just want information.

505
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:57,305
Suit yourself.

506
00:22:57,472 --> 00:22:58,671
What do you hear about
the Cardell Rhodes shooting?

507
00:22:58,838 --> 00:22:59,938
Rumor going around

508
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:02,305
the cats making book
got pissed at youngblood

509
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:04,874
for point-shaving against dorsey
the other night.

510
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:06,771
Cardell was involved
in gambling?

511
00:23:06,938 --> 00:23:09,472
I mean, I wouldn't want to
speculate on that for certain,

512
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,238
but little man
with all that speed

513
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:13,504
stepping out of bounds
with all kinds of daylight

514
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:15,537
numerous times?

515
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:17,472
I mean, you got to wonder
about the spread.

516
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,138
Where did you hear this?

517
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:20,640
Fourth-hand knowledge.

518
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:23,787
Don't really have
any specific names.

519
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:28,971
You might want to check
with my man deuce

520
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:30,983
down there on bronson,
next to the laundromat.

521
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:34,445
Appreciate it, though, you keep
vanbro name out your mouth.

522
00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:36,539
Stay black.

523
00:23:40,405 --> 00:23:41,535
Detective Billings.

524
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,787
Anything yet, Steve?

525
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:44,971
Oh, shit. Right.
Uh, let me look.

526
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:50,971
Deuce says
it wasn't point-shaving.

527
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,038
Cardell's been playing it smart
all season...

528
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:55,138
stepping out of bounds
to avoid cheap shots,

529
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:56,778
saving his knees
for the next level.

530
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,838
All the bookies making the line
knew that.

531
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,346
They factored that
into the spread.

532
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:01,681
No, no mail yet.

533
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,326
Just keep an eye out,
okay?

534
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:05,904
Let's head back to the Barn
and regroup.

535
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,580
No, hey, I want to talk
to that recruiter again

536
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:08,838
as soon as he gets back

537
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:10,372
from scouting that kid
down in San diego.

538
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:11,691
Polk's a victim, not a suspect. Exactly.

539
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:13,401
Maybe he was the target.

540
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,338
That's worth
a conversation.

541
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:17,530
I got to go get
a prescription filled.

542
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,639
I'll meet you
back there, okay?

543
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:30,804
Hey, yo, my man!

544
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,804
Hey, man, you goddamn deaf,
homey?

545
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:43,764
What are you looking
to get into, gabacho?

546
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:45,571
None of that goddamn
stepped-on shit.

547
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:47,005
I ain't
seen you around before.

548
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:48,686
Yeah, well,
I'm changing slangers, man.

549
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:50,804
I'm looking to bring my business
to you.

550
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:52,704
You want to get paid
or what, man?

551
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:54,338
'Cause I'm looking
to get low.

552
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:56,038
Let me see
what I'm working with.

553
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:02,575
I'm gonna hold a dub, cuz.

554
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,209
You ain't no cop!

555
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:14,571
You need to work
on your street skills.

556
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:17,938
Now, you're gonna walk me into
that stash house off normandie.

557
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:20,038
I ain't doing shit for you.
I'm 16.

558
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:22,005
Take me in,
and we'll call my moms.

559
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:23,372
I don't have her number.

560
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:25,056
Hey, bro, why you tripping?
Aah!

561
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:27,405
I can do this shit all day.

562
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:29,171
So, what's it gonna be?

563
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:33,038
You doing what I tell you
or blood coming out your ears?

564
00:25:33,316 --> 00:25:36,336
How much firepower inside?

565
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:38,360
Enough to shred
your bony, white ass.

566
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:39,862
How much cash?
Huh?

567
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,448
8 to 10.
Had a good couple of days.

568
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:44,138
All right,
let's get this done.

569
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:52,472
What the hell happened?

570
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:53,838
Beats the shit out of me.

571
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:55,704
It was up and slanging
two hours ago.

572
00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:04,948
You ain't a cop.
I was right.

573
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:07,038
Yeah,
you're a goddamn genius.

574
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:20,071
We got a runner!

575
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,675
We got a runner!

576
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:25,405
Hey, freeze!

577
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:26,572
Police!

578
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:31,905
100 grand...
earnest money.

579
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:36,627
Don't smoke, don't drink.

580
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:39,905
A man of few vices.

581
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:44,237
For me,
it blurs the edge.

582
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:48,238
The edge is where we live...
all of us, all the time.

583
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:51,238
People try to convince
themselves otherwise,

584
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:53,894
it's just an exercise
in self-deception.

585
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:55,637
A philosopher.

586
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:58,899
Former cop.
Same deal, less horseshit.

587
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:01,205
Things come easy
for you, huh?

588
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:02,945
Are you one of these

589
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:05,508
"hard work
is its own reward" guys?

590
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,671
I had grandparents
like that.

591
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:09,702
They died miserable
and broke.

592
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:13,504
You've accomplished a lot
in a very short time.

593
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:17,585
You need to understand
something Pezuela never did...

594
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:21,505
you got an action hero
on your payroll.

595
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:36,804
Okay.

596
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:39,208
She's in position.

597
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:41,605
I've got a visual.

598
00:27:43,988 --> 00:27:46,947
Tell me she's gonna get through
this without cracking on us.

599
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:49,537
I'd feel better if we could
communicate with her.

600
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:51,005
The wire's risky enough.

601
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:53,704
I don't want Mackey
sniffing anything.

602
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:03,130
Ronnie's here.
Vic's not with him.

603
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,438
It's Gardocki.

604
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:06,926
What's he doing...
recon for Vic?

605
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:08,947
Julien, you have a visual
on Mackey?

606
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,971
Negative.

607
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,325
Where's Vic?

608
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,637
This is for you.

609
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:16,060
Well, Vic was supposed
to be here. Is he all right?

610
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:17,645
He's fine.
Something came up.

611
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:19,372
Come on, Corrine,
get him talking.

612
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,205
Is that what I'm supposed
to give Shane? Good girl.

613
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:22,274
I got to go.
Thanks, Corrine.

614
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:25,639
Ronnie as his goddamn
errand boy.

615
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,049
Mackey's a no-show.

616
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:30,074
On my signal, prepare
to apprehend Gardocki.

617
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:31,704
No, no,
Mackey might be watching.

618
00:28:31,871 --> 00:28:32,938
You hold your positions

619
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:34,745
until you've got a visual
on the primary.

620
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:36,438
We've got Ronnie
dead to rights.

621
00:28:36,605 --> 00:28:38,938
We've got Gardocki on tape.
We can file on him later.

622
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:40,668
We haven't got
the real bastard yet.

623
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:44,637
Stand down.
Do not engage the target.

624
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:49,481
Shane's an hour late.

625
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:51,637
This doesn't feel right.

626
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,799
Maybe Mara got cold feet,
spilled to Shane.

627
00:28:58,414 --> 00:29:00,347
Claudette,
they're not coming.

628
00:29:00,514 --> 00:29:02,564
What if Vic figured out
that I was working with you?

629
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:04,775
That's why he sent Ronnie.

630
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:06,948
Jesus Christ.

631
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,781
Okay, she's losing it.

632
00:29:11,948 --> 00:29:14,114
Why didn't you give me something
so I could hear you?

633
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:16,147
Somebody talk to me!

634
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:17,981
Okay, call it.
Yeah.

635
00:29:18,148 --> 00:29:19,447
All units, abort.

636
00:29:19,614 --> 00:29:21,083
10-4. copy that.

637
00:29:21,448 --> 00:29:23,502
God damn it!

638
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:26,182
So, now what?

639
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:29,548
Bottom line...
we got to hunker down

640
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:30,915
while they sweat the streets

641
00:29:31,082 --> 00:29:32,344
on account
of the president coming.

642
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:33,814
You know, the real danger

643
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,431
is that they know you think
like a cop,

644
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,414
so they're expecting you
to hit certain targets.

645
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:40,848
But they don't know
how I think.

646
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:42,021
If you've got an idea on how
we can score some cash, baby,

647
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:43,381
lay it on me.

648
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,347
The safe
at the real-estate company.

649
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:46,608
Come on.

650
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:49,481
No, there's a lockbox where
the coordinator keeps checks

651
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:51,047
before they send them
to escrow.

652
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:54,247
Mara, if I can't
knock over a stash house,

653
00:29:54,414 --> 00:29:56,714
what makes you think
we're gonna walk into a bank

654
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:58,381
and cash a bunch
of stolen checks

655
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,347
made out to a goddamn
escrow company? Shh.

656
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:02,714
They also keep the checks
for apartment rentals...

657
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:04,881
first, last, security deposit. So?

658
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:06,915
So, most of the time,
they're cashier's checks.

659
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:09,414
Folks in the hood
don't have checking accounts.

660
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:12,468
Well, I can pass
a cashier's check, no problem.

661
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,897
But I don't know
about cracking in no safe.

662
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:16,614
No, no,
I have the combination.

663
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:17,915
I've been filling in
for the assistant manager

664
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,114
out on maternity leave.

665
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:21,134
So, I'll go in,
grab the checks, and go.

666
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:23,047
Hmm?
No, it's too dangerous.

667
00:30:23,214 --> 00:30:24,938
The only people that'll be there
are the cleaning crew.

668
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:26,614
You don't think they know you're a
fugitive already? And they know me.

669
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,448
They're illiterate,
and they don't speak english.

670
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:33,790
I'll go in.

671
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,681
I don't want the mother
of this little girl

672
00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:39,648
in harm's way any more
than she already is.

673
00:30:44,915 --> 00:30:45,781
Ha!

674
00:30:45,948 --> 00:30:47,481
For a guy in a close race,

675
00:30:47,648 --> 00:30:49,963
you'd think you'd have
more pressing matters

676
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,748
than to stalk me
for my vote.

677
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,467
I've been looking
into the circumstances

678
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:56,047
surrounding Pezuela's
"suicide."

679
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,981
And here I thought
you'd miss the prick.

680
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,681
Interesting fact surfaced when
I reached out to my contacts

681
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:02,217
at the coroner's office.

682
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:05,714
Cruz Pezuela ate a bullet
less than 24 hours ago,

683
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:10,414
yet his body
is already back in Mexico.

684
00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:12,694
Why waste time
taking out the garbage?

685
00:31:13,048 --> 00:31:14,347
A suicide in L.A. County,

686
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:16,814
the coroner's required
to perform an autopsy.

687
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,614
But he never
had the chance.

688
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:21,453
That's because
Pezuela isn't dead,

689
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:23,648
is he?

690
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:26,881
I got someplace to be.

691
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:29,429
We can debate the eternal
qualities of the soul

692
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:30,781
at another time.

693
00:31:30,948 --> 00:31:33,915
Is Pezuela testifying?
What's he saying about me?

694
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:35,748
I played my cards.
You played yours.

695
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:37,681
I took the pot.
I win.

696
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:40,472
Now step away from the table.
Game over.

697
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:43,180
No, I still have
one more card to play.

698
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:44,481
I will go
straight to Beltran

699
00:31:44,648 --> 00:31:46,270
and tell him that Pezuela
is alive and testifying.

700
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:48,281
I will wreck
this investigation

701
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,514
before I let you and Olivia
cut me out.

702
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:52,047
What makes you
more afraid...

703
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:55,015
being denied your legacy
as the great Brown informer

704
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:56,381
or it coming out

705
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,740
that your campaign is financed
with dope money?

706
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:03,281
We have a common cause.

707
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:08,333
Are you asking me
to be your friend?

708
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:12,314
I'm asking that we both
respect the other's end game.

709
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:19,047
Hey, how goes it?
Fine.

710
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:20,387
Claudette had you out
on something?

711
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:21,681
Checking a lead.

712
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:23,080
Something on Shane?

713
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:24,975
Um, turned out
to be nothing.

714
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:33,275
Hey.
Everything okay?

715
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:36,614
Yeah. Yeah.

716
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:39,689
Um, Polk's back from San diego.
I'm gonna go see him.

717
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:41,481
You got that covered?

718
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:43,314
Yep.

719
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,422
Great.

720
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:54,614
What about drugs?

721
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:57,147
Our intel says
the cartel's a major supplier

722
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:58,848
across the southwest.

723
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:01,414
Beltran never mentioned
any drugs.

724
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:03,414
This guy's all about banks.

725
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:05,180
The scale of this thing...

726
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:08,147
the infrastructure,
transportation, security...

727
00:33:08,314 --> 00:33:12,648
looks like they're planning
to wash half the Mexican gnp.

728
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:14,015
Chaffe wants to find a way

729
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:15,848
to embed a couple
of our agents with you.

730
00:33:16,015 --> 00:33:18,320
It's time for me to pull my guy
Ronnie Gardocki into this thing.

731
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:19,404
We'd rather use someone
from our end.

732
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:21,615
This isn't the time to play
"getting to know you."

733
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:22,991
Ronnie and I
have a short hand.

734
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:24,648
Also, I need Beltran to feel
like he's got reach

735
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:25,494
into the local
police department.

736
00:33:25,848 --> 00:33:27,120
Vic, I can't say yes
to that.

737
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:28,664
That's the way
it's got to be!

738
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:37,923
Meanwhile, this is yours.

739
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:43,178
Pezuela's blackmail file
on you.

740
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:46,765
I just found it.

741
00:33:47,048 --> 00:33:49,881
If I'm honest...

742
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,031
I was tempted
to hold onto it...

743
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:54,814
pull an Aceveda,

744
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:57,115
use it to squeeze you.

745
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:03,865
Thank you.

746
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:10,047
I just gave away any leverage
I ever had on you.

747
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,247
Now I'm out of a job,

748
00:34:12,414 --> 00:34:14,158
and I'm cozying up

749
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,381
to the most dangerous man
in the Mexican cartel.

750
00:34:17,548 --> 00:34:20,814
And even if I fool Beltran
long enough to stay alive,

751
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:23,677
I've got no future
I can plan on past tomorrow.

752
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:30,748
I need a place to land.
Can I count on you for that?

753
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,365
Excuse me, mi amigo.
Hey, uh, mi amigo?

754
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:49,347
¿qué?

755
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,681
¿sí?

756
00:34:51,848 --> 00:34:53,040
Buenas noches.
Let's go... in the back.

757
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:54,481
Silencio.
Silencio. Silencio.

758
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:56,080
Silencio.
Shh. Be quiet. Be quiet.

759
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:57,748
In the back. In the back.
Silencio.

760
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:01,173
Hey, come on. Let's go.
Let's go, right there.

761
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:02,591
Shh! Be quiet!
Shh!

762
00:35:02,948 --> 00:35:04,676
Be quiet! Be quiet!
Silencio!

763
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,637
On the floor, damn it!
On the floor!

764
00:35:07,213 --> 00:35:08,889
Hit the deck, damn it,
right now. Down.

765
00:35:09,182 --> 00:35:10,766
Down.
Abajo. Abajo.

766
00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:12,684
God!

767
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:14,811
All right.

768
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:16,581
Right 32, left...

769
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:18,190
hey, shut up!
I'm trying to think here!

770
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:22,861
...27, right 60.

771
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:24,655
Ahh.

772
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:26,015
Okay.

773
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:30,786
32 left, 27 right, 60.

774
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:32,147
Shit.

775
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:33,781
Okay, all right.

776
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:36,750
Anyone moves, um, muerto.
Muerto.

777
00:35:40,214 --> 00:35:42,247
Mara, come on.

778
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:43,674
I got...

779
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:46,426
bring him.
Just bring him. Come on.

780
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:48,419
Let's go! God!

781
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:51,223
Hurry up!

782
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:53,314
God.

783
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:54,518
What?

784
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:57,104
That goddamn safe.

785
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:05,654
Okay, I dialed right 32,
left 27, right 16.

786
00:36:06,048 --> 00:36:07,814
You have to pass 27 twice,
remember?

787
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:10,147
Stop on it the third time
and then right to 16.

788
00:36:10,314 --> 00:36:11,618
I don't know
what that means.

789
00:36:11,981 --> 00:36:13,514
Oh, God.
Here. Take him.

790
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:14,663
Um, hey.

791
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:16,514
Hey, Jackson,
be still, buddy.

792
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:17,958
Can you just
be still, okay?

793
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:21,514
Dámelo, por favor.
What?

794
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:22,671
Dámelo.

795
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:27,676
Hey.

796
00:36:33,514 --> 00:36:36,059
Okay, I got it.

797
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:37,988
Gracias.
De nada.

798
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:42,881
So?
How'd we do?

799
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:44,915
$5,000, give or take.

800
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:47,048
That'll work.

801
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,723
Shane didn't show up
today?

802
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,754
What happened?
I was worried.

803
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,890
Job interview came up
at the last minute.

804
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:06,990
I had no choice.

805
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,008
Job interview?

806
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:10,723
Yeah, a position opened up
with the feds.

807
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,888
I really have a shot...
good benefits.

808
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:15,423
Obviously,
we're gonna need it.

809
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,890
Corrine, I am so sorry
I left you on the hook today.

810
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:21,146
I did not want
to do that to you.

811
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,523
We sure as hell would have heard
if Shane got popped.

812
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,590
Anything happen at the park
that might have spooked him?

813
00:37:32,757 --> 00:37:34,990
No, just me
and the crackheads.

814
00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:38,356
Listen, please just get this
out of here, okay?

815
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,023
It makes me nervous.

816
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,389
Keep it.
Shane might call back.

817
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:45,003
And if he doesn't,
use it for the kids.

818
00:37:45,356 --> 00:37:47,798
Where did this money
come from?

819
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,690
All that matters now
is it's in good hands.

820
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:52,886
Please tell me
when this is gonna be over.

821
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,764
Soon.

822
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,389
Hi, dad.

823
00:37:57,556 --> 00:37:59,017
Hey, kid.

824
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:00,289
How are you?

825
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:02,057
Cassidy, you need
to get to bed.

826
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:03,814
You have an early morning
tomorrow.

827
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,923
I just want to show dad
my math test.

828
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:06,983
I got a 98%.

829
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:10,590
You got a 98%.

830
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:12,656
That's great, kid.

831
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,890
You're really pulling it
together, aren't you?

832
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:18,286
Thanks. I'm trying.

833
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,248
Vic.

834
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:24,876
What?
She earned it.

835
00:38:25,224 --> 00:38:27,057
Okay, dad.
Iove you.

836
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:28,590
Iove you, too.

837
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:36,057
I'll fax you a list of
all the I.a. Kids we've met with

838
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:37,430
as soon as I get back
to dallas.

839
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,356
That could be helpful.

840
00:38:39,523 --> 00:38:42,790
Just know that, usually,
a sit-down for me

841
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:44,646
involves a coach,
overprotective mother,

842
00:38:44,957 --> 00:38:47,222
sometimes
a family minister.

843
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:49,901
With Rhodes,
I had a meet-cute

844
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,571
with some inked-out thug
in baggy clothes and a grill.

845
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:54,556
Got me wondering
if offering him a scholarship

846
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:55,615
was even a good idea.

847
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,323
For all we know, that thug
could have been there

848
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,623
as a show of respect
to Cardell...

849
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,356
make sure he wasn't
taken advantage of.

850
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:01,621
By who? Me?

851
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,489
I walk into a place like this,
I'm Mr. Opportunity...

852
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:05,723
money, education,

853
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,556
chance to get out
of a shitty environment.

854
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:08,879
That cuts both ways.

855
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,890
In your job, you destroy more
dreams than you make come true.

856
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:13,356
That earns you
some enemies.

857
00:39:13,523 --> 00:39:14,990
Tell me about it.

858
00:39:15,157 --> 00:39:17,723
Last year, I had a mother come
after me with a baseball Bat

859
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,222
after we took a pass
on her kid.

860
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:21,641
Same block as Cardell.

861
00:39:21,923 --> 00:39:23,602
How random's that?

862
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:27,057
Thanks for bringing verna
down here.

863
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:28,940
I didn't want her
coming down here by herself,

864
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:31,156
picking up
her boy's things.

865
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:33,122
Did they find
who did this?

866
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:34,279
Um, not yet.

867
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:36,222
Never found the gang member

868
00:39:36,389 --> 00:39:38,890
that murdered your son
last year, either.

869
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,057
No, they didn't.

870
00:39:42,224 --> 00:39:45,081
You were at home at the time
of today's shooting?

871
00:39:45,423 --> 00:39:47,456
I was there watching my stories
on television.

872
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:49,836
Did you hear shots?

873
00:39:50,124 --> 00:39:53,189
No, I, uh...
I heard the siren, though.

874
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,556
And then my neighbor came
knocking on the door.

875
00:39:55,723 --> 00:39:56,843
If you care
about your friend,

876
00:39:57,224 --> 00:39:58,489
you'll help me
solve this case...

877
00:39:58,656 --> 00:39:59,763
save verna a lot of pain.

878
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:02,356
All you got to do is
tell the truth. Of course.

879
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:04,184
You knew darren Polk was
in that truck,

880
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,311
didn't you?

881
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,063
He the same man
that recruited your son?

882
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:16,122
He promised dion a scholarship,
a car, money...

883
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,073
all kinds of things.

884
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:19,908
And then it just, what?
All falls through?

885
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:24,023
Your son was shot and killed
a little while after that.

886
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,749
Six months. Shot my baby
in the head at a bus stop.

887
00:40:28,057 --> 00:40:31,878
Mia, as a mother
who has lost a child,

888
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:35,023
tell me that you didn't know
he was in that truck.

889
00:40:38,757 --> 00:40:40,490
With them dark windows...

890
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:46,890
...I didn't...
I didn't see Cardell.

891
00:40:47,057 --> 00:40:48,323
And that's the truth.

892
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,688
I didn't see Cardell.

893
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,923
That man...
he destroyed my boy.

894
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,723
And now he's lying
in the dirt

895
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,947
when he should be running
for touchdowns.

896
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:24,723
Shit.

897
00:41:26,556 --> 00:41:28,893
Hey, I was just about
to go upstairs and take...

898
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:30,857
did you get it?

899
00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:45,389
Called I.A.D., got the paperwork
started on Gardocki.

900
00:41:45,556 --> 00:41:47,489
We'll be ready to hit him
with an indictment

901
00:41:47,656 --> 00:41:48,523
when the time comes.

902
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,590
That's fine.

903
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,207
Why don't you go home?

904
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:53,251
Because I've got work
to do.

905
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:57,256
I, uh, talked to Danny.

906
00:41:57,423 --> 00:41:58,556
Now that Vic's not
around here anymore,

907
00:41:58,723 --> 00:41:59,549
I think she's ready
to come back...

908
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,957
help you take care
of things again.

909
00:42:03,423 --> 00:42:06,347
Seeing the bottom of my inbox
is not a priority.

910
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,623
We'll get Vic.

911
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,990
At the moment,

912
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:13,813
I'm a little bit more concerned
about you.

913
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,856
You know, we can't
expect justice out there

914
00:42:17,023 --> 00:42:19,623
when we don't demand it
in our own house.

915
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,613
Okay, so,
now you're taking on

916
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:24,189
the problems
of the whole world?

917
00:42:24,356 --> 00:42:26,659
Everything's not
under your control.

918
00:42:29,823 --> 00:42:32,723
You don't like the way
I'm handling this case,

919
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,209
you can always leave.

920
00:42:44,057 --> 00:42:47,656
Olivia smelled Beltran's musk
on me... made her wet.

921
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:48,765
We deliver,

922
00:42:49,157 --> 00:42:51,389
I.C.E. Is gonna take care
of both of us, I know it.

923
00:42:51,556 --> 00:42:53,590
If we close the deal
before Shane gets caught.

924
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:55,756
He and Mara just
have to stay invisible

925
00:42:55,923 --> 00:42:57,122
for another day or two.

926
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:58,690
What do you think of Shane

927
00:42:59,027 --> 00:43:00,990
taking a pass on that bag
of free money?

928
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:02,823
He was just
giving us busywork...

929
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,823
keeping it so we couldn't
look for him.

930
00:43:05,157 --> 00:43:08,389
Jesus,
this is cutting it close.

931
00:43:08,556 --> 00:43:10,489
Hey.

932
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:12,580
A little ulcer
never hurt anyone.

933
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:18,923
Say hello
to my friend Ronnie Gardocki.

934
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,356
Mucho gusto.

935
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:22,674
He speaks highly of your
character and your abilities.

936
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:26,845
He taught me
everything I know.

937
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:31,516
Boo-Ray.

938
00:43:31,768 --> 00:43:32,934
It's been a minute.

939
00:43:33,186 --> 00:43:34,923
How's the family doing?

940
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,023
My peoples
is doing good.

941
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,314
Glad to hear it.

942
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:42,944
Iook, uh, I need your help
on a little business matter.

943
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,489
I'm tapped out.
Come back another time.

944
00:43:47,656 --> 00:43:50,410
Oh, look, man, come on, you know
these are as good as cash.

945
00:43:50,757 --> 00:43:53,023
All the favors I did for you...
looking the other way

946
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,373
while you ran your little
weed operation out the back.

947
00:43:55,723 --> 00:43:58,790
Come on.
You owe me, homey.

948
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,755
I will make it up to you.

949
00:44:03,124 --> 00:44:04,623
You got yourself
in a spot.

950
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,885
Yeah, don't believe
everything you hear.

951
00:44:11,757 --> 00:44:13,349
This is 2 grand light.

952
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:14,809
50 cents on the dollar.

953
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:17,353
That's a pretty steep vig.

954
00:44:17,605 --> 00:44:18,690
Iook, it's unacceptable.

955
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:20,057
Give me 75 cents,
and we'll call it even.

956
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,357
I got enough trouble.

957
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:25,057
I got a kid. You know,
I got another one on the way.

958
00:44:25,224 --> 00:44:28,456
Walk away, white man,
or I dial 911.

959
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:30,423
Put the phone down.
You're not a snitch, man.

960
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,453
Giving up a killer cop
ain't snitching in my hood.

961
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:50,553
It's the best I could do.

962
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,723
Anyway, it's a down payment
on us getting out of here.

963
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,856
I thought you said
this guy was your friend...

964
00:45:01,023 --> 00:45:04,224
that he owed you big-time.

965
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,823
Baby, come here.

966
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:15,856
Moving forward,

967
00:45:16,023 --> 00:45:18,590
I guess we both need
to embrace the reality

968
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,667
that neither one of us
has a friend in the world...

969
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:24,823
...except each other.
