1
00:00:01,114 --> 00:00:03,037
Previously on The Shield.

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,238
What happened?

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:08,725
I've got lupus.
I've had it for 15 years.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,583
You dropped a grenade in
his lap, and what did you do?

5
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:12,262
- You run?
- Shane!

6
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:13,109
I killed elm.

7
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:15,335
Leave here
before I kill you.

8
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,127
Just imagine every
wrong thing we have ever done.

9
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:22,650
If anything happens to me,
that lands on I.A.D.'s doorstep.

10
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:25,103
The Armenians know
about the money train!

11
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:26,886
Diro green lit
your family.

12
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:28,638
L'm paying off your debt
in favors.

13
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:30,181
What the hell
have you gotten us into?!

14
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:31,176
This will handle
the first week.

15
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:33,248
I need you to look after
Corrine and my family.

16
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,402
This is Cruz Pezuela.

17
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:36,482
He's representing
a local development company

18
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:39,212
that has backing in various
Mexican investment interests.

19
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,263
The Mexican mob
is buying up Farmington?

20
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:42,446
Pezuela is connection

21
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:44,131
blackmail... that's how
Pezuela's getting everyone

22
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,878
onboard the train
to cartel town.

23
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:49,023
I can't tackle Cruz alone,
so there's got to be trust.

24
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:51,158
You and I have the only
two copies of the keys.

25
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:53,805
There are over 100
blackmail files in this box,

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,751
and I only need one of them
to get my badge back.

27
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:58,167
This intel is the proof that
we have that Pezuela's dirty.

28
00:00:58,202 --> 00:01:00,660
Using it as leverage will
compromise it as evidence.

29
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:03,684
L'm gonna need you to get
my family clear of this thing.

30
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,990
I need you
to make Rezian believe

31
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:07,151
the Mexicans are
the Armenians' worst problem.

32
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:09,006
The Latino crime bosses
need you out of the way

33
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,937
so that they can get on
with their Brown revolution.

34
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:13,484
I am going to protect you.
Anything happens to me,

35
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,435
I've already given the order to
go after your friend's family.

36
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,787
We got to figure out how many
rungs on the Armenian ladder

37
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:20,739
know about
our money-train rip-off.

38
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:24,741
Hey, you and me... on the road
to being cool, right?

39
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:28,310
Working with you to protect
my family? L'm down with that.

40
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:31,069
Trusting you?
Not there yet.

41
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:38,167
www.1000fr.com presents...

42
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,863
If there's a bug hidden,
this'll find it.

43
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:43,544
- That's unnecessary.
- Yeah, tell it to the feds.

44
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:56,799
Sync: Vine

45
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,832
heard about the city's
new top-10 gang list?

46
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:04,649
Word is they're holding a spot
for a local Armenian kingpin.

47
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:05,984
Feds would like
to beat them to it.

48
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,417
Since father and daughter
kesakian are gone,

49
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:08,706
I guess
that means you.

50
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:10,162
It's safe.
You're wasting your time.

51
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,504
Well, up until now,
we've been slow-dancing.

52
00:02:12,772 --> 00:02:15,721
If we're gonna slip into bed,
I'm gonna need some protection.

53
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:18,923
So...
I got a real job,

54
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,460
so anytime you want
to get started.

55
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:21,736
Your job
will have to wait.

56
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:23,677
L've got something
you need to do for me.

57
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:26,285
It better be quick. I got
a lot on my plate these days.

58
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,989
Your police department is about
to destroy its confiscated guns.

59
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,668
Yeah, I know about it.
It's an annual thing.

60
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:32,484
We want them.

61
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,320
L'm sure the SWAT team
guarding that shipment

62
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,319
won't have a problem
with me taking a few.

63
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:38,919
The guns are stored
before they're moved.

64
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,657
Find out where
and get to them first.

65
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:43,976
Look you want guns, you can get them
anywhere else a hell of a lot easier.

66
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:46,432
Those guns have been
processed, cleaned.

67
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:49,094
Thanks to your city,
they're untraceable now.

68
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,017
I got to pass
on this favor.

69
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,125
- You have no choice.
- I don't need a choice.

70
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:54,631
The answer's no.

71
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,448
You just killed
your friend and his family.

72
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:00,529
You know what?
Go ahead... kill Mackey.

73
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:01,804
Kill his whole family!

74
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,275
L'm not going on some career
suicide mission for you!

75
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,658
L'm not gonna spend
the rest of my life

76
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:07,875
with somebody else's debt
hanging around my neck, either.

77
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,462
You said that we would
be compensated for our loss.

78
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:12,591
How about saving your ass
in county jail?!

79
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,929
Huh?!
That slip your mind?!

80
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:16,744
Money compensation.

81
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,908
Those guns
are a down payment.

82
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:19,382
Those guns
are a tall order.

83
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,012
I need fair market value for
the risk that I'd be taking.

84
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:23,396
L'll come up
with something,

85
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:25,468
but you got to tell me
what you need these gatts for.

86
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:30,020
We'll move them out of state.
That's all you need to know.

87
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:38,968
Interesting strategy.

88
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,883
"Kill his whole family."

89
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:44,283
It's the smartest thing we've
done with these assholes, Vic.

90
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,294
I gave us a chance
to end all of this.

91
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:49,361
By putting a truckload
of untraceable weapons

92
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,066
in the hands
of God knows who?

93
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,821
I put us in a place,
finally,

94
00:03:53,856 --> 00:03:55,751
to ensuring that
your kids stay alive.

95
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:58,523
- By letting innocents get killed somewhere else.
- We don't know that.

96
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,445
Iook, Rezian's
negotiating with us now.

97
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,337
We still don't know who
in Rezian's crew

98
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:04,844
knows about
my money-train debt.

99
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,107
I don't see him volunteering
that anytime soon.

100
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:08,675
We have no choice.

101
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:11,529
Until we figure out
exactly how deep the threat

102
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:13,299
against my family goes,

103
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,245
we got to play ball
with them.

104
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,734
So, all we got to do
is hijack

105
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,837
the department's
annual p.r. Bonanza.

106
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:21,067
Maybe we don't
have to steal the guns.

107
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:23,041
Maybe somebody
gives them to us.

108
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:26,922
- Yeah, how's that?
- I got a card to play.

109
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,838
Morning.

110
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:54,380
- You shouldn't have come here.
- Where's that blackmail box?

111
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,452
The one we were supposed
to only access together?

112
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:58,139
See, I knew you couldn't
resist the temptation

113
00:04:58,174 --> 00:04:59,828
to use it
for your own purposes.

114
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:02,054
The very fact that you're
here now just proves it.

115
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:04,158
- So, you took it?
- Yeah, I'm in control of it

116
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:06,047
until the time is right
to turn it over to justice.

117
00:05:06,082 --> 00:05:09,139
I don't have time
to bullshit around here!

118
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:11,204
Hey, we're still
working together.

119
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:14,810
The only change is that I'm
now in possession of the box.

120
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:17,023
We're close to drawing Pezuela
out of his hole

121
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:17,946
and into the light of day,

122
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,852
and that only works if he thinks
the box is still out there.

123
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,444
And that
hasn't changed.

124
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:26,116
Iook,
if Pezuela's smart,

125
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:28,403
he hasn't had any contact
with anyone in that box,

126
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:31,356
so I have to link him
directly to the cartel

127
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:34,130
or all you're doing
is giving the feds ammunition

128
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:37,266
to destroy the careers
of everyone in that box.

129
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:41,935
Before one of them has a chance
to save your job, right?

130
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,917
When you finally turn it
back over to justice,

131
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,677
they're gonna wonder
what took you so long.

132
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:53,996
I was trying to understand
exactly what I had...

133
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:55,589
determine who
put it all together.

134
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:57,821
I could
tell them that,

135
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:00,044
or I could tell them that you're
just another dirty politician

136
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,057
trying to extort his way
into the mayor's office.

137
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,399
You'd only be
incriminating yourself.

138
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:07,790
Yeah, but
I'm on the way out.

139
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,955
You could still
maintain the lie,

140
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,496
keep yourself distanced
from all this...

141
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:15,705
that is, if I'm willing to tell
the right story on that day.

142
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,767
Don't look for the box.
You won't find it.

143
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:20,921
I don't need the box...

144
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,024
I have you.

145
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,525
- How did that card play out?
- It didn't.

146
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,709
If this is gonna happen,
it's gonna be the hard way.

147
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,340
Did you find out
where the guns are stored?

148
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,822
Department's kept them
in five different locations.

149
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:41,191
L'm about to get roasted.
They gotta be in the same place.

150
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:42,582
The question is
which one?

151
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:45,975
It might seem obvious if we start asking
right before the guns get jacked.

152
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,582
We got to know that
we have a deal with Rezian.

153
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,582
Who is this?

154
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,182
Vic Mackey.

155
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:05,418
Why is he here?

156
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:07,261
If you want those guns,
I can't do it alone.

157
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:09,833
He's got more motivation
to succeed than anybody.

158
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:12,104
Going after my family
got my attention,

159
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,171
but I'm gonna defend them
one way or the other.

160
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:16,187
He stole from us once.
Why trust him?

161
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:18,589
You shouldn't...
I took your money-train cash,

162
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:20,877
and I'm not afraid to come here
and tell you about it,

163
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:23,030
but we both know I just stole
what you already stole.

164
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:27,441
- You and who else?
- Me, my buddy elm, who's dead,

165
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:29,553
and two of his homies
from out of town.

166
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:32,128
I couldn't find them now
if I wanted to.

167
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:34,521
Shane and my partner, Ronnie...
they had nothing to do with it.

168
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:35,931
Maybe we just
kill you, then.

169
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:38,617
The foot-chopping generation
is dead and buried.

170
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:40,247
You filled the vacuum,
but you're new.

171
00:07:40,282 --> 00:07:44,191
You're consolidating power,
and you've got a Mexican threat

172
00:07:44,226 --> 00:07:46,638
you don't understand
and can't defend yourself from.

173
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:48,973
Then you can give us
our money back.

174
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:52,685
Sorry, we burned
through the money,

175
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,868
but I can offer a, uh,
solution that benefits us all.

176
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,981
- End this now.
- First, I need to know

177
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:00,918
where the guns are headed
once we've delivered them.

178
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:02,802
They're going to Chicago
by train.

179
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:05,181
We need to see a light
at the end of this tunnel,

180
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:08,924
so, instead of the $2 million
that I don't have,

181
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,191
I'm gonna grant you
three wishes.

182
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,709
The guns
can be wish number one.

183
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,295
Use your wishes well... be a lot more
valuable than the missing cash,

184
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,657
but once you've had
your three meals,

185
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:24,545
you walk away from the table
fat, happy, and even.

186
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,402
He doesn't
give us terms.

187
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,259
The talk is your war with
the Mexicans is heating up.

188
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:31,781
You're gonna need more help,
you're gonna need more intel.

189
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:33,588
Trust me or not,

190
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:35,472
that's your
best offer.

191
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:48,323
Rezian's buying it
for now,

192
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:51,003
but that asshole khalulian's
nothing but trouble.

193
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:53,778
I know. First, we'll get
the guns out of storage.

194
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:56,145
After that, we'll find out
exactly where they're going.

195
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,297
- Who cares where they're going?
- I care.

196
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:00,032
Iook, you know
who we're dealing with.

197
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,848
If the Armenians want guns,
they're gonna get them...

198
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:03,719
if not from us,
from someplace else.

199
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:06,369
The most important thing
is I have finally found us

200
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:09,174
a light at the end
of this goddamn tunnel.

201
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,472
Hey.

202
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:17,166
What can I do
for you guys?

203
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,260
Well, you can help me
save my partner's ass.

204
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:23,563
We had a gun that should have
been stored in evidence.

205
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:25,482
Somehow, my partner
let it slip into the pile

206
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:28,211
that's headed for the
Smith & wesson wienie roast,

207
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:30,857
and now the asshole who wounded
two people in a robbery

208
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:33,409
got himself a retrial...
we need the gun back.

209
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:34,912
L'm sorry,
you're too late.

210
00:09:34,947 --> 00:09:36,760
Guns aren't supposed to be
destroyed for two days.

211
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:39,094
True, but they're locked up
at the impound yard

212
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,405
over on San Fernando
right now.

213
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:44,423
There's almost 8,000 loose guns
in that pile.

214
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,940
You think you're gonna find
one serial number in all that?

215
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:48,253
Shit.

216
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:51,533
Iooks like the D.A. Will
have to get by on his charm

217
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:54,497
instead of limping by
on forensics.

218
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:02,050
Steve, there's a girl here
about a missing person.

219
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,577
- So give her the paperwork.
- She filled it out yesterday.

220
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,086
I think there's
some new information.

221
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:08,078
Well, I'm about to jump
into something else.

222
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:10,729
- The crossword puzzle?
- Jumble, actually.

223
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:12,051
Just give it
to Dutch.

224
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:13,339
If it's got legs,
I'll hop on board.

225
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:16,012
Dutch, there's a young woman
outside... marisol griego.

226
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:19,218
Some missing girl is
her friend... wan Lee, 16.

227
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,577
16?
Try runaway.

228
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:24,745
You think your friend wan
was abducted?

229
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,000
I was meeting her after school
to get something to eat.

230
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:29,868
She passed me on her scooter
trying to park.

231
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:33,698
I saw somebody, a man,
push her into an SUV.

232
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,420
An officer called
wan's mother yesterday,

233
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:39,220
was told she wasn't missing...
said it was a mistake.

234
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:43,867
Wan hasn't been at school.
She missed a midterm today.

235
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:46,275
Sometimes kids
don't want to go to school.

236
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,349
Wan's 4.0.
She wants to go to Stanford.

237
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:52,354
Something happened to her.

238
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:00,702
Mrs. Lee?
L'm detective Wagenbach.

239
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:03,178
Are you
wan Lee's mother?

240
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,092
A friend of wan's
is concerned.

241
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:07,938
She hasn't heard from her
in a couple of days.

242
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:09,743
I already spoke
to the police.

243
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:11,518
I told them
there was no problem.

244
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:14,398
I still have a
missing-person's report on file.

245
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:15,491
If I could
just talk to her,

246
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,051
close it out,
get out of your way.

247
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:18,778
- She's not here.
- Where is she?

248
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,565
Come back when
my son is home.

249
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,532
Well, I'd rather
do this now.

250
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,518
She went away
for a few days.

251
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:27,077
Okay, well,
why don't we call her?

252
00:11:27,112 --> 00:11:29,450
You'll have
to talk to my son.

253
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:32,885
Mrs. Lee,
is everything all right?

254
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,864
If something's happened
to your daughter...

255
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,640
there's nothing wrong.
We don't need your help.

256
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:39,127
Thank you.

257
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,055
Says wan's not missing...
just went away for a few days.

258
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,535
L'd rather spend the limited
time I have on the clock

259
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,817
investigating actual crimes.

260
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:59,722
The mother's scared,
covering...

261
00:11:59,757 --> 00:12:02,434
if you'd gotten your ass out of
the car, you'd have seen that.

262
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:05,390
How about I take your word for
it and we end this field trip?

263
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:17,014
Hey, Vic.
L'm on San Fernando.

264
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:19,352
If we can get in,
we can drive right out.

265
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:21,249
The guns must be
in the main warehouse...

266
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,202
where they keep
those expensive rides.

267
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:25,214
Nothing like
a tricked-out Benz.

268
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:28,119
Rezian was right on one thing...
until the cameras roll,

269
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:30,520
these guns are nothing
but the department's garbage.

270
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:32,167
They got
one guard inside.

271
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,206
Guy couldn't
protect his own asshole.

272
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:36,656
That makes sense.
Budgets are tight all around.

273
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:39,751
Hey, you remember
that dealer we used once...

274
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:41,820
blew a hole in his wall
for that murder case?

275
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,580
What was his name?
Burnout, wasn't it?

276
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:45,547
That sounds right.
Why?

277
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:47,551
I saw him driving
a few days ago.

278
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,860
Guy got himself
a brand-new escalade.

279
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,568
Business must be good.

280
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:53,965
All right, I'll track him down
and get back to you.

281
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:56,716
Why the
mysterious invite?

282
00:12:56,811 --> 00:13:00,200
We've been working a local
Armenian crew from the inside.

283
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:02,600
Our C.I. Tipped us off
about a major gun heist

284
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:06,112
that's about to land...
you want in on it?

285
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:07,766
Think it's as good
as your last lead?

286
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,096
Sounds like it's better.

287
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:12,506
Probably took a lot of effort
to get your name in so deep.

288
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,836
Anybody else
would be trying to keep

289
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:15,542
that lid screwed on
as tight as possible.

290
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,433
Yeah, well,
I'm not anybody else.

291
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:20,104
No, you're one
of those rare cops

292
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,136
who likes
to share his spoils.

293
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:23,979
We're all fighting
the same war, right?

294
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:28,014
My father
always warned me...

295
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,924
a boy does you one favor,
maybe he's just nice,

296
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,146
but if he does two favors, he's
either trying to put his hand

297
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,241
on your wallet
or down your panties.

298
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:38,904
L'll bet your daddy had to beat
the boys away with a stick.

299
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:42,880
A louisville slugger, actually,
and he wasn't afraid to use it.

300
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:45,608
And no one's gonna
hang anything over my head,

301
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:47,238
so if you think
sharing a couple busts

302
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,679
gives you the right
to something, think again.

303
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:51,754
In case
you haven't heard,

304
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,858
I'm not exactly
appreciated around here.

305
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,634
The department's
trying to force me out,

306
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,580
so I'm gonna clear away
as much shit off the street

307
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,550
as I can before I go,

308
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:03,003
and I don't give a rat's ass
who gets the credit for it.

309
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:07,367
You still want in on this,
or not?

310
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,324
Hey, captain.

311
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,514
How you doing?

312
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:18,796
Busy.

313
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:21,519
You want to tell me what you
wouldn't tell the desk sergeant?

314
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,234
This guy Larry... he's been
coming into my porn shop

315
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,688
wanting to invest
in my films.

316
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:27,779
¡ê-who could blame him?
¡ê-I know about Larry.

317
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:31,549
His main thing is drugs...
only pays his actresses in coke.

318
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,429
Of course,
I threw him out.

319
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:35,828
Because you commit your smut
to a higher standard?

320
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:39,499
Interested in a drug-peddling,
money-laundering asshole?

321
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,395
What happened
in the meetings?

322
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,268
I showed him my product.
He wasn't interested.

323
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,067
It's not my fault
he can't appreciate

324
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:50,410
the mature female body
the way I can.

325
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,931
What kind of stuff
did he want to invest in?

326
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:58,330
Oh, um, guy-girl, girl-girl,
three-way, atm, black-on-white.

327
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,305
If you ever get tired of
squashing people's civil rights,

328
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,041
I can make you
some real money.

329
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,099
So far,
this is working out,

330
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,840
but if something changes,
I'll let you know.

331
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,262
You call Larry and
set another meeting.

332
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:09,975
Outside?

333
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,707
Would you fold Tina
in with you as bait?

334
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,467
You want us to set up
on the porn guy?

335
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,963
- Sounds like more a vice thing.
- It's a drug thing.

336
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:23,744
Larry's got to get his
someplace.

337
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:25,928
Follow the coke trail
where it leads to.

338
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:28,546
- Where's Vic and Shane?
- Uh, Vic had a C.I.

339
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,799
He and Shane
are following up on it.

340
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:33,145
Well, if you need bodies,
get them back.

341
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,866
L'm gonna need
to see some I.D., Burnout.

342
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:53,006
- Mackey, what I do, man?
- License.

343
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,929
This is wack.

344
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:02,128
Registration.

345
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:09,421
That's a nice ride.

346
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:11,244
Thank you.

347
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,761
L'm afraid I'm gonna
have to take you in

348
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:14,961
for driving without
a license and registration.

349
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:17,249
Man, you got both of them
in your goddamn pocket!

350
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:20,093
You start talking back, we're
gonna add a resisting charge.

351
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:25,740
Really nice ride.

352
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:28,132
Make the introductions
and shut up.

353
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,046
We'll take it from there.
Everybody ready?

354
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:32,112
I thought we
were meeting up with Vic.

355
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:33,758
What, we can't handle it?

356
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,311
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm feeling my groove.

357
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:37,943
Remember to wait for him
to offer the drugs.

358
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:40,448
Don't ask to be vague,
or else it becomes entrapment.

359
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:42,766
I was listening the first time
you taught me this stuff.

360
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,862
- Glad to hear.
- Let's go.

361
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:48,067
About time you got out of that
old, disgusting granny shit.

362
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:50,562
- Glad you approve.
- How many scenes you done, hon?

363
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:53,679
L've only done a couple
of home ones with Devon,

364
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:55,798
but I just got into town
a few days ago.

365
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,206
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.

366
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,230
Who's Devon?

367
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:01,855
L'm her boyfriend. We were
hoping to break in together.

368
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,207
Hmm.

369
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:06,750
Small, but natural.

370
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:08,965
You done anal yet,
sweet thing?

371
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,056
L'm waiting
for the right material.

372
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:12,889
I was thinking we could
do a few scenes together

373
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:14,773
until she got
more comfortable.

374
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:19,087
All right, hon, get naked.
Let me see how you suck it.

375
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,098
Axl didn't mention
free samples.

376
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,433
This is an audition.

377
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:27,184
Yeah, well, axl had said
that he had been to you before

378
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:29,804
and that he always
came back empty-handed.

379
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,651
Iook, I don't get laid
unless I get paid.

380
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,456
This already
feels different.

381
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:37,814
I got to know what
my money is buying, okay?

382
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,158
What's the problem, baby?

383
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:41,341
L'm just
a little nervous.

384
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:43,356
You need something to help you
get in the mood?

385
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,249
Yeah, okay.
What do you got?

386
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:50,701
- You got a stage name?
- Persuasion.

387
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:55,259
- You like that?
- Yeah, I like that.

388
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:03,200
If those give you an erection
that lasts more than four hours,

389
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:05,005
call me so I can film it.

390
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,792
And this bag of powder means
I get to tap that ass, too.

391
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,524
Welcome to the world
of adult entertainment.

392
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,951
Police!
You're under arrest!

393
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:20,837
Natural... but small.

394
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:31,582
I don't want it touched until
the techies run through it.

395
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:32,491
Sure thing.

396
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:34,769
Just dump it at Farmington.
L'll check it out there.

397
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:37,642
Luxury vehicles
get parked at San Fernando.

398
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:39,561
Department regulation.

399
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:41,431
Wherever.

400
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,093
Asshole.

401
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:54,029
You know, the way
this cocaine is packaged...

402
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:57,563
small quantities...
buys you a distribution charge.

403
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,144
I don't sell it.
I give it away.

404
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,726
It gets a better performance
out of the girls.

405
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,941
Then you bought it
from somebody... who?

406
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,937
Demetrius harms.

407
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:13,712
There's no sense in you taking
the hit if it's harms we want.

408
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,709
You're done now.
Get lost.

409
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:17,707
Someone gonna take me back
to my store?

410
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:20,015
Call a uni to haul him
back to his place???

411
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,130
Okay, come on.

412
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,607
What do you say, Larry?
You want to help yourself out?

413
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,541
- Is your son home?
- No.

414
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,114
We went by his market on the way
over here. It's closed?

415
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:41,639
Mrs. Lee,
was wan kidnapped?

416
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:43,391
Wan is not missing.

417
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:45,102
I want to
bring wan home safely,

418
00:19:45,137 --> 00:19:48,325
but you're gonna have
to help me help her.

419
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:50,128
Wan!

420
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,030
You're wan?

421
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,010
Where should
I take her?

422
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:03,101
Just go up the stairs...
any open interrogation room.

423
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:11,736
Wan, wan, wan!

424
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:13,505
L'm sorry, you're gonna have
to wait down here.

425
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,072
No, my...
whoa, whoa, whoa.

426
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:17,400
Miss Johnson from
child protective services

427
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:18,357
explained
your rights.

428
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:22,130
You're just gonna have
to be patient. L'm sorry.

429
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,286
Hey,
feel free to sit in.

430
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:26,705
- Dutch.
- Yeah?

431
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,407
Maybe I should be the one
to talk to her.

432
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,442
I don't know,
she seems really shut down.

433
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:33,153
I think it should be
girl to girl.

434
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:36,247
You trusted a hunch.
Trust mine.

435
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:39,790
I promise you,
I'm just trying to help you.

436
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:40,999
Then let me go home.

437
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:44,233
I will as soon as we sort out where
you've been for the past three days.

438
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:46,146
L'm here now!
What difference does it make?!

439
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:48,236
I think that
you were kidnapped.

440
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:50,038
I think your mom
paid the ransom.

441
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:51,414
So you're
calling me a liar?

442
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:53,887
I think
you're hiding something.

443
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:55,684
Listen, wan,
I know you're tired, okay?

444
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:58,355
L'm gonna
let you go, but...

445
00:20:58,701 --> 00:21:00,826
just answer
one thing for me, okay?

446
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:04,440
If you weren't taken,
what are you so mad about?

447
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:06,508
And don't tell me it's
because I won't let you leave,

448
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:08,234
because I've heard
that you're a nice kid.

449
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:11,041
I mean, you're a good student,
straight "a's"...

450
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:12,476
you want to go
to Stanford, right?

451
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:15,338
I mean, you have
everything working for you,

452
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:18,488
so what are you
so mad about?

453
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:28,006
What if I were to tell you something
about me that nobody else knows?

454
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:32,537
A few days ago,
I was working on a case.

455
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:35,702
We were arresting some
really dangerous people.

456
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:39,690
I thought that the
other officers I was with

457
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:42,481
had cleared the room
that I was in, but...

458
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:46,174
but somebody was hiding,
and they missed him.

459
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:50,317
I didn't even see the guy's face
until he was choking me.

460
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:55,043
I couldn't... I couldn't get
his hands from around my neck.

461
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:57,137
What happened?

462
00:21:57,172 --> 00:21:58,316
I honestly thought

463
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:02,034
that I was leaving my baby boy
without his mother,

464
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:05,176
and I have never been so
scared, and at the same time,

465
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:08,816
I've never been so mad,
and I wanted to kill him.

466
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:11,357
I still do.

467
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:22,427
They raped me!

468
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,422
Any special
instructions?

469
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:34,677
Yeah, the cop
said to stay out.

470
00:22:34,712 --> 00:22:36,590
They're waiting for
a tech to run through it.

471
00:22:37,377 --> 00:22:38,668
Anything else coming in?

472
00:22:39,113 --> 00:22:40,644
No, it's the last one.

473
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:43,315
Okay, gonna lock up.

474
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:16,097
Yeah?

475
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:17,737
Hey, Vic.
It's Ray Carlson.

476
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,481
Is Matthew supposed to be
outside by himself?

477
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:21,832
- No. Why?
- 'Cause he just walked out of the house

478
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,040
and took off down the street...
Matthew!

479
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:24,974
Where's Corrine?

480
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,270
She left about an hour ago.

481
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,446
Where's Cassidy?

482
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:29,229
Inside the house
with a friend... Matthew!

483
00:23:29,612 --> 00:23:31,089
Ray,
what's going on?!

484
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,619
Matthew!

485
00:23:34,437 --> 00:23:35,472
Carlson?

486
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:38,079
L'll take him.
L'm a friend of the Mackey's.

487
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:39,703
Whoa, whoa, wait...
hey, hey!

488
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:41,528
I don't know
who the Mackey's are.

489
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:42,836
I don't know
who you are,

490
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:44,632
but you're not leaving
with this kid.

491
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:45,448
Ray?!

492
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:47,460
We can let the police
figure it out.

493
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:50,548
Vic, you better
get down here.

494
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,208
Oh, shit!

495
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:56,013
- How's that thing going?
- I got sidetracked.

496
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:57,230
What's going on
where you are?

497
00:23:57,265 --> 00:23:57,976
Caught a little fish

498
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:00,775
rolling on a bigger one...
demetrius harms.

499
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,561
We've been trying
to nail him

500
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:03,104
since he moved out
from Oakland.

501
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:05,129
Well, now's our shot.
I can use you.

502
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:06,662
L'm tied up.

503
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,633
Is there any way you could
squeeze a couple of unis

504
00:24:08,668 --> 00:24:10,267
without alerting
the African queen?

505
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:12,176
Harms is supposed to be
by himself

506
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:13,752
with one other guy...
I'll make it work.

507
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,755
Sorry to jam you up.

508
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:18,781
Put him in the Van.
We're rollin' on harms now.

509
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:20,157
Aren't we supposed
to process him first?

510
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,878
No time... harms is
alone or undermanned.

511
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:24,946
He finds out Larry's been
burned, that'll change fast.

512
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:31,771
Hey, they're fine, Vic,
don't worry.

513
00:24:35,161 --> 00:24:36,406
What's going on here?!

514
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,685
- Are you the father?
- Yeah!

515
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,512
Cassidy and Ellen
were drinking beer

516
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:42,270
and she had the door closed...
she wasn't watching Matthew.

517
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:44,037
Drinking?
Where were you?

518
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:47,309
I had her parent-teacher
conference, remember? I told you.

519
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:48,743
So you just
left them alone?

520
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,360
Cassidy watches Matthew
all the time.

521
00:24:50,395 --> 00:24:52,207
It was only for an hour.

522
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,713
How do you think I do everything
around here without you?

523
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:56,495
Look, I'm a cop.
This is my ex-wife.

524
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,743
The parents of the other
girl are filing a complaint the achole.

525
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:00,270
Your wife's
got to be processed.

526
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:02,621
L'll talk to the parents.
I can smooth this out.

527
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:04,428
I can release the kids
to your custody,

528
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:06,594
but that's about
the best you're gonna do.

529
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:09,514
We got to take her in.
L'm sorry, man.

530
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,672
Vic!

531
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:13,267
- Vic!
- L'll be right behind you.

532
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:15,447
We'll straighten this out
at the sheriff's station.

533
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,186
Don't take your eyes
off them.

534
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:27,467
Child services took wan to
mission cross for a rape kit.

535
00:25:27,502 --> 00:25:28,887
Okay, good work.

536
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:31,030
Actually, it was Danny
who got her to open up.

537
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:32,751
The only thing that she
remembers about the house

538
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:35,078
is it was empty, but she
could hear a freeway nearby,

539
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:37,573
and she saw part of a billboard
outside of her window.

540
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:40,348
It was a suntan-lotion ad
in Spanish.

541
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:44,388
L'll check it out.

542
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:49,573
Um... wan's been taken
to the hospital.

543
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:52,387
She was sexually assaulted
by her kidnappers.

544
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:55,540
The hospital is gonna do
a post-assault examination.

545
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:56,500
You can't do that.

546
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:59,702
Mrs. Johnson from child services
is gonna be with wan.

547
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,902
Don't worry.
Wan will not be alone.

548
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,666
No! Just bring my sister
back here!

549
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,236
Well, that...
that's not possible.

550
00:26:07,271 --> 00:26:08,655
This is a criminal
investigation now.

551
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,289
- There's no kidnapping.
- Joe!

552
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:11,861
L'm gonna get a lawyer.

553
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:30,920
Yeah?

554
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:31,960
Is the coast clear?

555
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:33,846
I got caught up.
I had to cut out.

556
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:35,773
You're supposed to be outside
keeping an eye on things.

557
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:36,815
Corrine got arrested.

558
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,694
You gonna be kidding me.

559
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:40,361
I had to arrange bail.

560
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:41,673
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

561
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:44,251
Now I got to get past the guard
blind if I'm gonna get out.

562
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:46,739
L'm not anywhere near there,
and we got to be there soon.

563
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:49,504
Fine. L'll handle it.

564
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:51,068
L'll see you there.

565
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:04,416
This is Vic Mackey.
It's going down.

566
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,742
Try the door.

567
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:53,642
You!
Demetrius!

568
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:56,137
Demetrius?

569
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:57,217
Hey!

570
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:00,904
Aah! Get it off me!

571
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:03,778
Get him off!

572
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:05,054
Ahh!

573
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:07,024
Move in! Move in!

574
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:11,326
Take the back!

575
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:12,999
The place looks empty.
We missed harms.

576
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:15,391
I need a paramedic
at 2489 gorham!

577
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:16,841
Officer needs assistance!

578
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:17,776
Shit!

579
00:28:17,811 --> 00:28:19,520
Shit!

580
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:26,973
Over here.

581
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:35,135
Pull it in.
I have to close the gate.

582
00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:37,362
Don't worry... I don't plan
on being here long.

583
00:28:37,397 --> 00:28:38,624
I don't care.
Just move it.

584
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:40,016
Is that everything?

585
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,610
It's most of them... had
to leave a few crates behind.

586
00:28:43,162 --> 00:28:45,975
That should be enough
to wet your whistle.

587
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,096
Hey, is this place secure?

588
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:49,412
Of course it is.

589
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:52,408
Something
doesn't feel right.

590
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:55,090
Shane tell you the feds
put you on their hit list?

591
00:28:56,746 --> 00:28:58,756
All right, let's get this shit
unloaded and get out of here.

592
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:02,143
This place is safe. Now, get
over here and help your friend.

593
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,554
That's a police radio.

594
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:07,681
Jesus Christ!
You were set up!

595
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:11,577
Did you hear me? We got to
go now... leave the guns!

596
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:15,439
Your choice, but don't forget
I tried to pull you out.

597
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,989
Rez... rez.

598
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:24,511
Where are you going?

599
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,964
This is ridiculous.

600
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,947
Where are you going?!

601
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,281
Get on the ground!

602
00:29:39,316 --> 00:29:41,056
- On the ground!
- Down on the ground!

603
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:42,991
Don't move...
right there!

604
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:49,528
You got the results
of the rape kit yet?

605
00:29:49,563 --> 00:29:52,671
Positive...
vaginal tearing.

606
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:54,199
L've been on the phone
with every realtor

607
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:56,382
who has a house for sale
within earshot of the freeway.

608
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:59,135
These three have a partial view
of the billboard wan saw.

609
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,087
Thanks, Steve.
Um, interrogation room two.

610
00:30:01,122 --> 00:30:03,899
- L'm gonna get my coat.
- Forget your coat. I need you here.

611
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:05,465
I want to follow this through.

612
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,127
Brother's out looking for
a lawyer... I need you here

613
00:30:08,162 --> 00:30:10,755
to keep them apart until
we figure out what we've got.

614
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,212
L'll get the rape book.

615
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:15,010
Have her start
I.D. Ing some suspects.

616
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:18,845
Maybe the Billings minimum
is all we need today.

617
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:25,231
- It's just like wan said.
- Yeah.

618
00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:29,353
Hey, um, that story you told her in
interrogation about a guy choking you?

619
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:30,393
Yeah, I made it up.

620
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,827
Did it to draw her out...
it worked.

621
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:35,064
Um, I'm always here,
you know,

622
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,030
if you ever want
to talk about something.

623
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,277
I guess I'm a better liar
than I thought.

624
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:54,021
I bet you're glad
you listened to me now.

625
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:56,040
What happened?

626
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:58,232
Did they follow you
or did you bring them?

627
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:00,971
L'm the guy who just saved
your ass from that federal fire.

628
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:04,476
- Because you heard the radio?
- Consider yourself lucky.

629
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:07,947
I got out, but my men didn't,
and I lost the guns.

630
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:09,171
And you
stayed out of jail.

631
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:12,347
So did we...
unless your boy sold us out.

632
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:15,453
He didn't, and if you did,
you're both dead.

633
00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:17,637
Sending you to jail would be
the worst thing for me.

634
00:31:17,672 --> 00:31:20,507
You'd have nothing to lose
going after my family. I know that.

635
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:21,895
Think the goddamn thing
through!

636
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,338
Vic just risked everything
getting you out of there.

637
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:26,746
If you're blaming us, it
just means you got a blind spot

638
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:28,349
to whoever it is
that's trying to burn you.

639
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:30,497
You got a hole in your
organization you better plug

640
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:32,080
before you
accuse me again.

641
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:34,827
- What about khalulian?
- He'd never betray me.

642
00:31:34,862 --> 00:31:36,534
We'll see.

643
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:42,922
You need to grab
anything incriminating

644
00:31:42,957 --> 00:31:43,501
and clear it out of here.

645
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:44,784
No one knows
about this place.

646
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,408
Like they didn't know about
the trucking company, right?

647
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:48,984
You sweep in here?

648
00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:50,765
Uh, yeah, today.

649
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,593
- Every room?
- Just this room.

650
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,386
This is where
we were talking.

651
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:56,390
Khalulian got
an office of his own?

652
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:58,851
Someplace where he made
a call about tonight?

653
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:00,451
Over here.

654
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:43,051
Khalulian might be loyal, but
he's also stupid and careless.

655
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,666
You better hope he didn't
mention your name or ours.

656
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:46,614
Let's just
get out of here.

657
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:48,807
You dodged the feds tonight
with our help,

658
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,930
but that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

659
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:53,783
You really think the Mexicans
are just gonna go away?

660
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:56,602
They're gonna keep coming
until they get what they want.

661
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:59,060
And we all saw your idea
of taking precautions.

662
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:02,226
Can you find out what
the Mexicans want from me?

663
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:05,357
Maybe, but first, I need
to know who's on your crew.

664
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:08,356
Only the ones that are close,
that you trust.

665
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:09,700
L'll check them out.

666
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:12,306
If I don't find anything,
that'll be the end of it.

667
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:21,178
Thank you.

668
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,224
You set that whole thing up,
didn't you?

669
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,775
- Without telling me.
- Something like that, yeah.

670
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,072
And now Rezian
is gonna send me a list

671
00:33:35,107 --> 00:33:37,148
with his most trusted crew on it,

672
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,922
and everyone who knows
anything about us

673
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:40,662
and the money train
is gonna be on it.

674
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:45,076
L'm trying to help you.
Don't you get that?

675
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:46,393
You think
I would do something

676
00:33:46,428 --> 00:33:49,127
that would let those guns
be in play somewhere else?

677
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:51,827
You think that I would let
three random kids in Chicago

678
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:53,656
get killed
just to save my own?

679
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:56,703
So, now khalulian's busted...
maybe he doesn't give up Rezian,

680
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:58,871
but he's sure as hell gonna
point a finger at you and me.

681
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:01,715
Let him.
Claudette was in on it.

682
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:04,311
She knew
about the bust?

683
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,847
I told her we were
working with the feds

684
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:08,542
on a tip you picked up
from Rezian.

685
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:10,884
It was the only way to pull it
off and keep us in the clear.

686
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:12,862
Khalulian knows about
the money train, too.

687
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:14,635
If he says anything,
our story is

688
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:19,237
that it was a lie you fed
to Rezian to keep him close.

689
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:21,028
So, why did you
keep me in the dark?

690
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:23,747
I don't trust you,
remember?

691
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:26,523
You know what?
That's bullshit.

692
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:29,969
L've done nothing but look out
for you, Corrine, and the kids,

693
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:31,345
and every single thing
that I have told you

694
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,344
has checked out
so far.

695
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:34,731
Hasn't stopped you from
using your secret file

696
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:36,159
to hang over our heads,

697
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:37,596
listing all the shit
we've ever done.

698
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:39,463
You know exactly
why I did that.

699
00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:41,295
L'm the one
standing by you, Vic.

700
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:44,451
You're the one cutting me out,
punishing me.

701
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:45,815
And you know what?

702
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,370
It's a stupid, dangerous game
that you're playing,

703
00:34:48,405 --> 00:34:50,491
because I'm just trying
to help you protect

704
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:52,577
the only thing
that really matters to you.

705
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,086
Interrogation one, Tony.

706
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:03,278
Is that our rapist?

707
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:05,320
He's the guy
who's renting the house...

708
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:07,097
Iooks like
our crime scene.

709
00:35:10,263 --> 00:35:11,918
Hey, um...

710
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:15,366
I, uh, I heard
some of the unis complaining

711
00:35:15,401 --> 00:35:16,971
about the new
administrative duties.

712
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:19,333
You ever think about someone
to assist you permanently?

713
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,539
- You have someone in mind?
- Yeah. Danny.

714
00:35:21,574 --> 00:35:24,791
Danny's a sergeant. I wouldn't
waste her time at a desk.

715
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:26,508
You ever think the reason
you run into problems

716
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:29,707
is the person on that desk
is underused or under qualified?

717
00:35:29,742 --> 00:35:30,921
What are you doing, Dutch?

718
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:33,547
Ever since Lee was born,
she's changed...

719
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:36,104
some kind of maternal
survival instinct.

720
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:38,436
What she wants is something
out of the line of fire.

721
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:39,371
She told you that?

722
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:41,956
Too much pride, but if
you wanted to go that way,

723
00:35:41,991 --> 00:35:44,036
I think you'd
be helping her out.

724
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:47,792
She's already I.D.'d you
for the kidnapping.

725
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:50,538
L'm sure the D.A. Can add
conspiracy to commit rape,

726
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:53,640
plus any additional charges
involving...

727
00:35:53,675 --> 00:35:55,286
crimes against a minor.

728
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,956
Any thoughts?

729
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:02,483
Honestly, I wish
they were all this easy.

730
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:03,874
I never touched her.

731
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:07,252
She had sexual contact
with two other minors...

732
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:08,444
boys her own age.

733
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:10,378
- It wasn't rape.
- It wasn't consensual.

734
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:13,470
What she experienced was a part
of a therapeutic treatment.

735
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,520
Treatment?
For what?

736
00:36:15,555 --> 00:36:17,501
Wan's brother found out

737
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,167
she was involved
in a homosexual relationship.

738
00:36:20,202 --> 00:36:22,799
Joe had assumed the role
as head of the family

739
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:23,819
after his father died.

740
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:26,742
He didn't appreciate
his sister disgracing them.

741
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:29,630
He wanted to spare
his mother from heartbreak.

742
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:35,261
So, her brother hired you to...
rape the lesbian out of her?

743
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:38,078
To show her
a preferable alternative.

744
00:36:38,603 --> 00:36:41,293
And this was supposed to get her
to want more sex with men?

745
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:44,610
I offered positive encouragement
at a critical moment.

746
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:46,802
As far as wan's case
is concerned,

747
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,925
I'm hopeful
it was successful.

748
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,408
You have any proof that Lee
hired you to "treat" his sister?

749
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,100
I have
a signed, legal document

750
00:36:54,135 --> 00:36:57,902
giving me temporary custody over
wan while she was in my care,

751
00:36:58,234 --> 00:37:00,738
and a check for $3,000.

752
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,777
How many stitches?

753
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:05,522
- 19.
- Anything on harms?

754
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,444
I got a "stake and notify"
on his car.

755
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:09,993
And I talked to a neighbor...
she told me that harms

756
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,517
always keeps his dog
in the back, not in the house.

757
00:37:12,552 --> 00:37:15,006
Axl... he's the only one
who knew we were going there.

758
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,118
So I got him
stewing in the Clubhouse.

759
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:23,009
You tipped off harms,
dickwad.

760
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:24,013
Who's harms?

761
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:26,397
He knew
we were coming.

762
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:28,021
He left his pit bull there
to greet us.

763
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:30,371
Now, the only question is,
what did you get out of it?

764
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:33,187
You must be more hooked
into harms than we thought.

765
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:35,969
You're barking up
the wrong tree, fellas, okay?

766
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:39,386
That's for the DEA
to decide now.

767
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:40,882
And the way those guys
like to drag their feet,

768
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:43,580
it will be 9, 10 months
before you get your store back.

769
00:37:43,615 --> 00:37:47,376
Iook, I had no problem
giving up Larry.

770
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:48,721
He's an asshole,

771
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:50,865
but I didn't want to burn
a guy like harms

772
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,552
'cause that's like
a death sentence, all right?

773
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:54,742
Where is he at now?

774
00:37:57,866 --> 00:37:59,821
Where is he at now?!

775
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:02,434
We recovered over 900 guns
from the trucking factory,

776
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:04,230
thanks to
your cooperation.

777
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:07,136
Vendrell's snuggling up
to Rezian seems to be working.

778
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:08,678
Southern charm's
good for something.

779
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:11,344
Thanks for not burning
our Armenian target.

780
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:12,835
With Rezian still in play,

781
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,782
we can get deeper
into the organization...

782
00:38:14,817 --> 00:38:16,428
try to take
the whole thing down.

783
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,982
Well, khalulian's
not talking.

784
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:19,466
Hasn't mentioned
any cops neither,

785
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:22,233
so it looks like your man's
cover is still solid.

786
00:38:22,571 --> 00:38:25,411
Guess he's as loyal
as Rezian says he is.

787
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:41,724
- Where is she?
- In her room.

788
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:45,250
Cassidy, come out here!

789
00:38:49,946 --> 00:38:52,217
Cassidy, get out here!

790
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:54,932
What were you thinking?

791
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:58,742
?? Drinking and you were supposed
to be watching your brother Matthew.

792
00:38:58,777 --> 00:39:00,882
He could have gotten
hurt or worse.

793
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:02,988
- He's 10 years old.
- He's autistic!

794
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:04,687
Nothing happened,
did it?

795
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:06,764
Your brother was walking around
loose on the street.

796
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,625
He's your responsibility,
not mine.

797
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,140
Hey! Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?!

798
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:14,313
- The only parent that's ever around to listen to me.
- Cassidy!

799
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,001
Ow!
You're hurting me!

800
00:39:19,036 --> 00:39:22,862
Don't you ever push your mother
like that! Do you understand?!

801
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:24,858
- It was an accident.
- Vic, let her go!

802
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:26,820
- Do you understand me?!
- Let her go!

803
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:34,467
We didn't raise her
to be like that!

804
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:36,007
You should go.

805
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:38,314
I didn't mean
to grab her that hard.

806
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:40,488
Let me deal
with her, okay?

807
00:39:40,523 --> 00:39:41,874
No, I should apologize.

808
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:43,827
Go now!

809
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:45,761
Now!

810
00:39:58,264 --> 00:39:59,329
You said
we had to move,

811
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,708
and you made me do it
all by myself.

812
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,331
Where were you?

813
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:04,066
I was out.

814
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:06,599
Oh, yeah, you were out.
Stupid me.

815
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:08,726
- No, you talking to Corrine...
- shh!

816
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:11,943
You talking to Corrine...
that was stupid you.

817
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:14,756
I thought somebody had to
do something for Jackson and me

818
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:17,993
because when it comes to Vic,
you don't do shit.

819
00:40:19,557 --> 00:40:20,900
Where's the file?

820
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:22,922
The list of shit
that Vic and I did, Mara.

821
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,537
What did you do with it?!

822
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,070
Here.

823
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:37,709
What did you do?

824
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:42,050
God damn it, Mara.

825
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:43,960
Shane... Shane!

826
00:40:44,323 --> 00:40:45,602
Where are you going
with that?

827
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:46,846
L'm gonna give it
to Vic.

828
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:49,606
- You can't.
- L've already made another copy.

829
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:51,178
L'm sorry.

830
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:53,042
I should've told you.

831
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:55,436
You're always chasing Vic's tail
as if he's most important.

832
00:40:55,471 --> 00:40:58,624
I have to get Vic's family
in the clear again.

833
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:01,778
Once this threat is gone,
we are out of his life.

834
00:41:01,813 --> 00:41:05,262
What about our family?
What about me?

835
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,924
Mara, you and Jackson and the
baby... you always come first.

836
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:09,435
You know that.

837
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:12,139
We just have to be patient
a little while longer.

838
00:41:12,174 --> 00:41:15,038
I owe him
this one last thing.

839
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:19,080
I used to be worried
about Lee not having a sibling.

840
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:20,266
L'm not
so worried anymore.

841
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:22,426
Yeah, um, hey...

842
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:25,994
would you ever consider taking
Claudette's desk full time...

843
00:41:26,472 --> 00:41:28,056
helping her
run this place?

844
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:28,981
Why?

845
00:41:29,016 --> 00:41:31,367
She's been
a little, uh, erratic.

846
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:32,468
You've noticed.

847
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:33,534
Is she all right?

848
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:37,368
I can't get specific,
but she can later if she wants.

849
00:41:37,403 --> 00:41:38,925
No, she's not all right.

850
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,071
If she doesn't get somebody
real good backstopping her,

851
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:42,955
this place
could really suffer.

852
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:46,285
Just think about it,
okay?

853
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:52,835
Mr. Lee's lawyer got a
court order for wan's release.

854
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,053
He's got good timing...
Mr. Lee?

855
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:57,080
You're under arrest.

856
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:58,841
What's the charge?

857
00:41:58,876 --> 00:42:01,367
Kidnapping and
conspiracy to commit rape.

858
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:02,818
Come on,
we're going.

859
00:42:03,427 --> 00:42:06,083
Peter meyers is under arrest,
too. He's upstairs.

860
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:08,368
He's got
some interesting theories

861
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,434
on treating
aberrant sexual behavior.

862
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:12,595
Stick around.
We'll talk about them.

863
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,721
L'll get him printed.
Let's go.

864
00:42:15,093 --> 00:42:16,533
Joe?

865
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,452
Wan!

866
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:23,212
What are you
doing here?

867
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:25,098
- L've been worried about you.
- Go away!

868
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:26,619
But I'm the one...

869
00:42:26,654 --> 00:42:30,135
get away from me!
Stay away from me!

870
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,314
Bite looks bad.
How's the bark?

871
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:47,491
Almost got
my balls chewed off

872
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:50,478
because we went in there
too quick and undermanned.

873
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:52,766
Iook, man, I'm sorry.
I had no choice.

874
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:55,019
We all had choices once
and we made 'em,

875
00:42:55,054 --> 00:42:56,074
and now we got to
live with them.

876
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:59,022
Ronnie, we're gonna get out
of this quicksand.

877
00:43:00,635 --> 00:43:01,931
No, we're not.

878
00:43:02,575 --> 00:43:04,151
Jesus, Vic,
everything we do

879
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:06,639
to get out of this shit
just drags us down deeper,

880
00:43:06,674 --> 00:43:09,093
and hanging with Shane
is gonna push our heads under.

881
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,370
We need Shane
right now.

882
00:43:10,405 --> 00:43:12,488
L'm sick of walking around
half the day

883
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,167
smiling at a guy who
put a grenade in Lem's lap.

884
00:43:15,202 --> 00:43:17,854
Hey, you know what's
at stake here for me.

885
00:43:18,169 --> 00:43:22,012
I do, yeah, but I'm not
gonna drown for Shane...

886
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:23,973
or you.

887
00:43:27,263 --> 00:43:30,261
Hey, Rezian just gave me
his list of names.

888
00:43:30,296 --> 00:43:33,259
Aside from khalulian,
who got swept up tonight,

889
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:35,043
there's only five guys.

890
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:37,531
Think that's everyone who knows
about us and the money train?

891
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:40,235
Aside from diro, who's
in the wind or dead, yeah.

892
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,442
Then what
are we waiting for?

893
00:43:41,477 --> 00:43:44,849
Protecting my family was
only one part of this war.

894
00:43:44,884 --> 00:43:48,335
Tearing Pezuela down is the
other, and I'm not there yet.

895
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:55,276
That's it.

896
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:58,492
That's everything.
There are no copies.

897
00:43:59,275 --> 00:44:00,587
Take it.

898
00:44:03,214 --> 00:44:04,610
It's all I can do.

899
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:08,859
Now I've got nothing
on paper on you guys.

900
00:44:08,894 --> 00:44:12,405
I talked to Mara. The thing
that happened with Corrine...

901
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,253
it'll never happen again.

902
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:19,743
You want
blood from me?

903
00:44:19,778 --> 00:44:22,410
Just break out the goddamn
needle, man, I will give it.

904
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:29,094
- Well, I got to get back.
- Wait.

905
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:35,113
Iook, we all heard
the lies about elm.

906
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:37,234
We knew he was
under pressure and scared...

907
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:39,217
thought he
might have turned.

908
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:43,104
None of us will really know
exactly what he would have done,

909
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,599
but you were the only
one of us who saw him.

910
00:44:48,502 --> 00:44:50,606
Now, I hate it...

911
00:44:51,285 --> 00:44:53,490
and it hurts me...

912
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:55,546
but under the circumstances,

913
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:59,139
you made the only decision
you could at the time.

914
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:00,969
I know that now.

915
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,432
Thank you.

916
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:11,949
Yeah, we're gonna
all get through this

917
00:45:11,984 --> 00:45:14,662
and come through
the other side one day.

918
00:45:15,985 --> 00:45:17,356
Yeah...

919
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:21,691
yeah.

920
00:45:40,328 --> 00:45:44,526
