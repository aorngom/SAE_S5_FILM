1
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:06,756
- I'm going to throw up!
- This is ridiculous!

2
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:08,924
Hold on, I've lost lateral control!

3
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:14,430
This is really not going well!

4
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:15,658
I know!

5
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:17,892
No lift.
I can't get any altitude!

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,200
Bloody hell!

7
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:22,104
Try hitting it with more sedation!

8
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:23,974
I'm already doing that!

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,400
What the hell is wrong with...

10
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:33,491
Magnus, pull up.

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,533
I can't!

12
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:36,704
Pull up now!

13
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:37,955
Dammit!

14
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:40,292
This is going to be nasty.

15
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:45,082
The Team Projet-SG

16
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:46,421
presents:

17
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,633
Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 8
Next Tuesday (v. 1.00)

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:54,137
Timing by: Arrow,
nitrogenc, Salomon.

19
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:13,198
http://projet-sg.net

20
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:15,617
Just come on.

21
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,493
Just say it with me once...

22
00:01:18,372 --> 00:01:19,369
Reykjavik.

23
00:01:19,494 --> 00:01:21,679
- I love that word.
- You've told me a dozen times.

24
00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:23,743
But I'm talking vodka, good food,

25
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:25,395
fresh-faced women

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,503
with names like "Goodmansdottir"...

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,907
Stimulating conversation
under intricate ice sculptures...

28
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:35,175
Will, I've already told you,
you can't go to the conference.

29
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:37,811
- Why?
- Some things have come up.

30
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:40,683
- Things? What things?
- Well, for starters,

31
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:44,437
our sensors have picked up a very rare
abnormal in the gulf of Mexico.

32
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:46,689
And?

33
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:51,235
Mutated Vampyroteuthis Infernalis,
a vampire squid,

34
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,812
incredibly shy. I've only ever
encountered one once before,

35
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:56,688
60-odd years ago
in French Polynesia.

36
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:58,463
Okay, so a shy vampire.

37
00:01:58,925 --> 00:01:59,952
There's a first.

38
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:01,814
Actually, the name is misleading.

39
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,081
They're amazingly intelligent
and very docile.

40
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,876
They're called vampire
not because of a violent predilection,

41
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,316
but more because
of their superior intellect.

42
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:12,381
- This is fascinating, it really is...
- The beacon is coming from

43
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,443
an abandoned oil rig
off the Louisiana coast.

44
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,636
So one of our retrieval teams
will pick it up, bring it back, boom.

45
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:20,086
They're all in mission mode.

46
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:23,021
I'd rather not interrupt them
for something as simple as this.

47
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:26,145
We will charter a helicopter
in New Orleans and fly out there.

48
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,396
Take Kate.

49
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,981
Kate can't dive. I need you.

50
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:37,525
I'll miss the opening reception,
but I still can give my presentation.

51
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,658
- Fine, I'll go.
- Actually, no.

52
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,912
I need you here
for the next few days.

53
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,079
Why?

54
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,251
I have a meeting in Berlin
with my U.N. security council liaison.

55
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,504
- Very time sensitive.
- Henry?

56
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,048
- He's in Tasmania surfing.
- The Big Guy?

57
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,174
Is with him.

58
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,656
Is not ready for an extended period
of being in charge.

59
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:02,033
No, because I told you
about this trip months ago, okay?

60
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,409
I'm a guest speaker.
They're giving me a nice hotel room.

61
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,560
- I'm touring fjords.
- There's always next year.

62
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,179
Which is next year.

63
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:12,239
I'm sorry, Will.
This is not a request.

64
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:56,026
You all right?

65
00:03:57,045 --> 00:03:58,195
I don't know.

66
00:03:58,484 --> 00:04:01,532
My door kind of gave way
when we... stopped.

67
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:05,807
What about you?

68
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,747
Any landing
you can swim away from...

69
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:12,208
What is it with you
and flying, anyway?

70
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:15,629
Two crashes in 158 years,
that's not bad.

71
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,651
They only invented flying
110 years ago, so...

72
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:24,972
Great.

73
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,866
We lost our air tanks

74
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:28,591
and half our scuba gear.

75
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:31,896
And our friend as well.

76
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:37,878
- You think it's still around here?
- I'm sure it's long gone.

77
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:40,237
This bore well leads to open water.

78
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,271
- Another rare abnormal stays rare.
- Dammit, and we had him.

79
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:23,281
I've never seen something so big

80
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,778
fit into such a small container.

81
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:28,053
Cephalopod.

82
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:31,565
Thankfully, a very
passive one at that.

83
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,417
This one doesn't seem too pleased
that we captured it.

84
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,378
It's much safer with us, believe me.

85
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,338
These creatures are so passive,

86
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:43,717
they're often killed by other species
very early in their life cycle.

87
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,507
Welcome to your new home...

88
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:48,806
Squidly.

89
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,433
We will not be calling it that.

90
00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:55,635
There are far more inappropriate
nicknames I could give it.

91
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,440
- I'm sure there are.
- Good, there's still time.

92
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,447
For what?

93
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:04,514
The red eye, New Orleans.
Connecting through Halifax,

94
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,531
landing in the lovely city
of Reykjavik,

95
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:08,504
the capital of Iceland.

96
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:10,911
Come on, Magnus.

97
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,201
I know Kate
is not your first choice,

98
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:16,015
but can't she just
hold the fort down for a couple days?

99
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,751
I'm not gonna be gone that long.

100
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,753
I'm sure she can.

101
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:22,881
See, that's the Magnus
I know and love.

102
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:25,266
But the answer is still no.

103
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:27,416
Prep it for flight, please.

104
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,337
The radio's broken or there's far
too much concrete and steel in here

105
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:48,336
for us to get a transmission out.

106
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:51,160
Meaning nobody can pick up
the chopper's transponder signal.

107
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,434
How deep do you think this goes?

108
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:07,468
70 feet, maybe more.

109
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,150
- Without scuba gear...
- It's much too far for us

110
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,806
to try to dive to the bottom.

111
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,702
Okay, here's what I think.

112
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:21,072
Once we don't check in for a while,
those people we rented the chopper from

113
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:22,733
will come looking for us, right?

114
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,776
Isn't that
how it's supposed to work?

115
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:27,532
And if they follow
the bogus flight plan that I filed,

116
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,344
they'll be looking for us
200 miles west of here.

117
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:35,704
It's how we keep
our work private, Will.

118
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:45,714
According to the mission plan,
we're due back tomorrow night.

119
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,907
Once we don't show up,
Kate's got to get suspicious,

120
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,533
she'll just probably...

121
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:53,011
Right, right, you're right.

122
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:56,137
We're totally screwed.

123
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,001
I'm sorry about
your trip to Greenland.

124
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:16,481
Iceland.
It's Iceland.

125
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:19,356
I'm sorry your trip
to Iceland was scuttled,

126
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:22,807
but obviously we have a far more
important problem on our hands.

127
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,381
We always do.

128
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,796
What's that supposed to mean?

129
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:33,637
What does it mean?
It means whatever you want it to...

130
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:47,248
It's all right.

131
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,676
It just shifted position.

132
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,726
You think it'll hold?

133
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,824
If the crash didn't bring it down,
I doubt we can.

134
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:56,081
All I know is

135
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:59,979
the deposit you gave
the rental company's history.

136
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:05,982
Maybe everything you heard
about this creature is wrong.

137
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:09,244
Maybe they're not
as docile as you think.

138
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:10,431
Nonsense.

139
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:12,134
We captured it easily enough.

140
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:14,182
It offered no resistance.

141
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,724
Something freaked it out.

142
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,306
Flying,
or the vibrations from the rotors,

143
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,881
different altitude.

144
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:25,397
Its container was specially designed
to mimic its preferred atmosphere.

145
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:27,693
It should have been fine.

146
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,486
How did it go
from happy-go-lucky Cephalopod

147
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,156
to air-rage squid
in a matter of a minute?

148
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,462
I don't know.

149
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,213
I should be learning
Icelandic phrases right now

150
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:54,343
and discussing psychoanalytic theory
over cocktails.

151
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,027
Yes, instead, you're
stuck here with me.

152
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,193
You know what I mean.

153
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:01,568
Actually, I do.

154
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,301
This isn't about conferences
or ice sculptures.

155
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:08,732
It's about some immature tryst
with a woman you barely know.

156
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,631
Excuse me?

157
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:14,321
Dr. Halstrom, or should I say Sigrid,
your Internet chat friend?

158
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:15,996
Internet chat friend?

159
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,320
She happens to be
the foremost authority

160
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:21,196
on deviant psychology in Scandinavia,
thank you very much.

161
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,762
- An attractive element in a woman...
- She has a PHD!

162
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,540
Really, it's about priorities.

163
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:28,543
My priorities? What is this,
an employee training seminar?

164
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,389
Why did you want me to stay, anyways,
other than to ruin my fun?

165
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:33,924
Do not pretend that this is
some giant intellectual loss.

166
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,951
This is about your libido.

167
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:38,762
Come on. If you think that this
is all about me chasing...

168
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:41,306
- Do not get self-righteous with me...
- Hold on.

169
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,474
What?

170
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:45,018
Something just swam past my leg.

171
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:46,228
What?

172
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:49,426
Maybe that unhappy vampire squid

173
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,401
- that we have in here with us.
- It's miles away by now.

174
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:54,951
No, I'm telling you...

175
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,779
Something is in here with us.

176
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,617
Something just swam past my leg,
and it's slimy...

177
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,770
You all right?

178
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,761
I'm miles away from all right.

179
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:51,760
You said it would break
for open water.

180
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:53,135
It should have.

181
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:56,948
- Then why is it still here?
- I don't know.

182
00:11:57,512 --> 00:11:59,217
And why does it hate me so much?

183
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:02,304
It might have marked this
as its territory.

184
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:04,825
Wonderful news.

185
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,315
I've never seen such aggressive behavior
in this species.

186
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:10,354
You might want
to get out of the water.

187
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:11,887
Good idea.

188
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:23,982
I'm gonna fry you up...

189
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,568
A little tartar sauce...

190
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:36,195
I think those tentacles
gave me a rash.

191
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:40,232
I've got an idea.

192
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:43,456
Why don't we just shoot it?

193
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:46,272
- I'd prefer not to. It's a very...
- Rare species of abnormal.

194
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:47,349
Right.

195
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:51,311
What we need to do

196
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,960
is send it a clear message,

197
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:55,607
at least until we figure out
why it's behaving this way.

198
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,745
Incoming!

199
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:41,027
- It's really pissed now.
- Do not touch the water!

200
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:52,497
Okay, do it!

201
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:54,339
Clear!

202
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,011
You okay?

203
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,215
That seemed to have worked.

204
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:12,445
For now.

205
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:14,725
It'll be back, and...

206
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,521
Battery's pretty much dead.

207
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,225
Thanks for...

208
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:35,355
Of course.

209
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:42,170
So what now?

210
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,365
Well, we can't send an SOS.

211
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,735
Eventually someone will notice us
missing and start a search.

212
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:51,225
In the meantime, I want to know
what turned this creature violent...

213
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:54,555
Come on, we should change.
Otherwise, we'll freeze to death.

214
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:04,027
I'll change somewhere else.

215
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,285
Maybe...

216
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:21,753
Maybe it's environmental.

217
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:25,215
Something from the rig
is poisoning its food supply.

218
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,945
No, scans didn't indicate
any sea water anomalies.

219
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,710
Fine, then it's just
a crazy giant squid.

220
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:35,141
Honestly, they are one of the most
docile creatures in the entire ocean.

221
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,436
You got to stop using that word
to describe it, because it's not docile.

222
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:41,773
It feeds on plankton,
it lives in coral caves,

223
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,025
it can create entire Mandelbrot

224
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,440
mathematical patterns
on the floor of the ocean.

225
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:49,010
I have never known one
to attack another life form.

226
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:51,520
Really? What about
bringing down a chopper?

227
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,095
Because this one did.

228
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:58,295
40 MINUTES PLUS TÔT

229
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:56,549
Delegates from around the world

230
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:58,025
are going to be there!

231
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:03,620
Plus, there's an intense discussion
group on amygdaline mutation!

232
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,925
I think it would really
benefit our work!

233
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:08,815
Would you tie off
the other side, please?

234
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,395
Anyway, I think my being there would

235
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,920
expand my knowledge of
cutting-edge psychological theory!

236
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:20,545
The cross-over in treating abnormals
would be endless!

237
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:24,505
Could you sit in the back, please?
Just in case it needs sedation!

238
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:26,975
Really?

239
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:28,865
It seems fine.

240
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:32,585
Better safe than sorry!
Sea creatures rarely like flying!

241
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:36,145
All right.

242
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:51,593
All set?

243
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,261
Let's go.

244
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:14,745
Fuselage is intact.

245
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:17,715
- What the hell made us crash?
- I remember a loud noise

246
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:19,925
and then the Squidapus went insane,

247
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,280
maybe it just really
didn't like flying.

248
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:24,405
Possibly,

249
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,955
though why it's still upset
is anyone's guess.

250
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,539
Antenna's broken.
Means the radio is definitely out.

251
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:53,325
I should have come clean to you
about Sigrid. I'm sorry.

252
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,860
What you do in your own time
is your own business,

253
00:17:57,985 --> 00:17:59,911
just so long
as it doesn't affect our work.

254
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:01,559
Granted, but...

255
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:04,815
What's wrong with taking
a little time off?

256
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,503
Things have been pretty hectic
around here.

257
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,755
What's your point, Will?

258
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,762
Don't you ever want to take a break?

259
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:19,765
Not really.

260
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:24,735
Stranded.

261
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:33,645
We've got some flares.
We could wait till night,

262
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,029
fire them off.

263
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,835
Flares only work if there's
someone in the vicinity to see them.

264
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,746
This rig is miles
from the nearest shipping lanes.

265
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:46,207
You must have been
stranded at sea before.

266
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:47,765
Only once.

267
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:50,170
April 14th, 1912.

268
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,881
Really?

269
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,902
I wonder how they serviced
the drill apparatus when it was in here.

270
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:09,981
Do you see right up there,
right up by the lights?

271
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,527
I bet you those air vents
double as maintenance portals.

272
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:16,780
And the pattern continues
down below.

273
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,410
How far do you think down that is?
30, 40 feet?

274
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:24,645
That's doable as a free dive, right?

275
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,885
We take the transponder
from the helicopter,

276
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:35,095
we swim down to the portal,
out to the surface, and signal for help.

277
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:38,218
Unless, of course,

278
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,455
the docile squid
attacks us before then.

279
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:43,355
If it attacks both of us,

280
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:44,808
we don't stand a chance.

281
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,476
But...

282
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,725
- if one of us were to stay here...
- What, like as a distraction?

283
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,735
It seems to hate you more.

284
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:53,983
Yeah, it really does, doesn't it?

285
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,745
- All right?
- Hold on a second.

286
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:07,185
All right.

287
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:08,706
You're good to go.

288
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:12,175
All right,

289
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,045
if I make it out...

290
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:16,105
Throw me down a sandwich.

291
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,340
And an Uzi.

292
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:21,469
Sure you're all right?

293
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:39,445
Okay, so when you say priorities...

294
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,527
Does that include drowning?

295
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:46,635
Thank you.

296
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,000
Don't thank me.

297
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,675
The system purged itself.
You got lucky.

298
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:09,425
Of course!

299
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:11,973
What?

300
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,945
Why didn't I think of this earlier?

301
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:18,485
If we can salvage enough wiring,

302
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:22,108
we run an extension
from the radio's internal antenna...

303
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,676
Right to the wall.

304
00:23:24,255 --> 00:23:26,825
We can use the entire rig
to boost the signal.

305
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:30,185
But isn't the battery almost dead?

306
00:23:30,695 --> 00:23:33,275
We should be able
to get one last transmission out.

307
00:23:34,415 --> 00:23:35,415
All right.

308
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,665
Bring on the Hail Mary.

309
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,935
What?
It's worth a shot.

310
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:54,895
All right.

311
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,420
Start with the avionic wiring.

312
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:59,187
We definitely
don't need that anymore.

313
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:01,025
All right.

314
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,107
Rip as much wire as you can.

315
00:24:03,845 --> 00:24:05,095
Start splicing.

316
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:25,885
- So you never go on vacation?
- I travel all the time. You know that.

317
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,025
Yeah, on missions or for research.

318
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:29,815
I'm talking about...

319
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:31,885
flopping down on a beach

320
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:33,346
with a good book,

321
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,525
a never-ending supply of mojitos.

322
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:38,295
I own a villa in Italy,

323
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:40,485
on Capri, near Naples.

324
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:42,230
I go there every seven years.

325
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:43,775
Seven years?

326
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:46,015
For a long weekend.

327
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:48,915
I take it back.

328
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:51,170
You really do know how to unwind.

329
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:54,055
That's about as long
as I can stand doing nothing.

330
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:55,635
British, remember?

331
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:58,560
Wait a second.
Let me get this straight.

332
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:01,207
You own a villa in Italy,
and you never told me about it?

333
00:25:02,825 --> 00:25:04,752
I own a lot of things
you don't know about.

334
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:05,995
Really?

335
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:08,506
What about a working helicopter?

336
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:11,155
Yeah, several.

337
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:16,705
She's nice, you know.

338
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:18,445
Sigrid.

339
00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:21,435
She's friendly and charming.

340
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:24,897
She's chair of advanced psychology
at Stockholm University.

341
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:27,150
She sounds lovely.

342
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,196
Ever since Clara,
things have been kind of...

343
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,406
Lonely.

344
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:37,935
Goes with the territory, I'm afraid.

345
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:43,660
Doesn't it make us all

346
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:45,635
more productive if we have,

347
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:47,975
normal healthy relationships?

348
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:50,673
You're not being serious, are you?

349
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,301
What am I talking about?

350
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:54,135
Nothing we do is normal.

351
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,210
I don't think
that occasional loneliness

352
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:00,555
is too high a price to pay
for what we do.

353
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:02,101
Maybe you do.

354
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,188
You just should have told me about it
when you recruited me.

355
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:08,020
But you never would have
taken the job.

356
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:10,109
- Probably not.
- And you'd be miserable.

357
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:15,531
So, what's your cover with Sigrid,
greeting card salesman?

358
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,535
Fire insurance.

359
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:23,122
Oh, God...

360
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,775
All right, ready?

361
00:26:25,355 --> 00:26:26,705
Hang on a second.

362
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,020
You think this'll work?

363
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:43,726
It should do. I've never been
stranded for too long.

364
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:49,857
The Titanic?

365
00:26:52,325 --> 00:26:54,540
I was fished out of the water
by Molly Brown.

366
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:56,113
She hauled me into her life raft.

367
00:26:58,995 --> 00:27:00,345
I was very lucky.

368
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,025
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

369
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,792
This is A-Star 350,

370
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:10,745
N-0-X-1-7-J.

371
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:12,450
Aircraft down.

372
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:14,470
Requesting immediate assistance.

373
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:15,595
We are at

374
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,645
27 degrees North by 89 degrees West.

375
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:22,295
Two souls onboard.

376
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:24,934
Mayday, mayday, mayday...

377
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:27,575
Come on...

378
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:33,505
Battery's gone.

379
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:37,825
You weren't kidding
about the Hail Mary.

380
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,215
We've any food?

381
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,935
There's MREs in my gear bag.

382
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:54,964
Did you move it?

383
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,715
It was right there.

384
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:01,929
Maybe it got knocked into the water.

385
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:06,390
You don't think it took it, do you?

386
00:28:06,515 --> 00:28:07,815
What, the squid?

387
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:10,396
After the shock we gave it,
highly unlikely.

388
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:14,785
Besides, it wouldn't be remotely
interested in our emergency rations.

389
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:18,659
They're kind of a last resort
for me too.

390
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:32,005
What is this?

391
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:43,429
Some kind of residue the squid
left behind when it attacked?

392
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:47,141
Adult vampire squid don't secrete
anything remotely like this.

393
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:48,726
Then, what the hell...

394
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:54,205
Quiet.

395
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:08,525
Holy crap.

396
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:16,430
Don't tell me it's another squid.

397
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,205
Maybe one of its young.

398
00:29:18,445 --> 00:29:22,140
It explains why it gave us such
a hard time when we tried to take off.

399
00:29:22,265 --> 00:29:23,265
Now,

400
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,995
we have to be extremely careful
not to hurt or frighten it.

401
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,777
That is definitely not
a baby vampire squid!

402
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:58,205
Southern hemispheric sea scorpion!

403
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,330
Very rare.

404
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:01,500
Extremely dangerous!

405
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,135
How the hell did it get
inside the chopper?

406
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:07,365
I knew I wasn't that bad a pilot.

407
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,612
- I think I'm gonna throw up!
- This is ridiculous!

408
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:25,781
Hold on, I've lost lateral control!

409
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:31,495
Okay, this is really not going well!

410
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,763
Looks like it climbed onto the tail
as we took off.

411
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:37,415
Crawled inside the exhaust louver.

412
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,200
It must have got trapped
in the engine compartment.

413
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:41,930
That's why I lost flight control.

414
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:44,755
I thought vampire squid
weren't aggressive,

415
00:30:45,435 --> 00:30:47,300
that other creatures
killed them off.

416
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:49,775
Yeah, ordinarily,
they're the victim.

417
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:52,117
It could be that the sea scorpion
is one of the species

418
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:53,809
that triggers its fight response.

419
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:57,860
Both these creatures must have claimed
the rig as their territory.

420
00:30:57,985 --> 00:30:59,732
They'll fight to the death
if we let them.

421
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:01,735
So it's a turf war?

422
00:31:02,016 --> 00:31:03,652
- Wonderful.
- It must have sensed

423
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,322
its adversary was nearby
when we loaded it into the chopper.

424
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:09,105
But see,

425
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:12,320
if the scorpion hates the squid so much,
why doesn't it just jump into the water,

426
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:14,116
and they can, you know, do battle?

427
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:16,130
It's a bottom-dwelling
arachnid amphibian.

428
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:18,083
It can't swim. The squid can.

429
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:21,420
So it needs solid ground
to settle the score.

430
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,547
They're actually very well suited
as enemies.

431
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:27,175
The sea scorpion is also
more intelligent than it looks.

432
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,802
It's just incredibly vicious.

433
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:31,005
It's the vicious part
that I'm worried about,

434
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,522
not so much the smart.

435
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:47,154
It unlocked the hatch?
How did it know how to unlock the hatch?

436
00:31:48,795 --> 00:31:50,407
I told you it was intelligent!

437
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:51,992
Hold on, I'm coming!

438
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:56,585
Will, you have to load the harpoon!

439
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,040
What is it about me that makes
these things hate me so much?

440
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:09,593
- Where is it?
- To the other side! I can't see it!

441
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,745
It's coming 'round this side!

442
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:25,785
Hello, beastie.

443
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:20,368
The other hatches are sealed.
This should hold it for now.

444
00:33:40,295 --> 00:33:41,745
I now officially...

445
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,187
hate seafood.

446
00:33:43,595 --> 00:33:46,500
We have to get these two creatures
as far away from us as possible.

447
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:47,625
Agreed.

448
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:49,115
But how?

449
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,865
We drop the chopper.

450
00:33:58,475 --> 00:33:59,975
Scorpion can't swim,

451
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:02,860
the squid won't leave
until it gets the scorpion.

452
00:34:02,985 --> 00:34:05,850
We cut the helicopter loose,
squid will follow it down.

453
00:34:05,975 --> 00:34:07,590
How are we gonna do that?

454
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:09,630
The acetylene torch
from my diving kit.

455
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,340
It should be able to cut the wires.

456
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:13,312
Hold on a second.

457
00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:15,895
We're gonna use...

458
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:19,905
a torch on top of
a fuel-soaked chopper

459
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:22,460
that has a sea scorpion
trapped inside

460
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:25,485
so the giant vampire squid
will follow it down?

461
00:34:25,975 --> 00:34:27,425
Sounds like a plan.

462
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:29,915
No beaches.

463
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:31,245
No mojitos.

464
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,995
No fancy villas.

465
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,795
These cables are really thick.

466
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:06,350
It'll take me forever
to get through.

467
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:08,625
Just try weakening
the major stress points.

468
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:22,915
So the UN.

469
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,005
Yeah, what about it?

470
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:29,376
Why does the liaison
want to meet with you?

471
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:35,749
He wants to talk about how I exposed
Emma Correia as a mole in our network.

472
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,676
In person?

473
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:42,681
You averted a major security breach.
Couldn't you just do a teleconference?

474
00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:44,710
I don't mind.

475
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:47,035
Munich's lovely this time of year.

476
00:35:52,895 --> 00:35:54,777
You mean... Berlin.

477
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:59,205
Right.
Yes, of course, I mean Berlin.

478
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:05,204
- Because you said Munich.
- Yeah, both are in Germany, Will.

479
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:21,325
But isn't Munich where...

480
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:23,105
Olaf lives?

481
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:25,098
Who?

482
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:29,205
You think I don't know about you
and Olaf Von Ausburg?

483
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:33,650
Super-rich guy,
he owns the Bremen soccer club.

484
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,775
I haven't seen him in decades.

485
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:40,408
You look me in the eye,

486
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:43,479
and tell me that you were
gonna meet the UN liaison

487
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:45,369
and not Olaf.

488
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:53,418
I appreciate the offer, Olaf,
but it's not a good time right now.

489
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:56,505
<i>It never is, Helen.</i>

490
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,200
I don't know why you keep asking.

491
00:36:58,325 --> 00:37:01,677
<i>Because even you need
some time off once in a while,</i>

492
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:04,985
<i>especially after everything
you've been through.</i>

493
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:06,795
<i>Please.</i>

494
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:09,805
<i>Let me be there for you, hmm?</i>

495
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:12,225
<i>You need this.</i>

496
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:19,510
He offered me a weekend away.
I was considering going.

497
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:21,135
I knew it!

498
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,970
It was a romantic getaway,
wasn't it?

499
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:26,583
It's my prerogative
how I spend my personal time.

500
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,515
But when I try to get away,

501
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,956
I get the speech about priorities?
Double standard much?

502
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:33,417
- I'm doing this a lot longer than you.
- Which I respect,

503
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:36,628
but just don't give me a hard time
when I try to take care of myself.

504
00:37:37,365 --> 00:37:38,865
Please. With Sigrid?

505
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:41,466
You can do much better than that.

506
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:44,180
And Olaf is some prize catch?

507
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,178
The guy looks like
a Maserati salesman.

508
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:51,184
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'm not going.

509
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,479
Why?

510
00:37:57,865 --> 00:37:59,735
Far too many things going on.

511
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,045
That clears the air.

512
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:05,145
Well...

513
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:09,077
I think you should have taken him up
on his offer.

514
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:14,291
Look out!

515
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,667
Will, hold on!

516
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,519
Don't move!

517
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:29,325
I know.

518
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:39,149
Any sudden movement,
and it will strike!

519
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,197
Will, look out!

520
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,715
Get out of there!

521
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:14,615
That's not good.

522
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,563
As long as the chopper's above water,
the squid can't win.

523
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,515
We have to end this, and now!

524
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:24,861
Well, that thing ain't coming down
any time soon,

525
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:27,447
not without something stronger
to cut those cables.

526
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,175
Stay here.

527
00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:40,355
Where are you going?

528
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,080
How deep can you dive?

529
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,915
Light it up!

530
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:57,145
You just blew the whole thing!
It's just gone!

531
00:40:59,515 --> 00:41:03,335
You're crazy, you know that?
You're absolutely certifiably insane.

532
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:05,315
That was pretty cool.

533
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,490
Cool, yeah!

534
00:41:06,705 --> 00:41:09,905
That was, like,
James Bond, Die Hard cool.

535
00:41:10,755 --> 00:41:12,594
Better than room service
in Reykjavik?

536
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:16,125
Way better.

537
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:20,811
Never let it be said that I don't know
how to show someone a good time.

538
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,396
You got it, believe me.

539
00:41:36,186 --> 00:41:37,624
Tuesday is Ashley's birthday.

540
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:42,833
That's the reason
I wanted you to stay. I just...

541
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:45,418
I didn't know how to ask you.

542
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,560
I guess it didn't help that I was...

543
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:56,844
desperately trying
to get away to Iceland.

544
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:05,775
It's hard, isn't it?

545
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:07,983
To find someone worth a damn.

546
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:12,545
You're kidding, right?
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

547
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:18,785
You didn't just make that joke.

548
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,077
You didn't just make
that joke right here.

549
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:22,841
- You laughed.
- No, I didn't.

550
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,385
It was derisively, out of pity.

551
00:42:25,805 --> 00:42:26,960
A laugh's a laugh.

552
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:30,425
I was just choking
on helicopter fuel.

553
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:42,925
You know...

554
00:42:43,785 --> 00:42:45,687
We sent up
a pretty good flare just now.

555
00:42:46,295 --> 00:42:47,345
I think so.

556
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,345
You think anybody'll see it?

557
00:42:53,795 --> 00:42:54,945
I don't know.

558
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,281
With my luck...

559
00:43:00,385 --> 00:43:02,616
Seriously, how are we gonna
get out of here?
