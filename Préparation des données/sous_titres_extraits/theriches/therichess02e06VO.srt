00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,970
Previously on the riches...

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:03,840
What*******?

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,310
In the woodswhere you buried it.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,460
I want to give it to pete.

5
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,200
You can't bribe pete.

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,670
I have to try.

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,920
What did you dowith pete?

8
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,540
You ... you killed him.

9
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,060
I hit him,and then ...but he fought back.

10
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,780
What if someonecomes looking for him?

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,470
You said yourselfhe didn't have any friends.

12
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,170
What happened with pete?

13
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,340
Did he take the money?

14
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,890
Pete went home.

15
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,160
Doug rich?

16
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,570
I'm a private investigator.

17
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,330
I'm trying to locatepete mincey.

18
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,340

Nina.Jim.

27
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,520
Well,at least I'm not gay.

28
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,410
Hi,cherien.

29
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,430
Uh,this is wes.

30
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,830
He and jim are friends.

31
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,290
I guess you could say
we've cometo an understanding.

32
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:00,140
I just want a chance,you know,to change my life.

33
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,540
And I want to stop lying.

34
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,730
Cal,why are you livingin a tent in the yard?

35
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,220
He thinks the houseis stealing our souls.

36
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,380
I'd rather be piss-poorwith my dad than
$13 million richerwith whoever you are.

37
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,870
Where you headed,cal?

38
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,010
Just hitting the road.

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,550
This is rosaleen.

40
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,690
Hi.

41
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,190

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,320
I'm chet landry.

47
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,850
I'm a private investigator.

48
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,730
My husbanddo something wrong?

49
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,860
No,no.

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
I'm looking for pete mincey.

51
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,090
You're looking for pete?

52
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,000
Would you like to sit down,
or ... something to drink?

53
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,150
Uh,I'm fine.

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,800
- This good?
- Sure.

55
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you.

56
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,530
So,pete is missing?

57
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,150
Well,he's disappeared.

58
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,830
His mother hired meto find him.

59
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,020
You haven't seen him recently,
have you,mrs.Rich?

60
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,700
Well,sure!

61
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,110
He came to visit me andmy
husband about a week ago,

62
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,480
and he was in towna couple nights.

63
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,560
- Mr.Landry ...
- uh,please,please,call me chet.

64
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,040
Chet ... why do you thinkhe is missing?

65
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,770
Well,his mama's birthdaycame and went,

66
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,380
and she didn't get a callfrom her boy.

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,220
She became worried.

68
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,380
She had her neighborcontact me.

69
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,640
I'm an old friend.

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,640
- Of pete's mother's?
- Of the neighbors.

71
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,060
So,you don't actually know pete.

72
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,170
No.

73
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,510
And,uh,I hope she alsocalled the police.

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,340
- Oh,I convinced her not to.
- Really?

75
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,070
Oh,I find police work in these
matters sloppyand incompetent.

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,640
- Really?
- Yeah.

77
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,290
Mrs.Rich,I'm afraidI have to ask you something

78
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,470
that's not gonna be easy for youto talk about.

79
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,080
His mother mentionedthat you
and pete might have had a special.

80
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,980
relationship.

81
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,720
- What?
- That he loved you,mrs.Rich.

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,890
Oh,I see.

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,590
Now,I've spoken toleif solberg,his therapist,

84
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,020
and apparently,pete called him

85
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,980
while he was here and saidhe
was in a kind of a crisis.

86
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,160
Now,that crisisdidn't involve you,did it?

87
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,060
Did your husband find out
about the relationship?

88
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,580
Did pete and dougperhaps have an argument?

89
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,030
No.

90
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,880
Look,I got to be honestwith you ...

91
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,710
he may have had feelingsfor me,

92
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,380
but he never,everacted on them.

93
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,860
You know what I mean?

94
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,670
I mean,he was goingthrough so much.

95
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,430
I had no idea.

96
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,460
I mean,if I had,maybe I could have helped him.

97
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,630
So if you hadany information,I would
hope thatyou would come forward.

98
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,440
Oh,yeah.

99
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,010
Just trying to think.

100
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,910
what?

101
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,970
Oh,my god.

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,780
He ... okay,he came over for dinner,

103
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,260
and he was telling usall about losing
his job and his divorce and all.

104
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,920
And then he said,at one point,

105
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,190
I wish I could just walk away,
just start all over again.

106
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,560
I mean,I knew he was unhappy,but.

107
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,870
I guess I ...I didn't know to what extent.

108
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,510
You don't write much down,do you,mr.Landry?

109
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,940
I do not.

110
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,490
I keep most of it up here.

111
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,600
This ... this notebook'sjust a crutch.

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,420
Sort of likea security blanket,huh?

113
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,860
I think I've taken upenough of your time.

114
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,290
Sorry I'm the bearerof bad news.

115
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
That's all right.

116
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,120
I just assumed your husband would
have told youall about it.

117
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,440
You talked to my husband?

118
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,460
Well,of course.

119
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,980
Best friend missing and all ...
I'm surprisedhe didn't mention it.

120
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,040
You have a nice day now,mrs.Rich.

124
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,080
Chet landry?

125
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,440
What the hell?

126
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,090
I was gonna tell you about him.

127
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,920
I didn't know that you talked to
him until he was leaving,wayne!

128
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,530
How could you be so goddamn careless?Huh?

129
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,330
We could have got our stories mixed up.

130
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,980
You're right.I have been just so worried about

131
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,140
this bayou hills thing that ...

132
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,550
you understand we're a P.I.'S wet dream.

133
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,280
He could have seen a picture of doug
and cherien on the internet,you know?

134
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,110
No,no.We've been careful,baby.

135
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,880
Cal went through every photo,
and he switched them out.

136
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,330
What if he had a picture of
doug and cherien on him?

137
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,950
Huh?Maybe that happened.Shit!

138
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,590
He's not looking for the riches.

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,260
He's looking for pete.

140
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,640
So now we stick to the plan.

141
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,830
To do the con,we close the deal in one month.

142
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,540
We get our money,and we are gone.

143
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,180
No one's heard from pete since he left our place.

144
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,580
I figured.

145
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,560
There's no time for love.Contractors are here.

146
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,130
We got to hit our bids on bayou hills.

147
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,760
And I need to talk to you.

148
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,950
Ah ... one minute.

149
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,860
We have to be together on this,wayne ...

150
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,200
completely together,completely honest.

151
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,170
Of course.

152
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,140
Hey,you.

153
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,200
How you feeling this morning?

154
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,700
Fine.

155
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,830
Wondering how the hell I ended up in this place.

156
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,250
Stop the bullshit.

157
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,490
You lured me here.

158
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,140
Don't you want to be here?

159
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,910
Itching to move.

160
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,420
Well,I'd really like it if you stayed a while.

161
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,160
Want to meet quinn?

162
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,030
Eamon quinn?

163
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,160
Didn't he kill people with the tire iron?

164
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,760
When'd he get out of prison?

165
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,500
A little while ago,
but he's really happy you're here.

166
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,450
He knows who I am.

167
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,980
He's heard of you.

168
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,930
Come on.

169
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,440
Well,well,well.

170
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,420
Cal malloy.

171
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,600
How does it feel to be home?

172
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,660
Strange way to come home.

173
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,450
We're having a campfire dinner tonight.

174
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,600
Everyone wants to welcome you in.

175
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,710
That's very nice.

176
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,140
That surprises you?

177
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,540
All the attention makes you feel uncomfortable?

178
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,950
People here think highly of you,cal.

179
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,860
Don't fight it.

180
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,290
Not interested in fighting.

181
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,020
Oh,it's written all over your face.

182
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,370
You don't know what's written all over me.

183
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,970
I know that you've traveled a long way,cal malloy,

184
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,170
and I know that you've arrived.

185
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,320
I got a problem,doug.

186
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,570
The meeting'sabout to start.

187
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,760
I need 500 signaturesby the end of the
day,or I can't run for mayor.

188
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,840
500?

189
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,600
Who's got time to stand on the damn street corner?

190
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,540
- I'll handle it.
- This is the problem with democracy.

191
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,200
I'll handle it.

192
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,300
That is musicto my ears,doug,

193
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,430
'cause I promised gee-gee shecould be my
campaign manager,so I need this to happen.

194
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,810
Aubrey,give me the list of ducaine
parishregistered voters.

195
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,980
I'm concerned about you,di di.

196
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,730
You've missed a few daysof school,

197
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,190
and after what happenedwith your
brother,things okay at home?

198
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,040
They're fine.

199
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,790
All of your teachers saythe same thing ...

200
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,440
this is a girl with a future ...
law school or medical school.

201
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,540
They're impressed,but they're also concerned.

202
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,800
You seem.

203
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,260
detached.

204
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,040
You don't seemto apply yourself.

205
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,680
So you want meto apply myself?

206
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,050
Let me ask you,di di ...

207
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,350
do you want to sleepthrough life,
or do you want to beextraordinary?

208
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,050
Well,I ... I don't wantto sleep through life.

209
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,850
Well,good.

210
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,240
Let's get to work,then.

211
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,430
Have you thoughtabout extracurriculars?

212
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,150
Maurice devereux?

213
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,190
Maurice,hi.

214
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,270
It's dahlia malloy.

215
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,560
Look,I just wantedto say,about ...

216
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,530
last night was just awfuland,um,for both of us.

217
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,260
For my part,I'm sorry I lied
about my mode of transportation.

218
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,650
It was ... I know how shittyit is to be lied to.

219
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,420
I'm sorry I let you down.

220
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,710
Um,maurice,I just wantto stay clean,you know?

221
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,950
My body and my conscience.

222
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,450
Hey there,darling!

223
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,050
Oh,I'm sorry.I'm a little late.

224
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,800
Nice wheels.

225
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,310
I want to buy them.

226
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,480
You sure?

227
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,330
Yeah.

228
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,660
So,what are you thinking?

229
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,320
Gmc acadia?

230
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,920
How much down?

231
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,440
Yeah,how much down?

232
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,910
Zero money down.

233
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,250
What's the sticker price?

234
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,000
Well,it's right there.

235
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,740
That includes a navigation radio
with a rearview camera system.

236
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,890
That's zero money down?

237
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,900
Right.

238
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,740
Walk away,dahlia.

239
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,510
- What are you talking about?
- That's a great deal.

240
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,990
You never agreeto the first offer.

241
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,110
Uh,thank youfor your time,sir.

242
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,080
Have you ever bought a car?

243
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,140
No.

244
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,150
I likethat car,though.

245
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,280
We're gonna get that car.

246
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:50,190
I guarantee dave wilkinson will
deliver the first 50 homesin 5 months.

247
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,760
Now,if you shift your attentionto page 4,

248
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,550
this graph will show youthe cost-and-profit ratio.

249
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,350
Now,after the first 50 homes,
that's gonna jump tenfold.

250
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,450
We are gonna make a lot of moneyhere,
gentlemen ... a lot of money.

251
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,770
Oh,nina,I'm feeling inspired.

252
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,410
I never bought a car before.

253
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,290
So,I need a favor.

254
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,570
I need to move jim's birthday
party to your place tonight.

255
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,310
Why?

256
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,360
The septic tank's broke.

257
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,400
We'll be using your bathroomall night,anyway.

258
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,170
Thanks,honey.

259
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,640
Now,can I count on you to help,
or are you too busy?

260
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,870
- Well ...
- good.

261
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,430
Remember those littlehors d'oeuvre forks

262
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,000
you used at that party where
your black friend outed jim ...

263
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,910
the ones with the little duckson the handle?

264
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,640
Oh,yeah.

265
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,090
I'd love to use thosewith the miniburgers!

266
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,800
Oh,that'd be cute.

267
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,800
Yeah,I think they'rein my kitchen somewhere.

268
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,600
So,are you gonna throw a partywith wes for jim?

269
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,330
Live and let live.

270
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,080
Listen,I did the work,all right?

271
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,720
Here's my book.

272
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,660
I don't want to bore youwith all that,okay?

273
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,350
Let your staff take a lookat that later.

274
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,120
Point here is,sure,I can do the work.

275
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,290
Every guy who comes in herecan do the work,right?

276
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,630
I mean,we wouldn't be up hereif we couldn't do it.

277
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,020
But here's what makes medifferent ... two things.

278
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,420
Numbers ... no one beatsmy numbers,all right?

279
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,720
They all have more overheadthan I do.

280
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,570
They just can't do it.

281
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,790
It's not possible.

282
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,400
And the second thing ... energy.

283
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,560
Look,I'm gonna be frankwith you,okay?

284
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,090
These other guys ... they ...

285
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,060
they just won't have the passion
for this project that I will.

286
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,730
You know,to them,it's justgonna be
another project on a long list of 'em.

287
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,070
To me,no.

288
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,990
I'm gonna sweat blood to makethis
project the best it can be.

289
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,770
So,I'm thinking reilly,
if his numbers add up.

290
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,930
Yeah,yeah.I like reilly.

291
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,750
But I don't know the guy.

292
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,710
And you got to work with peopleyou know,doug.

293
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,570
I mean,I know wilkinsonis
a stiff,but he's my stiff.

294
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,740
We're going with wilkinson.

295
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,400
And so it is written,and so it is sealed.

296
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,690
And.

297
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,600
500 signatures.

298
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,180
Oh,god.All right.

299
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,230
Damn forks.

300
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,880
Oh!Shit!

301
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,470
Oh,there they are.

302
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,170
Doug here.

303
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,270
It's me.

304
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,520
I ... I can't stop thinkingabout pete.

305
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,000
I just got to make surethat
we're on the same page.

306
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,770
Now,you gave him that $40,000
that I buried and sam found.

307
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,410
and he took it,right?

308
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,850
Right.

309
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,070
What's going on?

310
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,490
Oh,I don't know.

311
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,360
Why do I feel likeI'm losing my mind?

312
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,120
Hey,you rememberwhen I was 18
and we was in beaumontat the horse races?

313
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,810
Dahlia,what the hellare you talking about?

314
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,930
You know,I was waiting for you.

315
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,270
I just knewyou'd show up.

316
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,870
even though you hadall the money.

317
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,800
You could have split on mea
million different ways.

318
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,290
I knew I could trust you.

319
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,330
- Listen,baby ...
- get off that phone,doug.

320
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,450
You got to see this.

321
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,500
Uh,cherien,hugh's justcome in.

322
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,670
I got to go.

323
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,240
What do you think?

324
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,310
I'd use a different photo.

325
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,560
That one makes you lookkind of insane.

326
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,900
Gee-gee likes it.

327
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,430
She's my campaign manager.

328
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,990
Yeah,she's yourcampaign manager.

329
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,350
I'm your turd blossom.

330
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,220
Change the frickin' photo.

331
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,200
Hey,have you ever heardof leadership council?

332
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,710
Yeah,me neither.

333
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,380
I guess it's someafter-school committee.

334
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,280
It's meeting today.

335
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,770
They need a president.

336
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,140
I mean,the guy wants me to run
for president of something.

337
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,140
It's just ...
it's hard to takeseriously,I guess.

338
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,980
Well,you're smart.

339
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,790
You deserve it.

340
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,460
Thanks.

341
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,970
Good luck at your audition,all right?

342
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,630
Thanks.

343
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,850
I'm gonna be in the chapeljust studying,

344
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,310
so come get mewhen you're done.

345
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,740
Go.

346
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,520
Mr.Rich,got a moment?

347
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,410
Oh,sure.

348
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,810
Well,it seemed to me like
you liked my presentation.

349
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,830
So I was just wondering
why I didn't get the job.

350
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,610
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,420
There were a lotof qualified applicants,

352
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,820
and,um,it was a reallydifficult decision.

353
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,520
Why would you hire someone
who bid higher than me?

354
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,730
Look,you weren't hired,
so suck it upand get out of my way.

355
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,110
And a fellow irishmanon top of it.

356
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:33,970
I'm not irish.

357
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,070
I'm jewish.

358
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,870
You don't look jewish to me.

359
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,650
You look irish.

360
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,660
Uh,we're gonna start in afew,
so enjoy your last cookie.

361
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,310
Remember,you needto sign up today
if you want to runfor president.

362
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,310
Another reminder ...

363
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,520
we do a newcomer c&c celebration
every third friday of the month.

364
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,980
So if you want to come,
raiseyour hand so I can get a count.

365
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,790
Sounds good.

366
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,680
Yes.

367
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,320
Oh,did you get a t-shirt?

368
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,640
No,I ... I didn't knowthere were t-shirts.

369
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,480
Cool & celibate.

370
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,590
Are you serious?

371
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,750
I mean,are you truly serious?

372
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,450
Because.

373
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:40,010
sometimes I think no oneis
as serious as I am about "no sex.

374
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,720
This is not a joke.

375
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,080
You can't be half a virgin.

376
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,080
You're either a virginor a slut.

377
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,300
So,you all know each other?

378
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
I get it ...it's a family project.

379
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,180
Interesting.

380
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,560
So now that you get the picture,
when do I start the job?

381
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,800
We can talk about this later.

382
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,430
Just let me handle it.

383
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,160
Oh,no.

384
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,380
Let me handle it.

385
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,880
Let me tell you a story.

386
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,770
Before I got taken inby travelers,
I lived in an orphanage.

387
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,640
And,uh,one night,there was a fire.

388
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,180
When I woke up,smoke everywhere,
heat,people screaming,burning alive.

389
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,360
We all just ran,jumped out of windows,
did whatever we neededto get out.

390
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,900
But this one kid ...he'd been hiding
his money in the hole in the floor.

391
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,650
He was clawing at the floor,
trying to get the money.

392
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,530
And I told him,"get out while you can!

393
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,380
He didn't listen.

394
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,060
And now I'm telling youthe same thing.

395
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,160
Get out while you can.

396
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,210
'cause I set the fire.

397
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,080
I already had his money.

398
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,380
Oh,and,uh,dale,you're fired.

399
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,640
Funny,funny,funny,doug.

400
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,650
Why don't you justcome on back here
and we can talk about it?

401
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,160
Don't worry about that.

402
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,730
I'll take care of it.

403
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,450
He's just puttingon a show.

404
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,800
You're full of it.

405
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,500
You lied to usfor the last time.

406
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,060
What a day.

407
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,270
What's with all the food?

408
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,530
Nina's shitter broke.

409
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,060
We're gonna havejim's birthday party here ...

410
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,010
some kind of'70s costume thing.

411
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,840
So why are you sitting here.

412
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,800
in the dark?

413
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,660
Why am I sitting herein the dark?

414
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,960
I have no idea.

415
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,970
You know why I'm sitting herein the dark?

416
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:25,690
Do you have any ideawhy I find myself
sitting here in the totalgoddamn darkness?

417
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,980
Did I miss something?

418
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,040
Well,it's a celebration,wayne!

419
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,790

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,750

Oh,you want to know?You sure?

You really want to know?!

424
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,760

426
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,690
And what doesthat mean,wayne?

427
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,910
I can explain.

428
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,450
I don't want youto explain.

429
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,920
I want to know what happenedwith pete.

430
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,270

I know you.

434
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,730
I thought that was you.

435
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,430
Hey.

436
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,310

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,520
Well,what'd youtalk about today?

447

Uh,I just assume that,
if you can tellyour dad's friend,

448
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,670
you can probably tell me.

449
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,560
You don't have to,so.

450
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,860
no,I'm... I don't know.

451
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:22,370
It may sound corny,but,uh,

452
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,950
you know,not,uh,believing in myself.

453
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,270
I mean,I don't reallybelieve
in god or... well,maybe I do.

454
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,900
I don't...you know,I don't know.

455
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,990
I just... I-I thinkit's important
to feel... feel like a child of god,you know?

456
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,510
To just... to feel and actthat way in life...

457
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,760
I mean,to treat ourselvesand others that way,

458
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,410
like we're all meantto do good things.

459
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,350
Yeah.

460
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,570

You too.

464
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,400
hey,a spinny thing.

465
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,410
We always bringour own disco ball.

466
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,880
The captain likes lights.

467
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,230
The captain?

468
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,700
Oh.Fancy.

469
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,490

470
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,360
Uh,a lawyer.

471
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,530
Okay,everyone,when we get back,

auditionsfor "little buttercup.

473

" What are you doing?

474
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,590
She's a brave young woman.

475
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,100
It's not easy to be alonein this world.

476
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,310
Doesn't strike me as the typeto be alone for long.

477
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,540
Maybe.

478
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,860
What about you?

479
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,840
Are you gonna ignore herall night?

480
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,650
She's dancingfor your benefit.

481
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:28,990
You say so.

482
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,970
Don't sell yourselfshort,cal.

483
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,910
You're as much a mystery to heras she is to you.

484
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,490
- Did you bribe him?
- I didn'T.

485
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,100
Then how did youget rid of him?

486
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,610
Don't you bullshit me,wayne.

487
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:24,730
When you came backto the house,
did you talk to peteor not?

488
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,990
I didn'T.

489
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,710
Oh.

490
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:36,070
Well,I'm --I'm trying really
hard not to lose my mindhere,wayne.

491
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,750
If you didn't talkto pete.

492
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,640
what happenedwhen you came back?

493
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,110
Dale was here.

494
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,400
He had alreadyspoken to pete.

495
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,950
- Dale.
- That's right.

496
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,220
What?Well,then what,wayne?

497
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,620
What did dale do?

498
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,750
Is pete dead?

499
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,360
He's dead.

500
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,450
He's actually dead.

501
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,970
Ohh.

502
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,390
It was an accident.

503
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,650
He meant to justknock him out.

504
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,360
Look,dahlia,it's a tragedy.

505
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,360
It is a terrible tragedy.

506
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,810
Don't you touch me!

507
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,060
Hey.Look.

508
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,720
No one meant for it to happen,
not even dale,but once it happened,

509
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,960
all I wanted to dowas to protect you,
to protect the kidsfrom all of it.

510
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,180
Protect us?

511
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,710
Look what youdestroyed,wayne.

512
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,230

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,910
Where's our marriage?

514
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,630
Look what happenedto our family.

515
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,510
I couldn't stand to tell you.

516
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,320
- I knew...
- oh,no,I'll tell youwhat you knew.

517
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,440
You knew I would never come back to this cursed

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,660

519
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,330

520
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,050
Uh,are you okay?

521

529
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,380
I've been thinking about you.

530
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,520
Before we go any further,do you love me?

531
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,550
Will you love me forever?

532

Do you need me?

533
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,020
Will you never leave me?

534
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,420
Will you make me so happyfor the rest of my life?

535
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,960
Will you take me away?

536
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,240
Will you make me your wife?

537
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,280

go any further do you love me?

538
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,450
Will you love me forever?

539
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,510
Sorry.I was lookingfor the bathroom.

540
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,610

No,come on,man,no.We got to sing.

548
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,710
You can't go till you finishthe song.

549
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,150
Let me sleep on it baby,baby,let me sleep on it

550
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,720

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,020

552
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,400
What?

553
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,830
Oh,come...don't!

554
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,910
Don't bring me down,man.

555
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,400
Cherien,listen to mefor a second.

556
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,550
No,come on.

557
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,050
You should know the words.

558
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,470
You should knowthe words,jim.

559
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,700
You take them in,promise to love.

560
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,040
That's what it's all about.

561
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,710
That's it -- and the lie.

562
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,060
How many people do you thinktell each other the lie,jim?

563
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:04,560
- You want some coffeeor something?
- No,I don't!I want some blow!

564
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,290
Feelings pass.

565
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,310
Nina always says that,and it's true.

566
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,160
What does nina say about.

567
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,860
the lie?

568
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,850
Do they pass?

569
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,710
I don't know about that.

570
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,680
The only thing that lasts,as far
as I'm concerned,is love...true love.

571
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,620
Everything else is.

572
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,810
What do you want,cherien?

573
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,970
I want to be someone else.

574
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,600
Well,you're in the right placefor that.

575
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Hey.

576
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,330
Doug/wayne.

577
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,500
- You okay?

578
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,800
Great party.

579
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,750
Where's dahlia?

580
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,180
Oh,my god.Oh,party favors!

581
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:23,920
Dahlia?

582
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,110
This is for all of you.

583
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,410
I love you.

584
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,240
This money's been my curse.

585
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,130
Let it be your blessing.

586
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,280
Dahlia.

587
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,840
- It's diana.
- Stop it.

588
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,920
Party pooper!

589
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,050
Go away,all of you!

590
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,640
Party favors are donefor the night,all right?

591
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,890
- Listen,baby,I am sorry.
- Oh,shit!I love this song!

592
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,710
Let's go somewherewhere we can talk!

593
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,860
Can't hear you.

594
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,730
Go away.

595
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,480
Hey!Over here,jeremy!

596
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,000
We're playing charades!

597
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,370
Come on,baby.Let's get out of here.

598
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,000
Hands off me,wayne!

599
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,300
It's the first word.

600
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,490
Uh."Crotch.

601
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,140
" Listen to me.

602
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm sorry!

603
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,980
A stretched vagina.

604
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,710
Oh!"Vagina monologues"!

605
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,340
Aah!That's it!

606
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:36,990
Okay,jim,you're up.

607
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,500
Look at me,damn it!

608
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,130
I am sorry I lied to you,and I'm sorry
he's dead,but you needto talk to me now!

609
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,670
I don't need to do shit!

610
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,500
Now,get your hands off meand leave me the hell alone!

611
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,270
Four words.

612
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,730
No,no.

613
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,710
First word.

614
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,130
"The.

615
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,280
" "The.

616
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,260
" And the second word is,uh,"growl.

617
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,770
" The -- the roar of the -- oh!

618
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,650
"The roar of the crowd.

619
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,830
" "Dead calm"!

620
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,010
"Die hard.

621
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,330
Dying bird.

622
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,150
" It ain't a snow angel.

623
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,090
Jim?

624
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,910
Jim?

625
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,170
Jim!

626
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,690
I can't hear his heartbeat!

627
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,270
Somebody call an ambulance!

628
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,080
Jim!

629
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,920
Hello,yeah.We need an ambulance right away.

630
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,980
Someone has collapsed.

631
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,610
Can you shutthat damn music off?!

632
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,300
Don't leave me.

633
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,810
Don't leave me!

634
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,120
I can't live without you.

635
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,710
I can't!

636
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,490
Don't leave me alone.

637
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,450
Don't leave me.

638
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,410
What happened?

639
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,330
Jim's heart stopped.

640
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,970
He's dead?

641
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,850
I'm afraid so.

642
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,100
Oh,my god.

643
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,820
I'm beat.

644
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,640
Cal's right.

645
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,440
We lost our souls.

646
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,750
We can get through this.

647
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,960
I love you,and I need you.

648
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,440
And sometimes I need you
to remind me I'm not alone anymore.

649
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,800
If you could just give mea second chance.

650
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,310
second chance?

651
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,810
That's what you want?

652
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,760
Where's pete'ssecond chance?

653
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,770
Don't you thinkhe deserves one?

654
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,970
He not gonna get one.

655
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,950
He's not gonna get shit,
'cause he's dead.

656
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,780
He's dead because of us.

657
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,920
Remember?

658
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,400
It's our fault.

659
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,830
Shut up about fault!

660
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,060
I will not take the blamefor
what happened to pete.

661
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,380
I didn't mean for himto die.

662
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,210
Who cares what you meant?

663
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,000
There was nothing I could do about it.

664
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,210
It was an accident!

665
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,150
Oh,yeah?

666
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,310
And deep in your heart,what did you
feel when you saw him lying dead there?

667
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,380
It was an accident.

668
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,300
Stop trying to turn this into something else

669
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,960
because you feel so damn
guilty about a million things

670
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,800
that have got nothing to do with pete.

671
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,590
No one meant for pete to die,and he
died anyway,just like jim died tonight.

672
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,530
No one's to blame.

673
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,570
Is that what you tell yourself these days?

674
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,030
That's how you get out of bed in the morning

675
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,990
and put one foot in front of the other?

676
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,910
I won't do it anymore.

677
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,020
You went too far,wayne.

678
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,500
and I am out.

679
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,730
Dahlia,where are you going?

680
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,380
Just gonna take care of my friend!

681
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,180
Declan and caitlin left?

682
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,200
Yeah,I thought they'd staytill
morning,but,um,I don't know.

683
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,200
Guess we're bothon our own,huh?

684
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,820
I kind of like it here.

685
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:32,280
Quinn makes me feel likeI'm a part
of something,like I'll be taken care of.

686
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,850
Don't you like quinn?

687
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,130
Everything I've been told about
him...I mean,my whole life...

688
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,700
just doesn't seem like the same person.

689
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,650
Shouldn't have done that,wayne.

690
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,800
What the hell are you doing here?

691
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,650
This is...this is bigger than me.

692
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,370
It's bigger than reilly.

693
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,800
You come into my house again,
you come near meor my family,

694
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,250
I'll slit your throat.

695
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,140
I am asking you.

696
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,200
Please.

697
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,820
What are you scared of?

698
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,950
Nothing.
