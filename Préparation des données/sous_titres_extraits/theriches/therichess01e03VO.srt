1
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:02,588
<i>I'm Wayne Malloy.</i>

2
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:04,537
<i>My family and I are travelers.</i>

3
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:08,339
<i>Our kind has been living in
this country for 150 years.</i>

4
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:11,984
<i>We're not listed in the phonebook,
we don't have social security numbers.</i>

5
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:13,235
<i>We live off the grid.</i>

6
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:16,497
<i>Some call us gypsies,
others call us thieves,</i>

7
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:19,407
<i>most though, don't even
know we exist.</i>

8
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:20,744
<i>I've got three kids,</i>

9
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:22,347
<i>a boy, a girl,</i>

10
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,474
<i>and, uh...</i>

11
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:27,205
<i>My wife Dahlia is just out of jail,</i>

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,331
<i>on parole.</i>

13
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:30,636
<i>We took her home
to the traveler camp.</i>

14
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,452
<i>The family gave her
a warm welcome.</i>

15
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,706
<i>I, on the other hand,
got a different type of welcome.</i>

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,084
I am the new boss.
He is the old boss.

17
00:00:40,422 --> 00:00:41,501
Get over it.

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,084
<i>Sometimes, it takes a beating to make
you realize it's time to move on.</i>

19
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:46,734
So where are we gonna go?

20
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:50,645
Life's a river, kid.

21
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:53,093
You gotta go where it takes you.

22
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:55,549
<i>So, with a loan from the family bank,</i>

23
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,601
I packed up the RV and went out
in search of something better.

24
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:00,774
<i>- Shit!
- It wasn't</i>

25
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:02,807
<i>that long before the family
tried to stop us.</i>

26
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,450
You're in the wrong lane, asshole!

27
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:05,780
Mick, look out!

28
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:07,078
Shit! Stop!

29
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:10,630
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

30
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:13,062
<i>they stopped someone else instead,</i>

31
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,712
<i>and then they ran.</i>

32
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:20,544
She's breathing.

33
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:24,580
<i>Knowing that we couldn't
go back to our old home,</i>

34
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:26,574
<i>we decided to visit
their new home</i>

35
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:27,841
<i>edenfalls,</i>

36
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,661
<i>as The Riches.</i>

37
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:32,289
<i>Now, who buys a house
on the internet?</i>

38
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,963
<i>Come and meet our new neighbors.</i>

39
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,418
Doug, meet Hugh Panetta,

40
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:37,976
biggest asshole
east of the mississippi.

41
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:39,963
You flatter me, Jim.

42
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:41,801
Dougy was looking for work

43
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:43,718
<i>as a lawyer,</i>

44
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,987
<i>and you've got a lunch
interview today.</i>

45
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:49,608
A good lawyer
makes you believe the truth.

46
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,712
A great lawyer makes you believe

47
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,480
the lie.

48
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,406
You're a sick mother, Doug,

49
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:01,362
and I like that in a liar.

50
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:03,396
<i>I've taken many things in my life,</i>

51
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:06,415
<i>but I'm on my way to taking something
I never thought possible.</i>

52
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:08,550
<i>The American dream.</i>

53
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,411
<i>We're gonna steal it.</i>

54
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:12,899
<i>Will the past ever catch up with us?</i>

55
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:15,269
<i>I don't know.</i>

56
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,131
<i>Doug, I know you're there.</i>

57
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,417
<i>Don't you hang up on me, Doug.</i>

58
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:24,523
<i>But I'll be damned if I go down
without a fight.</i>

59
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,926
Dad, do we really have to do this?

60
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,898
Why can't just crank the blue plate
special like we always do?

61
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:39,166
The blue plate special has its flaws.

62
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:40,864
Dad's right, honey.
Phony chits and

63
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:42,522
phony slangs
only get you so far.

64
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:45,048
- Come on, cupcake. Get out of the car.
- I am not going.

65
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:47,113
- Yes, you are, Cal.
- I'm not-- I don't want--

66
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,006
I don't want a damn number.

67
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,705
- Get out.
- No one's gonna own you, honey.

68
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:52,863
Come here. Let me see.

69
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:54,717
Dad, I don't want
to be a number, either.

70
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,954
Nobody is going to be a number.

71
00:02:57,838 --> 00:02:59,512
Sammy, take the shoes off.

72
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,219
Come on.

73
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:05,207
But I like the shoes.

74
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,585
We're not a family of shoe-wearers.

75
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:08,927
We are a family

76
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,393
of missionaries.

77
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,139
Missionaries.

78
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:17,881
We've been spreading
the good word, ma'am.

79
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:20,509
Here's our paperwork.

80
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:27,020
What country are these
birth certificates from?

81
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:29,805
Indonesia.
The wife and I are U.S. citizens,

82
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,886
the kids were all born
in Pare-Pare in indonesia.

83
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:34,592
- Pare-pare.
- That's right,

84
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:36,821
Pare-Pare born and bred.

85
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:38,261
But you're a priest?

86
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:39,528
Oh, yes, ma'am.

87
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:41,515
A catholic priest?

88
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:44,566
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:49,548
Spreading the good word,
spreading the good seed.

90
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:50,753
So good.

91
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:58,758
And what's your name, hon?

92
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:04,437
Her name is Delilah.

93
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,439
She was bitten by a monkey
when she was eight

94
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,176
so her english is not so good.

95
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:16,812
Pad thai*!
[*gibberish]

96
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,910
Quit scratching honey.

97
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,382
He got bitten by a tsetse fly
at the airport.

98
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:24,040
Big ol' son of a bitch.

99
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:27,811
So, now, we're back on U.S. soil,

100
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:31,089
we wanted to get the kids
all socially secured,

101
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,357
you know, with cards.

102
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:38,533
God bless you.

103
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,614
God bless you.

104
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:42,804
God bless you.

105
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:45,073
God bless you.

111
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,056
Problems with the newlyweds.
That guy Pete,

112
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:16,872
he e-mailed again and said
he wants to reschedule the golf trip.

113
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:18,186
Good. Reschedule.

114
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:20,383
Tell him the mono is
really kicking in,

115
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,824
and it's contagious as hell.
Don't come around.

116
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,552
Didn't like you anyway. Weasel.

117
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,179
Do you have to call them newlyweds?

118
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:27,719
They're newlyweds.

119
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:29,885
So how do we use these cards?

120
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,160
We use them

121
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,350
to enroll you kids in school.

122
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:35,697
Would you stop scaring 'em.

123
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:36,878
I'm serious.

124
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:38,490
So am I.

125
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,579
Dad, come on. School?

126
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:42,870
Who wants to learn a bunch
of buffer bullshit?

127
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:45,749
School is the cornerstone
of buffer society.

128
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,197
That's where you meet
a lot of buffer friends and

129
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,745
learn really important things.

130
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,584
Wayne, it will kill their tiny minds.

131
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,376
No, I went to school till seventh grade.
It didn't kill my mind.

132
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,988
You're half-breed.

133
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:01,187
I'm just saying.

134
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:03,831
Come on.

135
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,934
It will be real fun, won't it?

136
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:08,625
When was the last time you were
in an educational facility?

137
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:11,019
Fifty minutes outside
Georgia rippin' off that school.

138
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,537
Yeah.
Wasn't that great?

139
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:14,289
Dad, it sucked.

140
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:18,442
What else do we really need to know?
You taught us everything.

141
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,561
We're smart, we're crafty,

142
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:22,517
we're self-taught,

143
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,191
we're autody...

144
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:25,576
namic.

145
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:26,859
Auto...

146
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:29,041
Shit. What is that again?

147
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:32,279
The word is autodidacts, and if
you don't know, you're not self-taught.

148
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:33,812
- I know history.
- Really,

149
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:35,158
All of it?

150
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,051
Who's Sulla?

151
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,740
<i>The guy from Star Wars.</i>

152
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:40,867
He was the first dictator of Rome.

153
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:42,345
Freak.

154
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:43,799
I read a book on Joan of Arc.

155
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,865
Look, this is not an education, kids.

156
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:49,260
I do not want my children
in no buffer facility.

157
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:51,419
Stop being scared of school.

158
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,987
Nothing to be scared of.
Knowledge is power.

159
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:58,592
That's the end of it.

160
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:02,081
On a lighter note...

161
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:05,523
Honey, you're my best friend.

162
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:07,549
What do you think, red or blue?

163
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:09,489
I have no opinion.

164
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,186
I'm scared of school.

165
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:15,418
Obviously red.

166
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:19,275
I'm gonna tell my mom.

167
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:20,948
Yeah? You little bitch.

168
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,717
You tell your ma who
you've been talking to.

169
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:26,048
I haven't talked to Cal in a week.

170
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,747
Look, incoming calls from Cal.

171
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,532
Okay, so I talked to him,

172
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:35,049
but I don't know where they are.

173
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,288
Don't sass me.
I will beat you with a switch.

174
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:45,043
See?

175
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:47,187
Now you make me get all violent.

176
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,979
Screw you, Dale.

177
00:07:58,176 --> 00:07:59,334
Shit, Wayne.

178
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,026
Shit, Wayne!

179
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:12,343
Not bad for a half-breed.

180
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:14,830
Not bad.

181
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,247
And...

182
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:23,127
Sex and a gold card, too.

183
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,989
Because you're worth it.

184
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:26,514
They're legit.

185
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,188
Wait, we have to pay at
the end of every month?

186
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,027
That's the idea here.

187
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:32,262
It's FEO.

188
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:34,695
For Energetic Orgasms?

189
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,198
For Emergencies Only.

190
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,313
Shit, Wayne.

191
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:40,718
I've been running hot plastic since
I was eight years old.

192
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:43,565
You can't just screw me give me
a gold card, and tell me it's FEO.

193
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:44,872
New life,

194
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,561
new horizons,

195
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,016
new challenges.

196
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:56,821
You know,

197
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,651
just 'cause you grew up a buffer

198
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:02,249
it don't give you the right
to call me ignorant, you know?

199
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:04,987
I never called you ignorant.

200
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,146
You said I was scared of school.

201
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,461
I ain't scared of anything.

202
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:13,818
What does Panco do anyway?

203
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:16,508
Real estate investment something.

204
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,119
Cal got me a bunch of stuff.

205
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,391
Did you even glance at it?

206
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:21,034
Yeah, I glanced at it.

207
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:30,120
Well, that is really girly.

208
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,787
It doesn't feel right.

209
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,518
Hold on.

210
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:51,702
Better, huh?

211
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:54,800
Thank you.

212
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,243
Wish you were coming with me.

213
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,432
I bet.

214
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,638
Who else gonna put rocks
in your briefcase?

215
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:07,891
You and me.

216
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:09,721
I know.

217
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:12,021
You'll be fine, though.

218
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,140
You're the best conman in the world.

219
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:16,064
The world is a big place.

220
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:21,055
You're the best conman
who gets in my pants.

221
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,800
Sorry, I called you a half-breed.

222
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:44,393
This is crazy.

223
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:01,848
<i>Hi, welcome to Panco</i>

224
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,616
Thank you for calling Panco.

225
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:05,649
Please hold.

226
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:08,403
<i>Welcome to Panco.
Are you a Panco person?</i>

227
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,212
<i>Hi. Welcome to Panco.</i>

228
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,027
Thank you for calling Panco.

229
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,294
Please hold.

230
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:17,273
You must be a Panco person.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,457
I am on mondays, wednesdays,
and fridays.

232
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,053
Can I be tuesdays and thursdays?

233
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,557
Thank you for calling Panco.

234
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:28,239
Please hold.

235
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,116
Thank you for calling Panco.

236
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:32,916
I'm Doug Rich.

237
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:35,185
Mr. Rich.

238
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:37,625
Mr. Panetta has been expecting you.

239
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,174
Excellent.

240
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:45,288
Hi, Doug Rich.

241
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,010
Hi, Doug Rich.

242
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:53,834
You're late.

243
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,963
Meet your new team.

244
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:59,122
Panco team, meet your

245
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,375
new legal chief.

246
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:02,900
I hope you don't mind an impromptu.

247
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:05,165
I wanna get folks together,
and just kind of dive in.

248
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:06,828
No. Impromptu?

249
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:08,462
Very good.
Love to dive in.

250
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:09,690
Great.

251
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,614
All right.

252
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:13,147
The floor is yours.

253
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,677
Do you--

254
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:21,961
where would you like me to start?

255
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:23,322
I don't know.

256
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,357
How about the present, future,

257
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:29,110
vis-a-vis the Doug Rich way.

258
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:32,262
Present, future, Doug Rich way.

259
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,806
Good morning.

260
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,122
What is the Doug Rich way?

261
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,897
What is

262
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,142
Doug Rich way?

263
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,066
Anybody?

264
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,189
Okay. Now, that would be too easy.

265
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,068
Is it about the present?

266
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,634
Yeah, sure is, right now.

267
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,699
Is it about the future?

268
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:01,492
It's written in the stars.

269
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,636
It's about...
It's about problems.

270
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:06,087
It's about, "what's the problem?

271
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:07,538
"where's the problem?
There's the problem.

272
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:11,466
"catch the problem. Look, it's getting
away. Stomp it with your foot."

273
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:13,374
It's about people

274
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:15,807
solving the problems.
Panco people,

275
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:17,888
people of Panco.

276
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:21,103
Peter Piper picked
a peck of Panco people.

277
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:23,660
And it was good

278
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:25,162
on the first day.

279
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:27,524
And these are the people, you--

280
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:31,888
we are the people that
will win each and every case.

281
00:13:34,568 --> 00:13:35,647
What case?

282
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:37,822
Exactly.

283
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:39,246
What cases?

284
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:41,600
We're a real estate company.

285
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:44,009
Panco real estate company.

286
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:45,855
That is what we are.

287
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,692
What have I got in my briefcase?

288
00:13:58,372 --> 00:13:59,451
What does he mean?

289
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:00,828
A hundred bucks

290
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:04,661
to anyone--
no, hell, a thousand bucks

291
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:06,679
of Hugh's money.

292
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:10,804
Anyone, have a guess,
what's in the briefcase?

293
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:12,681
What's your name?

294
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:14,965
Kimmie, a thousand bucks.

295
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,743
The Beaufort-Simpson file?

296
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:20,510
The Beaufort-Simpson file.

297
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:22,544
A file I will be getting to know.

298
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,648
No, it isn't in the briefcase.

299
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,275
Good guess. Anyone else?

300
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:27,370
A thousand bucks.

301
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:28,527
Pink slips.

302
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:30,490
Pink slips.

303
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,634
No, thank you.
Not today.

304
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,668
Well, I'll show you.

305
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:38,617
I'll get the thousand bucks.

306
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:46,593
A rock.

307
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:48,299
Is that a rock?

308
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:52,726
When people ask me,

309
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:54,979
"what is the Doug Rich way?"

310
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,638
I say, "it's this."

311
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:58,656
This is it.

312
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:00,048
This is the Doug Rich way.

313
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:01,238
This is

314
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:05,016
what I am about,
what we will be about.

315
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,269
The whole team.

316
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,289
So you want us

317
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,768
to be rocks?

318
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:16,081
What's your name?

319
00:15:16,754 --> 00:15:18,381
Tony, you got yourself a raise.

320
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:19,765
Check with Hugh.

321
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,057
Yes, we will be rocks,

322
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:25,374
all of us. I am a rock.
What are you, Kimmie?

323
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:26,868
A rock?

324
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,909
Yes, you are.
We will be rocks.

325
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:32,132
You and you and you
and you, all of us, rocks.

326
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:34,933
Rock-solid, rock sure,
rock and roll, baby.

327
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,223
This is us.

328
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:37,944
Now,

329
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:40,228
and if we all...

330
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,982
All as rocks, if we stick together,

331
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:45,368
we become...

332
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,965
A mountain.

333
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:51,563
A mountain, yes.

334
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,159
A mountain.

335
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,724
Together, we will be

336
00:15:58,084 --> 00:15:59,163
a mountain.

337
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,695
A Panco mountain.

338
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:04,152
All right.

339
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:06,186
All right.

340
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:08,822
All right, Doug.

341
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:23,982
There's Robert E. Lee.
It's a public school.

342
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:25,922
It's mixed,

343
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:29,614
which, in my opinion,
is a good thing. I mean...

344
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:34,633
Who wants to be with
Whitey mcwhitey all the time?

345
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,385
Also, it's cheap.

346
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:37,668
That's good.

347
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,212
Excuse me, is that a camel?

348
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:44,582
Jim and his shitty alpacas.

349
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,429
And then, there's the jesuits.

350
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:50,753
And, of course,
you've famous old Rosemere.

351
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:52,184
Is that a school?

352
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:54,421
The Rosemere academy.

353
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:57,049
1,500 a month, 18 a year.

354
00:16:57,486 --> 00:17:00,052
It's a symbol of everything
that's wrong with the universe.

355
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:01,413
Eighteen what?

356
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:03,156
Thousand dollars, hon.

357
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,519
18,000 a year to send
a kid to school?

358
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:06,614
Get out.

359
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,512
That's not including books.

360
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:10,842
Sugar?

361
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:12,164
Sure,

362
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:14,057
I would love some sugar.

363
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:18,328
And to think of all the kids
that are starving in Africa.

364
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,759
So you send your daughter
to public school?

365
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,902
Hell, no.

366
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:25,451
Rosemere.

367
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:28,134
We're all hypocrites.

368
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:36,094
Come on in here.
And this, this here is Greg.

369
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,668
Greg's a great guy,
great accountant, too.

370
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:41,937
And, here we are,
a little snacky.

371
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:43,650
This is Diana.

372
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:49,349
Lynn, Kimmie, Jen.

373
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:52,682
Great speech.
You're a real Panco person.

374
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,911
Kimmie is terrific.

375
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,235
Yeah, so are Lynn and Jen.
Great girls.

376
00:17:58,392 --> 00:17:59,737
Ladies. Ladies.

377
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:03,468
Come here. Come on.

378
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:08,103
Aubrey's a five star paralegal.
Wants to be a lawyer, too.

379
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:11,029
What year are you on,
year two at the night school?

380
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,734
Third year, actually.

381
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,237
Third year, yeah.

382
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:18,912
I'm not sure I want her to graduate.
Then she'll be a lawyer. I'll lose her.

383
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:21,008
She's the hardest worker I've got.

384
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,184
Let's see now.

385
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:25,342
And...

386
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,649
Yeah. Sit down, Tony.

387
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:32,817
Como esta tu esposa hoy?

388
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:34,929
My husband?

389
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:37,847
Your husband?

390
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:39,333
What about your wife?

391
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:40,444
What the hell?

392
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:44,715
- Muy bien.
- Thank you.

393
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:46,983
Wife's in chemo,
he hadn't missed a spill.

394
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:48,383
He's a god damn Saint

395
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:49,509
and a great janitor.

396
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:50,918
Hey, there, Stu.

397
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,506
What's goin' on?

398
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,266
You know.

399
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,557
Yeah, Stu's okay.

400
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:04,716
He's pretty good.

401
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:06,202
Sit down, Greg.

402
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,168
You'll be moving into
Stewart's offices today.

403
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:11,928
- Stewart's moving office?
- No,

404
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:14,017
No more offices for Stewart.

405
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,191
Somebody comes, somebody goes.

406
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:19,194
Somebody dies, somebody lives.

407
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:21,047
I'm a hunter, Doug.
In hunting,

408
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,786
you eat what you kill, you kill
what you eat. Comprende?

409
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:26,195
So when are you planning to tell him?

410
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:29,269
I'm not planning
on tellin' him anything.

411
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:31,177
Get rid of him by lunch.

412
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,144
I got I I got it.

413
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,036
Don't pick it up.
I got it.

414
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,234
Don't touch it. I said don't touch--
give me my phone.

415
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:53,723
Give me my phone.
Can I have my phone, please?

416
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:58,577
Have you been talking to her?

417
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:00,400
Cal, look at me.

418
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:03,841
Did you tell her where we are?

419
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:06,642
Yeah, Di, I gave her the address
'cause I'm that dumb.

420
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,034
Don't be a dick, Cal.

421
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,107
Rule number eight:
don't rat on your family,

422
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:12,398
even when you think
your dad has lost his mind.

423
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:14,526
We're gonna be gone in a week.
What do you care?

424
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,621
Maybe not, huh?

425
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:18,646
Maybe we'll graduate high school
and become lawyers or dentists

426
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,727
or successful americans or shit, Cal.

427
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:23,511
Maybe dad has a plan, Cal.
Did you ever think of that?

428
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,117
Maybe dad has a-- when was
the last time dad had a plan, Di?

429
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:28,337
When?

430
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:30,770
Do you really think dad has a plan?

431
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,977
Do you?

432
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:36,574
He stole the money,
ma lost the money,

433
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:39,617
and now we're here
in a dead guy's house.

434
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,354
He got a job, Cal.

435
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:46,090
He got a job.

436
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:48,531
That's great.

437
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:54,985
It is, Di, but when was the last time
he held one down for more than two days?

438
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:57,277
We're gonna get caught, Di.

439
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:14,274
- Hello.
- Hi ya.

440
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:17,325
Well, Nina was kind enough
to make an appointment for us

441
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:19,109
today at Rosemere school.

442
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,893
Yeah, well, couldn't you give me
a little bit more notice?

443
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:25,905
I mean, this is just
a little bit inconvenient.

444
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,892
<i>- Hello?
- I know.</i>

445
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:30,004
I didn't ask her to, she just did it.

446
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:32,953
Don't get mad at me.
You want school.

447
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:36,402
Yeah, okay.
Well, I'll see you at noon.

448
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,953
- See you at noon.
- See you at noon.

449
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:43,807
David's good, Doug's better.

450
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:46,701
Well, I hear we're gonna
be workin' together... Doug.

451
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:49,595
You know, I've been beggin' Hugh
for some support around here.

452
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:51,777
I hope you're ready for me
to work you to death.

453
00:21:52,184 --> 00:21:53,185
Beaufort-Simpson.

454
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,547
Yeah. You read up on the deal, right?

455
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:57,941
You know, we got
a conference call at three.

456
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,272
Why don't you just jump in
and take the call yourself.

457
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:02,212
Give them the old Panco punch.

458
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:06,224
Absolutely. Better still,
you could take the call.

459
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:08,367
I'll watch the master at work.

460
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:10,980
Chicken, huh?

461
00:22:13,738 --> 00:22:14,771
Wise owl.

462
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:25,110
So who are you replacing, Doug?

463
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:27,894
- You mean, the--
- No, you know, what I mean.

464
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:31,536
Hugh's a freak. Space is limited.
If you're in, who's out?

465
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:36,774
I got a hundred bucks on that picarelli.
The guy's a heck of a whiner.

466
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,706
You guys bet on
who's getting canned?

467
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:41,694
I know, it's a local entertainment
around here.

468
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:46,487
I got 500 bucks says it's you.

469
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:49,100
That's not even funny.

470
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:55,613
I got 12 mouths to feed.

471
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:59,587
What you mean,
all these kids are yours?

472
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,230
Of course, they're mine.

473
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:02,457
Adopted

474
00:23:03,122 --> 00:23:05,124
from every corner of the world.

475
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:08,261
This one's got a heart of gold.

476
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:09,806
Her name's,

477
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,731
Chi Ho.

478
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,434
You wanna get started on this?

479
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,129
All this.

480
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,313
Right.

481
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,740
This is a school ?

482
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:52,181
This is a private school, honey.
It's an academy.

483
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:54,872
I gotta get this done fast.
I got a conference call at 3:00.

484
00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:56,700
Shit, look,
he snuck them on.

485
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,861
Sammy, Sammy,
do secret squirrel, okay ?

486
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:03,527
Di, what's your name ?

487
00:24:04,297 --> 00:24:07,057
- My name's Delilah Rich from Tampa.
- Hobbies ?

488
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:09,684
Fencing, skiing,
racquetball, and sex.

489
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,251
Ow, chess.

490
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:12,474
Cut the sass.

491
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,469
Have you kids even thought
about who you are ?

492
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:15,898
I'm a rich jerk-off.

493
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:17,926
I think we know who we are
but the question is,

494
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:21,425
do we really wanna go to a school
that rips us off for 18 grand a year?

495
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:23,549
18 grand a year,
is that a joke ?

496
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:25,539
Why are you
so scared of school ?

497
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:28,037
My mom was scared of school,
and look what happened to her.

498
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:30,066
- What happened to her ?
- She drowned in a creek

499
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,264
cause she couldn't read
the goddamn danger sign.

500
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,255
"We know what we are,
but not what we may be."

501
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,595
William Shakespeare.

502
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:39,864
I don't know what that means,
but y'all take notes.

503
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:44,901
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

504
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,131
Asseyez-vous.

505
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:47,443
Répétez.

506
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,387
Je veux.

507
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:50,586
Tu veux.

508
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:51,755
Il veut.

509
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:53,875
Très bien.
Excellent class.

510
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:56,677
Maintenant, le verbe "avoir".

511
00:24:58,002 --> 00:24:59,711
And chess, too?

512
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:03,380
Well, I'm no pro or anything,
but I do play the computer.

513
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:06,230
Our daughter
is very gifted.

514
00:25:06,443 --> 00:25:07,796
You mean highly gifted ?

515
00:25:08,014 --> 00:25:09,531
We mean perversely gifted.

516
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,939
That's what
we got here, Jane.

517
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,198
So what can I do for you
nice people today ?

518
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:17,510
Jane, we are in the scouting process
at the moment, being new to Edenfalls,

519
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,546
and our kids' education is,
of course, paramount.

520
00:25:20,864 --> 00:25:24,431
And we're looking for
the topmost educational environment

521
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:27,520
for our three dangerously
gifted children,

522
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:30,526
- And Rosemere...
- Yeah, Rosemere's it.

523
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,110
I see. You're
interested in Rosemere.

524
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:35,549
- We are, Jane.
- And I assume you are aware

525
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:38,283
that we have
an extensive waiting list.

526
00:25:38,727 --> 00:25:41,010
We are, Jane.

527
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,106
The extensive
waiting list, of course.

528
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,957
We are
people of means.

529
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,263
Excuse me ?

530
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,048
We got money.

531
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:56,211
No, I know what
"means" means, Mrs. Rich.

532
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:02,416
Look, you should feel free to apply,
and I'll be sure and let you know

533
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,589
if we have
any openings next fall.

534
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:08,081
- Next fall ?
- That's when our year begins.

535
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,252
Our school is
currently full, Mrs. Rich.

536
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:13,932
You can make room
for three little kids.

537
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,220
Now, that really wouldn't be fair
to our current parents,

538
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:22,531
would it, Mrs. Rich?
I mean, they thought ahead.

539
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:27,960
They made our deadlines.
They got their applications in on time.

540
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:31,612
Now, I'm delighted to hear
that your children's education is,

541
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,615
in fact,
"paramount" to you.

542
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,909
From where I'm sitting,
it doesn't really look that way.

543
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,606
I think what you're looking for is
a delightful public school in the area.

544
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:46,654
Robert E. Lee.

545
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,427
Yeah ? Well,
I shit on Robert E. Lee.

546
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:57,177
Baby, don't you listen to that bitch.
We can go anywhere we want.

547
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:59,318
Public school, private school ?
What do you care ?

548
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,831
You've never even been
to a school.

549
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:02,996
She can take her 18 grand
and shove it up her ass.

550
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:05,352
They don't just
give it to you, Wayne.

551
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:08,418
This american dream,
they don't just give it to you

552
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:10,113
with a big old ribbon
and a bow.

553
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:12,191
If we want it,
we gotta take it.

554
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,221
We got to do whatever it takes
to get it and to hold on to it

555
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:17,450
till they rip it out
of our cold, dead hands.

556
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,602
They're ain't nobody gonna tell me
I don't care about my kids.

557
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,953
There's nobody gonna say
"they ain't good enough".

558
00:27:26,357 --> 00:27:27,983
They're not gonna
let us in.

559
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,146
Yeah, they will.

560
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:35,032
Come on, Sam !

561
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:02,304
This is it. Jane Fedley.
1158 old hickory.

562
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:04,349
It's quite a nice house.

563
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:07,835
It's not as nice as ours.

564
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:10,078
Cal, you first.

565
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:16,600
- We need to do this quick.
- All right, kids. Dig in.

566
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:17,831
Thanks, mom.

567
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,324
Di, come on.
Do it.

568
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,197
Whoa, this one reeks.

569
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:32,194
Cal, do y'all wanna go
to private school or not ?

570
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:34,756
- No.
- Well, you are.

571
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,136
They are?

572
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,654
Take the bags, quick.

573
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:42,167
Thank you, ma'am.
May I have another ?

574
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:48,204
- Hurry up, will you ?
- Don't you have a meeting ?

575
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:52,154
Okay, if you get caught,
call me. I'm a lawyer.

576
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:55,090
Did I teach you anything ?

577
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:11,369
Oh, my God. Cal, come here.
Check out this bird.

578
00:29:12,193 --> 00:29:13,546
<i>Gotta go, gotta go.</i>

579
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:17,861
Are you deaf ?

580
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,896
What part of "hold my calls"
don't you understand ?

581
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:22,498
- I'm sorry.
- Get it?

582
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:25,265
So what happened?

583
00:29:25,457 --> 00:29:27,848
I put the money in,
and it wouldn't come out.

584
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:30,891
Couldn't pull the trigger ?

585
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:33,720
You didn't seem to have a problem
pulling the trigger last night.

586
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,269
- What happened ?
- That was firing a gun.

587
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:41,334
Doug, listen.
I'm an easy-going guy.

588
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,369
I got three rules
here at Panco :

589
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,282
don't litter,

590
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:47,841
flush the john...

591
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:53,260
And make the new guy
fire the old guy.

592
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:55,194
Can you live with that ?

593
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,827
- Aubrey !
- That-a-boy.

594
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:00,430
Conference call in a half an hour,
all right ?

595
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:04,002
And get him on the phone first
and don't screw up.

596
00:30:05,743 --> 00:30:06,850
Pronto !

597
00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:13,605
Sit down.

598
00:30:20,683 --> 00:30:22,343
What do you think of this ?

599
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:23,750
Excuse me ?

600
00:30:24,175 --> 00:30:28,005
What do you think of this ?
Would you like to have a go at this ?

601
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,757
I mean, would you like
to take a stab at this?

602
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:37,130
- At the candy bar ?
- No, this, this. Not this, this.

603
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:38,831
Beaufort-Simpson, right ?

604
00:30:38,981 --> 00:30:41,113
I am not
a lawyer, Mr. Rich.

605
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,120
Yes, but you're an expert.
You know your field.

606
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:46,280
You must know this
like the back of your hand.

607
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:48,197
Oh, so you want me
to mark it up.

608
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:50,972
I want you to mark it up, that's it.
Just to mark it up.

609
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:53,035
- I'm a paralegal.
- Good.

610
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:55,345
That should help.

611
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:00,676
I don't wanna
get blamed, and

612
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:05,037
- I really, really need this job.
- You will not get blamed.

613
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:09,397
You're doing this for me.
I just want your opinion.

614
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,445
You want my opinion ?

615
00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:16,230
I'm a just man. I am a fair man.
I am a woman-loving, colorblind,

616
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:17,727
and powerful man.

617
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,937
And I want your opinion.

618
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,147
And I wanna give you
this candy bar as well...

619
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:24,606
for the job.

620
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,488
Are you gonna fire him ?

621
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,334
The man's got 12 children.

622
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,734
Can I tell you a secret ?

623
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,248
Those aren't his children.

624
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:41,572
He cut the photos
out of a catalog.

625
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:43,100
No, shit.

626
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:07,858
<i>How are you doing, baby ?</i>

627
00:32:08,022 --> 00:32:12,792
Well, she just sat down for a snack.
So, say we got us 20, 30 minutes easy.

628
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,693
<i>Okay. Well, you keep
your eye on her. Bye-bye.</i>

629
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:22,726
Okay, my account name
is Jane Fedley.

630
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:27,065
She must really like Cosmo.

631
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:30,892
Jones.
Yeah, J-O-N...

632
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:35,443
That big ol' computer must have
a big ol' mistake inside it

633
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,752
because that is
my mother's maiden name.

634
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,727
Sure. My birthday ?

635
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,759
September 18, 1961.

636
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:47,525
<i>- Yeah. My social is 433-35-66-22.
- Gotta go. Gotta go.</i>

637
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:50,102
Y'all want the blood
of my first-born too ?

638
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,611
Just give me one moment.

639
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:55,174
- Would you shut that bird up ?
- Mom, I am trying, okay ?

640
00:32:55,384 --> 00:32:56,500
God damn it.

641
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:59,681
I'm so sorry.
My in-laws are in town.

642
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:03,754
Well,
I've lost my cell phone.

643
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:07,034
And I just wondered if you could suspend
my service for a couple of days

644
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:08,688
just to see if
it shows up.

645
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,676
Well, thank you so much.

646
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:16,487
I love them shoes.

647
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:18,244
Baby, come here.

648
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:25,876
Now, you gotta make
a choice.

649
00:33:26,545 --> 00:33:27,707
What do you mean ?

650
00:33:28,254 --> 00:33:30,284
Right now.
For the con.

651
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,878
See, when you rope
that Fedley woman,

652
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,351
you can be a girl,

653
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:38,803
but then, see,
you gotta stay a girl.

654
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,154
Or you can be a boy.

655
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:45,113
It might be easier.

656
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:47,255
I gotta make a choice?

657
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:49,911
Not for me, not ever.

658
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:53,262
I love you,
just like you are.

659
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,179
But, yeah, you gotta
make a choice.

660
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:57,542
For them.

661
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,202
You wanna go
to that school, right ?

662
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:05,410
I swear to God, that this bird,
if it says it one more time,

663
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,539
I'm gonna cook him.

664
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,778
Of all things that we had to steal,
we had to steal a goddamn parrot ?

665
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:13,061
<i>- It's not funny.
- Gotta go. Gotta go.</i>

666
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:15,473
- You hold him.
- Did you find something good for him ?

667
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:17,895
- Let me see.
- It's a prep school called Burton.

668
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:19,932
It's about an hour away.

669
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,211
- It's pretty fancy.
- That is good.

670
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:26,593
- Do you think he can do this ?
- Oh, sure.

671
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:28,521
Kid's a Malloy.
He can do it.

672
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,339
He can do it.

673
00:34:30,756 --> 00:34:32,574
Okay, show me
that bike. Come on.

674
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:34,343
Operation Education.

675
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,229
Here we go.

676
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:40,424
<i>Gotta go.
Gotta go.</i>

677
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,201
Hi, there.
Is everything all right ?

678
00:35:08,562 --> 00:35:11,835
Dear. Gotten yourself a flat
there, haven't you ?

679
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,783
My mom's gonna
kill me for this.

680
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:17,012
Ah, so your mom's not here
and she doesn't know

681
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:18,453
where you are, does she ?

682
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,164
No, I snuck off
to the library to study.

683
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,091
You snuck off to study ?

684
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:26,439
Yes, ma'am.

685
00:35:28,146 --> 00:35:31,132
You know what,
I have my phone here.

686
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:33,654
Why don't we give her a call ?

687
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,223
You have her number, right ?

688
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,956
- That's odd.
- What ?

689
00:35:41,564 --> 00:35:43,751
Don't seem to have
any service here.

690
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:47,305
I need to call my mom.

691
00:35:47,524 --> 00:35:49,341
Okay, sweetheart.
It's all right.

692
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,658
You know what ?
I live right around the corner.

693
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,217
Why don't we walk over there and
we can call your mother from my house.

694
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:01,417
- Will that be okay ?
- Thank you.

695
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:04,352
So you're a Burton kid ?

696
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,204
Oh, yeah...

697
00:36:07,148 --> 00:36:11,043
But not yet. My brother and sister
and I are supposed to start next week.

698
00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:14,589
- Well, Burton is an excellent school.
- It's all right.

699
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:16,737
It was actually
our second choice.

700
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:19,245
- Really ? What was your first choice ?
- Rosemere.

701
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:21,258
Mom said that
was the kind of place

702
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:23,978
where a kid like me could really
spread his wings in.

703
00:36:24,176 --> 00:36:25,721
Intellectually,
of course.

704
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:29,110
What's
your favorite subject, Sam ?

705
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:30,907
French, ma'am.

706
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,500
<i>Être ou ne pas être.</i>

707
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:35,363
<i>Voilà la question.</i>

708
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:39,695
You read Shakespeare
in french?

709
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:41,455
Just the soliloquies.

710
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,254
This is actually
where I live.

711
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:52,325
<i>He threatened me, okay ?</i>

712
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,027
<i>He said I had to do it.
I had no choice.</i>

713
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:58,669
<i>- He said...
- Who ? Who is it ?</i>

714
00:36:59,613 --> 00:37:01,744
Dale.
It's Dale, okay ?

715
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:13,823
You don't have
to marry him.

716
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,527
- By rule, you can say no.
<i>- I can't say no.</i>

717
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:20,788
He forced me, Cal.

718
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:25,210
I'm...

719
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:28,367
I think I might be
pregnant with his baby.

720
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm splittin' tonight,
got some bucks.

721
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:39,616
Take the hound, see where it leads me.
You know what I mean ?

722
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,811
No. No,
don't do that.

723
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:43,552
Well, what do you suggest ?

724
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:47,748
<i>Come live with us,
okay ?</i>

725
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,374
<i>I'll take care
of the baby.</i>

726
00:37:49,422 --> 00:37:50,543
You can...

727
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:54,014
you can go to school
here, I don't know.

728
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:57,690
- Since when do you go to school ?
- Since today.

729
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,573
So how do I find you ?

730
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:07,676
I'll pick you up.

731
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:09,904
8:00 tonight.

732
00:38:11,577 --> 00:38:13,620
You remember
that place you got...

733
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:16,804
sick off those fish sticks ?
I don't remember the name.

734
00:38:17,112 --> 00:38:18,266
Off route 19 ?

735
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,211
I'll see you then.

736
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:23,302
Bye.

737
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:41,797
- What ?
- You left the window open.

738
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:43,294
Where is the bird ?

739
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,893
Oh, shit.

740
00:38:49,112 --> 00:38:50,807
Birdie ?
Birdie ?

741
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:53,595
Bird ? Bird ?

742
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:57,612
Come here, birdie.
Come on.

743
00:38:58,432 --> 00:38:59,990
You know I like you.

744
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:03,642
Come on,
you little shithead.

745
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:05,816
Come here, bird.

746
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:17,035
Who's gotta go now, huh ?
Come on, bird.

747
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,520
- God damn it.
- Is this what you're looking for ?

748
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,650
Gotta go.
Gotta go.

749
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:28,627
Great. Yeah, Could you just bring
him down for me ?

750
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,041
How about you come up?

751
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:38,492
Oh my God!

752
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:46,697
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

753
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:50,240
I'm working on a triptych.

754
00:39:57,506 --> 00:40:00,171
So what's... it about?

755
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,835
Your trip thing?

756
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,838
Isolation.

757
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:17,287
Don't worry, madam.

758
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,328
We'll find you the little "oiseau".

759
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:24,937
- My mom is here.
- Oh, sweetheart,

760
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,520
I was worrying sick about you.

761
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,463
This is the nice woman who let me
use her cell-phone.

762
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,847
- Jane!
- Yes, yes... Hello, hello.

763
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:37,052
- You two know each other?
- Well, Miss Fedley...

764
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:40,191
Ms.Fedley is the head
of Rosemere,baby.

765
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:43,004
Wait... You...

766
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:46,699
Well, thank you, Jane.
Thank you so much.

767
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,314
- I think we should be going now.
- Of course.

768
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:53,025
Mom, my books.

769
00:40:53,352 --> 00:40:55,281
Books, books...

770
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:02,638
We can't leave her.

771
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:04,142
Her bird.

772
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,300
"Le petit chou" is missing.

773
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:09,799
- "Le" what?
- It's french, it's... means cabbage.

774
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,663
We gotta help her find him.

775
00:41:11,826 --> 00:41:13,958
Well sweetheart, you know,
Ms. Fedley is an adult,

776
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:17,039
- I'm sure she can manage.
- She did something nice for me.

777
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:19,311
Why can't we do something nice for her?

778
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:24,699
- Thanks guys.
<i>- Thanks

779
00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:30,063
You didn't say a word.

780
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,798
Next time chime in.

781
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,523
That's what you're here for, isn't it?

782
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:38,994
Let's talk about Panco, Stu.

783
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:40,031
Hey, you know what?

784
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:43,470
Let's talk about your lack of
participation on that conference call.

785
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:45,452
No, forget about that.

786
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,526
Tell me about Beaufort Simpson.

787
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,518
Are we winning or loosing?

788
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,362
I couldn't tell on my conference call.

789
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:56,275
Okay, let's play again.

790
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:00,069
I'm gonna read a paragraphe
on the Beaufort-Simpson file,

791
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,922
and you tell me what it means, okay ?

792
00:42:01,923 --> 00:42:02,973
Here we go.

793
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:06,209
"The provision of law, R.C.19,

794
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:09,850
"which prohibitsa court from
enjoining "the yada-yada-yada-yada,

795
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:12,772
violates the separation-of-powers
doctrine

796
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:14,904
and is therefore unconstitutional.

797
00:42:15,295 --> 00:42:17,091
What the hell does that mean?

798
00:42:18,496 --> 00:42:19,667
What kind of lawyer are you?

799
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:21,755
No, just imagine
I know nothing about the law.

800
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,245
Okay, just imagine I just come
straight out the far-west.

801
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:27,165
I'm a kid from the swamps,
and I'm here and, whoa.

802
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:29,175
Just help me out here.

803
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:32,209
"Eminent Domain"
Now what's that? I saw it in a film.

804
00:42:32,251 --> 00:42:34,260
- "Eminent Domain"?
- Yeah, is it important?

805
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,684
Jesus Christ! Where did
you go to school man?

806
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:41,613
You have to be
the worst lawyer in the world.

807
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:45,130
I am... I am
the worst lawyer in the world.

808
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:47,158
And you...

809
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:49,333
You are the best

810
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:51,438
liar in the world.

811
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:57,292
Your family?

812
00:42:57,881 --> 00:42:59,646
Cut out of a magazine.

813
00:43:02,425 --> 00:43:04,377
- That is brillant.
- You know what?

814
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:06,108
I am tired of this shit.

815
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:08,637
Get out of my office.

816
00:43:09,618 --> 00:43:11,678
No, you get out of your office.

817
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:13,715
You're fired.

818
00:43:16,364 --> 00:43:17,411
I'm sorry.

819
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:26,032
Not that sorry.

820
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,296
He doesn't know.

821
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,017
The new guy doesn't know anything.

822
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:35,127
He doesn't even know
about Eminent Domain.

823
00:43:35,387 --> 00:43:36,852
Welcome to Panco, Doug.

824
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:40,562
- I hope your time here is fruitful.
- Thank you.

825
00:43:45,662 --> 00:43:47,951
Come on, little chou-chou.

826
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:50,338
Come here, little chou-chou.

827
00:43:54,656 --> 00:43:55,674
See,

828
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,547
this is how the world ends,
not with a bang,

829
00:43:58,579 --> 00:43:59,789
but with a wimper.

830
00:43:59,822 --> 00:44:01,947
Oh Jane, honey, don't be so negative.

831
00:44:02,023 --> 00:44:04,835
The thing about birds is
you think they care but...

832
00:44:04,836 --> 00:44:07,075
all they really want is food.

833
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:10,443
Maybe I should go.

834
00:44:10,672 --> 00:44:13,409
- Look over there, here or something.
- Yeah, go look that way.

835
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:16,215
Yeah, hurry, hurry.

836
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,116
Don't be sad, Jane.
You keep doing that bird call.

837
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,385
- Hey, I'm not late, am I?
- Just give me the bird.

838
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:25,806
Okay, tell "over here".

839
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,147
Over here!

840
00:44:27,148 --> 00:44:28,553
Okay, take the bird.

841
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:31,524
- Come on, just--
- Okay, go, go.

842
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:34,858
I found him.

843
00:45:13,575 --> 00:45:16,583
Take care, Ms. Fedley.
Bonsoir.

844
00:45:17,074 --> 00:45:18,872
Come here you.

845
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:24,339
And best of luck this bird,
it really is a very good school.

846
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:26,419
- Thank you.
- Yeah...

847
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,119
It is an hour away but...

848
00:45:29,681 --> 00:45:31,693
You know, if you don't stand
for education, hell,

849
00:45:31,704 --> 00:45:32,882
what do you stand for ?

850
00:45:33,043 --> 00:45:35,164
- Mrs Riche.
- Oh, call me Shereen.

851
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:38,269
I want to repay you,

852
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,848
how can I repay you
for this great kindness?

853
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:42,589
Oh, there's nothing you can do, Jane.

854
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:45,884
We're not the kind of people
who need to be repaid, are we?

855
00:45:46,256 --> 00:45:48,514
Sometimes life's not
about payments, or

856
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:50,138
meeting deadlines,

857
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,615
playing by the rules.

858
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:54,791
You know, our life is just...

859
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:56,781
It comes right out and it hits you.

860
00:45:57,173 --> 00:46:00,509
And before you know it, you got
a missing child and a missing bird.

861
00:46:03,092 --> 00:46:04,891
We know what we are,

862
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:07,507
but not what we may be.

863
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,927
Right?

864
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,295
Bye, Jane.

865
00:46:17,153 --> 00:46:18,428
<i>Au revoir.</i>

866
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,599
Huh... Have you got a minute?

867
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:35,824
Mom still got it, huh?

868
00:46:35,987 --> 00:46:37,949
Why sure, Jane.

869
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:32,162
Better be a rental.

870
00:47:32,228 --> 00:47:34,582
Never trust a thief with
a gold card, baby.

871
00:47:34,663 --> 00:47:36,003
I've missed you.

872
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:37,442
I've missed you too.

873
00:47:37,443 --> 00:47:39,958
- And how was your day been?
- Good.

874
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:41,822
I think I'm getting a hangover.

875
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,470
I think you are too.

876
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,320
- I got the kids into Rosemere.
- Oh yeah?

877
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:55,427
Eighteen grand times three,
how much is that?

878
00:47:55,557 --> 00:47:57,389
That's a lot of money, Wayne.

879
00:47:57,617 --> 00:48:00,495
Well, I've been a crack
