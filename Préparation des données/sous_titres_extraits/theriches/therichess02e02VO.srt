<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:07,177
I guess you're probably
surprised to see me here, Wayne.

3
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:09,763
You and I both know
you're not Doug Rich.

4
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:13,141
Everyone here
seems to think you are.

5
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:15,685
- Where'd you get this?
- In the woods where you buried it.

6
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:18,104
- I want to give it to Pete.
- You're going to bribe Pete?

7
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:19,814
You can't bribe Pete.

8
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:21,399
I have to try.

9
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,615
If you ask me, you never
should have let him go back.

10
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:26,112
- Well, I'm not asking you.
- Pete, you okay?

11
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:28,552
- Jesus!
- I scared you.

12
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,855
I know you're scared.
This is what we do.

13
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:32,219
We can do this, all right?

14
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:34,171
We work when we're together.
You know that.

15
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,998
- Well, we're not together, okay?
- What did you do with Pete?

16
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,958
Let's go for a little stroll.

17
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:40,210
You killed him.

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,712
I hit him, and then...
But he fought back.

19
00:00:42,872 --> 00:00:44,130
You murdered him!

20
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,091
Where the hell are Doug
and Cherien Rich?

21
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:51,478
We split apart. We come back together.
We go on the road.

22
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,848
- This is how we live our lives.
- I changed my mind.

23
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,934
- As it happens, I do have them.
- Have what?

24
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,311
- The guts.
- Tell him not to touch me!

25
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,913
You looking for this?

26
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,607
I should have stopped earlier.

27
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,309
I don't like the smell of this town.

28
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:06,236
We're gonna get a car,
and get out of here.

29
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:08,279
Bayou hills, Doug.
We can't pass it up.

30
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,658
If this goes through,
Panco makes $150 million,

31
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:13,576
and you cash in
on a baker's dozen...

32
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:15,829
$13 million, Doug.

33
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:17,163
$13 million?

34
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:18,623
Put the gun down, Dale.

35
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,291
Just how do you want this to end?

36
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,712
Do you want to go to prison or...

37
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:25,463
do you want to be my partner?

38
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:26,673
50-50.

39
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:29,681
- Is she dead?
- Ma?

40
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:32,345
Wrap that steak in a napkin.
Go steal me a car.

41
00:01:32,505 --> 00:01:34,010
Well, everything's all right.

42
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,172
Just where do you think
you're going?

43
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:38,435
Jesus.

44
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:43,815
This is my van.

45
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:45,608
Your van?

46
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:48,570
This looks just like our van,
sir... just like our van.

47
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,821
Shut the hell up.

48
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:52,907
Think I'm a goddamn moron?

49
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:54,826
Jesus.

50
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:57,662
- Get in back!
- Me?

51
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,587
I am done taking shit.

52
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:07,088
Drive.

53
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:18,287
Your boss has some great taste
in jewelry.

54
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:20,027
Where's the light?

55
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:21,586
I don't know, Hugh.

56
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:24,827
- Probably stuck in traffic somewhere.
- Lord.

57
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:28,763
So, what we gonna do about Pete?

58
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,274
Shut up, Dale.

59
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:33,761
First we cover his tracks.

60
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:35,937
Then we bury his body.

61
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:45,335
Are you really gonna execute us?

62
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:46,993
Shut up!

63
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:49,187
You flea-bitten shit bag!

64
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:51,424
Shut up or you're going back
to the pound!

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,642
Just because the phone rings
don't mean you got to answer it.

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,089
Sir?

67
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,901
I know you're upset because it appeared
that we were taking your van.

68
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:13,052
Maybe you could take
a nice deep breath.

69
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,886
<i>- This is Bob Day.
- Hi, there, Mr. Day.</i>

70
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:21,300
<i>This is Rosemary from
the collection agency.</i>

71
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,678
<i>And I'm calling to find out
whether...</i>

72
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:29,396
You are very stressed.

73
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:32,006
I know we are living
in very stressful times.

74
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,385
They call it the information age,
but it's really the age of stress.

75
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:37,804
That's why so many people
take antidepressants.

76
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:38,998
Shut up!

77
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,598
Shut up!

78
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:43,456
Jesus Christ!
I can't hear my own thoughts!

79
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,022
<i>- This is Bob Day.
- Hello, Mr. Day.</i>

80
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:49,774
This is Rosemary calling again.

81
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:51,484
I tell you what, Rosemary.

82
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:53,194
I'll send the check in.

83
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:56,026
And I'll send it in
when I'm goddamn good and ready.

84
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:58,686
- That's right. Yeah.
- I'm gonna put my manager on the phone.

85
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,660
Fine. No. Put your manager
on the phone.

86
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,380
'cause your manager
can kiss my hairy ass!

87
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:07,083
- My god!
- What the hell you doing?

88
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:13,715
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

89
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,066
- What?
- What are you doing?

90
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:18,511
- Don't do this to me!
- You pace around watching tv.

91
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,720
- Now, what are you doing?!
- Don't you do that!

92
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,487
- Don't do that!
- The son of a bitch is crazy.

93
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,519
I'm tired of you calling me
an asshole!

94
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:28,396
I'm tired of you...

95
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:37,488
I thought I told you
I was done taking shit.

96
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:40,808
Now sit down.

97
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,761
Sit down!

98
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:48,208
Are you insane?

99
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:51,002
Nobody steals my goddamn van.

100
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:52,845
So you're just gonna
execute them?

101
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:54,756
Do you have to undermine
everything I do?

102
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,841
Gee, why would I undermine you?

103
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,678
You're holding a gun
to a little boy's head.

104
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,912
There's just been
a misunderstanding, ma'am.

105
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:06,476
We got confused in the heat.

106
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:10,481
- Why didn't you just call the cops?
- Look at them, miss know-it-all.

107
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,412
What?

108
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:14,984
They're travelers,

109
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:17,028
gypsies, scum of the earth.

110
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:19,989
They're here to rip us off
like the other ones.

111
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,871
The cops ain't gonna do shit.
They're just gonna pay them off.

112
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,606
You're traveler scum?

113
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:27,497
- No, we...
- We're on our way to a funeral, ma'am.

114
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:29,303
Yeah, it was our grandmother.

115
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:31,216
Our grandmother.
She had a heart attack.

116
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,753
We were just on the way
to the funeral, I swear to god.

119
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,117
I can't breathe.

120
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,994
I think I'm gonna faint.

121
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:08,808
My kids are burning up.

122
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:11,399
Can they please just put their
hands down to fan themselves?

123
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,168
Shut up, bob.

124
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:17,588
We're not psycho.
Put your hands down.

125
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:19,631
Thank you, ma'am.

126
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:22,276
We were supposed to get
air-conditioning this summer,

127
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,095
but somebody
didn't get a job.

128
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,167
Why don't you just fan them
personally?

129
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:28,349
Why don't you put in
a swimming pool for them?

130
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,693
I'm trying to show them
a little common decency.

131
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:33,005
You don't show travelers
common decency.

132
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,981
They spit on your common decency.

133
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:38,401
Sir, I understand that you have
strong feelings about this,

134
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:41,654
but what do you got
against travelers?

135
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:43,518
Come on.

136
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:45,700
We're gonna take
a little field trip.

137
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,211
Shut up!

138
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:51,052
Show them, Amber.

139
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:55,298
This guy comes by about
six months ago, real fat guy.

140
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:57,837
Name plate, helmet.
Says he's in termite control.

141
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:01,924
We got an infestation. Charges us
an arm and a leg to get rid of them.

142
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:04,089
Had to take an advance
out on our credit card.

143
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:06,835
- Now they're charging us 19% interest.
- That's right.

144
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,557
Turns out that bastard put
those termites into our wood.

145
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:12,727
You think the fat ass
gave you termites?

146
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:13,777
Yep.

147
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:16,814
I don't think that's possible.
Maybe you already had an infestation.

148
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:18,649
- Shut up!
- She's right.

149
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,892
We should have had
a termite check.

150
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:22,695
I'm juggling, Amber.

151
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:26,345
I'm fighting to keep all of
our financial balls in the air.

152
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:27,960
You're fighting?!

153
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:34,916
60 hours a week!
60 hours a week on my feet at wal-mart

154
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:37,465
- while you laze around on your ass!
- I'm not lazing around!

155
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:40,671
Watching tv, hanging around,
threatening to execute children!

156
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:42,276
- Can I...
- Stay out of it!

157
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:46,302
I was just saying it's stress.

158
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:47,762
That's all.

159
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:50,014
It's just stress.
It's destroying your marriage.

160
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:52,433
- What do you know about my marriage?
- Nothing.

161
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:56,104
I'm just...
I know it's money.

162
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:57,647
Money is the problem.

163
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:00,233
So?

164
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:03,861
So, how much money would it take
to get rid of your stress?

165
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:05,696
Don't listen
to this traveler shit.

166
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:08,116
Can you put the gun down, please?

167
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,126
Please?

168
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:15,454
Thank you.

169
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:18,459
I'm just asking you a question.
I'm just suggesting a possibility.

170
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:21,003
How much would it take?

171
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:29,902
I thought you called your office,
told them that you had the flu.

172
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:31,874
Why are we here?

173
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:34,725
Pete's rental car,
we got to return it.

174
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:36,526
I like the way you think.

175
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,939
- God is in the details.
- Shit!

176
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,035
Meryl Streep said that on tv.

177
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,193
- Shit!
- What?

178
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:46,214
His keys.

179
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:48,798
They must be in his pocket.

180
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:50,242
Shit.

181
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:00,293
Shit.

182
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,420
- Check the other pocket.
- All right, all right.

183
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:04,097
Christ.

184
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,839
You got them?

185
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:11,870
Christ.

186
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:13,548
Got them.

187
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,391
Kimmie! Hi!

188
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:16,809
I thought you had the flu.

189
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:19,979
Don't come close. I got this cold.
It's really contagious, okay?

190
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:21,480
Hang back.

191
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:25,132
Hi. It's a hot one today?

192
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:28,112
Do I know you?
I'm a friend of doug's.

193
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:29,947
I'm taking him to the hospital.

194
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:34,660
Poor guy.
Sick as a dog.

195
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,538
Yeah.

196
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:41,016
So, you work at panco?
That must be pretty exciting, right?

197
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:42,632
You're probably pretty important.

198
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,587
I rope through
the accounting receipts.

199
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:47,153
All I'm saying is
maybe we can help you

200
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:49,467
get more of what you need,
which is money.

201
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:51,093
Don't listen to her, sweetheart.

202
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:54,013
These people got tongues of silk.
They can sell you the fleas off our dog.

203
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,028
No, I'm not trying
to sell you nothing.

204
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:58,100
I'm asking you,
what do you need?

205
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:00,848
Me?

206
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:02,480
What do I need?

207
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,066
What do you need?
I'm hearing all these people calling,

208
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,502
telling you they want this from
you, they want that from you.

209
00:10:07,622 --> 00:10:10,663
I'm asking, what do you need?
What's gonna make you feel better?

210
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:12,070
What do you want?

211
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,700
What do you think you deserve?
What are you entitled to?

212
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,246
- He needs to...
- You are gonna listen.

213
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:22,114
You're not gonna put him down.

214
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,270
You're not gonna tell him
how he's failed.

215
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:27,129
Okay?

216
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:28,965
'cause he gets it.

217
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,578
Why don't you just let him
tell you what he needs?

218
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,018
What do you need, Bob?

219
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:42,319
- I need my space.
- Yeah.

220
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:44,978
Good. That's good.

221
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:46,555
He needs space.

222
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,667
How about you, Amber?

223
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:51,279
Jesus Christ.
I don't know where to start.

224
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:54,031
- Well, start anywhere, sweetheart.
- He forgot our anniversary.

225
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,826
Okay, all right, so...

226
00:10:56,986 --> 00:10:58,744
You need a gift, right?

227
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:01,706
I'm thinking earrings.

228
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:04,083
- Some nice earrings maybe?
- You know, I could see you

229
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:07,209
- in some really nice gold hoops.
- Okay, that's like 50 bucks.

230
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:09,484
$200. You don't want none of
that gold-plate shit.

231
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:11,576
You want the real thing.
Anything else?

232
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:15,136
I need my sundays off.
I need a fan for the kitchen.

233
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:16,554
Fan. That's $100.

234
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:18,389
- I need cable.
- Cable, $65 a month.

235
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:21,183
- I'm tired of internet dial-up.
- Yeah, high-speed.

236
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:23,594
- And I need a vacation.
- Vacation. Let's say disneyland?

237
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:26,147
- $1,000 apiece?
- I really, really need a vacation.

238
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:27,940
And I need to get my hair done.

239
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,277
And I need to be beautiful.

240
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:39,535
We got, $6,158.87.

241
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:42,941
Round that up to a nice 7 grand
and give you two a cushion.

242
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:46,055
Great. Okay.
Is that everything?

243
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:48,521
- I guess.
- Okay, good.

244
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,255
So, 7 grand's
what I'm gonna get you.

245
00:11:51,415 --> 00:11:53,473
- You're gonna give us 7 grand?
- In cash.

246
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,727
You just got to give us
till midnight.

247
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:58,220
Well, what do you think,
that we're stupid?

248
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:01,766
You go.

249
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:04,226
We'll keep the kids
till you get back.

250
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:05,611
By midnight.

251
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:07,681
I can't do it without my kids.

252
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,483
My children are integral
to my operation.

253
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:14,987
I'll stay.

254
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,656
If they don't come back,
you can shoot me.

255
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:20,493
I got nothing to lose.

256
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,953
I'm already getting a divorce,
and my...

257
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:24,789
daughter hates my guts.

258
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,710
Y'all don't come back, the lady dies.

259
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:31,754
That clear?

260
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:34,008
Get the hell out of here
before I lose my nerve.

261
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,173
We love you, Nina.

262
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:37,457
We are coming back for you.

263
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:45,393
- Sit down.
- Yeah. Okay.

264
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:48,680
Ma, where are we gonna get
$7,000 in Blunt, Texas?

265
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:51,931
I'm working on it.

266
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:05,705
You know, that football game
is all we got.

267
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:08,555
Yeah, you're right, mom.
Game's where the action is.

268
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:09,917
It starts at 7:00.

269
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:12,154
The buffers are gonna know
we're not from around here.

270
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:13,796
So we go to military school.

271
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:15,848
Yeah, tell them we're just here
for the game.

272
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:17,967
- Came back to support Carson.
- Who?

273
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:20,511
Carson Emory is last year's
quarterback, shattered his knee.

274
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:22,876
He's in college now,
but his pro-ball prospects

275
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:25,433
- don't look good.
- You thinking of the spit and shine?

276
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:27,644
How many hero cars are we gonna
find in Blunt, Texas?

277
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:28,767
Only need one.

278
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:30,332
You know what?

279
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:33,319
I really appreciate your input,
but I'm gonna do this alone.

280
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,568
There's no way you're doing this
by yourself.

281
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:37,070
No, I am 'cause...

282
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,615
It's been a while. And, you know,
you guys are a bit rusty.

283
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:46,511
Mom, we can do this.
You can't, okay?

284
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,873
You can't go to jail.
I can't have that.

285
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,374
What about what you said?

286
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:52,042
- What I said when?
- Packing.

287
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:54,879
Come on. "We split up. We come back
together. We live our lives."

288
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,630
If this is how we want to live,

289
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,505
this is how we got to
keep living, right?

290
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,084
We're still travelers.

291
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:03,304
Screw them.
Let's roll the dice.

292
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:09,018
Well, I just can't believe
you listened to me.

293
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:11,687
We love you, too.

294
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:13,418
I can do a last wish.

295
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:15,566
Honey.

296
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:17,151
You don't have to do that.

297
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,320
I don't want them to shoot Nina.

298
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,682
Hi, there.
Welcome back, folks.

299
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:23,542
You pay your bill
and you walk away.

300
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,139
- Excuse me?
- Shut your mouth.

301
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,060
I saw you steal from that lady
this morning.

302
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,857
You pay your bill
and you walk away

303
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:31,300
and you never
show your face here again.

304
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,833
Okay, now we're gonna screw them.

305
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:42,093
Nice to have you back.

306
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:44,066
- Supplies, what do we need?
- We need signs.

307
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:45,304
We need t-shirts.

308
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:46,959
- Patriot gear.
- Red carpet.

309
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,847
- What else?
- Raffle tickets.

310
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:50,476
Maybe a short skirt.

311
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:53,479
Okay, by 5:00 we got to get
the patriot lineup down.

312
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,812
No problem.

313
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:56,565
I hate her.

314
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,253
I didn't know you travelers
bothered with divorce.

315
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,474
What?

316
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:21,703
You said you were getting a divorce.

317
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,973
This has been the worst year
of my life.

318
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:50,779
It's medical.

319
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,217
To ease the pain.

320
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:09,930
- We're washing cars!
- Shake it. Shake it. Come on.

321
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,515
I feel like a whore.

322
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,685
Good. Yeah.
Okay.

323
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,187
All right. Running back stats.

324
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,401
Robert Blagman, 1,900 yards,
25 plays per game average.

325
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,824
Tight end stats?

326
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:28,324
Sam Sullivan, 1,600 yards,
11 plays per game average.

327
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:30,784
- You're gonna know that shit, right?
- I know it. I got it.

328
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:33,159
Cougars fan?

329
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,998
Patriots. Beautiful Escalade, though.
You want me to buff it out?

330
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:39,138
- Go for a joyride, I'll ring your neck.
- Done. $5, please.

331
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:41,658
Make sure you get the grime
that's caked under the mud caps.

332
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:42,985
Thank you, sir.

333
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,385
That dickhead shortchanged me.

334
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:50,054
So? We got our hero car.

335
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,552
Maribelle Johnson.

336
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:58,873
87 years old,
beloved grandmother.

337
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:02,483
It says here the funeral
will be today and tomorrow.

338
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,894
Jesus, do I have to spell
everything out for you?

339
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,236
You know what?

340
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:11,237
I personally am not in the habit
of disposing of corpses,

341
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:12,970
so maybe I don't possess

342
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,995
the corpse-disposing finesse
that you do.

343
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:18,454
We have to dig an extra 3 feet
to create a false bottom.

344
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:20,657
Get it?

345
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:23,879
Get in.

346
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,714
You don't get to order me around.

347
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:35,052
Man.

348
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,226
We really are buffers.

349
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,015
What's up?

350
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:47,945
Nothing.

351
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:50,471
Don't tell me you're gonna miss
Edenfalls that much.

352
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,853
No, I just...

353
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:55,754
You know, I didn't even
get to say goodbye to Erick.

354
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,313
I don't want to just disappear,
you know?

355
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:01,554
Call him.

356
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:04,378
Tell him dad got transferred to Biloxi.

357
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,204
Yeah, that's what i'm gonna tell him

358
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:10,050
to explain to him why
i'm never gonna see him again.

359
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:13,234
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

360
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:15,828
I always thought
he was kind of a douche.

361
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:20,626
Look, you're not gonna
remember him in a week.

362
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:23,480
I promise.

363
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:27,335
Yeah, I guess.

364
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,141
Okay. Ready to go.

365
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,332
This reminds me of that story
about the scorpion and the goat,

366
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,480
where they want to get
across the river.

367
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,671
But the scorpion don't go
with the goat because he...

368
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,050
Wait, no, there was also a cabbage.

369
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,388
Right, so, the scorpion
and the goat and the cabbage

370
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,081
want to get across the river.

371
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:59,224
A cabbage cannot want
to get across a river.

372
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:02,101
It's a story, Wayne.

373
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,479
A cabbage cannot want
to get across a river.

374
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,676
It's a cabbage. That's the difference
between a cabbage...

375
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,276
and you.

376
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:13,405
I know the difference between
a cabbage and myself, Wayne.

377
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,549
You always talk to me
like I'm a moron.

378
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:17,951
I am not a moron.

379
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:21,482
You know what your problem is, Wayne?

380
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:23,665
You always think you're better
than everyone else.

381
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,006
We're gonna bury Pete here,

382
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,592
and then that's the end
of our little collaboration.

383
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,362
I'm gonna get in my car.

384
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,982
I'm gonna drive a long way
from here,

385
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:41,141
and I'm never
gonna see you again.

386
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:49,199
You've obviously forgotten
about our mutually assured destruction.

387
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,180
It seems to me you could stay

388
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,530
now that I solved
your little problem.

389
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,866
With Pete taken care of,

390
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:01,995
you could walk away with $13 million

391
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:03,984
without batting an eye.

392
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:07,754
Think about
what you could do with $13 million.

393
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:09,824
You could buy a house.

394
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:12,801
You could buy three houses.
Hell, you could sail around the world.

395
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,049
You can have everything
that you ever wanted for you

396
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,858
and your precious family.

397
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:23,100
The body in that trunk
is starting to smell,

398
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,102
and you and I both know
what it smells like.

399
00:20:25,262 --> 00:20:27,813
It smells like freedom,
and it smells like money.

400
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:31,941
I knew Pete,

401
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:33,116
all right?

402
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:35,571
A few hours ago,
he was a living, breathing person.

403
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:37,406
He sat in my house.

404
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:40,117
He talked to me about his life.
I had dinner with him.

405
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:43,620
I always liked the guy.

406
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,248
He'll be dead
whether you take the money or not.

407
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:49,167
Shut up.

408
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:51,753
You know you're thinking about it.
Just like Doug Rich.

409
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:53,380
- Shut up.
- You did kill him.

410
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,188
It wasn't my fault!

411
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,805
It was an accident.

412
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:05,434
Just like it was an accident
that I killed Pete.

413
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:06,809
You bludged him!

414
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,605
You smashed his skull with a hammer!

415
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,144
I feel real bad about that.

416
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,130
Which is why you and I...

417
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:17,029
are so alike.

418
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:20,891
Get back to work.

419
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,488
Grave ain't go dig itself.

420
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:33,754
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

421
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,287
<i>If you'd like to leave...</i>

422
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,768
Patriots, yeah!

423
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,137
Are you in Galveston yet?

424
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:46,141
We got stuck in Blunt, Texas.

425
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:48,991
Shit. Shit.

426
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:51,538
Oh, God. Look at my hands.

427
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:54,312
Do you have any more
of that hand sanitizer shit?

428
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:58,487
'Cause these open sores,
they can be really dangerous.

429
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,909
I can get an infection and die.

430
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,947
You're not gonna die from a blister.

431
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,671
Hugh says the viruses get in there,
and then they'll poison all your blood.

432
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:15,739
And viruses are everywhere.

433
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:16,780
Mutants.

434
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:20,596
Can't kill them
'cause they're resistant to everything.

435
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,176
He says it's 'cause of the hormones
that we give to cows.

436
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:24,539
Will you help me?

437
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:26,762
So, what do you think?

438
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:30,633
Yes, I think you will die of a virus.

439
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:32,743
I'm talking about all that money.

440
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:35,065
What if someone comes looking for him?

441
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:36,817
You said he didn't have friends.

442
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:38,944
He's got a mother.

443
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, shit.

444
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:43,073
I didn't think about his mother.

445
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:56,128
We should probably say a few words.

446
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:00,795
Dear Pete...

447
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,136
I'm sorry Dale bashed your brains in.

448
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:06,491
Amen.

449
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,543
Well, if somebody does come looking,

450
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:13,520
you just spew some bullshit.

451
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,201
That's what you're good at.

452
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,474
I just want
a little piece of the action, Wayne...

453
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:22,779
a little job at Panco.

454
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:25,522
Have some respect, for God's sakes.

455
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,930
Hang in there, big guy.

456
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:53,268
What's your wish?

457
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,524
What?

458
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,067
I really want to go to...

459
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:02,900
It's okay, honey.
Don't tire yourself out.

460
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,408
You are doing such a great job, okay?

461
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:10,486
Wheeze more.

462
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:16,621
Ah, Christ.

463
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,546
You really got to scrub.
That dirt really gets caked in there.

464
00:24:21,706 --> 00:24:23,531
<i>Wayne, we're in trouble.</i>

465
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:26,659
<i>We're in real bad trouble.</i>
<i>We're stuck.</i>

466
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:28,558
<i>We're in Blunt, Texas.</i>

467
00:24:28,678 --> 00:24:31,154
<i>Nina's being held hostage
by some crazy guy with a gun.</i>

468
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:32,724
<i>You got to get here.</i>

469
00:24:35,095 --> 00:24:37,604
Hey, you want some water for your hands?

470
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,989
Are you still in Blunt?

471
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,658
I hope you're there.

472
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:51,451
I fixed the RV.

473
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:53,635
I got delayed, but I'm on my way.

474
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:07,717
The worst part was the alpacas.

475
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:10,137
I didn't know travelers had alpacas.

476
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:11,930
They were Jim's.

477
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:14,933
Jim and his goddamn alpacas.

478
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:16,894
Why did Jim have alpacas?

479
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:19,813
I don't know.

480
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:22,149
For the wool?

481
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,140
He's gay.

482
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:32,309
Them gays and their goddamn wool.

483
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:35,287
I don't care that he's gay.

484
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:37,068
I'm happy for him.

485
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,875
I'm happy he's happy.

486
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:44,254
But everything he told me was a lie.

487
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:46,840
When he said he loved me,
that was a lie.

488
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:51,422
When he told me I was beautiful,
that was a lie, too.

489
00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:54,890
I think you're beautiful.

490
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,977
You don't have to say that.

491
00:26:01,578 --> 00:26:02,478
I mean it.

492
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,201
Well, I feel invisible.

493
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,577
I know what you mean.

494
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:19,497
Ever since Desert Storm,

495
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:22,542
I lie around
while the world passes me by.

496
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:26,148
I just didn't feel like
I was good enough,

497
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:27,271
like I don't...

498
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,799
Like I don't deserve to be loved.

499
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:35,722
That is just so wrong, Bob.

500
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:40,646
I'm sorry.

501
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,095
I've been such a...

502
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,772
bitch to you.

503
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:49,361
You have such nice fingers, Bob.

504
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:58,787
Would you excuse us?

505
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:03,880
Don't mind me.

506
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,627
Don't go anywhere, all right?

507
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:14,135
I wouldn't want to have to blow
your head off at this point in the game.

508
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:31,152
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean? What's it look like?

509
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:32,779
Didn't sally talk to you?

510
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:35,337
Yeah, it's for the raffle.
So Carson can get his knee surgery.

511
00:27:35,457 --> 00:27:37,033
Whoever wins gets a new Escalade.

512
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:38,618
Who donated the car?

513
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:40,298
Let's just say...

514
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:43,402
it was a member
of the Blunt football family, you know.

515
00:27:43,522 --> 00:27:44,749
"It takes a village."

516
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:47,585
Don't you want Carson to play again?

517
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,924
- How much are tickets?
- Tickets are 20 bucks.

518
00:27:57,964 --> 00:27:59,044
Excuse me.

519
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:00,181
Thank you.

520
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:12,718
Okay, now, here's what I want you to do.

521
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:13,756
Spit on it,

522
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:16,798
and rub it on this here
Carson Emory-signed football for luck.

523
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:17,916
Sweet.

524
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:20,076
So, what do you think
of Carson's chances?

525
00:28:20,237 --> 00:28:22,685
- Do you think he could start for TCU?
- That's what we're hoping.

526
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:24,338
It's the best surgery we got.

527
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,582
It's a new experimental surgery
over at Johns Hopkins,

528
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:29,501
so if the surgery works,
the sky is the limit.

529
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:30,962
Thank you for helping.

530
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:33,214
God, that's $100. You want five tickets?

531
00:28:36,687 --> 00:28:37,791
<i>Who's this?</i>

532
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:38,843
Doug...

533
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:40,954
I mean Wayne?

534
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:42,895
<i>Nina! Where are you?</i>

535
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:09,959
$40, $60, $80...
$6,400.

536
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,461
Plus whatever Sam got.

537
00:29:11,621 --> 00:29:13,213
Let's get Sam, get out of here

538
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,131
before that kid comes back
for his Escalade.

539
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:20,761
What gives? I heard you guys
are raising money for me.

540
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:24,024
Oh, good God.

541
00:29:24,144 --> 00:29:26,514
I thought you said
he was still in college.

542
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:30,772
God, Carson, it's such an honor
that you came to the game.

543
00:29:31,695 --> 00:29:34,199
Yeah, I never like to miss a big game.

544
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,484
Yeah, no. Me either.

545
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:37,547
God, I love watching you score.

546
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:39,227
I do.

547
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:42,878
God, do you remember that game
last september, six seconds to go,

548
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,923
the Patriots are down 45-41,

549
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:49,290
and you threw that unbelievable pass
to the 15-yard line? Do you remember?

550
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,877
- There was a lot of luck involved.
- That wasn't luck. That was a miracle.

551
00:29:54,232 --> 00:29:55,386
I almost cried.

552
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:58,258
Okay, let's get Sam.
We'll circle back for Di Di.

553
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:01,999
I remember them.
I knew it was you,

554
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,889
the minute I heard some assholes
were selling raffle tickets. Grab them!

555
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:06,474
These people are frauds!

556
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:10,061
They are using the good name
of Carson Emory to steal your money!

557
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:12,230
They're not even Patriot fans!

558
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,316
Stop hitting my kid!

559
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:18,153
- There's no experimental surgery?
- Look, there's still hope.

560
00:30:18,313 --> 00:30:19,654
Shut up, you traveler bitch.

561
00:30:19,814 --> 00:30:21,698
- We got you 6 grand!
- Shut up!

562
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:25,034
Please don't touch him!

563
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:32,125
Hey, come on!

564
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:34,085
Leave him alone!

565
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:40,637
Shit.

566
00:30:45,232 --> 00:30:46,181
Stay there.

567
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:53,480
Don't hit him!
Stop it!

568
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:55,607
Get off!

569
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:01,362
Everybody freeze!

570
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:04,115
This is the FBI!

571
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:06,826
All right, this is an FBI operation.

572
00:31:06,986 --> 00:31:08,369
Everybody stand down.

573
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:10,163
Sir, put the bat down.

574
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:11,661
Put it down.

575
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:13,833
I want you, you, and you
against the fence.

576
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:15,835
These three. Come on. Move it.

577
00:31:15,995 --> 00:31:18,087
Let's go. Come on, missy.
Assume the position.

578
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:19,839
These people are travelers.

579
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,425
There are more in the stadium.
Watch out for them.

580
00:31:22,585 --> 00:31:24,594
Watch for your wallets.
Watch for your bags.

581
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:28,077
This is an FBI operation.
There are other agents in the stadium.

582
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:31,059
Everyone go back to the game.
Just relax and enjoy yourselves.

583
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:33,770
I've got the woman and the two kids.

584
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,619
Hands behind the back, Missy.

585
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:38,141
The show is over here.
Well done, everybody.

586
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:39,150
Excellent.

587
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,194
All right, you three,
let's head this way.

588
00:31:41,354 --> 00:31:43,404
Sir, could you grab my purse?
Thank you.

589
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:46,616
We're going to the north fence.
We are going to the north exit.

590
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:49,786
All right, show's over, kids.
Everyone back to the game.

591
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:53,623
We're out of here. FBI operation.
We know what we're doing here.

592
00:31:55,368 --> 00:31:56,541
Oh, God.

593
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:00,880
Cal, you're bleeding like a stuck pig.

594
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,382
Put your head back.

595
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,593
- Is it broken?
- I don't know. Let me see.

596
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:06,761
I don't think so.
We just got rusty.

597
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:09,222
Our skills got real rusty.

598
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:17,146
Geez.

599
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,956
- Let's go.
- Come on, baby.

600
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:23,319
Okay, hit it, Wayne!

601
00:32:27,483 --> 00:32:29,117
We got to get our timing back.

602
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:31,771
Would you stop moving your head around?

603
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:38,335
How'd you find us? How'd you find her?

604
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:40,086
I found him, and we found you.

605
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:42,589
Using our charm
and powers of persuasion.

606
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:44,112
How's it going, Di Di?

607
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:51,694
It's good.

608
00:32:51,814 --> 00:32:54,726
Dad, I think
the 55 is about a mile up ahead.

609
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,811
But we got to give the Days the 7 grand.

610
00:32:56,971 --> 00:32:58,353
They held us at gunpoint.

611
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:00,648
If we don't, they're gonna think
all travelers are scum.

612
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:03,359
- Why would they think that?
- You know what?

613
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,213
Sam's right. A deal's a deal.
We got to go back.

614
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,830
Hon, I think Bob and Amber
are gonna be just fine.

615
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:12,035
We forgot ma!
Make a left right here.

616
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:13,369
She's not your mama!

617
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:17,362
I am not leaving my ma to rot with
jew-hating rednecks. Make that left!

618
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:19,129
She's not a jew.

619
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,127
Oh, yeah, she is a jew. Okay.

620
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:23,631
You're not Cherien.

621
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,923
Let's get out of here.

622
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,240
I hear you've been a bad ma.

623
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,886
Thank you, Doug.

624
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:33,003
You don't need that no more, mama.

625
00:33:58,564 --> 00:33:59,282
God.

626
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,710
I thought
they were gonna kill Cal back there.

627
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,796
He'll be okay.

628
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:07,298
You weren't there when that freak
held a gun to his head.

629
00:34:09,377 --> 00:34:11,115
I never used to get scared.

630
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:14,555
That's the thing... That's the thing
that messed up my timing.

631
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,853
What happened with Pete?

632
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:24,474
Did he take the money?

633
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:26,150
Pete went home.

634
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:28,611
He went home?

635
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,321
He took the money?

636
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,990
Sam was right.
Money makes the world go around.

637
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,206
I knew it.

638
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:35,535
I told you.

639
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:39,884
What?

640
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:42,291
You think it's safe to go back now?

641
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:44,043
Oh, Jesus Christ.

642
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:46,212
Don't be stupid. He's gonna want more.

643
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:48,089
You think that's his price?

644
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:49,248
40 grand?

645
00:34:50,092 --> 00:34:51,426
He's gonna own us.

646
00:34:51,586 --> 00:34:55,138
The minute you get what you think
you want, you always want more.

647
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:57,306
He's not gonna want more.

648
00:34:57,466 --> 00:34:59,267
Everybody wants more... Everybody.

649
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:00,685
As soon as we get back.

650
00:35:00,805 --> 00:35:02,311
We're going back to Edenfalls?

651
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,313
No, Dad, we can't keep being the Riches.

652
00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:06,023
He's gonna own our goddamn souls.

653
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:12,488
Look, do I look like I'm driving back?

654
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:14,031
I mean,

655
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:17,160
we said Mexico,
we're going to Mexico.

656
00:35:53,446 --> 00:35:54,238
<i>Adiós.</i>

657
00:35:54,398 --> 00:35:55,235
What?

658
00:35:56,107 --> 00:35:57,909
That's all the spanish I know...

659
00:35:58,246 --> 00:36:00,203
<i>Adiós</i> and <i>gracias</i>.

660
00:36:00,363 --> 00:36:02,705
I'm pretty sure they speak
a lot of english in Mexico.

661
00:36:02,865 --> 00:36:04,373
You've never been there.

662
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,925
Where are we gonna live?

663
00:36:09,474 --> 00:36:10,797
How are we gonna get money?

664
00:36:12,154 --> 00:36:13,318
Live in the RV...

665
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:15,968
you know,
make money like we always did.

666
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:17,697
You gonna con in spanish?

667
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:19,822
<i>Si, señorita.</i>

668
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:21,849
You can't con in spanish.

669
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,228
Hell, I can barely con
in English anymore apparently.

670
00:36:25,388 --> 00:36:26,687
Well, we'll make do.

671
00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:28,815
- We always do.
- You know...

672
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:31,847
We could keep paying him off.

673
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:34,153
Ma, we're not going back to Edenfalls.

674
00:36:34,313 --> 00:36:35,676
I'm just saying it's possible.

675
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,281
- Then what?
- I don't know.

676
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:40,868
See what happens.
See... how it rides.

677
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:44,205
- We roll the dice?
- In Edenfalls?

678
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:45,998
Shit, cal, what's your better idea?

679
00:36:46,158 --> 00:36:47,827
Take our chances in some shithole

680
00:36:47,994 --> 00:36:50,169
and you get your ass beat
every day by some townies?

681
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:52,692
Who knows, next place we go,
you might actually get killed.

682
00:36:52,812 --> 00:36:54,907
At least we'd be doing something
we want to do.

683
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:58,135
Instead of sitting around in Edenfalls
turning into a bunch of rich assholes.

684
00:36:59,036 --> 00:37:01,055
Situations can change, you know.

685
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:03,641
What do you mean?

686
00:37:05,462 --> 00:37:06,405
Well...

687
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:10,485
I wasn't gonna tell you this, but...

688
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:13,276
There is another way.

689
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,740
I saw Hugh last night, and he's got
one of these big deals closing.

690
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:22,952
He's always got
some big-ass deal going on.

691
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:25,872
Yeah, but it's $150 million.

692
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:28,624
My cut would be 13.

693
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,502
Million?

694
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:33,129
That's right.

695
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:34,797
$13 million?

696
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:36,235
It's a land deal.

697
00:37:36,995 --> 00:37:39,246
If everything goes right,
it should be a few months.

698
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:42,305
If Pete's a problem,
then we'll just pay him off again.

699
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,851
- Why the hell are we going to Mexico?
- What about Dale?

700
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,396
What the hell is he doing in Edenfalls,
and what does he want from us?

701
00:37:50,794 --> 00:37:52,064
I'll deal with Dale.

702
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:55,610
Maybe we could buy a house on an island.

703
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:59,363
For $13 million,
we can get our own castle in Ireland.

704
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,950
- This real?
- Yeah. I saw the papers.

705
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,536
All we got to do is
be the Riches for a few months.

706
00:38:05,696 --> 00:38:09,611
Deal closes, we cash in, check out,
and <i>adiòs</i>, just like any other con.

707
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:12,251
$13 million?

708
00:38:13,347 --> 00:38:16,034
Well, then we wouldn't always
have to be running.

709
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,363
We wouldn't always have
to be scared of every redneck cop.

710
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:21,052
Every man has his price.

711
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:24,889
Now, it's not about that, Cal.

712
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,849
No? What's it about?

713
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:29,543
It's about being free.

714
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,239
So, which way?

715
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:06,977
Okay.

716
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:37,962
Wayne Malloy's got himself
a $150 million deal.
