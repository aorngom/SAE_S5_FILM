1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,960
Previously on "the riches".

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,040
Bayou hills.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,200
It's $150 million, and
you cash in on $13 million.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,430
$13 million?

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,280
Deal closes, we cash in, check out,

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,010
and adios, just likeany other con.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,050
What did you do with pete?

8
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:14,800
You killed him.

9
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,020
I hit him, but he fought back.

10
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,160
You murdered him!

11
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,950
No one's heard from pete
since he left our place.

12
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,620
You gave him that $40,000that
I buried and sam found,

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,320
and he took it, right?

14
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,270
Don't you bullshit me, wayne.

15
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,660
Is pete dead?

16
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,770
It was an accident.

17
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,080
No one meant for it to happen.

18
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,540
I just think if we could do one
thing that we knowis true, wayne.

19
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,800
I'm dahlia malloy, and
I'm a parole violator.

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,590
I'm doing my best!

21
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,670
But you're lying to me.

22
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,640
Okay, I'm lying a little bit.

23
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,450
What about*****

24
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,640
What ****** my parole?

25
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,550
We're done!

26
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,520
Hi.

27
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,420
Eden falls security.

28
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,250
So this is whatyou do all day?

29
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,070
I wanted to see you.

30
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,620
You're gonna run for mayor.

31
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,570
Ta-da!

32
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,660
What do you think?

33
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,670
I'd rather be piss-poorwith my dad than
$13 million richerwith whoever you are.

34
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,570
Where you headed, cal?

35
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,660
Just hitting the road.

36
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,230
This is rosaleen.

37
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,200
Hi.

38
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,290
Hi, rosaleen.

39
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,610
So, what have you gotfor me?

40
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,060
I got wayne malloy wrapped
around my little finger.

41
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,080
Bollocks.

42
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,500
Mr. Rich, I was just wondering
why I didn't get the job.

43
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,920
So, you all know each other.

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,880
I get it.

45
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,450
It's a family project.

46
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,110
This is bigger than me.

47
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,320
Bigger than reilly.

48
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,590
I'm asking you...
what are you scared of?

49
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,740
I need to move jim's birthday
party to your place tonight.

50
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,800
First word.

51
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,000
"The."The roar... Roar of the crowd!

52
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,700
Oh,"dead calm"!

53
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,540
I can't hear his heartbeat!

54
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,710
Somebody, call an ambulance!

55
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,240
Dad, wake up.

56
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,340
You're gonna be latefor the funeral.

57
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,040
Okay, okay, okay.

58
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't worry, sammy.

59
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,330
It's gonna be okay.

60
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,600
It's all gonna be okay.

61
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,300
Dad, it's 8:30.We're gonna be late.

62
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,180
- 8:30?
- Yeah.

63
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,710
Morning.

64
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,500
Dale's truck has been parked
outside for three days now.

65
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,110
Where the helldo you think he could be?

66
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,320
Sam, you're gonna be latefor the bus.

67
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,770
- Di di.
- What?

68
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,620
I'll be waiting in the car.

69
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,450
Who knew jim hadso many friends?

70
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,210
Dahlia.

71
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,830
Dahlia.

72
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,300
Damn it, dahlia, I'm talking to you.

73
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,560
This is not the gulag.

74
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,950
I don't deservethis silent bullshit.

75
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,550
Look, everything I have done,
I have done for this family.

76
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,450
At least, that's the lie you
like to tell yourself, wayne.

77
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,050
God damn it.

78
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,560
Would you two just stop it?

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,130
What the hell is going on?

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,480
Ask your father.

81
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,980
Oh, no, I'm asking both of you.

82
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,370
Is it about cal?

83
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,370
No. No, it's nothing.

84
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,820
Bullshit.

85
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,120
We're talkingabout pete, di di.

86
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,460
Ask your fatherwhat happened to pete.

87
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,360
Jesus, dahlia.

88
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,420
Pete?

89
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,770
What happened to pete?

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,140
Daddy?

91
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,660
Dad.

92
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,580
Okay.

93
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Pete died.

94
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,350
What?

95
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,250
It was an accident.

96
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,140
He's dead?

97
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,430
Yeah, pete's dead.

98
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,790
Dale killed him, and
your dad buried him.

102
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,840
My jim was a man of many, many talents.

103
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,080
He discovered his passion late in life.

104
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,480
But when he did, he committed to
it with all his heart and soul.

105
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,840
There are no words to describe
my love for this fine man.

106
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,870
But I would be doing him
a great disservice were

107
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,160
I not to mention the
generosity of spirit,

108
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,580
the exemplary christian forgiveness
that nina has shown to both of us.

109
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,760
Nina, would you like to say a few words?

110
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:59,380
I was married to jim
for... for 25 years.

111
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,390
And I'm sure most of you are wondering

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,460
how I could be married to a gay man
for that long without knowing it.

113
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,610
Well, guess what.

114
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,420
It's none of your goddamn business!

115
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,790
Nina.

116
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,880
Friends?

117
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,700
Amongst friends?

118
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,840
I don't know any of you people!

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,310
If this whole thing had been up to me,

120
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,890
jim would have been cremated
and stuck in a closet somewhere!

121
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,040
Do you think I would
have had any of this?

122
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,330
I hate funerals!

123
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,870
I hate funerals!

124
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,810
I hate that goddamn alpaca,
and I really hate all of you!

125
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,200
Come on. We'll get out of here.

126
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,210
Come on. Come on.

127
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,150
Okay.

128
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,180
Come on.

129
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,040
Let's go.

130
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,370
Take... take me away from here, as
far away from here as humanly possible.

131
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,880
Like a bit of stone, I
lie under a broken tree.

132
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,270
What?

133
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,450
I could recover, if I
shrieked my heart's agony.

134
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,340
To passing bird, but I am
dumb from human dignity.

135
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,700
What's that supposed to mean?

136
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,820
I'm not sure.

137
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,220
It's from a book that quinn loaned me.

138
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
I like the way it sounded,

139
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,240
especially the "shrieking
my heart's agony" part.

140
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,270
What do you think it means?

141
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,260
It should mean whatever you want it to.

142
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,110
I want it to mean someone thinks
I'm smart enough to figure it out.

143
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,980
That I'm not just some
dumb trailer trash.

144
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,630
You're not.

145
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,440
Is it true?

146
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,640
Baby.

147
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,200
So this is who we are?

148
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,600
Di di. Di di.

149
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,340
What?

150
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,710
Where the hell you at, doug?

151
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,510
Get your ass down
here... I mean yesterday.

152
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,490
Down where?

153
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,570
Bayou hills construction site.

154
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,830
Where the hell do you think?

155
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,020
We got a shitstorm going on down here,

156
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,650
you're not answering your goddamn phone?

157
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,050
I'll be right there.

158
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,150
Di di.

159
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,530
Crap.

160
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,210
Go on, jamie. Go on.

161
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,860
This is my neighbor. Come on.

162
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,980
This your place?

163
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,520
Yeah.

164
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,990
It's, uh.

165
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,960
It's complicated.

166
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,550
It's kind of like my
secret getaway, where I.

167
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,830
Get to be alone.

168
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,540
Hey, you want some coffee... something?

169
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,900
No one else know about this place?

170
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,970
Nope.

171
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,530
Not even wayne?

172
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,090
Especially not wayne.

173
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,980
Coffee all you got?

174
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,020
Just running along here.

175
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
Where were you standing?

176
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,740
Pretty good shape, considering.

177
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,880
Just gonna getyour B.P. Here.

178
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,640
Jesus christ!

179
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,560
What happened here?

180
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,560
Chain broke.

181
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,810
Poor bastardmay never walk again.

182
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,710
Don't say that!

183
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,510
You don't know that.

184
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,300
Where the hell you been?

185
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,590

186
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,290
Ohh, I'm not that goodwith blood.

187
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,240
Hang in there, buddy.

188
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,720
I'm gonna do everythingl can.

189
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,270
Get you anything you need.

190
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,070
You don't look so good.

191
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,050
Why don't you sit down?

192
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,260
No, I'm fine.

193
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,010
No, I don't think so.

194
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,030
Come on.

195
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,090
Why does this happen to me?

196
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,000
Put your headbetween your legs.

197
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,380
Okay, all right.

198
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,970
All righty?

199
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,260
How could thatgoddamn chain break?

200
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,980
I mean, what are the oddsof that, doug?

201
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,170
How many tons of crap has
thatthing lifted in its lifetime...

202
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,910
decides to goand break on me?

203
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,990
Maybe this is it.

204
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,200
This is what?

205
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,690
Karma.

206
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,090

A man seriously injuredon my watch.

208
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,780
You know, gee-gee... gee-gee...

209
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,780
What are youtalking about here?

210
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,150
- This was an accident, yeah?

211
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,520
Accidents happen.

212
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,170
We can't control
everything. We're not god.

213
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,730
Let me tell you something...
I've been a contractor 21 years.

214
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,910
This wasno goddamn accident.

215
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,060
Well, I guess I made a lot
of friends back there, huh?

216
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,250
Tough shit.

217
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,230
You're allowed to feel like crapat
your husband's funeral, you know?

218
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,810
Even if you weren'texactly.

219
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,190
Together.

220
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,140

221
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,650
I did love him.

222
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,760
I know you did.

223
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,170
Hey, hold on one second.

224
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,300
Dahlia, I thinkyou should call me.

225
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,730
Bastard.

226
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,070
Problems at home?

227
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,150
No.

228
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,850
It's my parole officer.

229
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,920
Your parole officer?

230
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,920

Shit.

233
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,260

234
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,910
Hell, insurance company finds
out this might'vebeen foul play,

235
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,750

No more goddamnsurprise funerals, okay?

239
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,620
Drink your water.

240
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,600
It's good for the shock.

241
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,970
You got to start gettingyour head in the
right place for our campaign announcement,

242
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,920
'cause you winning this election is

Doug.

244
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,100
You really thinkl can win this thing?

245
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,420
Absolutely.

246
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,840
Hugh panetta can winwhatever
he goddamn pleases.

247
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,110
- You better believe it!
- Remember that.

248
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,380
Aubrey, it's me.

249
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,110
There's been a change of plans.

250
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,690
Okay, I want you to get berthaud
construction in the office.

251
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,380
I want you to phonefelix minkov.

252
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,270
Tell him I want to see him.

253
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,550
So, you're an ex-con.

254
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,320
And a drug addict...
don't forget that part.

255
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,230
And a parole violator.

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,620
Yeah, I got lost.

257
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,360
Badly lost.

258
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,660
And I turnedinto someone else.

259
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,260
Cherien rich.

260
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,950
No, I mean, in here... I
turned into someone elsein here.

261
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,840
I just got to keep giving my
selfa second chance, you know?

262
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,460
I blew itwith this parole officer.

263
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,170
I... and I don't knowwhat to do.

264
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,810
There's probably a
warrant outfor my arrest.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,290
You are so full of shit, dahlia.

266
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,830
We just camefrom my husband's funeral...

267
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,140

- I'm sorry.

268
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,700
Oh, shut up.

269
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,140
I'm not done with you, but
I am done with the lies.

270
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:08,330
Dahlia, you couldn't tell the
truth if your lifedepended on it.

271
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,020
My lifedoes depend on it, nina.

272
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,390
Come here.

273
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,980

274
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,700

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,340
What's the story on the P.I.

277
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,850
Who came to my housethe other
day, asking about that guy pete?

278
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,280
I don't knowwhat happened to pete.

279
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,500
I was jim's beardfor 25 years.

280
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:25,420
I knew he was gay, but I lied to
myself, to everyone, all those years.

281
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,870
You want to give
yourselfa second chance?

282
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,060
You want to be my friend?

283
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,720
Then face the truth.

284
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,310
I don't knowwhat the truth is, nina.

285
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,360
I got to go homeand
scrounge myself up a joint.

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,110
Thank you, doug.

547
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:03,130
I won't forgetwhat you have done
and what you continue to dofor me.

548
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,530
All right.

549
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,540
Good night, turd blossom.

550
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,150
Good night.

551
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,510
I fly to thee, o virgin
of virgins, my mother.

552
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,880
I come to thee, and before thee
I stand, sinful and sorrowful.

553
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,320
O mother of the word incarnate,
despise not my petitions,

554
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,450
but in thy mercy, hear and answer them.

555
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,920
Amen.

556
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,590
This is maurice devereux.

557
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,220
Leave a message.

558
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,330
Yes, hello.

559
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,800
This is dahlia.

560
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,740
L-I really need to talk to you, please.

561
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,380
I've been trying for days now.

562
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,520
And I know you're pissed, and
you have every right to be,

563
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,040
but, if you could, please, just
call me back, then we could talk.

564
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,700
Honestly.

565
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,730
About everything.

566
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,400
Okay? Thank you.

567
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:06,960
Hold on. Hold on.

568
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,750
That could be my brother.

569
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,080
Is it him?

570
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,300
No.

571
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,470
No, it's my mom.

572
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,770
Y-you don't want to.

573
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,020
No, no.

574
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,650
Yeah?

575
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,630
Is this your first time?

576
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,420
Yeah.

577
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,730
Yeah, me too.

578
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,310
Go on. You do it.

579
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,320
I'm through.

580
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,170
Where you going, babe?

581
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,150
Hey.

582
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,830
You left this on the
grassat school today.

583
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,890
Oh, shit.

584
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,010
Shit!

585
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,480
Dahlia, what the hell?

586
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,450
Oh, hey, hey.

587
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,570
No, I knowl shouldn't have come here.

588
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,150
I know you washed your
handsof me, and you're right.

589
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,000
L-l-I...
it's crazy.

590
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:58,720
What are you doing here?

591
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,130
Well, clearly, I'm out
of my mind, ain't I?

592
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,820
I want to help you, dahlia. I do.

593
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,260
Well,15 or 20 unanswered
phonecalls... not real helpful.

594
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,810
You're a parole officer.

595
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,220
You just don't get it, do you?

596
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,560
Wait. What am I supposed to get?

597
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,410
I didn't come here... I'm sorry.

598
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,210
I did not come here for that.

599
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,240
I didn'T.

600
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,120
I came here... I came
here to talk to you.

601
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,320
Your family's 20 feet away.

602
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,580
Forget it. I can't do that to.

603
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,860
Dahlia!

604
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,050
Did you take my pot?

605
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,170
Uh, uh, yes.

606
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,130
- Yes, I did.
- Give it to me.

607
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,190
Nina.

608
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,600
Wes.

609
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,230
Dr. Morgenstern.

610
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,900
He brought you over
some foodfrom the wake.

611
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,000
Thank you.

612
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,700

613
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,210

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,550
Don't know where di di is.

615
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,460

Where did you two goafter the funeral?

620
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,280
Nowhere.

621
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,010
A walk.

622
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,060
Why?

623
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,710
You know where she is now?

624
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,000
Sorry.

625
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,760
Are you sure you don't knowwhere she is?

626
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,480
I've been calling herall day.

627
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,600
Maybe you could call her.

628
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,950
Me?

629
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,780

630
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,430
Let me ask you this, wayne.

631
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,950

633
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,180

634
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,790
You sure?

635
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,720
'Cause from wherel'm sitting, you
look to bea little confused about that.

636
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,410
Yeah, good shit.

637
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,020
Bobby mcgee.

638
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,580
Those folks just got this bed.

639
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,250
Had it flown infrom france.

640
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:43,540
Used to, like, belongto
an emperor or something.

641
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Well, it is kind of likea cloud.

642
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,450
I think the leadership
council would have to approve.

643
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,510
The leadership council?

644
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,110
Oh, yeah.

645
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,340
I'm a member ofthe
celibacy club, by the way.

646
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,070
Are you kidding?

647
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,030
Nope.

648
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,250
Zero, alpha one.

649
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,820
Jesus!

650
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,960
Yeah, go ahead, dad.

651
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,940
Zero, send. Over.

652
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,260
Status report. Over.

653
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,100
Zero.

654
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,850
All sectors all clear. Over.

655
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,710
Roger. Out.

656
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,060
You work for your dad?

657
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,310
Your dad's a dick, too, huh?

658
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,550
Come on.

659
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,140
You look beautiful.

660
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,420
Really?

661
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,510
Wait, wait.

662
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,890
My dad's become a buffer.

663
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,740
Nothing more to say.

664
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,130
I happen to know that your
dais anything but a buffer,

665
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,740
not withstandinghis mixed blood.

666
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,390
Don't be fooled.

667
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,940
Your da is a pioneer.

668
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,640
Right.

669
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,290
Are you saying I'm wrong?

670
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,370
Wayne malloy, like every
othergood man before him,

671
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,480
is fighting to do rightby his family,

672
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,290
and don't you everforget that.

673
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,420
He's following his
destiny, branching out,

674
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,110
an example to our people,
a king amongst travelers.

675
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,930
That's whatyou're not seeing yet.

676
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,160
But I see it.

677
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,460
Boy, do I see it.

678
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,270
Whatever you say.

679
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,480
Wayne malloy.

680
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,970
When was the last
timeyou called your ma?

681
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,190
She must be worried sick.

682
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,030
Wayne.

683
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,330
Oh, wayne.

684
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,110
Ma, it's me.

685
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,910
Oh, my god.

686
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,870
Cal!

687
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,760
I'm okay.

688
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,720
Baby!

689
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,720
No, it's okay.

690
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,940
Where are you?

691
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,300
I'm with friends.

692
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,550
With a friend.

693
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,570
Holy shit. Dale?

694
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,610
Where the hellhave you been?

695
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,330
Back with my people,
after 15 long years.

696
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,250
Who is this?

697
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,180
This is your old pal.

698
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,780
Long time, wayne.

699
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:37,780
Word has it you're really
beginning to go places, boyo.

700
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,750
Quinn.

701
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,430
I've been thinking.

702
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,300
You and I should think
seriouslyabout teaming up,

703
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,190
working together.

704
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,810
A man nearly diedthis morning, quinn.

705
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,030
People die all the time, wayne.

706
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:04,630
There is no way in hell that I
would ever do shitwith you, quinn.

707
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,980
Suit yourself, wayne,

708
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:12,480
but before you go making
anymore rash business decisions,

709
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,050
know one thing.

710
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,540
I have your son.
