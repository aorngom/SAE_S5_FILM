1
0:0:20,20 --> 0:0:22,938


2
0:0:34,779 --> 0:0:36,869
A crane collapsed
in downtown Trenton.

3
0:0:37,38 --> 0:0:38,88
Don't care.

4
0:0:43,210 --> 0:0:45,753
- That's my great-grandfather.
- No, it's a book he wrote.

5
0:0:47,514 --> 0:0:48,756
Open it up.

6
0:0:49,633 --> 0:0:52,134


7
0:0:53,203 --> 0:0:55,220
Seriously, you're giving this to us?

8
0:0:55,390 --> 0:0:58,489
It's a big step you're taking.
I wanted to congratulate you.

9
0:0:58,614 --> 0:1:0,517
I understand
that's the adult thing to do.

10
0:1:0,642 --> 0:1:1,992
How did you know?

11
0:1:2,117 --> 0:1:3,582
I've known for a while.

12
0:1:3,707 --> 0:1:5,643
The fact that you decided
to cohabitate

13
0:1:5,768 --> 0:1:7,518
is not exactly a spoiler.

14
0:1:8,207 --> 0:1:9,957
Unless my intel is wrong.

15
0:1:10,956 --> 0:1:12,554
Trouble in paradise?

16
0:1:12,897 --> 0:1:14,570
We have to get to Trenton.

17
0:2:30,859 --> 0:2:33,21
.:: La Fabrique ::.

18
0:2:33,146 --> 0:2:35,696
R[H]ésus AB+ Team

19
0:2:49,165 --> 0:2:50,465
Can you hear me?

20
0:2:52,89 --> 0:2:55,383
- That sound like a yes?
- Sir, we have to get you to the O.R.

21
0:2:55,551 --> 0:2:59,135
You have a bad wound,
we're gonna pack it and transport you.

22
0:3:1,182 --> 0:3:3,761
Skull fracture.
Glasgow coma score of 11.

23
0:3:3,929 --> 0:3:5,394
She's immediate.

24
0:3:6,115 --> 0:3:8,799
- Move on. This guy's dead.
- His wounds aren't so...

25
0:3:8,924 --> 0:3:10,921
Forget the wound.
Look at his toes.

26
0:3:11,46 --> 0:3:12,817
Atherosclerotic emboli.

27
0:3:13,153 --> 0:3:14,693
He'll never survive the surgery.

28
0:3:14,861 --> 0:3:16,946
- Maybe his shoes were too tight.
- It's not that.

29
0:3:17,114 --> 0:3:18,823
Skin shows smoker's facies.

30
0:3:18,991 --> 0:3:21,575
He's not gonna make it till morning.
He'll take up an ambulance ride,

31
0:3:21,743 --> 0:3:23,244
surgeon's time, and an ICU bed.

32
0:3:26,803 --> 0:3:28,653
He's expectant.
Leave him.

33
0:3:31,3 --> 0:3:33,920
I only nodded off for a second.
I lost control of the load.

34
0:3:34,89 --> 0:3:36,841
- I'm so sorry.
- We're gonna get you outta here.

35
0:3:37,10 --> 0:3:38,10
I'm sorry.

36
0:3:38,635 --> 0:3:41,7
- He's secure.
- Ready? Three, two, one.

37
0:3:43,52 --> 0:3:43,889
That's it.

38
0:3:45,487 --> 0:3:48,310
Crane operator.
Made it through amazingly well.

39
0:3:48,682 --> 0:3:51,355
Lucid and responsive.
Stable fracture, right humerus.

40
0:3:51,523 --> 0:3:53,774
Haven't gotten
to his lower half yet.

41
0:3:54,620 --> 0:3:58,237
- Tell me when something hurts.
- I fell asleep. Killed those people.

42
0:3:58,405 --> 0:4:0,489
Something other
than your conscience.

43
0:4:1,960 --> 0:4:4,742
Is that a pill in your pocket,
or are you just happy to have

44
0:4:5,73 --> 0:4:6,704
a tiny pill-shaped penis?

45
0:4:8,622 --> 0:4:9,790
Caffeine pills.

46
0:4:10,374 --> 0:4:13,669
- You fell asleep taking these?
- I drank two cups of coffee too.

47
0:4:13,965 --> 0:4:16,213
- Is that normal for you?
- No, I hate coffee.

48
0:4:16,381 --> 0:4:18,674
I'm working on no sleep.
My daughter has the flu.

49
0:4:18,843 --> 0:4:20,718
This much caffeine
for a coffee virgin.

50
0:4:21,656 --> 0:4:23,685
There's no way he fell asleep.
He passed out.

51
0:4:24,313 --> 0:4:27,600
Which means a neurological disorder
caused the crash, not fatigue.

52
0:4:30,879 --> 0:4:33,188
We're taking the crane operator
back to Princeton.

53
0:4:33,356 --> 0:4:35,65
He was barely hurt...
He can wait.

54
0:4:35,233 --> 0:4:37,818
Steal an ambulance. And call the team.
Tell 'em we got a case.

55
0:4:38,982 --> 0:4:40,946
No!
I need you here.

56
0:4:41,319 --> 0:4:43,742
And he needs me there.
And he moans louder than you do.

57
0:4:43,910 --> 0:4:47,202
There were over 100 people.
Only 76 have been accounted for.

58
0:4:47,371 --> 0:4:50,80
Foreman and your team
can handle the crane operator for now.

59
0:5:12,215 --> 0:5:14,396
- Having fun down there?
- <i>Lots!</i>

60
0:5:14,564 --> 0:5:17,14
Every time Cuddy
leans over a patient,

61
0:5:17,401 --> 0:5:20,631
it's another opportunity
for a down blouse nip slip.

62
0:5:21,327 --> 0:5:23,113
What's going on
between her and Lucas?

63
0:5:23,281 --> 0:5:25,741
Besides them moving in together?
That's not enough for you?

64
0:5:26,78 --> 0:5:28,678
I gave her
the housewarming gift earlier.

65
0:5:29,416 --> 0:5:31,412
And she paused for a split second,

66
0:5:31,582 --> 0:5:33,519
like she was hiding something.

67
0:5:33,644 --> 0:5:36,126
It's probably her moral revulsion
at housewarming gifts.

68
0:5:36,455 --> 0:5:39,797
Or she didn't want to accept a gift
for something she wasn't gonna do.

69
0:5:40,458 --> 0:5:42,981
<i>You actually think
they're not moving in together?</i>

70
0:5:44,270 --> 0:5:45,452
What was that?

71
0:5:45,845 --> 0:5:46,845
You okay?

72
0:5:47,651 --> 0:5:49,285
Vending machine collapsed.

73
0:5:50,396 --> 0:5:53,23
She still using
your ex-wife as a realtor?

74
0:5:53,148 --> 0:5:55,606
- <i>As far as I know.</i>
- <i>Know a little farther, will you?</i>

75
0:5:55,731 --> 0:5:56,881
<i>Look into it.</i>

76
0:6:33,136 --> 0:6:34,518
There's somebody down here!

77
0:6:39,472 --> 0:6:42,609
If you can hear me,
tap three times, or call out.

78
0:6:46,344 --> 0:6:47,644
Is anyone there?

79
0:6:50,448 --> 0:6:52,945
- I'm not getting anything.
- I heard something...

80
0:6:53,549 --> 0:6:56,540
- There's gotta be a void down there.
- It was the parking garage.

81
0:6:56,966 --> 0:6:59,626
Equipment hasn't picked up any movement.
Dogs haven't picked up any scent.

82
0:6:59,976 --> 0:7:2,805
There's smashed cars down there.
The gasoline throw off their scent?

83
0:7:2,973 --> 0:7:6,300
We gotta get back to work, okay?
We'll get to this area soon. Excuse me.

84
0:8:4,163 --> 0:8:5,463
Anybody hear me?

85
0:8:11,114 --> 0:8:12,414
Anybody hear me?

86
0:9:14,694 --> 0:9:15,694
Help me.

87
0:9:23,943 --> 0:9:24,938
What's your name?

88
0:9:30,259 --> 0:9:31,259
Please...

89
0:9:31,662 --> 0:9:32,946
my husband's gift.

90
0:9:33,312 --> 0:9:35,782
I was supposed to pick it up
at the framers.

91
0:9:36,322 --> 0:9:37,422
It's on Elm.

92
0:9:37,619 --> 0:9:40,573
You should have told me earlier.
I could have picked it up on the way.

93
0:9:40,698 --> 0:9:41,823
What's your name?

94
0:9:41,948 --> 0:9:44,348
It's a picture
from our Tortola trip.

95
0:9:44,573 --> 0:9:45,757
For his birthday.

96
0:9:45,925 --> 0:9:48,136
I'm not asking your name
because I wanna become friends.

97
0:9:48,304 --> 0:9:50,526
I'm trying to gauge
your mental state.

98
0:9:51,825 --> 0:9:52,825
Hanna.

99
0:9:54,17 --> 0:9:56,345
That's a start.
What day of the week is it?

100
0:9:56,640 --> 0:9:57,596
Tuesday.

101
0:9:57,892 --> 0:9:59,42
Better still.

102
0:10:0,578 --> 0:10:1,962
What happened?

103
0:10:2,330 --> 0:10:5,61
You know that giant
construction crane next door?

104
0:10:5,231 --> 0:10:6,939
It's kind of on top of you
right now.

105
0:10:9,359 --> 0:10:10,982
I'm gonna try to pull you out.

106
0:10:12,821 --> 0:10:13,576
My leg!

107
0:10:23,85 --> 0:10:26,166
- I'm gonna need to get help.
- No, stay! Someone else will come.

108
0:10:27,294 --> 0:10:28,669
No one knows I'm down here.

109
0:10:29,50 --> 0:10:30,914
Please!
Stay with me.

110
0:10:31,775 --> 0:10:33,297
Don't leave me in the dark.

111
0:10:33,584 --> 0:10:35,34
I'll be right back.

112
0:10:35,268 --> 0:10:36,970
Don't leave me in the dark!

113
0:10:37,339 --> 0:10:38,820
Please stay!

114
0:10:43,902 --> 0:10:46,478
He's still in the E.R.
We haven't start a differential.

115
0:10:46,646 --> 0:10:48,188
Perfect!
Let's start right now.

116
0:10:48,540 --> 0:10:49,648
Put me on speaker.

117
0:10:52,291 --> 0:10:53,568
What causes syncope?

118
0:10:53,840 --> 0:10:55,931
He's stable.
The two dozen other patients...

119
0:10:56,56 --> 0:10:58,982
Don't need to be diagnosed.
They just need to be bandaged.

120
0:10:59,107 --> 0:11:0,607
What causes syncope?

121
0:11:2,92 --> 0:11:4,913
- Vasovagal reaction...
- Meningioma. Sick sinus syndrome.

122
0:11:5,280 --> 0:11:7,552
<i>Or you're wrong,
and he just fell asleep.</i>

123
0:11:7,677 --> 0:11:10,419
How's he gonna sleep with 50 cups
of coffee going through his veins?

124
0:11:10,587 --> 0:11:14,227
- Were you never a medical resident?
- I hear ten, eleven, and twelve.

125
0:11:14,352 --> 0:11:16,133
- Where's Thirteen?
- She's not here.

126
0:11:16,301 --> 0:11:18,552
The answer is no.
I don't know where she is.

127
0:11:18,723 --> 0:11:20,387
The answer to my question
after that?

128
0:11:20,597 --> 0:11:23,299
<i>Space-occupying lesion
in his brain is most likely.</i>

129
0:11:23,475 --> 0:11:24,850
MRI will prove I'm right.

130
0:11:25,126 --> 0:11:27,352
Or it'll just prove
he suffered head trauma from the crash.

131
0:11:27,848 --> 0:11:31,243
Which we'd wanna find anyway.
Two birds with one scan. Do it.

132
0:11:32,770 --> 0:11:34,776
Having trouble finding a vein
for Hanna's IV.

133
0:11:35,101 --> 0:11:37,863
- She getting weaker? Paler?
- No. She's stable.

134
0:11:38,31 --> 0:11:39,765
That means
her blood loss in minimal.

135
0:11:39,890 --> 0:11:42,159
Buys us some time.
Get the IV into her tibia.

136
0:11:42,601 --> 0:11:45,454
It's almost hollow,
feeds into the venous system.

137
0:11:48,230 --> 0:11:50,709
Which they obviously don't teach you
in EMT school.

138
0:12:1,137 --> 0:12:3,731
This side's still leaning pretty bad.
Gotta shore up this beam.

139
0:12:6,393 --> 0:12:7,893
Told ya I'd be back.

140
0:12:9,225 --> 0:12:10,604
Heard you might be thirsty.

141
0:12:13,110 --> 0:12:15,241
I assume that bodes well
for the rescue?

142
0:12:15,409 --> 0:12:17,361
Structural beam.
High compression concrete.

143
0:12:17,486 --> 0:12:19,613
- I can't break it up.
- You can't get me outta here?

144
0:12:20,545 --> 0:12:23,112
Just means we gotta move on
to a different piece of equipment.

145
0:12:23,237 --> 0:12:25,304
I got airbags comin' in
that'll lift 70 tons.

146
0:12:28,21 --> 0:12:30,989
- What's your name?
- You testing my mental state?

147
0:12:31,114 --> 0:12:34,804
I'm gonna be stuck here for a while.
I'd like somebody to talk to.

148
0:12:35,129 --> 0:12:37,797
The guy who just left is the one
who's gonna be holding your hand.

149
0:12:37,922 --> 0:12:39,125
You talk to him.

150
0:12:39,760 --> 0:12:41,8
Little pinch.

151
0:12:46,491 --> 0:12:47,491
Big pinch.

152
0:12:49,773 --> 0:12:51,812
I gotta call my husband.
Can I use your phone?

153
0:12:52,410 --> 0:12:53,903
No bars down here.

154
0:12:55,633 --> 0:12:56,608
<i>L'chaim.</i>

155
0:12:57,458 --> 0:12:59,56
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry.

156
0:12:59,238 --> 0:13:1,538
Fire marshal Bill will be back soon.

157
0:13:12,370 --> 0:13:14,918
So I hope I didn't weird you out
giving you that gift.

158
0:13:15,238 --> 0:13:18,46
- Can we talk about this later?
- Of course.

159
0:13:19,106 --> 0:13:20,133
Is now later?

160
0:13:21,552 --> 0:13:23,590
Maybe things aren't going
so well with Lucas.

161
0:13:23,715 --> 0:13:26,12
If so, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to step into anything.

162
0:13:26,582 --> 0:13:29,158
There's no problems.
We're doing just great.

163
0:13:30,128 --> 0:13:31,309
So why the weirdness?

164
0:13:33,480 --> 0:13:34,630
Can you help?

165
0:13:38,382 --> 0:13:39,443
When I opened it,

166
0:13:40,425 --> 0:13:42,696
I didn't think
it was a housewarming gift.

167
0:13:42,864 --> 0:13:45,364
I thought
it was an engagement present.

168
0:13:50,808 --> 0:13:52,289
It just happened last night.

169
0:13:55,771 --> 0:13:57,830
No wonder you wanna hide this
from me...

170
0:13:58,445 --> 0:14:0,385
Since I'm such a delicate flower.

171
0:14:0,510 --> 0:14:3,383
I didn't know what to say.
And I've been slightly distracted.

172
0:14:3,712 --> 0:14:6,94
That might make sense,
'cept you're not wearing the ring.

173
0:14:7,509 --> 0:14:10,57
You are hiding it,
which begs the question...

174
0:14:11,451 --> 0:14:14,936
It's in my office drawer
because I knew I was coming here.

175
0:14:15,449 --> 0:14:16,563
It's not weird.

176
0:14:16,918 --> 0:14:18,368
There's no mystery.

177
0:14:19,449 --> 0:14:21,199
I'm just getting married.

178
0:14:23,309 --> 0:14:24,309
'Scuse me.

179
0:14:27,622 --> 0:14:29,659
- <i>How much longer?</i>
- Less than a minute.

180
0:14:30,350 --> 0:14:31,578
Are you in pain?

181
0:14:31,746 --> 0:14:34,498
<i>Nothing now.
Just a little claustrophobic.</i>

182
0:14:35,318 --> 0:14:38,376
Shouldn't you be taking care
of those people that I hurt?

183
0:14:42,923 --> 0:14:44,773
Everything checks out okay.

184
0:14:51,291 --> 0:14:52,791
My nose is bleeding.

185
0:14:52,916 --> 0:14:55,916
It's expected,
given the trauma you've sustained.

186
0:14:56,411 --> 0:14:57,911
That's not expected.

187
0:15:7,281 --> 0:15:10,546
The way things fell, this beam is now
holding up a giant pile of rubble.

188
0:15:10,671 --> 0:15:13,808
We can't lift it
without jeopardizing everyone down here.

189
0:15:13,933 --> 0:15:16,183
So it's time to discuss amputation.

190
0:15:25,161 --> 0:15:26,446
Please listen to me.

191
0:15:26,571 --> 0:15:28,468
We've been down here
almost two hours.

192
0:15:29,156 --> 0:15:30,939
By the time
they clear away the rubble...

193
0:15:31,64 --> 0:15:32,973
We are not cutting off her leg.

194
0:15:34,35 --> 0:15:36,476
You don't have to rush through this
to make his job easier.

195
0:15:37,796 --> 0:15:38,796
You kidding me?

196
0:15:38,921 --> 0:15:41,147
We leave the leg pinned,
we're risking crush syndrome.

197
0:15:41,558 --> 0:15:42,588
What's that?

198
0:15:42,713 --> 0:15:44,901
Your leg isn't getting
enough circulation.

199
0:15:45,26 --> 0:15:47,115
The longer it's pinned
the more the muscle dies.

200
0:15:47,240 --> 0:15:48,340
Like a limp?

201
0:15:48,980 --> 0:15:50,865
Dying muscles release poisons.

202
0:15:51,33 --> 0:15:54,286
We free your leg, they go back
into your system, could stop your heart.

203
0:15:54,573 --> 0:15:56,223
So could cheeseburgers.

204
0:15:57,206 --> 0:15:59,583
Let's get your lazy friends
to start moving that pile.

205
0:15:59,751 --> 0:16:0,882
She's got two hours

206
0:16:1,7 --> 0:16:2,961
before crush syndrome
could possibly set in.

207
0:16:3,544 --> 0:16:4,713
We're digging by hand.

208
0:16:4,881 --> 0:16:7,633
I can't get 10 tons of debris
pulled off in two hours.

209
0:16:7,758 --> 0:16:8,758
Try.

210
0:16:10,347 --> 0:16:11,447
It's my leg.

211
0:16:11,846 --> 0:16:13,847
It's not just that
you gotta worry about.

212
0:16:14,213 --> 0:16:15,593
There's gas leaks, fire,

213
0:16:15,718 --> 0:16:18,656
or secondary collapses, no matter
how much we shore this thing up.

214
0:16:18,781 --> 0:16:22,36
Chopping off someone's limb
inside a pile of dirty rocks is safe?

215
0:16:22,161 --> 0:16:23,898
Sepsis, fat embolism, a hemorrhage.

216
0:16:24,66 --> 0:16:27,861
Those are nothing compared to the risk
of this thing coming down again.

217
0:16:28,543 --> 0:16:30,989
He's a jerk.
But it's what the patient wants.

218
0:16:31,557 --> 0:16:33,742
Can we please
give it a couple more hours?

219
0:16:40,917 --> 0:16:42,334
I gotta get up to triage.

220
0:16:46,431 --> 0:16:48,563
Thank you, doctor.

221
0:16:52,484 --> 0:16:54,334
You don't need to thank me.

222
0:16:54,657 --> 0:16:56,7
Just makes sense.

223
0:16:56,680 --> 0:16:58,975
Just promise me
you won't let them cut off my leg.

224
0:17:0,144 --> 0:17:1,144
I promise.

225
0:17:2,4 --> 0:17:5,316
- Does that make you feel better?
- For some reason, it does.

226
0:17:8,850 --> 0:17:10,570
Your phone is working down here.

227
0:17:10,738 --> 0:17:14,74
Switched carriers.
Better rollover minutes. Talk.

228
0:17:14,242 --> 0:17:15,433
MRI was clean,

229
0:17:15,558 --> 0:17:17,786
but afterwards,
he bled out of his eyes and nose.

230
0:17:17,954 --> 0:17:19,996
There was something wrong
before the collapse.

231
0:17:20,164 --> 0:17:22,791
Unless it's just conjunctive
coagulopathy from the trauma.

232
0:17:22,959 --> 0:17:24,876
You don't think he was sick before.
We get it!

233
0:17:25,378 --> 0:17:26,378
<i>You're wrong.</i>

234
0:17:26,797 --> 0:17:27,945
Brain infection?

235
0:17:28,70 --> 0:17:29,297
Sorry I'm late.

236
0:17:30,25 --> 0:17:31,716
- Where were you?
- <i>Physical therapy.</i>

237
0:17:31,884 --> 0:17:33,291
Left my phone in my locker.

238
0:17:33,416 --> 0:17:37,420
Infection causes neurological symptoms,
goes systemic, and DIC causes the bleed.

239
0:17:37,574 --> 0:17:39,974
Good theory.
Except there's no fever.

240
0:17:40,371 --> 0:17:41,768
<i>Get an X-ray venogram.</i>

241
0:17:41,936 --> 0:17:44,60
See if you can find a reason
for your existence.

242
0:17:44,185 --> 0:17:45,939
<i>Also look
for venous sinus thrombosis.</i>

243
0:17:46,107 --> 0:17:47,482
Would've shown on the MRI.

244
0:17:47,650 --> 0:17:49,889
Not if you were too busy
not looking for it.

245
0:17:50,14 --> 0:17:53,321
We should X-ray for a facial fracture.
This could all be simple trauma.

246
0:17:53,489 --> 0:17:54,781
Just do what I tell you.

247
0:17:55,685 --> 0:17:56,950
<i>Be back in ten minutes.</i>

248
0:17:58,319 --> 0:17:59,494
You're leaving?

249
0:17:59,662 --> 0:18:1,569
There's a dozen people here
who can save you.

250
0:18:1,694 --> 0:18:3,999
I'm the only one
who can save this other guy.

251
0:18:5,553 --> 0:18:6,553
Wait!

252
0:18:7,111 --> 0:18:8,111
Don't go.

253
0:18:17,499 --> 0:18:19,49
Hanna's freaking out.

254
0:18:19,684 --> 0:18:21,638
She's having a panic attack,
she can't breathe.

255
0:18:21,763 --> 0:18:24,18
- She's gonna rip out her IVs.
- So calm her down.

256
0:18:24,186 --> 0:18:25,386
She wants you.

257
0:18:26,461 --> 0:18:28,511
I'm flattered. Give her oxygen.

258
0:18:28,769 --> 0:18:30,650
They won't let O2 down there.

259
0:18:30,818 --> 0:18:32,218
Fear of explosion.

260
0:18:32,862 --> 0:18:34,362
You have to go back.

261
0:18:34,780 --> 0:18:36,330
She needs you, House.

262
0:18:53,62 --> 0:18:55,662
You only came back
because I freaked out.

263
0:18:56,3 --> 0:18:57,3
Right?

264
0:18:58,132 --> 0:18:59,846
I just realized how...

265
0:19:0,291 --> 0:19:2,91
big and scary the world is

266
0:19:2,855 --> 0:19:5,555
and how cozy and safe
this little place is.

267
0:19:7,63 --> 0:19:8,63
Thank you.

268
0:19:8,955 --> 0:19:10,565
I'm sorry I needed you.

269
0:19:17,883 --> 0:19:19,583
Here. Call your husband.

270
0:19:31,587 --> 0:19:32,587
Charlie?

271
0:19:33,959 --> 0:19:35,159
I'm here in...

272
0:19:36,255 --> 0:19:37,555
They called you?

273
0:19:40,319 --> 0:19:41,596
They're helping me.

274
0:19:42,574 --> 0:19:43,824
Are you coming?

275
0:19:46,292 --> 0:19:48,542
I don't know how this could happen.

276
0:19:49,395 --> 0:19:51,545
It's your birthday, I'm so sorry.

277
0:19:51,670 --> 0:19:53,858
See?
This is why I lied about the phone.

278
0:19:54,26 --> 0:19:55,333
Your BP is spiking,

279
0:19:55,458 --> 0:19:57,219
so you're bleeding faster
from your leg.

280
0:19:57,344 --> 0:19:59,402
I'm gonna have less time to save it.
Hang up.

281
0:20:0,517 --> 0:20:2,617
They're telling me I have to go.

282
0:20:8,317 --> 0:20:9,582
That was stupid of me.

283
0:20:10,935 --> 0:20:12,210
It was nice.

284
0:20:13,285 --> 0:20:15,585
I don't see that as a contradiction.

285
0:20:16,927 --> 0:20:18,727
He was already on his way.

286
0:20:19,401 --> 0:20:22,601
He was in Baltimore,
and they all saw it on the news.

287
0:20:23,679 --> 0:20:25,479
How many people were hurt?

288
0:20:27,76 --> 0:20:29,926
What did I tell you about
not raising your BP?

289
0:20:33,87 --> 0:20:35,487
Can I ask
what's wrong with your leg?

290
0:20:36,176 --> 0:20:37,694
Crane fell on it.

291
0:20:38,696 --> 0:20:39,737
Small world.

292
0:20:40,679 --> 0:20:42,448
You could have just said no.

293
0:20:43,289 --> 0:20:45,285
I'll remember that
for my next human contact.

294
0:20:49,457 --> 0:20:51,107
Would you pray with me?

295
0:20:54,73 --> 0:20:55,753
I'm not in the habit of encouraging

296
0:20:55,921 --> 0:20:57,771
my patients' superstitions.

297
0:20:58,424 --> 0:20:59,924
How is that a habit?

298
0:21:0,427 --> 0:21:3,527
You plan on getting trapped
under a building again?

299
0:21:4,505 --> 0:21:6,155
I don't believe in God.

300
0:21:7,787 --> 0:21:9,37
I don't either.

301
0:21:11,344 --> 0:21:12,344
Please?

302
0:21:28,339 --> 0:21:29,621
I always thought...

303
0:21:31,186 --> 0:21:32,624
if I did the right thing,

304
0:21:32,892 --> 0:21:34,692
if I treated people right,

305
0:21:35,363 --> 0:21:37,663
then good things would happen to me.

306
0:21:39,440 --> 0:21:41,7
You think that's how it works?

307
0:21:43,357 --> 0:21:44,657
I didn't use to.

308
0:21:46,780 --> 0:21:48,480
Then recently I tried...

309
0:21:51,975 --> 0:21:53,325
Now I don't know.

310
0:22:0,107 --> 0:22:1,107
Good news.

311
0:22:4,526 --> 0:22:7,526
Advancing catheter
through interior jugular vein.

312
0:22:8,794 --> 0:22:10,620
You told House you were at therapy.

313
0:22:10,788 --> 0:22:13,238
Did you transcribe
the entire meeting?

314
0:22:13,860 --> 0:22:15,810
Entering the cavernous sinus.

315
0:22:16,353 --> 0:22:18,23
Your therapy's on Thursdays.

316
0:22:18,285 --> 0:22:19,379
Got rescheduled.

317
0:22:19,657 --> 0:22:20,857
Injecting dye.

318
0:22:21,215 --> 0:22:22,215
Really?

319
0:22:24,553 --> 0:22:27,153
I'm not gonna rat you out.
We're friends.

320
0:22:27,519 --> 0:22:29,323
Just wanna make sure you're okay.

321
0:22:31,892 --> 0:22:33,342
No filling defects.

322
0:22:36,639 --> 0:22:37,739
Don't worry.

323
0:22:38,357 --> 0:22:39,357
I'm okay.

324
0:22:44,995 --> 0:22:47,782
You think we can be friends
when I get outta here?

325
0:22:50,7 --> 0:22:53,508
We'll catch a ball game or...
rroup sex show or something.

326
0:22:53,633 --> 0:22:55,132
Put the cribbing in there.

327
0:22:57,926 --> 0:22:59,876
When the beam starts lifting,

328
0:23:0,468 --> 0:23:1,754
you're gonna feel pain.

329
0:23:1,922 --> 0:23:3,506
Like your foot's gone to sleep

330
0:23:3,674 --> 0:23:4,757
times a billion.

331
0:23:5,148 --> 0:23:7,677
You'll notice that I'm waiting till now
to tell you.

332
0:23:7,997 --> 0:23:9,647
All right. We're ready.

333
0:23:12,214 --> 0:23:13,433
Lifting.

334
0:23:15,394 --> 0:23:17,311
I'm feeling the pain already.

335
0:23:17,593 --> 0:23:19,731
That's good.
Means the pressure's coming off.

336
0:23:20,859 --> 0:23:23,109
Much closer to getting out of here.

337
0:23:26,100 --> 0:23:27,100
Come on.

338
0:23:27,329 --> 0:23:28,479
Pull her out.

339
0:23:30,226 --> 0:23:31,451
Come on!

340
0:23:32,383 --> 0:23:33,453
It's moving!

341
0:23:35,376 --> 0:23:36,726
Pull hard! Pull!

342
0:24:14,204 --> 0:24:15,244
What happened?

343
0:24:15,412 --> 0:24:17,830
I think the adjacent beam
snapped during the lift.

344
0:24:19,288 --> 0:24:20,750
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

345
0:24:21,734 --> 0:24:23,260
We had a secondary collapse.

346
0:24:23,385 --> 0:24:24,879
We're all right. How are you?

347
0:24:25,329 --> 0:24:27,229
<i>Rescue one, copy the mayday.</i>

348
0:24:27,354 --> 0:24:29,457
<i>Main tunnel is fine.
Rescue's on the way.</i>

349
0:24:29,582 --> 0:24:30,732
Lift this up.

350
0:24:31,895 --> 0:24:32,945
One, two...

351
0:24:43,861 --> 0:24:45,311
Kit! Gimme the Kit.

352
0:24:47,856 --> 0:24:49,570
No breath sounds on the left side.

353
0:24:49,738 --> 0:24:51,114
Tension pneumothorax.

354
0:24:53,148 --> 0:24:54,617
One of your lungs is collapsed.

355
0:24:54,785 --> 0:24:56,536
I'm gonna have to reinflate it,
okay?

356
0:25:11,796 --> 0:25:14,575
You better get back up top
and make sure you didn't nick an artery.

357
0:25:22,800 --> 0:25:24,350
I'm gonna have to go.

358
0:25:28,444 --> 0:25:30,444
That's okay. You're all right.

359
0:25:32,930 --> 0:25:34,930
You're lucky this isn't worse.

360
0:25:35,801 --> 0:25:37,701
You know who's even luckier?

361
0:25:38,494 --> 0:25:42,44
You and about every other human being
who wasn't down there.

362
0:25:43,241 --> 0:25:45,376
- What did the venogram say?
- <i>Clean.</i>

363
0:25:45,544 --> 0:25:47,211
The guy's starting to spike a fever.

364
0:25:47,379 --> 0:25:48,827
Subarachnoid bleed.

365
0:25:49,423 --> 0:25:51,465
- Meningitis?
- He didn't say his neck was sore.

366
0:25:51,633 --> 0:25:53,333
Cause everything's sore.

367
0:25:53,458 --> 0:25:56,137
He just took a 15-story swan dive
into concrete, do an LP

368
0:25:56,575 --> 0:25:58,264
We have to consider
other infections.

369
0:25:58,432 --> 0:26:1,184
- So you're suggesting we do an LP?
- I guess I am.

370
0:26:1,560 --> 0:26:2,560
Genius.

371
0:26:3,105 --> 0:26:4,105
Bad news.

372
0:26:4,646 --> 0:26:6,890
Because of the collapse,
we can't try the airbag

373
0:26:7,15 --> 0:26:8,407
until everything's off the top.

374
0:26:8,532 --> 0:26:10,432
Be five, six hours at least.

375
0:26:10,819 --> 0:26:11,986
We have to amputate.

376
0:26:12,866 --> 0:26:14,816
It's been four hours already.

377
0:26:15,74 --> 0:26:17,575
It used to be a long shot.
Now it's crazy.

378
0:26:17,743 --> 0:26:20,244
Crush syndrome is basically
a buildup of potassium.

379
0:26:20,412 --> 0:26:22,985
- Remove potassium...
- We're using sodium bicarbonate.

380
0:26:23,110 --> 0:26:24,913
But not with glucose and Insulin.

381
0:26:25,38 --> 0:26:27,736
We have glucose in the Kit.
There's gotta be a diabetic somewhere.

382
0:26:27,861 --> 0:26:29,620
You wanna dose the Insulin here?

383
0:26:29,745 --> 0:26:31,881
In a non-hospital setting?
That is insane!

384
0:26:32,473 --> 0:26:34,425
- It's not worth it.
- Really?

385
0:26:35,302 --> 0:26:37,678
I'm the only one here
who knows what a leg is worth.

386
0:26:37,846 --> 0:26:40,348
Fortunately, you're not in charge.
He is.

387
0:26:40,516 --> 0:26:43,869
He knows that I'd testify against him
if Hanna sues for cutting off a leg

388
0:26:43,994 --> 0:26:45,811
without exhausting every option.

389
0:26:45,979 --> 0:26:47,438
Give us a minute?

390
0:26:51,777 --> 0:26:52,985
I know you're angry,

391
0:26:53,153 --> 0:26:56,489
but please don't put her life at risk
just to get back at me.

392
0:26:57,534 --> 0:26:58,534
Really?

393
0:27:0,173 --> 0:27:1,619
So this is all about you now.

394
0:27:1,900 --> 0:27:4,111
You took her side against me

395
0:27:4,631 --> 0:27:6,526
right after you heard
about my engagement.

396
0:27:6,651 --> 0:27:9,562
That must be it. It's not that you're
a pathetic narcissist.

397
0:27:9,687 --> 0:27:11,37
I don't love you.

398
0:27:11,787 --> 0:27:14,48
So just... accept it

399
0:27:14,216 --> 0:27:17,157
and move on with your life
instead of making everyone miserable.

400
0:27:17,282 --> 0:27:18,386
That's great.

401
0:27:18,554 --> 0:27:22,14
A life lesson from a middle-aged
single mom who's dating a man-child.

402
0:27:22,826 --> 0:27:23,826
Screw you.

403
0:27:24,662 --> 0:27:26,560
I'm sick of making excuses for you.

404
0:27:27,88 --> 0:27:29,939
I'm sick of other people
having to tiptoe around you

405
0:27:30,107 --> 0:27:33,907
and make their own lives worse while
they try to keep you from collapsing.

406
0:27:35,812 --> 0:27:36,862
I'm done.

407
0:27:38,439 --> 0:27:39,323
Fantastic.

408
0:27:39,491 --> 0:27:41,366
Just stay away from my patient.

409
0:27:43,280 --> 0:27:45,189
What are you clinging to, House?

410
0:27:46,319 --> 0:27:48,597
You're gonna risk her life
just to save her leg?

411
0:27:48,722 --> 0:27:50,612
Really worked out well for you,
didn't it?

412
0:27:51,605 --> 0:27:54,297
What do you have in your life,
honestly? Tell me.

413
0:27:54,595 --> 0:27:55,795
I'm moving on.

414
0:27:56,245 --> 0:27:57,497
Wilson is moving on.

415
0:27:57,622 --> 0:28:0,11
And you...
You've got nothing, House.

416
0:28:0,179 --> 0:28:1,179
Nothing.

417
0:28:2,633 --> 0:28:3,951
I'm going down there,

418
0:28:4,76 --> 0:28:7,184
and I'm gonna convince her
to let me cut her leg off.

419
0:28:7,985 --> 0:28:10,479
If you have any decency left,
you'll just stay out of it.

420
0:28:21,319 --> 0:28:23,200
Dr. House promised.

421
0:28:23,499 --> 0:28:24,952
If there was any other way...

422
0:28:25,728 --> 0:28:28,331
It doesn't hurt right now.
I can wait.

423
0:28:32,107 --> 0:28:33,127
Dr. House.

424
0:28:33,967 --> 0:28:34,967
Tell her.

425
0:28:43,593 --> 0:28:45,389
We have to amputate your leg.

426
0:28:47,351 --> 0:28:49,727
You said... that there was time.

427
0:28:49,895 --> 0:28:52,146
There was.
And it's run out.

428
0:28:56,304 --> 0:28:57,404
You asked me

429
0:28:58,490 --> 0:28:59,990
how I'd hurt my leg.

430
0:29:0,873 --> 0:29:2,323
I had a blood clot,

431
0:29:2,818 --> 0:29:4,568
and the muscle was dying.

432
0:29:5,609 --> 0:29:7,798
And I had all these doctors
telling me I should amputate,

433
0:29:7,923 --> 0:29:9,948
and I said no, and they did this...

434
0:29:10,332 --> 0:29:11,749
very risky operation.

435
0:29:12,791 --> 0:29:13,991
I almost died.

436
0:29:14,435 --> 0:29:15,711
But you saved your leg.

437
0:29:18,263 --> 0:29:19,563
I wish I hadn't.

438
0:29:21,567 --> 0:29:24,12
They cut out a chunk of muscle
about the size of my fist,

439
0:29:24,137 --> 0:29:26,631
and they left me
with this mutilated,

440
0:29:26,957 --> 0:29:28,157
useless thing.

441
0:29:29,610 --> 0:29:30,810
I'm in pain...

442
0:29:31,842 --> 0:29:32,842
every day.

443
0:29:34,398 --> 0:29:35,598
It changed me.

444
0:29:37,703 --> 0:29:39,403
Made me a harder person,

445
0:29:40,664 --> 0:29:41,862
a worse person.

446
0:29:43,579 --> 0:29:44,579
And now...

447
0:29:45,578 --> 0:29:46,778
Now I'm alone.

448
0:29:54,216 --> 0:29:56,27
You don't want to be like me.

449
0:29:59,64 --> 0:30:0,808
You got a husband who loves you.

450
0:30:0,933 --> 0:30:3,186
You have friends.
You can start a family.

451
0:30:4,194 --> 0:30:5,528
You have a life.

452
0:30:8,900 --> 0:30:9,968
And this...

453
0:30:10,472 --> 0:30:11,922
This is just a leg.

454
0:30:50,984 --> 0:30:52,442
I can't put you out.

455
0:30:52,567 --> 0:30:54,768
It could depress
your respiration too much.

456
0:30:54,936 --> 0:30:56,761
This should take away
some of the pain.

457
0:31:3,524 --> 0:31:5,196
Will it be quick?

458
0:31:7,603 --> 0:31:10,547
I'll use a scalpel
to slice through the skin,

459
0:31:11,73 --> 0:31:12,373
muscle, and fat.

460
0:31:13,33 --> 0:31:14,883
That should go pretty fast.

461
0:31:15,374 --> 0:31:17,917
Then I'll switch over to the electric
saw when I get to the bone.

462
0:31:18,85 --> 0:31:21,51
It's two bones...
About as thick as a broomstick.

463
0:31:21,176 --> 0:31:23,11
Takes about as long to get through.

464
0:31:23,871 --> 0:31:26,783
I'm gonna cut as close
to the concrete as I can,

465
0:31:27,73 --> 0:31:29,220
save as much of your limb
as possible.

466
0:31:29,622 --> 0:31:31,579
Then the orthopedic surgeons
back at the hospital

467
0:31:31,704 --> 0:31:34,99
will clean you up,
have you fitted for a prosthetic.

468
0:31:35,183 --> 0:31:37,394
You'll be running circles
around me in no time.

469
0:31:44,21 --> 0:31:45,571
How bad will it hurt?

470
0:31:47,854 --> 0:31:50,16
Like nothing
you've ever felt before.

471
0:33:44,539 --> 0:33:45,420
Baby.

472
0:33:45,882 --> 0:33:49,170
- I'm so sorry.
- Shut up. You always loved my legs.

473
0:33:49,680 --> 0:33:51,383
I don't care about your legs.

474
0:33:51,717 --> 0:33:53,572
Baby, I love you. I love you.

475
0:34:35,157 --> 0:34:35,948
What?

476
0:34:36,116 --> 0:34:38,517
He's fallen into a coma.
LP was clean, but...

477
0:34:38,642 --> 0:34:41,239
- <i>What are his vitals?</i>
- Excuse me, officer.

478
0:34:42,80 --> 0:34:44,707
What do you mean, officer?
How long has there been a cop there?

479
0:34:45,365 --> 0:34:47,418
Mayben ten minutes.
He was being questioned

480
0:34:47,586 --> 0:34:50,254
- <i>when he fell into the coma.</i>
- Was anything else making him nervous

481
0:34:50,422 --> 0:34:52,423
<i>or worried
before his other symptoms?</i>

482
0:34:52,591 --> 0:34:55,509
He was claustrophobic right before
the bleed and before the fever.

483
0:34:55,773 --> 0:34:57,759
We told him that he probably
did fall asleep.

484
0:34:57,884 --> 0:34:59,96
<i>Was his BP spiking?</i>

485
0:34:59,853 --> 0:35:1,682
But that didn't cause
his first symptom.

486
0:35:2,263 --> 0:35:4,633
Yeah, it did.
All the caffeine.

487
0:35:4,758 --> 0:35:7,699
We thought the problem was in his toilet
by that, of course, I mean his head.

488
0:35:8,211 --> 0:35:11,608
<i>Which distracted us. It could've been
a clog in his sewer pipe,</i>

489
0:35:11,776 --> 0:35:14,278
<i>and by that, of course,
I mean his spinal cord.</i>

490
0:35:14,446 --> 0:35:16,405
And blah, blah, blah.
You get the idea.

491
0:35:16,573 --> 0:35:19,408
An arachnoid cyst on his lower spine.
That's why we missed it.

492
0:35:19,576 --> 0:35:22,384
He's been sitting ten hours a day.
Spiked his spinal fluid pressure.

493
0:35:22,746 --> 0:35:23,764
Run a CT.

494
0:35:26,124 --> 0:35:27,816
BP's 72 over 42.

495
0:35:29,377 --> 0:35:30,586
I can't breathe.

496
0:35:34,526 --> 0:35:37,906
Breath sounds bilaterally.
It's not another pneumothorax.

497
0:35:38,724 --> 0:35:41,174
Neck veins flat.
There's no tamponade.

498
0:35:43,596 --> 0:35:45,58
Damn it.
I waited too long.

499
0:35:46,102 --> 0:35:48,479
You've got a clot in your lung.
I'm gonna fix this.

500
0:35:48,647 --> 0:35:50,189
IV streptokinase.

501
0:35:50,357 --> 0:35:52,260
What's happening.
What's going on?

502
0:35:52,385 --> 0:35:55,360
Her body won't get any oxygen
unless we can bust the clot.

503
0:35:55,584 --> 0:35:57,284
This is a blood thinner.

504
0:36:0,630 --> 0:36:1,955
Is she gonna be OK?

505
0:36:2,80 --> 0:36:4,369
It's gonna make her bleed more.
We'll take care of that next.

506
0:36:10,373 --> 0:36:11,877
It's not busting the clot.

507
0:36:13,90 --> 0:36:14,505
Maybe it's her heart.

508
0:36:31,140 --> 0:36:31,960
What?

509
0:36:32,399 --> 0:36:33,699
It's not a clot.

510
0:36:35,402 --> 0:36:36,902
It's a fat embolism.

511
0:36:37,904 --> 0:36:39,571
From the amputation.

512
0:36:44,236 --> 0:36:45,986
Okay. So, what can we do?

513
0:36:48,899 --> 0:36:49,748
Come on.

514
0:36:51,550 --> 0:36:54,280
Do something.
Please, please, do something.

515
0:36:54,405 --> 0:36:56,372
<i>Come on, guys, do something.
Come on.</i>

516
0:36:56,497 --> 0:36:58,203
Please, come on, do something!

517
0:36:58,967 --> 0:37:0,567
Come on, do something!

518
0:37:31,24 --> 0:37:33,416
There's no way to prevent
a fat embolism.

519
0:37:34,521 --> 0:37:36,602
Even if you'd done this in an O.R.,

520
0:37:37,539 --> 0:37:38,966
couldn't have saved her.

521
0:37:52,394 --> 0:37:54,894
You can't blame yourself
for her death.

522
0:37:55,356 --> 0:37:56,724
This wasn't your fault.

523
0:37:56,849 --> 0:37:58,199
That's the point!

524
0:37:58,735 --> 0:38:1,69
I did everything right.
She died anyway.

525
0:38:1,645 --> 0:38:4,482
Why the hell do you think
that would make me feel any better?

526
0:38:14,453 --> 0:38:15,918
You shouldn't be alone right now.

527
0:38:19,333 --> 0:38:20,633
You're bleeding.

528
0:38:21,134 --> 0:38:23,734
I'm gonna give you a task
as an employee.

529
0:38:25,198 --> 0:38:26,598
Get out of my way.

530
0:38:52,518 --> 0:38:53,664
What's that?

531
0:38:56,548 --> 0:38:58,725
I'm asking for some time off.

532
0:39:1,262 --> 0:39:2,430
What's wrong?

533
0:39:8,261 --> 0:39:9,411
Are you okay?

534
0:39:11,942 --> 0:39:13,142
Obviously not.

535
0:41:12,248 --> 0:41:15,792
You're going to leap across the room
and grab them out of my hand?

536
0:41:21,252 --> 0:41:23,855
It's your choice
if you want to go back on drugs.

537
0:41:28,572 --> 0:41:31,384
Just so you know, I'm finding it hard
to see the downside.

538
0:41:33,276 --> 0:41:35,676
You need to re-bandage
your shoulder.

539
0:41:39,222 --> 0:41:41,915
Is that why you're here?
Foreman sent you?

540
0:41:44,168 --> 0:41:45,820
You're here to yell at me again?

541
0:41:49,21 --> 0:41:51,121
Well, I'm running out of ideas.

542
0:41:54,68 --> 0:41:55,137
Great.

543
0:41:55,436 --> 0:41:57,539
You're feeling uncomfortable again?

544
0:41:58,237 --> 0:42:1,350
Probably means you just got back
from some quickie wedding in Vegas

545
0:42:1,475 --> 0:42:2,644
or you're pregnant.

546
0:42:2,813 --> 0:42:4,9
I ended it.

547
0:42:7,187 --> 0:42:8,87
What?

548
0:42:8,212 --> 0:42:9,562
I'm stuck, House.

549
0:42:12,851 --> 0:42:14,934
I keep wanting to move forward.

550
0:42:15,59 --> 0:42:17,367
I keep wanting to move on,
and I can't.

551
0:42:17,868 --> 0:42:19,963
I mean, my new house,
with my new fiancé,

552
0:42:20,88 --> 0:42:22,455
and all I can think about is you.

553
0:42:24,739 --> 0:42:28,477
I just need to know
if you and I can work.

554
0:42:33,429 --> 0:42:35,329
You think I can fix myself?

555
0:42:36,224 --> 0:42:37,320
I don't know.

556
0:42:41,978 --> 0:42:44,607
'Cause I'm the most screwed-up
person in the world.

557
0:42:44,941 --> 0:42:45,883
I know.

558
0:42:48,746 --> 0:42:49,796
I love you.

559
0:42:54,456 --> 0:42:55,756
I wish I didn't.

560
0:42:57,435 --> 0:42:58,871
But I can't help it.

561
0:43:35,437 --> 0:43:37,523
How do I know I'm not hallucinating?

562
0:43:39,826 --> 0:43:41,409
Did you take the Vicodin?

563
0:43:47,696 --> 0:43:49,396
Then I think we're okay.
