1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Michael, don't you think
We should go over the current case file?

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,500
Do I look like a dork in this suit?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,200
Yes, michael, you do. but please pay attention.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,200
Megan connelly, 28,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Phd in advanced biochemistry.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Cute.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,200
She works with dr. lawrence matheson
On the human potentiality project.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,000
What is it?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A government funded effort to enhance physical capabilities
Through an experimental hyper-catalyst.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,600
Whatever happened to vitamins?

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,900
I haven't seen you take many vitamins, michael.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,200
Unless you count beer as a vitamin.

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,600
Hey, there are plenty of vitamins in beer.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,000
If you drink enough.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,500
We'll have to discuss your misunderstanding
Of nutrition later, michael.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,900
You have an incoming call from sarah.

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,300
Mike, have you had a chance to review the case file?

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,800
Kitt and I were just going over it.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,500
And by "just," he means "just about to."

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,000
Gee, sarah,

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Thanks for installing the backstabbing program.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
It's really working out.

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,700
Mike, don't take this case lightly.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,300
Hxp enhances the speed, strength, and aggression
Of anyone who takes it,

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,900
Turning them into a living weapon.

26
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,600
Hate to see that get out on the streets.

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,200
If this stuff ends up in the wrong hands,

28
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,400
There's no limit to the damage it could cause.

29
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,700
I'm on it.

30
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,300
We are approaching megan connelly's car.

31
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,400
Engage the emp.

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,900
ENGAGING EMP.

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,800
EMP EDPLOYED.

34
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,200
GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
Need some help?

36
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,400
It just died, I don't know what happened.

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,900
And my phone's totally dead, so I can't call a tow truck.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Mine too.

39
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm just going up the road to balham labs.

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,700
Want me to call you a tow truck from there?

41
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,900
That's where I work. I've never seen you.

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,500
I'm from trydell insurance.

43
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,700
We're looking into a theft at one of the labs.

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,300
I filed that report.

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
You must be dr. connelly.

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,700
Megan.

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Michael knight.

48
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,100
Why don't you hop in? I'll give you a ride.

49
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,400
Thanks.

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,700
What's that on your dash? it looks like a snow globe.

51
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,800
It's a...gps.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,100
But it's--it's busted right now.

53
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,000
Gps is activated.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Seems like it's working.

55
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,100
Yeah, but it's...

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,900
Not reliable.

57
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,200
I've hit a road block.

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,400
We're still locked out of the GOVERNMENT
SECURITY DATABASES,
Nsa, dhs, cia, interpol.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,100
Billy, if flag's going to have a chance of succeeding,

60
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,200
We're gonna need access to those networks.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,700
I'll keep at it.

62
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,600
Also, since we're short-handed...

63
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:08,900
Yeah?

64
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,600
Do you mind taking out some of that trash?

65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Sure, I'll just scoop it up with my phds.

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
BALHAM
INDUSTRIES AND LABORATORIES

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,500
I came in over the weekend.

68
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,600
That's when I noticed that the safe was open.

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,900
And three vials of serum were gone.

70
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,100
Any chance it could've been misplaced
Or accidentally thrown out?

71
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,000
Not really.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Dr. matheson's only managed to synthesize a small amount.

73
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,200
That's why I'm sure
We'll find it logged with the wrong batch.

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,300
Had you come to me first, megan,

75
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,800
I would've explained that to you.

76
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Dr. matheson, this is michael knight.

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
He has some questions about the missing serum.

78
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I told the military everything I know.

79
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,100
Just because the government funded this project

80
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,200
Doesn't give you the right to keep harassing me.

81
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,100
Yeah, I'm not with the government, dr. matheson.

82
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,300
I'm just checking some facts.

83
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,900
The fact is, this has been blown out of proportion.

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,300
If megan had been more discreet--

85
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,500
House system failure...

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,600
What happened to the lights?

87
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,000
Michael, the electrical and communication lines
To the complex have been severed.

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,200
A group of armed men wearing night vision goggles
Are rapidly approaching your position.

89
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,400
The phone is dead.

90
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
Dr. matheson, megan, I need you to get down.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,600
What? why?

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
Power system failure.

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Accessing backup system.

94
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,900
Emergency generator activated.

95
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,400
Bringing emergency generators online.

96
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Power system failure. power system failure.
NIGHT VISION.

97
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,100
Accessing backup system.

98
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,000
Go right.

99
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,100
Kitt, I need direction and proximity.

100
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,000
DISTANE CALCULATING
Target is approaching from behind.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,400
Tell me when.

102
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,000
Emergency generator activation.

103
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,700
He's raising the weapon.

104
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,300
And preparing to fire.

105
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Now.

106
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,500
What was that?

107
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,100
NIGHT VISION
Emergency generators online in 30 seconds.

108
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,400
30 seconds, counting.

109
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,900
Two more at your 10:00 coming fast.

110
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,100
Three meters...

111
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,700
Two...

112
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,800
One...now.

113
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Hey.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
Michael, can you hear me?

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Michael? ten seconds.

116
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I've got the serum, boys.

117
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,800
No, please, you can't.

118
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,100
Let's go!

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,600
Michael, the emergency generators
Are coming online now.

120
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Move, move, move!

121
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,500
Megan, go get help.

122
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,600
Kitt, you gotta stop them when they leave the building.

123
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,700
Michael, no one has exited,

124
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,500
But security is fast approaching your location.

125
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,200
Hold it right there!

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
- Get your hands up!
- whoa, guys...

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,200
This isn't what it looks like.

131
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,700
So, you just happened to bump into dr. connelly
On the side of the road?

132
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,900
Yes.

133
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,400
Don't you think that's just a little convenient?

134
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,300
We know they escaped through the biohazard tunnel,

135
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,700
We just don't know why they left you behind.

136
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,000
I told you.

137
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,200
I have nothing to do with the attack.

138
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
That's right.

139
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,300
You're an insurance adjuster.

140
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,500
Yet, you fought off four armed men
In total darkness.

141
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,000
Tried to fight off four armed men.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,700
I ran your i.d. through the system.

143
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,200
It came back clean.

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,100
The only problem is, no one's ever heard of you.

145
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,900
What do you make of that?

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, I'd say you talked to the wrong people.

147
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Colonel.

148
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,100
Lieutenant templeton benedict, sir.

149
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm mr. knight's army liaison officer.

150
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
I have orders for you to release him into my custody.

151
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,600
Well, that's just fine, lieutenant.

152
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,100
Well, I've never heard of you, either.

153
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,700
I'm sure you'll be hearing from my superior any minute.

154
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,800
That's probably him now.

155
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,400
Colonel hegal here.

156
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,000
Colonel, this is general stratton.

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,900
General stratton.

158
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,500
Hegal...hegal!

159
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Quite the honor, sir.

160
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,500
VOICE MODULATION
I need you to release your prisoner
Into lieutenant benedict's custody asap.

161
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,500
But, sir, I don't think that i--

162
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,300
Don't think, soldier. do it, and it's done.

163
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,400
Yes, sir. absolutely.

164
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,100
You're free to go.

165
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,500
Sir.

166
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,500
Does this mean there are two thieves?

167
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
The one who stole the missing serum

168
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
And the guys who shot dr. matheson?

169
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,500
No, it can't be a coincidence.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,100
You have to go back and download their inventory logs.

171
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,600
Why can't kitt do it?

172
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,800
Billy, the trunk line was severed.

173
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,700
CONNECTION SEVERED
I can't access their network.

174
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,000
Then what good are you?

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,300
I was able to record a voice print from the assault.

176
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,600
RECOVERED VOCAL SIGNAL, UNKNOWN SUSPECT
I got the serum, boys. let's go, let's go!

177
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,700
Enough consonants and syllables were articulated
To find a match,

178
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,200
but not without access
To the government's security databases.

179
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
Yeah, we're working on it.

180
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Thanks again for busting me out.

181
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,300
If you're so grateful, maybe you could spring

182
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,800
For the cost of renting the uniform!

183
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
It wasn't cheap!

184
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,800
I had no idea how much my dad and torres did,

185
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,300
And now I'm trying to do both their jobs.

186
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,100
It's okay to sweat...

187
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,900
As long as they don't see you sweat.

188
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,200
You're doing better than you think.

189
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
If we could just crack the government databases,

190
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,800
It's our best shot for finding a voice match
For dr. matheson's killer.

191
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,600
Torres had the highest level clearance.

192
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Yeah, but the government erased his password.

193
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Only the one they knew about.

194
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,900
How do you know his password?

195
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,100
I have perfect pitch.

196
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,000
Each click of the keys makes a distinct sound,

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,700
And I memorized the pattern.

198
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,600
I KILL THE KARAOKE.

199
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,300
Can I help you?

200
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,700
Uh, you must be dr. connelly.

201
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm lieutenant benedict. I work with michael knight.

202
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,500
How's he doing?

203
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,900
He's a little shaken up.

204
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,700
Actually, he's pretty scared.

205
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,000
I had to calm him down.

206
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,500
I'm sorry about dr. matheson.

207
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,400
I've started packing up my personal affects.

208
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
I've already been let go.

209
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,300
Why?

210
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,400
The military owns his work now.

211
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,500
I was always afraid this might happen.

212
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,700
Why did he develop a serum with military applications?

213
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,300
It was never intended that way.

214
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,700
He wanted to help the disabled by stimulating nerve repair
And cell rejuvenation.

215
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,200
To compensate for loss of function
In brain/body synergism?

216
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,800
Exactly.

217
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm a big reader.

218
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,500
He was trying to get approval
To test hxp on patients, but the fda refused.

219
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,400
- Let me get that.
- oh.

220
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,800
This must be hard on you.

221
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,700
Well, I think that army guy
Thinks I had something to do with it.

222
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,700
He keeps pointing fingers.

223
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,500
And I'm starting to think that maybe he's right.

224
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,400
I mean, if I hadn't said anything,

225
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,100
Maybe dr. matheson would still be alive.

226
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,300
Michael, you have a call from sarah.

227
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,800
Good news.

228
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,500
Thanks to zoe, we now have access to the databases.

229
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,900
Did you find a voiceprint match for dr. matheson's killer?

230
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,300
His name is victor galt.

231
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,700
??? ASSASIN AND THIEF.

232
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,900
And based on nsa chatter,

233
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,500
CROSS REFERENCING LEADS
It looks like the north koreans contracted him
To steal the hxp formula.

234
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Don't we have a photo?

235
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,300
No, nothing that can be verified.

236
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,400
But according to fbi informants,

237
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,900
He launders his money through a hotel and nightclub
Called la soleil.

238
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,500
Kitt, looks like we're going clubbing.

239
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,600
I'll park it myself.

240
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,400
No way, dude. those are expensive cars.

241
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,700
It's my ass if they get scratched--

242
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,600
Hey!

243
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Don't go chasing any tailpipe.

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,600
Michael, at the rate they're letting people in,

245
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,700
You'll be in line approximately 62 hours.
REVIEWING SUREVEILLANCE FOOTAGE
CALCULATING EXIT TO ENTRANCE RATIO

246
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,300
Ah, that's what the vip list is for, kitt.

247
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,400
You just have to tell me my name.

248
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,100
I'm on the list.

249
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,200
Michael, tell the doorman you are nick folman.

250
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,700
Nick folman.

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
Nice place.

252
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Kitt, can you please do something about this music?

253
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,500
Accessing dj booth.

254
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
* I love the nightlife **

255
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,300
* I've got to boogie **

256
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,200
* on the disco 'round,* *oh, yeah *

257
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,600
Kitt, the idea was to make the music better.

258
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
I assumed this was a popular hit.

259
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,000
Billy played it 389 times on my music system.

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,600
Billy has issues.

261
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,800
What else has he been up to?

262
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,100
He mostly plays second life on my touch screen.

263
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,900
Curiously, billy's avatar drives a car named kitt.

264
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,300
And its mechanic is named mike.

265
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,700
Okay, you tell billy you are not his tree house.

266
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,300
* when you've got women* *all over town *

267
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,200
* you can love them all,* *and when you're through... *

268
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Kitt, I think I know how we can find galt.

269
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
How, michael?

270
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,900
Can you dial the cell phones in the club?

271
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,400
Of course. but why?

272
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,400
Once you have their numbers,
you can access their voicemails.

273
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,100
Which will allow me to search
For a voiceprint matching galt's.

274
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,400
Exactly.

275
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,800
Very good, michael.

276
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,800
TRACING CELL PHONES
According to my scanners, there are 320 signals
In the general vicinity.

277
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,300
Dialing now.

278
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Work fast, kitt.

279
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,000
This could be our last chance to find galt
Before he passes the serum off to the buyers.

280
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,300
Excuse me.

281
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,500
Are you nick folman?

282
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,200
Yep, nick folman. that's me.

283
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,300
Then let me show you to the vip lounge.

284
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,400
Your bottle service is all set up.

285
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,600
Lead the way.

286
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,200
Oh, my god.

287
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,600
I found a message from victor galt
On alexandra pachinko's voicemail.

288
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,500
It came from a scrambled proxy phone.

289
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
Impossible to trace.

290
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,600
But you might consider asking alexandra about it.

291
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Considering she is the svelte lady
Who is causing your heart to race.

292
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,900
Mike, my scanners are indicating--

293
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,500
I saw you at balham labs.

294
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,600
Who do you work for?

295
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,200
Not the north koreans.

296
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,400
Isn't that who paid you?

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,100
Let's try that again, shall we?

298
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,300
Who do you work for?

299
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,200
Man, you wouldn't believe me if I told you.

300
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,400
Fine.

301
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,100
I work for flag.

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
Flag.

303
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,400
I have to go meet the buyers.

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What about him?

305
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,800
KILL HIM AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

306
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,300
When he's drunk, then take his car
And drive him off a cliff.

307
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,200
- Bring his car around back. - you got it.

308
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,200
Nice ride.

309
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,900
Too bad we're gonna have to wreck it.

310
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,600
Hey! what's going on?

311
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,000
I've lost contact with michael.

312
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,300
Tell me where he is.

313
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,500
Screw you--ow!

314
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,800
Wrong answer.

315
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,000
What?

316
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,900
Those appletinis are stronger than they look.

317
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,900
- Jeez. ease up.
- Oh, where you going?

318
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,700
We barely got to know each other.

319
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,200
Kitt, trunk.

320
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,100
Let me go!

321
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,800
Come here. aah!

322
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,700
It's okay. I'm a flag.

323
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,400
Michael, your blood alcohol level is far too high
To allow you to take the wheel.

324
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,100
Fine, I don't want to drive anyway.

325
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,300
I want a burger.

326
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,700
Take me to a drive-thru.

327
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,200
Michael, you do know that it's an urban legend,

328
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,300
That greasy food helps a hangover.

329
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,300
Look, the government's not sponsoring us anymore,

330
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,100
Zoe can't cook, and there's nothing in the fridge.

331
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,300
I need a burger!

332
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,600
Should we get something for the lady in the trunk?

333
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,800
No, she's not hungry.

334
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Sliding doors, open.

335
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,000
Thank you, sarah. I prefer a tidy interior.

336
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,900
Michael got ketchup all over my steering wheel.

337
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
I thought I told you to drink coffee.

338
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,000
Had some. it didn't work.

339
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,800
Who moved the gimbal?

340
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,100
What an auspicious beginning for flag.

341
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah, can we talk about that name?

342
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,100
'cause...

343
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,600
No, we can't.

344
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Billy...

345
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,500
Billy, I love what you did to this place.

346
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,600
Yeah, the elevator's out.

347
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,200
We needed a quicker way to get from floor to floor.

348
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,800
Try not to puke on anything.

349
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,900
Too late.

350
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,000
I just got finished going over the logs
I downloaded from balham labs.

351
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,500
It looks like dr. matheson was the last one

352
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,900
To sign out the samples reported missing by megan.

353
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,700
Why would he steal his own serum?

354
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,500
He could stand to make a lot more
By selling it on the open market

355
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,800
Than just giving it to the government.

356
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,600
Hmm, maybe when I see megan tomorrow,

357
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,200
I'll ask her if dr. matheson had been acting suspicious.

358
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
Billy's got a date.

359
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,400
- Michael, you're in no condition To tamper with my wipers.
-What can I say? she gets me.

360
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
You mean she gets lieutenant benedict.

361
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah.

362
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,500
Haven't exactly gotten around to telling her about that.

363
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,200
What was that?

364
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
That's the lady I stuffed in the trunk.

365
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,400
She knows where galt is.

366
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,900
You...coffee.

367
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,900
You...

368
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,000
Help me figure out how I can get information out of her.

369
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
What do you think? put her in the gimbal?

370
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,300
No, no.

371
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,800
Nobody's spinning around inside of kitt.

372
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm not cleaning up vomit.

373
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,000
If I'd been out clubbing and woke up in some guy's trunk...

374
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,000
You know what would really freak me out?

375
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,600
???

376
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,500
what's going on? where am i?

377
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,900
i ask the questions.

378
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,300
who are you?

379
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,600
your name is alexandra pachinko.

380
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,200
yes or no?

381
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,100
yes.

382
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,100
where is victor galt?

383
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,800
never heard of him.

384
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
PLAYBACK
alex, it's me, your little malush.

385
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,500
how's business?

386
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
okay, yes. i know victor.

387
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,600
but...i don't know where he is.

388
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,600
hello?

389
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,900
wait, what-- what are you doing?

390
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
malush, baby, it's me.

391
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,300
VOICE DUPLICATION
why did that guy come into my club?

392
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,400
what's going on?

393
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,300
victor, no! don't say anything!

394
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,800
- it's not me.
- YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

395
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,200
you were supposed to kill him,

396
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,600
and i'm hearing that he got away.

397
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,200
he didn't get far, malush. we took care of him.

398
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,000
but i'm worried about your deal--

399
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
don't worry, i'm on my way to meet them now.

400
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,200
hey, i'll see you tonight.

401
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,400
good job, kitt.

402
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
play back.

403
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,700
hello.

404
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,000
(- alex, it's me. - malush, BABY, IT'S ME.)
scrub forward a bit.

405
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,500
MESSAGE PLAYBACK

406
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,300
- there. play. (YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KILL HIM.)
- what are you doing?

407
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,400
ah, you had your turn.
(AND I'M HEARING THAT HE GOT AWAY.)

408
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,800
amplify the background noise, drop victor's voice.

409
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,900
turn west on highway 110. 200 yards.

410
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,700
i love gps.

411
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,600
kitt, isolate the gps voice
and piece together galt's destination.

412
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,200
put her in holding until we figure out what to do with her.

413
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,200
michael, according to my scanners,

414
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,400
the case galt is carrying contains the stolen hxp serum.

415
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,200
kitt, what did we say about the hangover voice?

416
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,300
sorry, michael.

417
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,800
are you sure you're up for this?

418
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,500
don't worry about me.

419
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,900
let's do this.

420
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,000
you know what?

421
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,600
i'm gonna need the other half of the money first.

422
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,900
let's do it.

423
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,100
take him out! come on!

424
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,300
come on, come on, come on.

425
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
there's nowhere to run, galt.

426
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,300
just give me the serum.

427
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
there's nowhere to run, galt.

428
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,100
kitt, what's happening to him?

429
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,600
there's a bio-metamorphic change
occurring at a cellular level.

430
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,000
that doesn't sound good.

431
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,200
i would advise you to get inside immediately.

432
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,000
galt's testosterone and adrenaline levels
are spiking dramatically.

433
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
kill you.

434
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,900
yeah, it might not be a bad idea
to give him some space

435
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,600
while we see how
this whole thing plans out.

436
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,100
michael, look out.

437
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
michael, galt's metamorphic changes
are not slowing down.

438
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,600
PAIN RECPTORS, NOCICPETOR
it also appears his pain receptors
have ceased to function.

439
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,700
anything else you need to tell me,

440
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,100
before i piss him off further?

441
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,000
yes, michael.

442
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,900
HE HAS FIVE TIMES THE STRENGTH
OF A NORMAL HUMAN.

443
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,000
michael, hurry!

444
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,500
come out and fight!

445
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,100
michael, you've been injured.

446
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
i must return you to the ssc for medical treatment.

447
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,100
no, i am ordering you to stay and fight.

448
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
i have new programming that orders me to return you
to the ssc for

449
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,300
medical attentionin the event that you are seriously injured.

450
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,900
whose idea was this new program?

451
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,100
sarah's.

452
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,200
hey, are you okay?

453
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,700
what the hell do you think you're doing?

454
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,900
- i--
- i'm in charge in the field.

455
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,200
you don't put in protocols that override my authority.

456
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,300
you're my responsibility now.

457
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,400
this is because of what happened in hawaii, isn't it?

458
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,500
what happened in hawaii has nothing to do with this.

459
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,400
that guy almost killed you.

460
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,200
you're more important than any one case.

461
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,100
please, sarah, you have to trust
that i know what i'm doing.

462
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,600
and if you're gonna wear so many hats,

463
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,300
you need to learn how to delegate.

464
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,000
i'm doing the best i can.

465
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,100
i'm sorry if it doesn't meet the standards you're used to.

466
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,200
sarah, you're doing an amazing job.

467
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,500
and your father would be very proud.

468
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,300
now, we need to figure out how to beat this guy,

469
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,000
'cause i'm not running again.

470
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,700
hey!

471
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,300
what's with the roller skates?

472
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,500
like you said, we've got to find a way
to move around quickly.

473
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
and it gets me through the creepy areas faster.

474
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,200
so, today's your big date?

475
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,300
that's right.

476
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,600
you seem to be making progress,

477
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,200
considering you've been lying to megan
about who you are.

478
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,600
i'm not lying.

479
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
it's called bending the truth.

480
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,700
and it's a natural part of dating.

481
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,300
what're you working on?

482
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,100
a metabolic panel of galt's blood.

483
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,400
he left a sample trying to smash kitt's windshield.

484
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,900
this serum seems to fortify muscular function,

485
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,900
overriding the brain/body barrier
that stops you from burning out your nervous system.

486
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,800
could the serum enhance senses like vision and hearing?

487
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,500
maybe. why?

488
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,300
kitt noticed that galt reacted to the blast
when the suv exploded.

489
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,400
interesting.

490
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,700
if galt is sensitive to sound, maybe we can stop him,

491
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,600
using a close proximity sonic weapon.

492
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,800
it should over stimulate galt's nervous system,

493
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,700
causing a complete shutdown.

494
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,800
any luck finding galt yet?

495
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,600
i'm still running a satellite search, michael.

496
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,300
but are you sure you want to confront him?

497
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,900
he seemed to handle you quite easily.

498
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,800
first of all, kitt,

499
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,200
he did not "handle" me, i was hung over.

500
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,000
there's a big difference between that...

501
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,800
and getting beaten.

502
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,900
are you upset because i brought you back to the ssc?

503
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,200
frankly, yeah.

504
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,500
i can't do this job if you and sarah
are making secret plans behind my back.

505
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,400
i'm sorry, michael. it was my protocol.

506
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,200
well, how 'bout this for a protocol, kitt.

507
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
from now on, we're up front with each other.

508
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,300
no secret pacts, no lies,

509
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,200
and no game-playing.

510
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,000
deal, michael.

511
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,700
all right...

512
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,600
now, let's find galt and finish this.

513
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,200
you look great.

514
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,300
i never thought i'd go out with a guy in uniform.

515
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,100
but it really does suit you.

516
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,900
well, i'm more than just a uniform.

517
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,900
i'm not suggesting that's the only reason
i'm going out with you.

518
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,600
but i do like it.

519
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
templeton, i have a confession to make.

520
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,600
the reason i reported the serum missing,

521
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,200
is because i was afraid dr. matheson
was using it on himself.

522
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,600
why do you think that?

523
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,000
i found this photo last week.

524
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,600
it was taken before i started working at the lab.

525
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,000
doesn't even look like the same guy.

526
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,200
dr. matheson couldn't get fda approval,

527
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,100
and he knew that without human testing,

528
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,200
the military was gonna pull our funding.

529
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,700
so he used himself as a human guinea pig.

530
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,100
i think that's why he was so defensive
when i reported them missing.

531
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,500
but i was concerned after some of our animal testing
started showing some serious side effects.

532
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,200
like what?

533
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,400
the endocrine system spinning out of control.

534
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
a large enough dose could cause a subject to overload

535
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,400
and slip into extreme aggression and violent behavior.

536
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,200
would you excuse me for one second?

537
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,800
i just have to make a quick phone call.

538
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,100
i'll be right back.

539
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,200
hey, billy. how's the big date?

540
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,600
informative.

541
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,700
how do you mean?

542
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,900
it looks like dr. matheson was getting high
on his own supply.

543
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,700
that's why the hxp serum went missing in the first place.

544
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,900
wait. if matheson took it,

545
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,100
then why didn't he metamorphosize like galt?

546
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,700
smaller doses over a longer period.

547
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,500
no way it would've had the same drastic effect
as galt's mega dose.

548
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,700
billy?

549
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,700
hey!

550
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,900
the north koreans are probably pissed
galt took their money

551
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,800
and used the rest of the serum on himself.

552
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,400
so he kidnaps megan
assuming she can replicate the formula.

553
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,900
after all, she knows more about it than anyone else.

554
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,400
sonic cannon program is installed.

555
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,300
so how does it work?

556
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
it produces a subsonic vibration,

557
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,700
that only galt should be able to hear.

558
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,600
it's like a super dog whistle.

559
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,600
when do we head out?

560
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,300
we don't. i'm flying solo.

561
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,200
galt grabbed megan on my watch, i'm going with.

562
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,600
actually, it's mike's call.

563
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,300
he's in charge of the field now.

564
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,700
i'll bring her back, billy.

565
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,200
so how do we find this bad boy?

566
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,400
we called him once.

567
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,900
but this time, it won't be alexandra's voice he hears.

568
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,800
kitt, dial galt's scrambled number we got at la soleil.

569
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,200
mike, what're you doing?

570
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,900
making a deal.

571
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,700
hello.

572
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,000
hey, malush. what's going on?

573
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,800
i was wondering when you were gonna call.

574
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
you still running away from fights?

575
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,600
thought you might be interested in a trade.

576
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,400
megan connelly for the rest of the serum.

577
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
she can make me new serum.

578
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,700
you think so?

579
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
research assistant?

580
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,900
yeah, i'm sure the north koreans
won't mind waiting six or seven months.

581
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,200
on the other hand...

582
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,100
i'm looking at three vials of the real deal.

583
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,700
i thought the rest of it was stolen.

584
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,600
it was. by me.

585
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,800
what do you think i was doing at balham labs?

586
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,500
trying to cover my tracks.

587
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,300
why do you care about this girl?

588
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,200
maybe i like her legs.

589
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,000
i hear that.

590
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,000
all right, you meet me at 23 wilmington way in hawthorne.

591
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,300
one hour.

592
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,800
and one other thing.

593
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,300
bring alexandra.

594
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,100
AND LOOKS LIKE ???

595
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,000
sarah, i'm at the location, but i don't see galt.

596
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,400
kitt, if billy's theory is right,

597
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,400
then galt should be running
at least three degrees hotter than normal.

598
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,500
michael, there are two heat sources

599
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,000
coming from inside that van,

600
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,500
and one is significantly hotter than the other.

601
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,100
that's gotta be him.

602
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
i don't want to take any chances, kitt.

603
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,100
as soon as we make the exchange,
hit galt with the sonic cannon.

604
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,400
yes, michael.

605
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,400
let's go see your boyfriend.

606
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,500
hey, baby. mr. knight.

607
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
have alexandra bring me the serum.

608
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,500
give me megan first.

609
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,300
now show me the stuff.

610
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,500
how do i know it's real?

611
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,100
stop!

612
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,300
send her over with it.

613
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,800
hey, baby.

614
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,500
i'm glad you're here.

615
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,900
i needed to test it.

616
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,700
what did you do to me?

617
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700
i'm sorry, baby.

618
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,300
what the hell's in it?

619
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,700
those appletini's do have a kick.

620
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,500
you'll be fine, all right.

621
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,400
kitt, now!

622
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,200
turn it off.

623
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,100
why would you save a guy who just shoved
a needle into your arm?

624
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,400
he loves me.

625
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,200
you know, they have therapy for that.

626
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,500
turn it off!

627
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,100
now!

628
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,500
do it, kitt.

629
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,200
thank you, baby.

630
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,300
i do love you.

631
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,900
what are you doing?

632
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,700
TAKING BACK MY ADVANTAGE.

633
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,800
zoe, do you have anything?

634
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,300
i got satellite pov.

635
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,900
that isn't good.

636
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,300
you know what's worse?

637
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,300
LOOKS LIKE BILLY IS THEIR ONLY HOPE.

638
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,300
hey!

639
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,600
come on, come on.

640
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
MEGAN.

641
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,100
you're gonna pay for that.

642
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,200
you're nothing without your car.

643
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,800
dude... okay.

644
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,100
you look pretty good out of uniform, too.

645
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,500
actually, it wasn't mine.

646
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,500
it was rented.

647
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,800
i'm not entirely who you think i am.

648
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,700
and i know that sounds really weird,

649
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,600
but i have a really good explanation
if you just give me a chance.

650
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,900
okay.

651
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,500
really?

652
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
i think i owe you the benefit of the doubt, templeton.

653
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,100
actually, megan, there's one other thing.

654
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,400
what?

655
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,000
my friends call me billy.

656
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,900
kitt, you okay?

657
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,500
i'm fine, michael.

658
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,000
are you okay?

659
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,100
yeah, i'm fine, too.

660
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,000
knowing you, i'm sure it's nothing
a couple of pints of vitamins won't fix.

661
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,900
yeah, you got that right.

662
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,500
initiate designated driver mode.

663
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,700
michael?

664
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,500
i'm kidding.

665
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,500
any faster, you'll set off the smoke alarms.

666
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,300
here, come here. i want a witness.

667
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
our first completed cases...

668
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,800
F.L.A.G.(FOUNDATION FOR LAW AND GOVERNMENT)
under the new flag.

669
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,700
- aww.
- oh, here, and look at this.

670
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,900
i've been going through the foundation's archives,

671
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,900
their cases were amazing.

672
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
they believed one man could make a difference.

673
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,300
shouldn't it be...

674
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,300
"one man with a really tricked out car
and an awesome team?"

675
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
yeah.

676
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,800
that's just what we got.

677
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,500
together...

678
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,800
we are going to make a difference.

679
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,300
break it.
