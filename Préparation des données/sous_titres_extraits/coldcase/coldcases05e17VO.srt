1
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,900
Sweetheart,
it's just me.

2
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,500
You shouldn't sneak up
on me like that

3
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
when I'm writing.

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,800
Let me have a peek.

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,200
I thought you said you were
going to your lecture.

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,500
I wanted to see my wife
before I go.

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,700
Give my new bride
a kiss good-bye.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,700
Honey, Dan, stop.

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,600
Rachel hasn't gone
to bed yet.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,400
Lookit. Now I have hair
like Mommy's!

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Rachel, sweetie,
you have beautiful hair.

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,600
red hair runs in your family

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,700
doesn't it,
Nancy?

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,100
Really, Mommy?

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
My mother had red hair,
but yours

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,800
is even prettier.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
Where is she?

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,000
In heaven, sweetheart.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,100
She died when I was a baby.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
But guess what?

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,200
I think it's
somebody's bedtime.

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,400
Go with Annette.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll be up in a minute
to say good night.

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,600
Did you hear that?

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Nancy, we've talked about this.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,300
I'm telling you I keep hearing
these noises, Dan.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
It's an old house, Nance.

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,500
I think they're coming
from the attic.

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,600
There are no monsters
in the attic, I promise.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,400
You know, you should save

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,600
all that imagination
for your writing.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,800
I don't know how you hear
anything with the racket

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,700
that typewriter
makes anyway.

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,400
None of it's any good.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,800
Give yourself a chance.

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,300
And promise me

37
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
you won't let
a few bumps scare you?

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,300
What's up
with Cyndi Lauper?

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,200
Can we help you
with something?

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,300
You're, like, the cops
that investigate

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,900
really old murder cases, right?

42
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,600
Detectives, actually. Rush,

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,900
- Valens.
- My name's Liza.

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
I have something
I want to show you.

45
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,300
My grandma Nancy Patterson
was found hung in her attic

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,600
in 1962.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
A suicide.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,700
That's what everyone said,

49
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,500
but the people that live
in the house now

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,600
are renovating the upstairs,
and... they found this note.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,700
"I must end it,
my dearest, my butterfly.

52
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,100
"Only in death
will I find peace.

53
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,500
"I hope in time

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
you'll forgive me. "

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,400
It's a suicide note.

56
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,200
But that's not

57
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
my grandma's handwriting.

58
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,000
Grandma Nancy wrote on the back
of all of our old photosLook.

59
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,600
You guys can test it,
can't you?

60
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,300
You have special instruments
or something?

61
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,800
What about your parents?

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,500
They think
your grandmother wrote this?

63
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
My mom doesn't like me
to talk about Grandma Nancy.

64
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,300
She was only five

65
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,400
when she died.

66
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Tough to lose a parent
at that age.

67
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,400
It's like she never got over it.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,100
Well, we'll take a look.

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,500
No promises.

70
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Thank you.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,900
I ain't an expert, but

72
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,900
the handwriting don't look
the same to me.

73
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,300
The note definitely sounds
like a good-bye.

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
If Nancy didn't write it,
who did?

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,100

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Questioned Documents confirmed
handwriting on the suicide note

79
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,800
wasn't Nancy's.

80
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,900
Strangulation could have
happened before the hanging.

81
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,200
Note tell us anything else?

82
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,300
There's no latent prints,

83
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,400
but the date of the
paper checked out.

84
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,300
The note's at least
30, 40 years old.

85
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,000
Nancy's daughter
Rachel Patterson

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,900
found the body.

87
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,500
Had a bad dream thatight.
Went looking for her mom.

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Hell of a thing

89
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
- living with that your whole life. - Nancy's husband

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
Daniel Patterson was working
late when it happened.

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
Professor Daniel Patterson?

92
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,000
Are you familiar?

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,100
Patterson was a state
Poet Laureate.

94
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,700
I take it
that means he was good?

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,500
"Hollow. No escape
from the dark. I sit alone.

96
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,900
In empty rooms. "

97
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,300
I hadn't really
pegged you

98
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,200
as a poetry type, boss.

99
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,100
Not me.

100
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,300
The ex-wife.

101
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,300
I thought
poetry was supposed to rhyme.

102
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,500
Apparently, he's still giving
lectures as a professor emeritus

103
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,700
of literature
at Powell University.

104
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,000
Where he met Nancy.

105
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,900
One of his students?

106
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,200
Try secretary.

107
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
Her first husband died

108
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
in a car crash.

109
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,200
Left Nancy with a kid
to support on her own.

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,400
Nancy married Patterson

111
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,700
in '61. Went back
to being a homemaker.

112
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,100
He had a much bigger house.

113
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,400
Daniel Patterson told police

114
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,200
his wife started acting paranoid
shortly after

115
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,400
they moved in.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Anybody benefit
from Nancy's death?

117
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,300
There was no life
insurance, no inheritance.

118
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,300
No leads.

119
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,700
Have a talk with the husband.
The daughter, too.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,500
Maybe they can shed
someight.

121
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
Liza shouldn't have

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
bothered you about this.

123
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,600
It's what we do.

124
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,100
Well, my mother
killed herself

125
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,400
long time ago.

126
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,600
- There's a chance she didn't. 
- A chance?

127
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,100
So you don't know
for certain then?

128
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,100
Mom, at least look
at the note.

129
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,600
I've seen the note, Liza.

130
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
It changes nothing.

131
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,300
I- I'm sorry,
but I don't see the point.

132
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,900
Losing your mom

133
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,300
like that, hard to accept.

134
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,000
But I did, and I've moved on.

135
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,300
Honey, you shouldn't be here.

136
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,300
Mom, come on.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,300
Your daughter
just wants to help.

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,500
Detective, my mother
was very disturbed,

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,100
and I've had to accept that
whatever made her that way

140
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,100
might be in us.

141
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,600
You and Liza, you mean.

142
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,300
I made it past
my 27th birthday.

143
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,100
What about my daughter?

144
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
It's the age your mother was
when she died.

145
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,400
Everybody assumes
that I want to... bury this,

146
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
but I have to live with it
every day.

147
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
And your stepdad?

148
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,500
Daniel?

149
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,800
He, uh, sent me off
to a boarding school

150
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
as soon as I was old enough...

151
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,400
probably because
I reminded him of her.

152
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,900
So it was just the three
of you in the house mostly?

153
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
No, daniel was away a lot

154
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,700
trying to meet
a deadline

155
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,600
for his book or lecture...

156
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,000
Then it was just you alone
with your mom that night?

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,900
Yeah, we were alone a lot.

158
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,800
But she was always hearing
strange sounds.

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,600
One... two... three...

160
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,100
four...

161
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,100
five... six...

162
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,800
seven... eight... nine...

163
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,400
ten. Ready or not,
here I come!

164
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,700
I can hear you!

165
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,700
Rachel, are you
in the attic?

166
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,400
I told you I don't want you
going in the attic.

167
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,500
Rachel?

168
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,600
Rachel?

169
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Oh, sweetie, what
are you doing in here?

170
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,800
You could suffocate.

171
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
I wanted a good
place to hide!

172
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,300
I don't want you
coming up here anymore.

173
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,500
Promise me.

174
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,900
Why, Mommy?

175
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,500
Come on. Let's go.

176
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,700
What's wrong, Mommy?

177
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,300
What's wrong, Mommy?

178
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,500
Shh-shh-shh!

179
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,100
Shh! There's someone out there.

180
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,100
Mommy,'m scared.

181
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,800
Hush, shh-shh-shh!

182
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
Who's out there, Mommy?

183
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
No one.

184
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,200
Who locked it?

185
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, um...

186
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
the door must have jammed.
That's all.

187
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,200
Uh, it's okay, sweetie.
Come here.

188
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Mommy's just out of sorts.

189
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,800
But we're okay. We're okay.
No one's here.

190
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,500
Someone was in the house?

191
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,400
No, I think that she probably
knocked the vase over

192
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,100
before she went in.

193
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
I'm late
for a meeting.

194
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,500
Someone was in your house.

195
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,300
I've got a deadline.

196
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,500
Maybe someone who had a problem
with your mother,

197
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,300
a grudge, an argument maybe.

198
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,100
I told you, detective, 
the problem was in my mother's head.

199
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,700
Look, I know it's hard, Rachel.
Think back...

200
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,800
Thanks for you time,
Rael..

201
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
We'll be in touch.

202
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
I can't change
what my mother did.

203
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,900
That's the past.

204
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,600
Let it stay there.

205
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,500
For years I searched
for an explanation.

206
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,100
Something that'd make sense.

207
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
Nothing ever did till now.

208
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,100
You said Nancy had been acting
a little paranoid.

209
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,200
No one had a word

210
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,900
for what was happening
to Nancy then... or a cure.

211
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,300
Electroshock therapy,

212
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,600
lobotomies?

213
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,300
It was seen as shameful-
insanity.

214
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,100
Gotta ask,

215
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,700
Professor, but maybe
that someone

216
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
she was afraid of was you.

217
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,400
I loved my wife.
I didn't kill her.

218
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,500
Plus I was never

219
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,900
around, really.

220
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,300
I was on a deadline,
spent all my nights here.

221
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,600
Deadline for this book?

222
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
<i>My collection of poetry:
Empty Rooms.</i>

223
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,300
It was going
to be my gift to her,

224
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,700
my attempt to capture
her spirit,

225
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,900
see the world
through her eyes.

226
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
She died before
it was published.

227
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,500
Such a fool...

228
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,100
spending my time
writing about the woman I loved

229
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,600
instead of being with her.

230
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,300
Sounds like Nancy
spent a lot

231
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,800
of time home alone.

232
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,200
That's why I hired Annette.

233
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
Annette?

234
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,100
Our housekeeper.

235
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,700
Annette have keys to the house?

236
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Yes.

237
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
She's the only one
outside the family who did.

238
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,700
The attic, too?

239
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,200
Yes, but you don't think...

240
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,700
We'll need her last name.

241
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,100
Also, a sample

242
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,500
of your handwriting.

243
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,100
Of course.

244
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,300
It sounds strange,

245
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,600
but somehow knowing
she didn't do it herself...

246
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,200
is a relief.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,500
Nancy had been so blessed.

248
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,300
Hard to believe someone
wanting to hurt her.

249
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,000
You had been working

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
for the Pattersons
for several months.

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,400
Yes, I started shortly

252
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,700
after they were married.

253
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,400
And you had keys

254
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
to the house- the attic?

255
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,000
Really now, you don't think

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,700
I had something to do
with what happened?

257
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,000
Professor Patterson trusted me.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,500
And you respected him.

259
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,400
He was a gentleman. Kind.

260
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,600
Sure you weren't holding
a torch, Annette?

261
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,700
Professor Patterson only
had eyes for his wife.

262
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,100
She was a beautiful woman.

263
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,200
Full of life.

264
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,800
Until she started slipping.

265
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,500
That's what we all believed.

266
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,800
Not you, Annette?

267
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,100
There was one incident

268
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,000
that I had trouble
explaining away.

269
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,300
Ma'am?

270
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,700
The page I typed last night-

271
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,800
It was right here, in my typewriter.

272
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,800
You're sure Rachel hasn't
been playing with my things?

273
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm sure, Mrs. Patterson.

274
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,800
I put Rachel to bed.
I should be going now.

275
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,900
Good night.

276
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,800
Wait, Annette!

277
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,900
Did you lock all
the windows and doors?

278
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,000
Of course.

279
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,100
- The back door, too?
- Yes.

280
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,900
Did you feel that?

281
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,300
That breeze?

282
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,200
Oh, my God.

283
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,700
I don't understand.

284
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,300
I locked everything...

285
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,900
Mrs. Patterson?

286
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,100
"Death lurks in the corners
of your past,

287
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,000
leaving her marks
about your neck?"

288
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,600
Drummond.

289
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,300
That name mean anything to you?

290
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,000
First time I ever heard it.

291
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Long time ago.

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Maybe your memory's
a little fuzzy.

293
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,900
My memory's sharp as a tack.
Thank you.

294
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,000
Sounds
like whoever

295
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,200
this Drummond was,

296
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,300
he was obsessed with Nancy.

297
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,100
There was a man once,

298
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,200
parked out in front of the house
in a brown woodie.

299
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,500
A station wagon.

300
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,800
Buick, I think.

301
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,500
He was just sitting there,
staring up at the study.

302
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,900
You never mentioned this.

303
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,700
Everybody said
she killed herself.

304
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
So why would I?

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,900
Any leads on a brown
station wagon?

306
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,200
Well, according to the DMV

307
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,000
there were at least a hundred
of them in the city in '62.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,100
Any of them
belong to a Drummond?

309
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,900
Nope. And the only
Drummonde found

310
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,500
was a 98-year-old man
in a rest home.

311
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,300
But we did find this.

312
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,400
Brown Buick station wagon
was issued a speeding ticket

313
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,700
not more than two blocks
from Nancy's house.

314
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,600
Turns out Speedy was
one of Patterson's students.

315
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,200
A Bruce Davies.

316
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,000
We thought this Bruce

317
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,400
might be connected to Drummond.

318
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
A nickname...
another student maybe.

319
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,800
Took a look at some yearbooks
and school newspapers.

320
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
Found this.

321
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,600
Picture from
the spring social.

322
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,700
Bruce Davies with
his sweetheart Nancy.

323
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,300
Nancy married
Daniel Patterson

324
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,600
less than a year
after this was taken.

325
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,400
Ol' Bruce got the heave-ho.

326
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,400
????

327
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
Philly Homicide.

328
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,800
Like to talk
with Bruce Davies.

329
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,800
Are you Mrs. Davies?
Me?

330
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,300
No. Name's Belle.

331
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
I might've been
somebody's wife if the job

332
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,100
paid better. I work here.

333
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,000
Help out with the cooking
and cleaning.

334
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,500
Something tells me
you haven't always

335
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,100
been cooking
and cleaning.

336
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,100
I spent a lot
of good

337
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,900
years dancing, too.

338
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I'll bet.

339
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Still know how to bring
a smile to a man's face.

340
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,800
Talkin' about my cooking,
of course.

341
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,900
Of course.

342
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
This way.

343
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,900
Police want to have

344
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,700
a word with you,
Mr. Davies.

345
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
The police?

346
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,500
Make a mean apple pie.

347
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
And you look like a man
that appreciates good pie.

348
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
á la mode.

349
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,500
What is this about?

350
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,600
Nancy Patterson.
You knew her.

351
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,400
- Haven't heard that name in years. 
- What about

352
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,000
the name Drummond?
That ring any bells?

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,400
No. Should it?

354
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,400
We'll need you

355
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,500
to come down,
provide a writing sample.

356
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,300
Why?

357
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,400
Because

358
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,300
we think Nancy was murdered.

359
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
You two dated,
right?

360
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,900
She was a secretary
in the English Department

361
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,700
when I was a grad student.
So what?

362
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,900
So she kicked you to the curb
and married Daniel.

363
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,500
But that wasn't
the end of it.

364
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,700
You sat outside in your car

365
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,200
for hours,
pining away.

366
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,100
I was pining away, all right,
but not for Nancy,

367
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,400
or for that dowdy housekeeper
of hers.

368
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,000
Two down, gentlemen,
one to go.

369
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,900
You were pining
for the husband?

370
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,400
They didn't have a name for that
in '62.

371
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,500
They do now.

372
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,700
I was his lovelorn grad student.

373
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,800
Tragic, really.

374
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,200
Sayin' it was a two-way street?

375
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,500
- You and the professor?
- In my dreams.

376
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,900
Professor Patterson barely knew
I existed.

377
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,300
Doesn't mean you didn't kill off
the competition.

378
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,400
I was interviewing
for a teaching post

379
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
in Cincinnati
the night she died.

380
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,200
You can check.

381
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,300
We will.

382
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,300
I was truly sorry
when I heard about Nancy.

383
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
Never believed it.

384
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,000
Suicide, I mean.

385
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Why's that?

386
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,300
Something was going on
in that house...

387
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
something strange.

388
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,100
Well, Bruce,

389
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,100
my advice is simple
to a young poet.

390
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,600
Let nothing come
between you and the page.

391
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,400
Is that why you prefer writing
everything longhand, Professor?

392
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
The truest connection,
really.

393
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,000
Because when the muse
speaks to you,

394
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,800
she does in a whisper.

395
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
Or a scream.

396
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,800
Pardon me.

397
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,200
I don't know
what made me say that.

398
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Could it be
your muse

399
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,300
is a banshee?

400
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,800
Of course

401
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
I don't write. Not really.

402
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,700
- Not like my husband does.
- Actually,

403
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,900
Nancy is a voracious reader.

404
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,500
Seems she's read
nearly every book

405
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,400
- in my library. 
- Oh, and somehow manages

406
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,100
to make delightful
pigs in a blanket.

407
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,700
I better check on Rachel.

408
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,700
Excuse me. Please.

409
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,000
Nancy grew up
an orphan,

410
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,500
so she got a late start
on the great works.

411
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,200
But it's just made her curious
about all that she's missed.

412
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Speaking of great works,

413
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,600
I heard that your collection
is coming out next spring.

414
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
My editor paid you to say that,
didn't he?

415
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,700
Well, it's a good problem
to have, Professor-

416
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,500
people waiting with bated breath
for your next project.

417
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,400
Well, don't hold your breath
for too long.

418
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,900
The muse can be as unpredictable
as my wife.

419
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
You'll give us
a preview,

420
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
won't you?
Of your collection?

421
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,600
You're not going
to make us wait.

422
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Well, if I shared
it now,

423
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,700
that would just spoil
the anticipation.

424
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,400
Daniel!

425
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Nancy?

426
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,200
Nancy?

427
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,500
Nancy...?

428
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,900
What the hell?

429
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,100
Daniel.

430
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,700
Professor Patterson asked
for me to be discreet.

431
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,900
His wife's problems, you see.

432
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,000
He said it must've been
a misunderstanding.

433
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,600
Some misunderstanding.

434
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,100
I respected him,

435
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
so I never spoke of it again.

436
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,900
Been holding out
on us,

437
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,400
- Professor. 
- Kinda thing makes us

438
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
suspicious.

439
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,800
What are you talking about?

440
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,800
Forgot to, uh,
clue us in

441
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,100
on the dinner party.

442
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,700
The noose in the attic.

443
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,100
Doesn't make
a lot of sense.

444
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,200
You keepin'
that quiet.

445
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,100
- It didn't mean anything.
- Really?

446
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,500
Someone breaking
into your house,

447
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,900
stringing up a noose,

448
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
doesn't mean
anything?

449
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,200
I couldn't believe it
at the time.

450
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,400
And after she died?
What about then?

451
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,100
It only made matters worse.

452
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,000
Why?

453
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,700
Because you didn't do anything
to stop it?

454
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,900
No. Because I believed her.

455
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,200
We need to go
to the police.

456
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,200
And tell them what?
There has to be

457
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
some rational

458
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,100
explanation for this.

459
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,300
Someone was in our house.

460
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,600
You saw it with
your own eyes!

461
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,100
- What more do you want? 
- It just doesn't make any sense.

462
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
I mean who would do
a thing like that?

463
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't know!

464
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,300
I'm so scared, Daniel.

465
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,400
You're always gone
and I'm left here alone.

466
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
What do you expect from me?

467
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,200
I expect you to believe me.

468
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I do.

469
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
I'm sorry.

470
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,200
We'll go to the police.

471
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,300
Together.

472
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,400
You...

473
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,100
Give me the keys.
I'll drive.

474
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,200
Um...

475
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
What...

476
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
What's the matter, Nancy?

477
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,000
You bought rope?

478
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,500
I don't understand, Daniel.

479
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,800
"Nancy Patterson. "
That's your signature.

480
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,100
I didn't. I...

481
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,800
I- I didn't buy that.

482
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,000
Did...

483
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,300
did I?

484
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Nancy bought the rope?

485
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,200
I wanted there
to be another explanation.

486
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,700
And when you came to me...

487
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,600
I thought maybe there was.

488
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,500
Cops had it right

489
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,600
the first time.

490
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,300
Nancy did herself in.

491
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
????

492
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,000
So we've been chasing our tails
on this one, huh?

493
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,900
Great,

494
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,800
'cause I got nothin' better
to do with my time.

495
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,200
Well, Nancy locked herself
and Rachel in the attic,

496
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,700
put the note in
the typewriter,

497
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,000
hung up the noose
at the party.

498
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,800
That's some kinda crazy.

499
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,200
Well, maybe she went
into a fugue state.

500
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Forgot she did
any of it.

501
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,900
So that's that, huh?

502
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,100
Job's open and shut.

503
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,400
Well, pretty much, yeah.

504
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,700
And what
about Drummond?

505
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,900
That "death lurks"
message he left?

506
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,500
Looney Tunes made him up.

507
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

508
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,400
Hey.

509
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
Can't you read?

510
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Since when is milk
private property?

511
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,300
Saving it, all right?

512
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,500
For what?

513
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,200
Apple pie, maybe?

514
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Just keep your hands off of it.

515
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,500
Most of the women in this book

516
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,300
just don't seem
like the type to leave

517
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,200
- without saying good-bye. 
- Aren't you forgetting the suicide note?

518
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,400
It wasn't hers.

519
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,500
Or her husband's,

520
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
or the housekeeper's,

521
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,900
or Bruce's.

522
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,600
So who wrote it?

523
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,100
It ain't an exact science.

524
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,300
Oh, that's your explanation?

525
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,500
Drop it, Scotty.

526
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,500
It's bad enough we rocked the
boat with the family, you know?

527
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,600
She didn't write
that note, Nick.

528
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,900
This isn't about you, Scotty.

529
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,000
Or Esasa.

530
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,000
Or is it?

531
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,300
<i>You're talking about the woman
that hung herself.</i>

532
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,500
Yeah, Nancy Patterson-
you heard about her?

533
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,900
Impossible not to.

534
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Grandpa Hal told that story
a million times.

535
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
Crazy lady that came
into the store,

536
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,800
bought the rope that
she hung herself with.

537
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,200
And your grandpa was the one
that sold it to her?

538
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,200
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

539
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,900
She didn't believe
him, either.

540
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,700
- What do you mean?
- She came back in

541
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,000
after buying the rope, asking
all these weird questions.

542
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,300
Questions like what?

543
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,800
Same ones you're asking now.

544
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,600
Excuse me.

545
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,400
May I help you?

546
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,100
My name is Nancy Patterson,

547
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,200
and I think there's
been a mistake

548
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,800
on my husband's account.

549
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,800
What kind of mistake?

550
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,900
I don't recognize
one of the charges.

551
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,900
Let's take a look.

552
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,200
Patterson...

553
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,100
Huh...

554
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,200
That's your signature, right?

555
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,100
Oh, but that...
that's impossible.

556
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,600
How's that?

557
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,700
I've never set foot in this
store until this very day.

558
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,000
Maybe it just slipped your mind.

559
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,500
No, it didn't slip my mind!

560
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,200
- That can't be!
- I saw you myself,

561
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,500
miss, with these very eyes

562
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
wearing the same hat
you're wearing now.

563
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,200
Maybe you just forgot.

564
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,600
Yes.

565
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,200
Maybe.

566
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,000
Miss Patterson...

567
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,800
forgot your pen, too,

568
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,300
last time you were here.

569
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,400
It is yours, right?

570
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,600
The pen had the name

571
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,500
- "Drummond" on it?
- Yeah.

572
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,700
The cuckoo's nest.

573
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Wait, Drummond's
a mental hospital?

574
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,200
Over in Olney.
Closed down in the '80s.

575
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,400
My grandpa heard Mrs. Patterson
was kind of spacey, but...

576
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,600
apparently she was,
you know,

577
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,100
A week later
she was dead.

578
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,100
You were a nurse

579
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,900
at Drummond Mental
Hospital back in '62?

580
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
Head nurse,
over 30 years.

581
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,900
But Drummond's

582
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,800
been closed a long time.

583
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,500
We tracked down
the employment records.

584
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Hoped to find someone who might
know something about this woman.

585
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,000
I remember her
like it was yesterday.

586
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,400
You knew
Nancy Patterson?

587
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
No, not really.

588
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,900
I was working the front desk

589
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,200
when she came in,
claiming she was being followed.

590
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,900
Even had a pen
as proof of it.

591
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
So Nancy did
visit Drummond?

592
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,700
- Yes, she did.
- We think someone

593
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,100
associated with the hospital
might have killed her.

594
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,700
She said
she was being

595
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,100
followed, Edna?

596
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,700
Yes, that's what she said.

597
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,600
And she thought it was a patient

598
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,100
or someone
who worked at Drummond?

599
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,900
The only thing following Nancy
was her past.

600
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,300
I need to speak
to someone immediately.

601
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,100
Someone has been

602
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,600
following me,
pretending to be me.

603
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,700
Do I know you?

604
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,900
You're the spitting image
of her.

605
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,300
- Of-of who?
- Your mother.

606
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,100
- What? I, I don't understand.
- I was her nurse

607
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,600
- for years.
- Oh, no, you must be mistaken.

608
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,100
Um, my mother,
she died

609
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,400
in childbirth.

610
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,300
You never got the note,

611
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,600
- did you, Nancy?
- What note?

612
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
How did you know my name?

613
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
She left a note

614
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,700
addressed to "my dearest,
my butterfly. "

615
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,700
I'd always assumed
that was you.

616
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,200
It was you,

617
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
wasn't it?

618
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
What was my mother doing here?

619
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,500
No one told you?

620
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,800
Told me what?

621
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,700
T- told me what?!

622
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,800
Your mother was a patient here.

623
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,500
No, no, I told you
she died in childbirth.

624
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,200
You were so young, Nancy,
just a little girl...

625
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,300
You're lying!

626
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,900
If she's here, where?

627
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,300
Where is she?

628
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,700
I found her in the storeroom
one morning.

629
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,900
No...

630
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,100
She hung herself
from the rafters.

631
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,700
I never should've told her
like that.

632
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,100
I just couldn't believe

633
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
she didn't know
about her own mother.

634
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,800
Who died just like Nancy.

635
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,600
With a noose around her neck.

636
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,400
The suicide note Nancy's
granddaughter brought in

637
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,900
belonged to Nancy's mother.

638
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
Nancy must've took it
from the mental hospital.

639
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,600
She didn't.

640
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,700
Somebody else signed out
her mother's medical file.

641
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,000
Check out the signature.

642
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,300
Nancy Patterson, so?

643
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,700
That's not Nancy's handwriting.

644
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,800
You're saying
someone forged her signature?

645
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,400
Probably the same

646
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,000
somebody who forged the receipt

647
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,400
- at the hardware store.
- And guess who that was?

648
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,900
Annette, the housekeeper.

649
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,600
Handwriting's
a perfect match to this.

650
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,400
Locked door,
message on the typewriter,

651
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,200
noose in the attic...
she set it all up.

652
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,700
With one goal in mind.

653
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,800
Drive Nancy insane.

654
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,100
??? who had everything you didn't.

655
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,100
Nice big house, cute kid...

656
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,000
good-looking husband.

657
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,300
I was satisfied with my life.

658
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,200
Alone in your two-room
apartment?

659
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,900
Early '60s, a woman
was expected to marry,

660
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,000
have a family.

661
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,300
Wasn't in the cards
for some of us.

662
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,500
Maybe you
had your heart set

663
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,900
on someone in particular.

664
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,200
I told you.

665
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,700
Professor Patterson
was in love with his wife.

666
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,400
But if she wasn't

667
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,700
- in the picture...
- Who better

668
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
to fill her shoes...

669
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,000
than you?

670
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,900
He'd never think of me that way.

671
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,200
You were around the same age,
you and Nancy.

672
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,800
From similar neighborhoods.

673
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Very little difference
between you.

674
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,500
Except Nancy was beautiful.

675
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,200
I don't know if I could do it,

676
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
mopping floors for a woman

677
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,000
lucky enough to catch
a man like that.

678
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,800
You wouldn't have to, would you?

679
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,300
Women like you,
you take everything for granted.

680
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,700
- Women like me?
- You bat your eyelashes,

681
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,300
smile sweet,

682
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,000
get whatever you want.

683
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh, everything
comes easy, right?

684
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,100
Like it did with Nancy?

685
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,700
You thought you could
have her committed.

686
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,900
- Get her out of the way.
- Nonsense.

687
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,600
You knew about Drummond.

688
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,500
I don't know that place.

689
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,600
Who said it was a place?

690
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Oh, you went there.

691
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,700
Forged her signature,

692
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,200
signed out
her mother's file.

693
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Went to the hardware store, too.

694
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,600
It was for their own good.

695
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,400
Who? Rachel? Daniel?

696
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,700
That why you killed her?

697
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,100
- To protect them?
- That woman was dangerous.

698
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,800
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were here, ma'am.

699
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,600
Mrs. Patterson?

700
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,700
They put her away
because she

701
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,100
nearly killed me.

702
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,100
Locked me in a closet.

703
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,900
I was seven.

704
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,900
She left me a note.

705
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,100
And I just can't
help but think

706
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,700
is it happing to me?

707
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,900
Am I slipping?

708
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,200
Where's Rachel?

709
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,400
She woke up almost an hour ago.

710
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,700
Said the two of you

711
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,400
were going to play
hide-and-seek.

712
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,200
Rachel, sweetie?

713
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,800
Rachel?!

714
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,200
Rachel, sweetie?!

715
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,500
Rachel!

716
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,600
Ra... Rachel!

717
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,700
Help me!
Help me, please!

718
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,800
I'm so sorry.

719
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
I might've done a lot of things,

720
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,500
but I did not put that key
in her pocket.

721
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,700
You had nothing

722
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,900
to do with Rachel
being in that trunk?

723
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,200
I would never hurt
that little girl.

724
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,800
I wanted
to drive Nancy

725
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,800
from the house,
that was all, I swear.

726
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,900
A fragile woman
pushed to her death.

727
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,400
Someone I got to see.

728
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,900
I, uh...

729
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,000
I owe you an apology.

730
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,700
I know when you don't
get a "good-bye,"

731
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,400
or at least one
that makes sense,

732
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
it stays with you.

733
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,500
It stays either way.

734
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,200
Doesn't it, Detective?

735
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,400
Yeah.

736
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,500
It does.

737
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,600
I hoped it'd turn out
different for you.

738
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,700
Yeah, me, too.

739
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,400
My mother did say good-bye,

740
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
you know?

741
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
She did?

742
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,200
Yeah, I just didn't know it
at the time.

743
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,400
Are you crying, Mommy?

744
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,500
No.

745
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,400
If you're scared,
you can sleep here with me.

746
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,700
Oh...

747
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
You are my very best
little girl.

748
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,200
You know that, right?

749
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
I'll do anything to protect you.

750
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,600
Anything,
and I want you

751
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,800
to remember that no matter what,

752
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,700
Mommy loves you
very, very much.

753
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
I love you too, Mommy.

754
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,500
Wait!

755
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,600
Lookit, for you.

756
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,900
For me?

757
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,900
Oh, and Rachel has red hair.

758
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,600
Like your mommy.

759
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,100
Rachel, where did
you get this paper?

760
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,100
This is the page I was
missing- my poetry.

761
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,500
Where did you get it?

762
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,300
It was in Daddy's things.

763
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,400
In Daddy's things?

764
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,300
Where?

765
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,200
In the attic.

766
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,100
You still have
that drawing?

767
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,300
Of course.

768
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,800
I never threw it out.

769
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,700
I'd forgotten
what she said

770
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,700
to me that night until now-

771
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,400
that I was her very
best little girl.

772
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,100
You sure it was Nancy's poem
on the back of that paper?

773
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,400
That's what my mother said.

774
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,000
It was hers.

775
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,300
"Hollow.

776
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,300
"No escape
from the dark.

777
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,400
I sit. "

778
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
"Alone in empty rooms. "

779
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,400
Poetry ain't really my thing,
but I got to admit...

780
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
this one got to me.

781
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,000
It was
translated

782
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,600
into seven languages.

783
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,800
Critics said
it was infused

784
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,200
with your wife's spirit.

785
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,900
It was.
I dedicated it to her.

786
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,700
Didn't really see you as
the type to write like this.

787
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,800
- What do you mean?
- Well, this poem

788
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
is about...

789
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,900
frailty,

790
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,100
people on the fringes,
lost hope.

791
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,500
Nancy knew a lot about that.

792
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Didn't she?

793
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,600
Uneducated,
orphaned by her mother,

794
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,000
widowed,

795
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,500
raising a kid
on her own.

796
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
She didn't have
an easy time of it.

797
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,500
The worst part is

798
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,400
she never got the credit
she deserved.

799
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm afraid I'm not following.

800
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,800
This...

801
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,600
was infused
with your wife's spirit

802
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,500
'cause she wrote the damn thing.

803
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,900
That's preposterous.

804
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,600
Then what was
Nancy's original

805
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,000
doing in the attic
in your desk?

806
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
It's not Nancy's original.

807
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,700
It's mine.

808
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,600
You didn't use a typewriter.

809
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,400
Remember, the muse and all?

810
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,500
She, she typed it for me.

811
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,800
You son of a bitch,

812
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,500
she's the one who should be
tting behind that desk

813
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,100
- and you know it.
- Nonsense.

814
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,600
You had
a deadline;

815
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,700
your career was at stake;

816
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,400
and you couldn't write
a thing, could you?

817
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,600
Who better to steal from
than the real talent living

818
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,900
- in your house?
- She stole from me!

819
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,300
That's what you told
yourself,

820
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,400
- how you slept at night.
- You made her out to be nuts

821
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,500
so you could steal her work
and make it your own.

822
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,500
You got poor, dumb, lovelorn
Annette in on the plan, too.

823
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,800
It's a perfect solution.

824
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,000
Nancy's daughter

825
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,300
spent her entire life afraid
she might go crazy, too;

826
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,900
beating herself up,
thinking she was the one

827
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,600
who pushed her mother
over the edge.

828
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,800
But it was you.

829
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,000
I was so desperate.

830
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,100
People expected
so much from me.

831
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,700
I had no choice!

832
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,800
Why your wife?

833
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Why steal from her?

834
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,600
Had to be other writers
around, other students.

835
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
You still don't get it, do you?

836
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,100
Get what?

837
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,100
How good Nancy was.

838
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,200
Nance?

839
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,900
Nancy?

840
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,300
Daniel.

841
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Nancy.

842
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,900
- What are you doing up here? 
- I'm confused.

843
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,100
I know.
You need rest.

844
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,800
- Come to bed. 
- I'm confused about who you are.

845
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,700
- What?
- Only a monster

846
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,500
would use this
against me.

847
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,600
You're the one
who's lost his mind.

848
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,100
You shouldn't
have come up here.

849
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,200
You took my words.

850
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,000
- You took me. 
- You know what my
first professor said about me?

851
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
He said my pen must have
been touched by the gods.

852
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,800
He said my potential
was unlimited.

853
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,300
- What's wrong with you, Daniel? 
- He was wrong.

854
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,600
All I had was potential,
nothing more.

855
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,500
I have craft

856
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
and diligence and a PhD,

857
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,900
and it's amounted to
a thousand pages of mediocrity.

858
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,400
I'm going downstairs
to Rachel.

859
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,500
As I toiled in the dark,
where were the gods then?

860
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Where were they?

861
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,600
With a secretary.

862
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,100
This is genius.

863
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,400
Written by a daughter
of the state?

864
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,700
- That's what you hate, isn't it?
- You couldn't have done this.

865
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,600
You couldn't have
written this, not you!

866
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,200
But I did.

867
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,600
I did write it, Daniel.

868
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,400
No, you didn't. I did.

869
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,200
It's mine. You
stole it from me.

870
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,400
My pen has been touched
by the hand of God.

871
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,300
Oh!

872
