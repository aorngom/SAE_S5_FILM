00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,620\par
May 20,1989\par
\par
3\par
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:16,021\par
<i>"Bust a move" by Young MC.</i>\par
\par
4\par
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,710\par
Big smile.\par
\par
5\par
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,070\par
I can't wait to be alone with you.\par
\par
6\par
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,470\par
You say that to all the girls.\par
\par
7\par
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,380\par
Just the hot ones.\par
\par
8\par
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,560\par
Let's keep those mitts up\par
where I can see them, Cole.\par
\par
9\par
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,790\par
Yes, siree.\par
\par
10\par
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,130\par
Do I smell alcohol  ?\par
\par
11\par
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,710\par
Not on me.\par
\par
12\par
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,410\par
I swear on my mom. I don't\par
even like the taste of it.\par
\par
13\par
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,480\par
Maybe we should take a walk.\par
\par
14\par
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,540\par
He's in good hands, Mr. Burke.\par
Got my eye on him.\par
\par
15\par
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,260\par
And McKinley High's\par
new prom queen is :\par
\par
16\par
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:19,961\par
Felicia Grant.\par
\par
17\par
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,860\par
I wish this night would never end.\par
\par
18\par
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,270\par
Ms. Jacobs, Principal Burke,\par
this is Detective Rush.\par
\par
19\par
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,970\par
I know you're busy here,\par
so from\par
\par
20\par
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:24,371\par
one overworked civil servant\par
to another,\par
\par
21\par
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,960\par
I want to thank you for your time.\par
\par
22\par
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,190\par
What's up  ?\par
\par
23\par
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,230\par
Ms. Jacobs is faculty advisor to the\par
prom committee at McKinley this year.\par
\par
24\par
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,160\par
Citywide budget cuts are forcing\par
us to get creative with a theme.\par
\par
25\par
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,700\par
I was sorting through some\par
decorations stored in the basement,\par
\par
26\par
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,160\par
hoping to recycle some.\par
\par
27\par
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,330\par
Found a disposable camera\par
in a box from the '89 prom.\par
\par
28\par
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,760\par
We had it developed.\par
\par
29\par
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,660\par
Thought it'd be fun to see what\par
the styles looked like back then.\par
\par
30\par
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,190\par
Surprised the photos came out.\par
\par
31\par
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,291\par
Us, too,\par
\par
32\par
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,580\par
and then we noticed that\par
she was in almost every shot.\par
\par
33\par
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,160\par
So who was she ?\par
\par
34\par
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,440\par
Felicia Grant,\par
\par
35\par
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,641\par
killed by a hit-and-run the same night\par
she was crowned prom queen.\par
\par
36\par
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,820\par
Never found who did it.\par
\par
37\par
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820\par
I pulled the Accident\par
Investigation Division file.\par
\par
38\par
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,660\par
The original detective figured\par
she was hit\par
\par
39\par
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,080\par
by a drunk driver\par
a few miles from the school.\par
\par
40\par
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,430\par
Prom queen didn't have a ride  ?\par
\par
41\par
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,150\par
According to the file, her boyfriend\par
was "too drunk to drive home."\par
\par
42\par
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,880\par
Cole Austen. That, I can attest to.\par
\par
43\par
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880\par
So you were there  ?\par
\par
44\par
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,880\par
I was assistant principal back then ;\par
chaperoned prom.\par
\par
45\par
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,710\par
We were all shocked.\par
\par
46\par
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,170\par
Felicia handed Cole\par
off to friends at 11:30.\par
\par
47\par
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,020\par
Said she'd catch a ride.\par
\par
48\par
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,380\par
- An hour later she was dead.\par
- No one saw her leave  ?\par
\par
49\par
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,120\par
I would have been there, but a student\par
fell off the bandstand.\par
\par
50\par
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,830\par
Sent most of the night in the ER.\par
\par
51\par
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,440\par
Is this the last photo  ?\par
\par
52\par
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,700\par
Outside the gym.\par
\par
53\par
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,870\par
Everyone always thought that Felicia\par
ended up walking home from the school.\par
\par
54\par
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,330\par
But look at the clock.\par
\par
55\par
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,890\par
Its says 12:15.\par
\par
56\par
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,690\par
Motorist spotted her body\par
on the side of the road\par
\par
57\par
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,130\par
about three miles from the school;\par
\par
58\par
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,720\par
called it in at 12:30.\par
\par
59\par
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,530\par
There's no way she could have\par
walked three miles in 15 minutes.\par
\par
60\par
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,850\par
Someone had to give her a ride.\par
\par
61\par
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,240\par
Whoever took this picture\par
was the last to see her alive.\par
\par
62\par
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,980\par
Or her killer.\par
\par
63\par
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,970\par

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,820\par
Almost paradise\par
\par
66\par
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,820\par
Felicia Grant, 17,\par
\par
67\par
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:07,421\par
hit by a car\par
on Old York Road,\par
\par
68\par
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,590\par
walking home\par
from the prom in '89.\par
\par
69\par
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,790\par
Yeah, broken neck, hip,\par
and pelvis.\par
\par
70\par
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,120\par
Multiple skull fractures\par
and internal bleeding.\par
\par
71\par
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,930\par
Whoever hit her\par
must have been hauling.\par
\par
72\par
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,120\par
I've seen a car going\par
30 do some real damage.\par
\par
73\par
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,950\par
It's all about where you get hit,\par
not how.\par
\par
74\par
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,870\par
AID tagged it as a\par
hit-and-run by a drunk driver.\par
\par
\lang1036 75\par
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,470\par
Kids from the prom alibi'd out.\par
\par
76\par
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,260\par
Most went to an afterparty together.\par
\par
77\par
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,820\par
The last photo suggests\par
someone she knew picked her up.\par
\par
78\par
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,540\par
- Talk to the parents  ?\par
- Father passed away.\par
\par
79\par
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,240\par
Mother remarried, moved to Miami.\par
Trying to find her.\par
\par
80\par
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,870\par
I don't remember dressing\par
this badly in high school.\par
\par
81\par
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,140\par
You mean compared to now  ?\par
\par
82\par
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,350\par
Well, how'd you guys do it\par
back in the day, Will  ?\par
\par
83\par
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,060\par
What, did Moses just hold a candle\par
while you guys danced  ?\par
\par
84\par
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,890\par
Had our prom at the Bellevue Hotel.\par
\par
85\par
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,570\par
Took a lovely, young betty\par
named Pennie Joe McVicker.\par
\par
86\par
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,130\par
So fine, make a blind man see.\par
\par
87\par
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,580\par
You ever wonder\par
what happened to her  ?\par
\par
88\par
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,460\par
Married, five kids, twice my size.\par
\par
89\par
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,590\par
What about you, boss  ?\par
\par
90\par
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,010\par
I quit school before the prom.\par
Went in the Navy.\par
\par
91\par
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,640\par
- What about you, Lil  ?\par
- Never went. Not my thing.\par
\par
92\par
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,450\par
Well, I was prom king, but\par
I lost my crown when I...\par
\par
93\par
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,660\par
Well, when I got caught streaking.\par
\par
94\par
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,250\par
You streaked at your prom  ?\par
\par
95\par
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,370\par
Yeah. Mrs. Kaye saw my junk\par
and fainted.\par
\par
96\par
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,140\par
Well, AID found silver paint chips\par
on the dress.\par
\par
97\par
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,700\par
Assigned checked all the body shops\par
within a 20-mile radius.\par
\par
98\par
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:20,801\par
Nothing ever surfaced.\par
\par
99\par
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,530\par
Well, whoever did it might\par
have waited a few years\par
\par
100\par
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,060\par
till the heat cooled and\par
then fixed their ride.\par
\par
101\par
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,070\par
Reinterview Felicia's inner circle.\par
\par
102\par
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,370\par
Find out who took that last photo.\par
\par
103\par
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,840\par
Updating your Facebook page  ?\par
\par
104\par
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,240\par
No, just an old narcotics case.\par
\par
105\par
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,960\par
Gonna talk to Suzie Hill,\par
\par
106\par
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:41,661\par
the prom queen's best friend.\par
Want to come  ?\par
\par
107\par
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,260\par
Sure. Suzie looks fun.\par
\par
108\par
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,100\par
My oldest, Tess, is at\par
cheerleading practice.\par
\par
109\par
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,940\par
I'm going to need\par
to grab her soon.\par
\par
110\par
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,430\par
Hey, how many times do I have to\par
tell you, no running in the house  ?!\par
\par
111\par
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,780\par
Anything stand out to you\par
about this photo, Suzie  ?\par
\par
112\par
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,650\par
Sorry.\par
\par
113\par
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:08,951\par
Seeing Felicia brings back\par
a lot of memories.\par
\par
114\par
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,070\par
I don't know why she was still there.\par
\par
115\par
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,470\par
The hool had a strict midnight curfew.\par
\par
116\par
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,800\par
Didn't you wonder where she went\par
after prom  ?\par
\par
117\par
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,050\par
Thought Felicia caught a ride ;\par
we'd all hook up later at the party.\par
\par
118\par
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,020\par
Best friends and you don't\par
even check up on each other  ?\par
\par
119\par
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,570\par
We were both sort of caught\par
up in our dates that night.\par
\par
120\par
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,880\par
If I knew she needed me,\par
I would have been there.\par
\par
121\par
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,420\par
When was the last time you saw her  ?\par
\par
122\par
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,200\par
When she won prom queen.\par
\par
123\par
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,940\par
I was so happy for her.\par
\par
124\par
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,340\par
When we were little girls,\par
we used to dress up,\par
\par
125\par
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,900\par
act like we were queens\par
and, now, she was one.\par
\par
126\par
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,010\par
All sugar, no spice  ?\par
\par
127\par
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,260\par
She could throw down.\par
\par
128\par
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,120\par
Felicia wanted something,\par
she went for it. She always got it.\par
\par
129\par
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,250\par
Probably made a few enemies, too  ?\par
\par
130\par
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,680\par
She was popular.\par
People's feelings get hurt.\par
\par
131\par
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,100\par
We we all so young and\par
thoughtless back then.\par
\par
132\par
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:56,101\par
<i>"Don't you forget about me"\par
par Simple Minds.</i>\par
\par
133\par
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,030\par
Hey, girl.\par
\par
134\par
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,420\par
You know Lee.\par
\par
135\par
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,500\par
Love that dress on you.\par
\par
136\par
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,790\par
I'm going to go grab a drink.\par
\par
137\par
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,440\par
Coolio. I'm good.\par
\par
138\par
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,750\par
I can't believe you brought\par
that weirdo,Lee Mavoides.\par
\par
139\par
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,930\par
Easy for you to say.\par
\par
140\par
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,790\par
You weren't dumped two\par
minutes before prom,\par
\par
141\par
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,110\par
- Miss Has-Her-Whole-Life Planned-Out.\par
- Whatever.\par
\par
142\par
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,740\par
I got to know him in art\par
class. He's not that bad.\par
\par
143\par
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,310\par
Has that whole Christian Slater\par
thing going on.\par
\par
144\par
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,500\par
I got your letter.\par
\par
145\par
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,790\par
What'd you say  ?\par
\par
146\par
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,920\par
I got your letter,\par
and I like you, too.\par
\par
147\par
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,600\par
He fell for it !\par
\par
148\par
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,780\par
What a loser. Why don't you go home\par
and hump your pillow, nerd !\par
\par
149\par
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,120\par
You just wanted to screw with me !\par
\par
150\par
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,740\par
What a loser !\par
\par
151\par
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,350\par
I haven't thought of Corky in years.\par
\par
152\par
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,180\par
Everyone always picked on him,\par
but I think that night was it for him.\par
\par
153\par
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,580\par
- How so  ?\par
- We never saw him again.\par
\par
154\par
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,190\par
He was so mad at Felicia,\par
\par
155\par
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:02,391\par
thought she made a fool of him.\par
\par
156\par
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,260\par
Where were you after the prom  ?\par
\par
157\par
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,960\par
Lee took me up to Fairmount Park\par
before we hit the party, and...\par
\par
158\par
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,020\par
I was right. He was sexy.\par
\par
159\par
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,430\par
My daughter thinks I'm such\par
a prude. If she only knew.\par
\par
160\par
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,500\par
Hi. May I help you  ?\par
\par
161\par
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,960\par
We're looking for a Corky Mazer.\par
\par
162\par
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,770\par
Last guy that called me that had\par
to pick his teeth off the floor.\par
\par
163\par
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,130\par
I'm not that guy anymore.\par
\par
164\par
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,400\par
Easy there, Whitey Chan.\par
\par
165\par
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,980\par
We're here to talk\par
about Felicia Grant.\par
\par
166\par
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,590\par
Felicia Grant  ?\par
\par
167\par
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,940\par
That's ancient history.\par
Barely knew her.\par
\par
168\par
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,180\par
Heard she made you look\par
like a fool on prom night.\par
\par
169\par
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,930\par
Yeah, that was the\par
worst night of my life.\par
\par
170\par
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,000\par
I'm glad I got far away\par
from that hellhole.\par
\par
171\par
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,770\par
Sounds more\par
like you were driven away.\par
\par
172\par
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,650\par
I decided I wasn't going\par
to be a victim anymore.\par
\par
173\par
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,950\par
So maybe you decided to poured\par
yourself a nice,hot cup of revenge  ?\par
\par
174\par
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,500\par
No. I joined the Army\par
the next morning.\par
\par
175\par
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,480\par
Saw the world. It gave me meaning,\par
purpose.\par
\par
176\par
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,190\par
It gave me "Kara-te."\par
\par
177\par
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,360\par
Or a way to escape a murder charge.\par
\par
178\par
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,670\par
"Murder"  ?\par
\par
179\par
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,500\par
Well, I thought some drunk hit her.\par
\par
180\par
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,390\par
You were the president\par
of the AV department.\par
\par
181\par
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,900\par
Took a lot of photos that night.\par
\par
182\par
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,430\par
I didn't take that one.\par
\par
183\par
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,040\par
And whoever did didn't\par
know what they were doing.\par
\par
184\par
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,500\par
What kind of car did you drive\par
to the prom, Evan  ?\par
\par
185\par
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,650\par
I didn't drive, okay  ?\par
\par
186\par
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,190\par
My mom dropped me off\par
and picked me up.\par
\par
187\par
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,780\par
You had it hard in high school.\par
\par
188\par
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,450\par
KiKi kicked your ass.\par
\par
189\par
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,680\par
Felicia humiliated you.\par
\par
190\par
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,480\par
I had lots of problems,okay ?\par
\par
191\par
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,540\par
You know, but I realized that night\par
that I wasn't the only one.\par
\par
192\par
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,830\par
<i>Ah, come on, baby.</i>\par
\par
193\par
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,400\par
<i>Oh, you're so hot.</i>\par
\par
194\par
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,690\par
This doesn't feel right.\par
\par
195\par
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,860\par
Really  ?\par
\par
196\par
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,210\par
'Cause the seats are real vinyl.\par
\par
197\par
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,570\par
Maybe you're just sitting on\par
the belt buckle or something.\par
\par
198\par
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,020\par
No, no, I mean us, this.\par
\par
199\par
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,560\par
Going all the way.\par
\par
200\par
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,640\par
I want it to be special.\par
\par
201\par
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,970\par
Babe, it is special.\par
\par
202\par
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,110\par
You're with me, the Colster.\par
\par
203\par
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,320\par
I want to go find Corky\par
and apologize.\par
\par
204\par
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,340\par
Corky  ?\par
\par
205\par
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,400\par
What are you talking about  ?\par
\par
206\par
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,460\par
I waited two years for this.\par
\par
207\par
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,810\par
- Look, I even made us a mix tape.\par
- I want to go inside. Right now.\par
\par
208\par
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,320\par
You can't just leave me like this.\par
\par
209\par
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,020\par
Come on. At least check the mic.\par
\par
210\par
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,740\par
Get off !\par
\par
211\par
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:31,941\par
<i>"Angel" by Aerosmith.</i>\par
\par
212\par
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,200\par
Come on, Felic !\par
\par
213\par
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,970\par
I mean, there wasn't a more\par
entitled guy on the planet.\par
\par
214\par
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,330\par
How come you guys aren't talking\par
to him  ?\par
\par
215\par
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,880\par
Cole's alibi checked out back\par
in the day. So did his car.\par
\par
216\par
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,760\par
Which one  ? His dad owned one of the\par
biggest car dealerships in Philly.\par
\par
217\par
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,380\par
Cole drove a new car every month.\par
\par
218\par
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,060\par
Hey, Dad.\par
\par
219\par
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,750\par
I went to the store.\par
I figured you could use a...\par
\par
220\par
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,500\par
Hey, sis.\par
\par
221\par
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,910\par
You've got to be kidding me.\par
\par
222\par
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,670\par
- Lilly...\par
- No. No !\par
\par
223\par
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,990\par
Lilly ! Lilly, wait !\par
\par
224\par
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,020\par
Cole Austen.\par
\par
225\par
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,730\par
Cole Austen  ?\par
\par
226\par
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,060\par
One and only.\par
\par
227\par
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,510\par
Far cry from your dad's\par
big car dealership,huh ?\par
\par
228\par
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,760\par
This gig's just temporary.\par
\par
229\par
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,340\par
Waiting on a call from McKinley High for\par
an assistant football coaching position.\par
\par
230\par
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,680\par
Sounds promising.\par
\par
231\par
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,210\par
Kind of a legend there.\par
\par
232\par
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,770\par
Just waiting to get the money right.\par
\par
233\par
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,730\par
You were the '89 prom king at McKinley.\par
\par
234\par
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,220\par
Damn straight.\par
\par
235\par
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,000\par
It was the greatest\par
night of my life,man.\par
\par
236\par
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,170\par
Till that...\par
\par
237\par
00:11:58,171 --> 00:11:59,071\par
till the morning.\par
\par
238\par
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,930\par
- Felicia Grant  ?\par
- Yeah. That was my girl.\par
\par
239\par
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,820\par
If she was your "girl," why'd you leave\par
her alone at the end of the night, Cole  ?\par
\par
240\par
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,690\par
I drank a little too much clear\par
\par
241\par
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,020\par
and I spent the rest of the night\par
praying to the porcelain gods.\par
\par
242\par
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,790\par
Last time you saw Felicia  ?\par
\par
243\par
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,660\par
I don't remember. Everything after\par
we won prom king and queen\par
\par
244\par
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:17,550\par
- is just a blur.\par
- That's pretty convenient.\par
\par
245\par
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,820\par
Felicia was hit and\par
killed by a silver car.\par
\par
246\par
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,120\par
Kind of like your Mustang.\par
\par
247\par
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,980\par
I'd never hurt Felicia. I loved her.\par
\par
248\par
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,720\par
We were going to go\par
to Penn State together.\par
\par
249\par
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,730\par
We heard you were macking\par
some serious moves\par
\par
250\par
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,431\par
on the queen out in the parking lot,\par
\par
251\par
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,160\par
but she just wasn't feeling the king.\par
\par
252\par
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,760\par
Felicia, she was just nervous, man.\par
\par
253\par
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,620\par
All she needed was a little reassuring.\par
\par
254\par
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,270\par
Felicia !\par
\par
255\par
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,800\par
Are you really looking for Corky  ?\par
\par
256\par
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,930\par
What you did was mean.\par
\par
257\par
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,340\par
Look, forget him.\par
\par
258\par
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,510\par
Look, I think I know\par
what's really bugging you.\par
\par
259\par
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,560\par
- You do  ?\par
- Yeah.\par
\par
260\par
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,540\par
You're just worried we're going\par
to get to State,\par
\par
261\par
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,420\par
I'm going to be smothered\par
in hotness\par
\par
262\par
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:58,321\par
and end up hitting it\par
with a bunch of hot chicks.\par
\par
263\par
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,100\par
- No, Cole, that's not...\par
- Not gonna happen.\par
\par
264\par
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,090\par
I could have played ball anywhere,\par
but I chose to be with you.\par
\par
265\par
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,820\par
You ever wonder if you're...\par
\par
266\par
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,940\par
a good person  ?\par
\par
267\par
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,710\par
What do you mean  ?\par
\par
268\par
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,350\par
I've been thinking about this stuff\par
a lot lately.\par
\par
269\par
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,070\par
After high school...\par
\par
270\par
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,640\par
who knows what lies ahead of us  ?\par
\par
271\par
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,890\par
I do. More awesomeness.\par
\par
272\par
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,610\par
The '80s ruled, but the '90s\par
are gonna rock.\par
\par
273\par
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,270\par
You and me, we're going to be\par
king and queen of Happy Valley.\par
\par
274\par
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,370\par
Felicia  ?\par
\par
275\par
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,860\par
Someone said you were crying in\par
the parking lot. Everything okay  ?\par
\par
276\par
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,080\par
Everything's cool.\par
\par
277\par
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,680\par
Roll,we'll get up\par
with you guys in a bit.\par
\par
278\par
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,670\par
We want to hear it from Felicia.\par
\par
279\par
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,490\par
You can shut your\par
freaky dink.\par
\par
280\par
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,530\par
Everything's fine. Just go.\par
\par
281\par
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,690\par
- What is it with you and that guy  ?\par
- I don't know. He creeps me out.\par
\par
282\par
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,170\par
Do you want me to kick his ass  ?\par
\par
283\par
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660\par
<i>Prom Court, please report\par
o the stage.</i>\par
\par
284\par
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,400\par
Come on, babe.\par
\par
285\par
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,330\par
It's showtime.\par
\par
286\par
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,820\par
Maybe...\par
\par
287\par
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,210\par
if I hadn't drank so much\par
that night,\par
\par
288\par
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,920\par
Felicia'd still be alive today.\par
\par
289\par
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,420\par
Who was this Lee guy  ?\par
\par
290\par
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,100\par
Lee Mavoides.\par
\par
291\par
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,580\par
He's some punk-ass freak.\par
\par
292\par
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,460\par
He have some kind of history\par
with Felicia  ?\par
\par
293\par
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,420\par
In his wet dreaMs.\par
\par
294\par
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,130\par
He was obsessed.\par
\par
295\par
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,240\par
He was always staring at her.\par
\par
296\par
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,070\par
That's why Felicia\par
was skeeved out by him.\par
\par
297\par
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,940\par
What happened to your old Mustang, Cole  ?\par
\par
298\par
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,980\par
I still got her.\par
\par
299\par
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,360\par
Cops checked her out back in the day.\par
\par
300\par
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,930\par
Yeah, well, I'd like to\par
get a second opinion.\par
\par
301\par
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,210\par
Take me back to my cell.\par
\par
302\par
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,770\par
I'm not sitting with this chota.\par
\par
303\par
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,990\par
Sit down and shut the hell up.\par
\par
304\par
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,530\par
Why don't you take your blue Nazi ass\par
back to Philly  ?\par
\par
305\par
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,330\par
I ain't got nothing to say to you.\par
\par
306\par
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,720\par
I got this. Why don't\par
you go grab some coffee  ?\par
\par
307\par
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,100\par
Yeah  ? You real tough with that tin.\par
\par
308\par
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,450\par
I don't need no badge to deal\par
with a little man like you.\par
\par
309\par
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,170\par
Its good to see you, man.\par
\par
310\par
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,630\par
\'bfQue pasa, Hector  ?\par
\par
311\par
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,510\par
T ? sabes. Viviendo como un rey.\par
\par
312\par
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,190\par
So I hear.\par
\par
313\par
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,540\par
Yeah,you got big ears.\par
\par
314\par
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,480\par
Yeah, so do these guards.\par
\par
315\par
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,060\par
It's not their ears I'm worried about.\par
\par
316\par
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,150\par
You know,bad for biz if anyone\par
finds out\par
\par
317\par
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:34,651\par
I grew up in Francesville\par
with a cop.\par
\par
318\par
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,330\par
Yeah, how's Tati  ?\par
\par
319\par
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,110\par
Thanks to you, she's good.\par
\par
320\par
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,360\par
Just gave us another niece.\par
\par
321\par
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,100\par
But that ain't why you here.\par
\par
322\par
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,840\par
Look, there's a new fish on your block.\par
\par
323\par
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,560\par
He likes to sing.\par
\par
324\par
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,440\par
You're his favorite song.\par
\par
325\par
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,030\par
And what you care so much\par
about me for  ?\par
\par
326\par
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,850\par
I wouldn't want to see your nieces\par
growing up without their t\'edo.\par
\par
327\par
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,660\par
Sounds to me like you want\par
someone to catch a cold.\par
\par
328\par
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,350\par
It's going around.\par
\par
329\par
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,040\par
But, I mean,\par
how you handle the jabber...\par
\par
330\par
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,770\par
- that's your business.\par
- Business, that is what I'm worried about.\par
\par
331\par
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,370\par
And this coming back on me.\par
\par
332\par
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,080\par
I get that.\par
\par
333\par
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,200\par
All right. Suppose...\par
\par
334\par
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,420\par
Suppose this-this fish,hmm...\par
\par
335\par
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,400\par
gets made out to be\par
a snitch in the yard  ?\par
\par
336\par
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,980\par
Then... he's everybody's problem.\par
\par
337\par
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,420\par
Game over. Kiss of the bitch.\par
\par
338\par
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,640\par
You know what I'm saying, pap  ?\par
\par
339\par
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,800\par
Starting to think you\par
weren't going to show.\par
\par
340\par
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,829\par
You want to order something  ?\par
I'm buying.\par
\par
341\par
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,610\par
I already ate.\par
\par
342\par
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,940\par
Check this out.\par
\par
343\par
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,379\par
Do you remember that suit  ?\par
\par
344\par
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,490\par
I was always so psyched when you got a\par
new one 'cause that meant I got yours.\par
\par
345\par
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,699\par
That day was so much fun.\par
\par
346\par
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,260\par
The last time I saw you,there\par
was a warrant out for your arrest.\par
\par
347\par
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,119\par
Am I sitting across\par
from a wanted fugitive  ?\par
\par
348\par
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,320\par
I cut a deal with the D. A. in New York.\par
\par
349\par
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,870\par
- Managed to avoid jail time.\par
- It's still a felony, right  ?\par
\par
350\par
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,360\par
I know that you promised Dad that\par
you were going to hear me out.\par
\par
351\par
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,500\par
I want to thank you.\par
\par
352\par
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,829\par
I don't have a lot of time, so...\par
\par
353\par
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,560\par
Get to the point, right.\par
\par
354\par
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,329\par
I've been lost a long time, Lil.\par
\par
355\par
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,810\par
Made a lot of mistakes,but\par
I'm ready to make a change.\par
\par
356\par
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,130\par
- Christina...\par
- I'm staying at the Grand Inn right now.\par
\par
357\par
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,029\par
Not as fancy as it sounds.\par
\par
358\par
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,549\par
It's a flophouse.\par
\par
359\par
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,970\par
It's cheap.\par
\par
360\par
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,410\par
But I'm looking to move.\par
\par
361\par
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,140\par
Somewhere more permanent. Near family.\par
\par
362\par
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,939\par
I want to settle down.\par
\par
363\par
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,810\par
Meet a good guy.\par
\par
364\par
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,629\par
What about you, Lil  ?\par
\par
365\par
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,450\par
You know me.\par
\par
366\par
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,790\par
- Working.\par
- Yeah, working.\par
\par
367\par
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,930\par
Yeah.\par
\par
368\par
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,910\par
kind of...\par
\par
369\par
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,339\par
Makes it kind of hard to get\par
a rental lease with a record,\par
\par
370\par
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,409\par
so I was hoping you could...\par
\par
371\par
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,470\par
co-sign for me.\par
\par
372\par
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,199\par
Yeah, shouldn't have guessed\par
that this was a social visit.\par
\par
373\par
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,309\par
You always want something.\par
\par
374\par
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,520\par
I know.\par
\par
375\par
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,140\par
You got no reason to believe me.\par
\par
376\par
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,610\par
But I need you, Lil.\par
\par
377\par
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,229\par
I don't... I don't know what to say.\par
\par
378\par
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,789\par
Honestly,every time you come\par
around,it's like a hurricane hit town.\par
\par
379\par
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,009\par
- Lilly...\par
- No, Christina.\par
\par
380\par
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,249\par
I promised Dad that I would talk to you,\par
\par
381\par
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,999\par
but I-I can't commit to anything else.\par
\par
382\par
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,630\par
I mean,maybe it's better that you find\par
someone else to clean up after you.\par
\par
383\par
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,220\par
I don't have anyone else.\par
\par
384\par
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,750\par
I wish I could I trust you, Christina.\par
\par
385\par
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,010\par
I really do.\par
\par
386\par
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,299\par
What are y'all laughing at  ?\par
\par
387\par
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,310\par
Look at you, Slick Willy !\par
\par
388\par
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,779\par
How  ?\par
\par
389\par
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,160\par
Called your old high school and said I\par
needed pictures for your retirement party.\par
\par
390\par
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,690\par
Still, this is the girl that\par
brought eyesight to the blind  ?\par
\par
391\par
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,659\par
And  ?\par
\par
392\par
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,109\par
And... we located Felicia's mother.\par
\par
393\par
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,989\par
Still had a few of her\par
daughter's things in storage.\par
\par
394\par
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,070\par
Look what I found in\par
her sophomore yearbook.\par
\par
395\par
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,759\par
"What do you see when\par
you look in the mirror,\par
\par
396\par
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,819\par
because I'm looking right\par
througyou and it's not pretty."\par
\par
397\par
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,769\par
Signed Lee Mavoides.\par
\par
398\par
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,949\par
Tracked him down to Morgan's Restaurant.\par
\par
399\par
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,460\par
He's the head chef.\par
\par
400\par
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,770\par
Well,let's hope his cooking's\par
better than his poetry.\par
\par
401\par
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,230\par
Pig in the pen.\par
\par
402\par
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,580\par
Yo,Mota  ?\par
\par
403\par
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,270\par
What's happening,bro ?\par
\par
404\par
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,690\par
Tag. You're it,bitch.\par
That's for my mom.\par
\par
405\par
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,260\par
Thanks.\par
\par
406\par
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,220\par
Buena suerte.\par
\par
407\par
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,399\par
Felicia Grant...\par
\par
408\par
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,999\par
killed on prom night.\par
\par
409\par
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,229\par
Right.\par
\par
410\par
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,980\par
You know,don't really remember.\par
\par
411\par
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,370\par
High school was a long time ago.\par
\par
412\par
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,810\par
Maybe this will help jog your memory.\par
\par
413\par
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,030\par
Back when you were busy\par
looking right through her.\par
\par
414\par
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,280\par
Now that's embarrassing.\par
\par
415\par
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,239\par
What kind of car did\par
you drive to the prom ?\par
\par
416\par
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,969\par
- It was my dad's Chrysler,I think.\par
- What color was it ?\par
\par
417\par
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,369\par
I don't know,gray.\par
Look,man,I'm in the middle...\par
\par
418\par
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,560\par
Put the knife down when\par
I'm talking to you,Emeril.\par
\par
419\par
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,139\par
Look,we used to be friends.\par
\par
420\par
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,969\par
High school started;\par
she became a cheerleader;\par
\par
421\par
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,799\par
and I became an afterthought.\par
\par
422\par
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,029\par
Bitter pill to swallow.\par
\par
423\par
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,719\par
Yeah,I wrote some mean\par
things in her yearbook,\par
\par
424\par
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,709\par
listened to a lot of Cowboy\par
Junkies and then I got over it.\par
\par
425\par
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,230\par
Some strange coincidence you ended up\par
going to the prom with her best friend ?\par
\par
426\par
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,109\par
Yeah, maybe I wanted to\par
get a rise out of Felicia.\par
\par
427\par
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,740\par
But I realized that she\par
really wasn't worth the drama.\par
\par
427\par
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:20,600\par
<i>"Suedehead" by Morrissey.</i>\par
\par
428\par
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,010\par
Didn't know you and Suzie were so close.\par
\par
429\par
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,749\par
You didn't even know we\par
all go to the same school.\par
\par
430\par
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,120\par
That's lame.\par
\par
431\par
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,800\par
Anyway I saw you on the dance floor.\par
\par
432\par
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560\par
You two make a cute couple.\par
\par
433\par
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,089\par
She's lucky to find a guy like you.\par
\par
434\par
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,269\par
Guys like me don't really fit\par
into your whole thing,Felicia.\par
\par
435\par
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,370\par
And what is my whole thing ?\par
\par
436\par
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,909\par
Don't be so modest.\par
\par
437\par
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,209\par
You're the queen of McKinley High.\par
\par
438\par
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,569\par
They even coroneted you.\par
\par
439\par
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,359\par
Hey,I'm trying to be nice right now.\par
\par
440\par
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,079\par
You don't have to be such a jackass.\par
\par
441\par
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,129\par
You came to talk to me.\par
\par
442\par
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,920\par
Yes,because we used to be friends.\par
\par
443\par
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,179\par
We used to make pizza and geek out\par
to old Twilight Zon. Remember ?\par
\par
444\par
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,479\par
I still like to make\par
pizzas and watch old TV.\par
\par
445\par
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,669\par
It was you that changed,Felicia.\par
\par
446\par
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,760\par
And now you've got the crown.\par
\par
447\par
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,099\par
You're just so above it all.\par
\par
448\par
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,499\par
If life's about being\par
liked,you win,okay ?\par
\par
449\par
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,529\par
Everybody loves you.\par
\par
450\par
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,780\par
No. No,they don't love me.\par
\par
451\par
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,319\par
They want to be me,or\par
they want to get with me,\par
\par
452\par
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,049\par
but they definitely don't love me.\par
\par
453\par
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,849\par
Love... said the girl who treated\par
high school like a contest.\par
\par
454\par
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,240\par
Lee,wait.\par
\par
455\par
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,370\par
You came to see if I was okay before.\par
\par
456\par
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,799\par
I figure that had to mean\par
you still cared... a little.\par
\par
457\par
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,969\par
Unlike the rest of your friends,\par
\par
458\par
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,060\par
I can tell you've been miserable.\par
\par
459\par
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,509\par
So,yes,I was worried.\par
\par
460\par
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,080\par
Thanks.\par
\par
461\par
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,940\par
You're the only one who noticed.\par
\par
462\par
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,830\par
I hate you,Felicia Grant!\par
\par
463\par
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,310\par
Suzie,wait!\par
\par
464\par
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,760\par
Suzie refused to even look at\par
me for the rest of the night.\par
\par
465\par
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,380\par
I think living in Felicia's\par
shadow kind of ruined her.\par
\par
466\par
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,499\par
Suzie said the two of you went\par
to Fairmount Park after the prom.\par
\par
467\par
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,119\par
No,she went to the afterparty.\par
\par
468\par
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,660\par
I smoked a couple bowls...\par
ended up at IHOP...\par
\par
469\par
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,810\par
alone.\par
\par
470\par
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,799\par
Scotty. What are you doing here ?\par
\par
471\par
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,870\par
Brought you some of those\par
pastelitos de coco y I le so much.\par
\par
472\par
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,309\par
In the middle of the afternoon ?\par
\par
473\par
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,630\par
Well,I had an interview nearby.\par
\par
474\par
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,760\par
What,a son can't bring his\par
own mother some pastries ?\par
\par
475\par
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,169\par
Of course. Thank\par
you,mijito. \'bfQuieres cafe ?\par
\par
476\par
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,080\par
Nah,I got to get back.\par
\par
477\par
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,889\par
Oh,honey,you can sit for ten minutes.\par
\par
478\par
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,280\par
- Come on,sit.\par
- No,Ma,I can't. I can't.\par
\par
479\par
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,620\par
Are you okay ?\par
\par
480\par
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,390\par
Yeah.\par
\par
481\par
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,370\par
Never better.\par
\par
482\par
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,060\par
I think she's about ready to spill.\par
\par
483\par
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,260\par
Scotty,my sister didn't\par
contact you,did she ?\par
\par
484\par
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,880\par
Christina ? No.\par
\par
485\par
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,100\par
She's back in town.\par
\par
486\par
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,229\par
I just,you know,maybe she'd call you,\par
\par
487\par
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,459\par
you know,booty call.\par
\par
488\par
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,420\par
No,Lil.\par
\par
489\par
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,860\par
Well,never mind. Let's just do this.\par
\par
490\par
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,669\par
Sorry if we kept you waiting.\par
\par
491\par
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,690\par
Just got caught up in\par
the The Odyssey here.\par
\par
492\par
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,019\par
You're all over this thing.\par
\par
493\par
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,759\par
Vice president of the student body,\par
\par
494\par
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,240\par
co-captain of the cheerleading squad...\par
\par
495\par
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,939\par
Second most popular\par
girl at McKinley High.\par
\par
496\par
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,879\par
That must have been\par
hard being number two.\par
\par
497\par
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,819\par
Always good,just never good enough.\par
\par
498\par
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,829\par
Ever get sick of it,Suzie ?\par
\par
499\par
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,819\par
Living in Felicia's shadow ?\par
\par
500\par
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,289\par
She was my best friend.\par
\par
501\par
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,319\par
And your worst enemy.\par
\par
502\par
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,859\par
Same thing,right.\par
\par
503\par
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,219\par
Sure,you eat her dust for four years,\par
\par
504\par
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,429\par
then she pays you back on prom\par
night by taking your boyfriend.\par
\par
505\par
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,179\par
Boyfriend ? I hardly knew Lee.\par
\par
506\par
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,379\par
Well,that was the point.\par
\par
507\par
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,209\par
Pick a guy you figure\par
Felicia won't know...\par
\par
508\par
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,350\par
And even then you're runner-up.\par
\par
509\par
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,359\par
- You told us you were parking with Lee when Felicia died.\par
- That's right.\par
\par
510\par
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,190\par
Last time he saw you was at the dance.\par
\par
511\par
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,270\par
Said you wanted to have\par
the prom queen's head.\par
\par
512\par
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,820\par
Why'd you lie about your alibi ?\par
\par
513\par
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,519\par
Because I was embarrassed.\par
\par
514\par
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,379\par
Embarrassed ? You ever been locked up ?\par
\par
515\par
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,229\par
I mean,'cause I acted like a child.\par
\par
516\par
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,639\par
It was high school.\par
\par
517\par
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,179\par
Everything was always so dramatic.\par
\par
518\par
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,429\par
And afterwards you realize\par
how stupid those fights were.\par
\par
519\par
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,940\par
What happened between you\par
and Felicia that night,Suzie ?\par
\par
520\par
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,890\par
I saw...\par
\par
521\par
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,730\par
Felicia with Lee,and I\par
wanted to hurt her so badly.\par
\par
522\par
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,630\par
And I got my chance.\par
\par
523\par
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,830\par
Suzie,please,listen.\par
\par
524\par
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,710\par
It's not what it looked like.\par
\par
525\par
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,010\par
Well,thank God,'cause\par
it sure looked like\par
\par
526\par
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,510\par
you were trying to stick your\par
tongue down my date's throat.\par
\par
527\par
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,280\par
Hey,we're not selling\par
tickets here. Get out.\par
\par
528\par
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,510\par
I don't get it,Felicia.\par
\par
529\par
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,330\par
Your quarterback boyfriend isn't\par
good enough for you anymore ?\par
\par
530\par
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,160\par
- That's not it.\par
- No ?\par
\par
531\par
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,590\par
Why ? Why my date ?\par
\par
532\par
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,140\par
You remember...\par
\par
533\par
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,140\par
the guy I told you I lost my\par
virginity to a few years back ?\par
\par
534\par
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,310\par
Yeah,some college guy down the shore.\par
\par
535\par
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,960\par
He lived on my block,Suzie.\par
\par
536\par
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,140\par
Lee ?\par
\par
537\par
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,280\par
It was a mistake.\par
\par
538\par
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,970\par
We were way too young,and it's way over.\par
\par
539\par
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,830\par
If you like him,you should go for it.\par
\par
540\par
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,040\par
So I get your sloppy seconds ?\par
\par
541\par
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,470\par
That's not what I meant.\par
\par
542\par
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,210\par
You're my best friend.\par
Closest friend in the world.\par
\par
543\par
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,130\par
You are the only thing in this\par
ridiculous place that matters to me.\par
\par
544\par
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,430\par
You're acting like we're never\par
going to see each other again.\par
\par
545\par
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,250\par
I'd never forgive myself if I hurt you.\par
\par
546\par
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,640\par
Please.\par
\par
547\par
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,810\par
Say we're okay.\par
\par
548\par
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,000\par
We're okay.\par
\par
549\par
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,210\par
She reached out to me,\par
\par
550\par
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,240\par
and all I could see was an\par
opportunity to take her down.\par
\par
551\par
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,790\par
I needed her to know\par
what it felt like to lose.\par
\par
552\par
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,940\par
What did you do,Suzie ?\par
\par
553\par
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,890\par
I told Cole about Felicia\par
and Lee,and then...\par
\par
554\par
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,230\par
later at the afterparty,\par
\par
555\par
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,320\par
I hooked up with him.\par
\par
556\par
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,170\par
I thought Cole was long passed out.\par
\par
557\par
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,010\par
Oh,sure,he was plastered,but...\par
\par
558\par
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,210\par
he was awake.\par
\par
559\par
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,390\par
The Colster and I were just going\par
back over the events of prom night.\par
\par
560\par
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,520\par
Right.\par
\par
561\par
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,630\par
Did you get to the\par
part where he lied about\par
\par
562\par
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,100\par
being passed out in\par
the back of that car ?\par
\par
563\par
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,050\par
I didn't lie about nothing.\par
\par
564\par
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,810\par
Been claiming you out cold,\par
\par
565\par
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,310\par
but not so drunk you didn't\par
try to get over on Suzie Hill.\par
\par
566\par
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,580\par
I don't remember that at all.\par
\par
567\par
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,170\par
Don't flatter yourself. She\par
doesn't remember much of it either.\par
\par
568\par
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:17,290\par
Boys down in the garage did some\par
analysis of your '89 Mustang.\par
\par
569\par
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,720\par
Turns out the paint on the\par
front bumper has been replaced.\par
\par
570\par
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,920\par
Doesn't match the factory original.\par
\par
571\par
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,450\par
I had an accident a few years ago.\par
\par
572\par
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,820\par
Back-ended some truck.\par
\par
573\par
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,070\par
So what,you forgot to file a report ?\par
\par
574\par
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,160\par
No,I wanted to leave the\par
insurance companies out of it.\par
\par
575\par
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,950\par
This isn't the first lie\par
you've told us there,Colster.\par
\par
576\par
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,580\par
What about all that smoke you were\par
blowing about big-time college ball ?\par
\par
577\par
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,830\par
Okay,so I exaggerate a little.\par
\par
578\par
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,640\par
Don't mean I hurt Felicia.\par
\par
579\par
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,730\par
Like I said,passed out.\par
\par
580\par
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,850\par
No,you were blacked out.\par
\par
581\par
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,550\par
Means you just don't\par
remember what you did.\par
\par
582\par
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,480\par
Like hooking up with Suzie.\par
\par
583\par
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,240\par
Or getting in your car\par
and tracking down Felicia.\par
\par
584\par
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,560\par
If I found out my high school\par
girlfriend was messing around...\par
\par
585\par
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,870\par
especially with a guy like Lee,\par
\par
586\par
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,380\par
there's no telling what I'd have done.\par
\par
587\par
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,440\par
That night was supposed\par
to end different.\par
\par
588\par
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,010\par
You touched my girl,I'm\par
gonna break your face.\par
\par
589\par
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,460\par
Dude,I don't want any trouble.\par
\par
590\par
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,780\par
Lee,that's enough!\par
\par
591\par
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,540\par
Just go.\par
\par
592\par
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,600\par
You okay ? You hurt ?\par
\par
593\par
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,070\par
I can't believe you\par
would do him,and not me.\par
\par
594\par
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,560\par
It was a mistake.\par
\par
595\par
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,910\par
One I don't want to make again.\par
\par
596\par
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,150\par
I kept trying to pretend like\par
\par
597\par
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,670\par
tonight was going to be special\par
\par
598\par
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,130\par
and that I wanted it too,\par
\par
599\par
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,900\par
but,Cole,we both know it's not true.\par
\par
600\par
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,990\par
Let's call it,Cole.\par
\par
601\par
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,210\par
Wait a minute. You...\par
\par
602\par
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,110\par
You're breaking up with me ?\par
\par
603\par
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,920\par
- At prom ?\par
- I know,I know. My timing sucks.\par
\par
604\par
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,000\par
Babe,we were meant to be together.\par
\par
605\par
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,960\par
Come on. I love you.\par
\par
606\par
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,250\par
You don't even know me.\par
\par
607\par
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,560\par
No way,babe,this runs deep.\par
\par
608\par
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,710\par
You say that now.\par
\par
609\par
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,650\par
Next year it's all going to fade.\par
\par
610\par
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,300\par
What ? We're going to Penn\par
State. Coed dorm,right ?\par
\par
611\par
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,090\par
I'm not going to State.\par
\par
612\par
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,510\par
I'm going to Berkeley.\par
\par
613\par
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,910\par
What ? Berkeley ?\par
\par
614\par
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,260\par
Mr. Burke wanted me to apply.\par
\par
615\par
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,930\par
He put in a call to his\par
friend in Admissions,\par
\par
616\par
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,870\par
and I just got off the wait list.\par
\par
617\par
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,090\par
- Why didn't you tell me ?\par
- I didn't tell anyone.\par
\par
618\par
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,090\par
I wasn't sure before.\par
\par
619\par
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,520\par
Look,Cole,it's not about you. I just...\par
\par
620\par
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,970\par
I wanted to go somewhere new\par
where I didn't know anybody.\par
\par
621\par
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,310\par
You have no idea what I'm saying,do you ?\par
\par
622\par
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,990\par
You're saying I'm not\par
getting any tonight.\par
\par
623\par
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,770\par
Sorry.\par
\par
624\par
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,450\par
But if it's any consolation,\par
\par
625\par
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,330\par
you can tell the team\par
any story you want.\par
\par
626\par
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,210\par
Your rep's safe with me.\par
\par
627\par
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,720\par
Hey,we never got a picture\par
together as king and queen.\par
\par
628\par
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,920\par
Come here.\par
\par
629\par
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:35,640\par
High school was the only time\par
that my life was worth a damn.\par
\par
630\par
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:41,050\par
And prom ? That was supposed\par
to top it all,but it blew.\par
\par
631\par
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,720\par
Girlfriend left you;\par
you got your ass kicked.\par
\par
632\par
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,440\par
Ended up spending the rest of the night\par
in the ER getting my stomach pumped.\par
\par
633\par
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,170\par
Didn't tell anybody that\par
she broke it off with me.\par
\par
634\par
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,260\par
Wanted to keep up my image.\par
\par
635\par
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,180\par
I was always the Colster.\par
\par
636\par
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,110\par
No one can ever take that from me.\par
\par
637\par
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,960\par
That picture Felicia took,when was that ?\par
\par
638\par
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:08,100\par
Um,end of prom,I guess,uh,around 11:30.\par
\par
639\par
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,240\par
Disposable cameras from\par
that night had 24 exposures.\par
\par
640\par
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,460\par
Stack of photos from\par
Felicia's camera ? Only 23.\par
\par
641\par
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,820\par
One photo's missing.\par
\par
642\par
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,630\par
The one she took of her\par
and Cole at the end of prom.\par
\par
643\par
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,810\par
Never got developed ?\par
\par
644\par
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,500\par
It got developed,all\par
right. Went back to the CVS.\par
\par
645\par
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,470\par
They keep the negatives on computer now.\par
\par
646\par
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,220\par
So either Mrs. Jacobs or\par
Principal Burke got rid of it.\par
\par
647\par
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,790\par
Mrs. Jacobs was barely in elementary\par
school when Felicia was killed.\par
\par
648\par
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,980\par
Look closer. Check out the car.\par
\par
649\par
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,850\par
Silver,looks like a Volvo.\par
\par
650\par
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,230\par
Looked up DMV records for '89.\par
\par
651\par
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,130\par
Principal Burke owned\par
the same make and model.\par
\par
652\par
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,930\par
Are you sure ?\par
\par
653\par
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,970\par
When did you notice it was missing ?\par
\par
654\par
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,210\par
No. No,Dad,it's not okay.\par
\par
655\par
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,600\par
No,I'll handle it. Damn it.\par
\par
656\par
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,080\par
What was that ?\par
\par
657\par
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,100\par
Christina just disappeared.\par
\par
658\par
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,280\par
Along with some jewelry\par
at my dad's house.\par
\par
659\par
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,290\par
Should have known.\par
\par
660\par
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,170\par
Well,you need help,say the word.\par
\par
661\par
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,090\par
I'll handle it.\par
\par
662\par
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,940\par
Just gotta take care of this first.\par
\par
663\par
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,600\par
According to DMV records,Mr. Burke,\par
\par
664\par
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,090\par
you drove a silver Volvo back in '89 ?\par
\par
665\par
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,790\par
That's right.\par
\par
666\par
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,580\par
It's right here in this photo,\par
\par
667\par
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,290\par
the one that you neglected to\par
share with us Taken at 11:30,\par
\par
668\par
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,480\par
right as the prom ended.\par
\par
669\par
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,930\par
Bit confusing.\par
\par
670\par
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,260\par
You said you were in the ER all\par
night with an injured student.\par
\par
671\par
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,420\par
Where are you going with this ?\par
\par
672\par
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,220\par
Felicia Grant was mowed down by\par
a vehicle with the same paint job.\par
\par
673\par
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,180\par
It must have been a real shock when\par
Ms. Jacobs found that old camera.\par
\par
674\par
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,210\par
All those photos of Felicia.\par
\par
675\par
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,930\par
Like a ghost coming back to haunt you.\par
\par
676\par
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,250\par
We spoke to Ms. Jacobs.\par
\par
677\par
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,630\par
And she said that at first,\par
\par
678\par
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,670\par
you didn't think those\par
phososererworth bringing to the police.\par
\par
679\par
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,550\par
Well,she's mistaken.\par
\par
680\par
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,850\par
I want justice for Felicia\par
just as much as anyone.\par
\par
681\par
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,460\par
She was a special student.\par
\par
682\par
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,880\par
No doubt about that.\par
\par
683\par
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,730\par
"Felicia has an\par
intelligence and maturity "\par
\par
684\par
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,200\par
that far exceeds even the best students.\par
\par
685\par
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,980\par
Her star burns brightly at McKinley."\par
\par
686\par
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,650\par
The letter of recommendation you\par
sent to Cal-Berkeley on her behalf.\par
\par
687\par
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,400\par
I've written hundreds\par
of recommendations.\par
\par
688\par
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,340\par
You went the extra mile for Felicia.\par
\par
689\par
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,830\par
Put several phone calls in to make\par
sure she got taken off the wait list.\par
\par
690\par
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:39,180\par
Are you suggesting we had an\par
inappropriate relationship ?\par
\par
691\par
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,440\par
She was just a girl!\par
\par
692\par
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,600\par
Felicia was no ordinary\par
student,now,was she ?\par
\par
693\par
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,700\par
- What makes you think...  ?\par
- 'Cause you've been in this room\par
\par
694\par
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,890\par
with two dozen photos of Felicia\par
\par
695\par
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,130\par
and you've barely looked at her once!\par
\par
696\par
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,910\par
Look now!\par
\par
697\par
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,090\par
You went to four different auto shops\par
\par
698\par
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,730\par
for replacement parts for that Volvo.\par
\par
699\par
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,230\par
You fixed it yourself.\par
\par
700\par
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,040\par
You should have paid cash.\par
\par
701\par
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,680\par
She was left there.\par
\par
702\par
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,140\par
Her date was too drunk\par
to drive her home.\par
\par
703\par
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,000\par
Then there you were.\par
\par
704\par
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,720\par
Felicia ?\par
\par
705\par
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,820\par
What are you still doing here ?\par
\par
706\par
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,530\par
She needed a ride. Believe that ?\par
\par
707\par
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,850\par
The prom queen was left behind.\par
\par
708\par
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,050\par
Was I supposed to leave her there ?\par
\par
709\par
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,820\par
You were supposed to drive her home.\par
\par
710\par
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,330\par
Mr. Burke,we're supposed to\par
turn these in to prom committee,\par
\par
711\par
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,680\par
buthere's still one picture left.\par
\par
712\par
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,800\par
Here.\par
\par
713\par
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,680\par
One last shot of the prom queen.\par
\par
714\par
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,670\par
Tomorrow you turn back\par
into a pumpkin,so...\par
\par
715\par
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,800\par
Come on. Let's get out of here.\par
\par
716\par
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,980\par
But something happened\par
on the way there,right ?\par
\par
717\par
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,490\par
I always knew where to draw the line:\par
\par
718\par
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,890\par
a joke, a pat on the back.\par
\par
719\par
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,510\par
But Felicia was special, wasn't she ?\par
\par
720\par
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,840\par
She was different.\par
\par
721\par
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,160\par
Beautiful.\par
\par
722\par
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,220\par
But so much more than that.\par
\par
723\par
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,130\par
She had it all.\par
\par
724\par
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,910\par
I just wanted to be a part of that.\par
\par
725\par
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,870\par
So,no afterparty ?\par
\par
726\par
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,580\par
Just going home.\par
\par
727\par
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,900\par
Come on. The prom queen can't\par
end the night with a whimper.\par
\par
728\par
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,290\par
I just don't feel much like partying.\par
\par
729\par
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,600\par
Felicia.\par
\par
730\par
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,960\par
Something happen ?\par
\par
731\par
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,930\par
No.\par
\par
732\par
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,140\par
No,it's just a crazy night.\par
\par
733\par
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,130\par
I think I lost my best friend.\par
\par
734\par
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,470\par
I broke up with Cole.\par
\par
735\par
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,980\par
it's okay.\par
\par
736\par
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,840\par
Cole Austen ?\par
\par
737\par
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,440\par
I mean,you've been out of\par
his league for a long time.\par
\par
738\par
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,100\par
It's more than Cole.\par
\par
739\par
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,040\par
I'm saying good-bye\par
to everything I know.\par
\par
740\par
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,950\par
I'm excited to move on,\par
\par
741\par
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,390\par
but also I'm terrified.\par
\par
742\par
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,630\par
Does that make sense ?\par
\par
743\par
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,960\par
Perfect. It's normal.\par
\par
744\par
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,450\par
I'm proud of you,Felicia.\par
\par
745\par
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,630\par
Thanks,Mr. Burke.\par
\par
746\par
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,930\par
Oh,please,you're practically graduated.\par
\par
747\par
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,720\par
You can call me Steve.\par
\par
748\par
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,640\par
Okay...\par
\par
749\par
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,290\par
Steve.\par
\par
750\par
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,910\par
You've always been so cool.\par
\par
751\par
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,100\par
I don't even really think\par
of you like a teacher...\par
\par
752\par
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,290\par
I don't think of you\par
as just any student.\par
\par
753\par
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,750\par
Mr. Burke! What the hell ? !\par
\par
\lang2057 754\par
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,960\par
I'm sorry! I,um,I must have misread...\par
\par
755\par
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,340\par
- I have to go.\par
- Wait! No,wait!\par
\par
756\par
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,730\par
- Listen to me! Listen to me! Let's just forget this ever happened,okay ?\par
- I feel sick.\par
\par
757\par
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,320\par
- Wait. Listen!\par
- Mr. Burke,you're hurting me!\par
\par
758\par
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,180\par
Calm down. I want to\par
keep this between us,okay ?\par
\par
759\par
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,110\par
- Let go!\par
- We just need to talk about this!\par
\par
760\par
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,170\par
Wait! Let's talk about it!\par
\par
761\par
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,570\par
Leave me alone!\par
\par
762\par
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,260\par
Felicia,wait!\par
\par
763\par
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,050\par
