3
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,424
Black-and-white is, like,

4
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:30,981
so beautiful.

5
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:35,753
Can't believe I made my Joseph Shaw 
signature popcorn for these guys.

6
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:37,364
And they're asleep!

7
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:39,629
What? What's going on?

8
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:42,562
Joseph, next time I'm
picking the movie, man.

9
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:45,644
I'm trying to broaden your mind, Corey,
but that's fine, whatever.

10
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,242
Bad enough you keep us sober.

11
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:50,020
You make us watch
black-and-white movies, too.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,253
All right, that's it, guys.
Lights out.

13
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,084
Come on, everybody up.

14
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:59,065
Let's go. Up.

15
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:02,276
I'm eating, like, so much sugar, 
I totally can't sleep, I bet.

16
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:04,058
Read a book in your room.

17
00:01:04,058 --> 00:01:06,208
I'll walk you back, Crystal.

18
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:10,376
Hey, you all, you made it.

19
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:13,414
One more day clean and sober.
Yeah!

20
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:19,730
Yeah, way to go, man.
Get sleep, man, okay? / All right.

21
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:23,561
Take care. Come on.

22
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,040
Corey!

23
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:14,891
Orlando.

24
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:18,816
Help! Somebody help!

25
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:22,094
Orlando, it's all right, man,
hang in, hang in there.

26
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:23,987
Help!

27
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,911
Hi.

28
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,331
What's with your hand?

29
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,592
None.

30
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:22,734
Kind of looks broken.

31
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,836
Uh, looks worse than it feels.

32
00:03:24,836 --> 00:03:26,932
You get in a fight or something?

33
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,902
Nah.

34
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:30,428
Got a call from east.

35
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:35,596
Someone just tried to use the credit card
of a murder victim from last year.

36
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:37,072
Where?

37
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:39,851
Check cashing place 
in Kensington, two days ago.

38
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,800
Wallet was taken off the body?

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,907
Who's the victim?

40
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:46,358
Joseph Shaw. He died last year.
He was a murder witness.

41
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:49,241
Shot two weeks before he was supposed
to ID the doer in court.

42
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,208
Didn't pin his death on the guy
he was gonna finger?

43
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,208
No, they lost traction.
Shaw's case went cold.

44
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,241
Till today.

45
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:59,143
When someone gets the bright idea 
of using a dead man's credit card.

46
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:02,081
Hope whatever they bought was worth it.

47
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:11,136
Cold Case 
3x23. Joseph

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2006/05/21

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,118
So I heard something 
I got to ask you about.

61
00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:40,605
Okay.

62
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:45,643
It true you keep pictures of victims next to 
your bed, when you're working on a case?

63
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,007
Where'd you hear that?

64
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:48,516
People talk.

65
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:50,944
Just seems a little freaky.

66
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:55,307
Easy to look at all the files and boxes,

67
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:57,666
forget the lives behind them.

68
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:00,596
Joseph Shaw, 38.

69
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:03,935
He was killed right before he was set
to testify against Corey Lewis.

70
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:06,426
Shotgun blast to the face,
through the door.

71
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:08,754
So suspect number one is Corey,

72
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:10,589
who didn't want Joseph
taking the stand?

73
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:13,282
But Corey was in jail
when Joseph was killed.

74
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:15,823
Cops figured he must've reached out,
gotten someone else to do it.

75
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,909
Yeah, but the kid didn't
seem to have much reach.

76
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:21,174
Was a loner who lived at a rehab center
called Robinson teen house.

77
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:23,291
Place Joseph worked as a counselor.

78
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,055
Know it from my narcotics days.

79
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:28,026
Treats drug-addicted teens from 
all backgrounds. Has a great rep.

80
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:31,171
Yeah, it was started by Jane and 
Ted Robinson, big Philly philanthropists.

81
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:35,466
Neighbor who ID'ed the body told the cops
Robinson house was Joseph's life.

82
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:38,428
So maybe the Robinsons can
tell us more about our victim.

83
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:42,208
Let's find out what Corey knows
about this credit card being used.

84
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:46,330
Now here's a guy who wouldn't 
look so bad on a bedside table.

85
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,257
We started this place after our son
Tom died of a meth overdose.

86
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:07,083
Being here has helped us as much
as it's helped any of the kids,

87
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,793
to tell you the truth.

88
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:10,532
Did you know Joseph Shaw well?

89
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:13,244
Sure, and the kids loved Joseph.

90
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:17,136
Well, he sweated through rehab
with them every step of the way.

91
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:19,606
He struggled with heroin himself, 
growing up.

92
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:22,620
He even did a few months in jail
before he got clean.

93
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,686
So he knew what the kids
were going through.

94
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:28,423
With a lot of social workers,
the kids are just a file.

95
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:33,050
But Joseph always said it was important
to see the lives behind the file.

96
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,089
And he did.

97
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:41,326
Can you tell us about his relationship
with, uh, Corey, the boy accused of murder?

98
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:44,183
Corey was like our son Tom,
in a lot of ways.

99
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:47,998
He was tough, put up walls.

100
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:50,961
But Joseph knew how to get through them,

101
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:53,109
right from the start.

102
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:57,401
Let me out of this damn prison!

103
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:59,873
- The new guy's freaking out!
- Chill out, bro!

104
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:02,274
Corey, we know what you're going through.

105
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:05,525
You don't know anything.
You just met me yesterday, bitch!

106
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,443
Let him slam.

107
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:11,285
My son used to do this kind of thing all
the time, end up in hospitals.

108
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,595
You're a strong bastard, aren't you?

109
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:16,494
- I'm getting out of here, man.
- No, you're not.

110
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:19,176
You know, when I was using, man,
I was hollowed-out and weak.

111
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:20,908
What the hell are you talking about?

112
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,494
You're in here because you're an addict, man. 
You got a disease.

113
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,090
- That's bull, man!
- Denial. Been there, done that!

114
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,500
What we do here Corey, is we try 
to help you kick addiction's ass.

115
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,728
It takes some serious muscle.

116
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:35,129
There's a dent in that door tells me 
you're strong enough to pull it off.

117
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,904
Bet I could put a dent in that door.

118
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:38,981
I'd rather see you get to group, Orlando.

119
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:42,989
You put that strength in the right direction,
you're gonna be a star here.

120
00:07:57,504 --> 00:08:00,116
We thought Corey was getting
on track after that.

121
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:04,796
Was there anyone Corey was close to,
could have convinced to kill Joseph,

122
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:07,164
- stop him from testifying?
- No.

123
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:10,914
The other kids just didn't seem
to connect with Corey.

124
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:18,597
Orlando and the witness
to his murder are dead,

125
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:20,148
and you're free as a bird.

126
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,024
Things worked out pretty good for you,
didn't they, Corey?

127
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:24,364
Look, I don't have to talk about Orlando.

128
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:25,973
Those charges were dropped.

129
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,147
Fine. Let's talk about Joseph.

130
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:29,770
I liked him.

131
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,878
And I got an airtight alibi
for the night he was killed.

132
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:36,271
Oh, someone just used his credit cards.
You got any ideas about that?

133
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:39,373
No, but I'll tell you what I think.

134
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:43,883
I think what sank Joseph is 
the same thing that always sinks a guy.

135
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,828
Women.

136
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,951
It's romantic of you, Corey.

137
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,974
You know it's true.

138
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:53,876
Come on, you've been sunk, too, right?

139
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,894
Why don't you tell us what
the hell you're talking about?

140
00:08:56,894 --> 00:09:01,103
I'm talking about
how love makes people crazy.

141
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:07,792
I couldn't keep my girlfriend,
'cause I was always lying,

142
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,607
sneaking off to get a fix.

143
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,280
She kept busting me.

144
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,894
The drug's like our secret affair, right?

145
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:17,907
The lies catch up with us, 'cause we ain't 
nearly as smart as we think we are.

146
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,846
Jasmine was my dream girl, too.

147
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,303
How so?

148
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,963
I don't know.

149
00:09:23,987 --> 00:09:26,155
She was hot.

150
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:28,686
What about you, Joseph?

151
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:30,584
Who's your dream girl?

152
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:32,812
I don't have a lot of time
for relationships right now.

153
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:35,171
I got my hands full with you punks.

154
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:38,672
Oh, must be something
that turns up your temperature.

155
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:44,197
Guess it would be someone smart, 
as passionate about her work as I am,

156
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:47,443
and not allergic to cats.

157
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:52,139
How about you, Corey?

158
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:55,437
Someone fine.

159
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:57,644
You know, who dresses nice.

160
00:09:57,644 --> 00:10:00,940
Someone who gives a damn about me.

161
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,692
See, that's an important step, Corey.

162
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:06,490
'Cause you're right,
you deserve that, man.

163
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,559
I mean, you all do.

164
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,772
I get your subliminal message, Joseph.

165
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:14,438
- What message?
- Just because I'm allergic to cats,

166
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:17,669
and I'm too young to be all
passionate about some dumb job...

167
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:19,668
Stop acting like a freak, Crystal.

168
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,389
You should be with someone
your own age, anyways.

169
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:24,531
Joseph, we could seriously make it together.
Don't just reject me.

170
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:27,817
Crystal, I'm not rejecting you as a person,
but there's no chance of...

171
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:33,059
Stop! I can't even look at you!
Your face is, like, haunting me, okay?

172
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:34,934
Crystal...

173
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,926
it might be best for you to have group
with a different counselor.

174
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:41,333
I can't survive like this.

175
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,735
I'm gonna kill myself.

176
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:46,488
Or I'm gonna kill you.

177
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:54,389
As soon as I heard
Joseph got shot in the face,

178
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:57,162
I thought crazy Crystal.

179
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:50,435
Crystal Eckersdorf?

180
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:54,406
Detectives Jeffries and Miller, Philly PD.

181
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:57,609
I'm out of jail and out
of trouble's the sweet thing.

182
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:59,767
So even though you're cops,

183
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,794
I'm not nervous right now.

184
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:04,085
We're about to kill that buzz, Crystal.

185
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:07,905
Take us back to a year ago,
back when you were in a bad way.

186
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:09,863
You told Joseph Shaw you loved him

187
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:13,044
and if you didn't kill yourself,
you'd kill him.

188
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:15,601
Oh, yeah.

189
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:19,734
Now he's dead, shot right in the face
you didn't want to look at anymore.

190
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:21,708
Shot by me?
No, you're wrong.

191
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,713
That so?

192
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:28,672
You know how...
if a person is drowning,

193
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:32,478
they'll, like, freak out and try to drown
the person who's rescuing them?

194
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:34,176
Sure.

195
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:36,910
Joseph was the person who'd rescue you.

196
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,666
Saying that put him in harm's way?

197
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:46,897
- You gonna say by who?
- Oh, but it's so sad. / Crystal.

198
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:50,379
Joseph's foster brother.

199
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:52,158
He stopped by one time

200
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:56,634
and I was like, "oh, my god, 
Joseph's family is as bad as mine."

201
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:59,034
Which is bad.

202
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:04,164
Every guy who's ever liked me...

203
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:07,521
dies including Orlando.

204
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:11,384
- Wilder, what are you doing here?
- Hey, bro. / Hi.

205
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:12,845
Crystal, can you step out for a minute?

206
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:14,846
No, no. I'll be real quick.

207
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:16,950
Landlord's screwing me.
Wants a deposit.

208
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,971
I've given you my last dime.

209
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:20,940
I'm gonna leave.

210
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,874
I'm afraid I'm gonna forget 
who you are.

211
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:25,112
I'm right here.

212
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:30,070
I want to look at you and see you, 
all right? Not this.

213
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,911
Look, I know she made you
feel like you're nothing.

214
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:36,391
But you're not.

215
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:38,337
You're not, man.

216
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:42,477
Joe wants to make everybody
perfect, like him.

217
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:45,569
No, thanks.

218
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,655
See you.

219
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:58,305
Stop!

220
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:01,562
Get out!

221
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:12,864
Wilder's mom, Joseph's foster mom...

222
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:17,948
she would, like, not let them eat,
but she'd, like, stuff her face.

223
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:19,415
Nice way to grow up.

224
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:22,096
They got into heroin as kids.

225
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:24,434
Only Joseph kicked it.

226
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:27,690
Some people just can't get sober.

227
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,366
You make it look like a breeze.

228
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:33,801
So Joseph tried the tough love
approach with Wilder.

229
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:37,474
Who was jonesing and probably
not in control of himself.

230
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:41,304
And Joseph was dead, 
like, two days later.

231
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:48,749
Your Wilder Dautry's been rubbing elbows
with the law since he was 14.

232
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:52,368
Possession, possession,
public urination...  lovely.

233
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:55,454
But arrests drop off after May 2005.

234
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:57,796
Yeah, when his foster brother,
Joseph, turns up dead.

235
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,300
- No trace of Wilder since then?
- Nope.

236
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,703
Got a last known address,
Reba Dautry.

237
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:04,856
Mother?

238
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:07,838
And Joseph Shaw's foster mom.

239
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:13,850
Kid at the park saw somebody beat
the crap out of that pervert guy.

240
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,594
Must've gotten what was coming to him.

241
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:17,515
That courtesy of you?

242
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:19,383
Me?

243
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,137
Nah.

244
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:29,683
I took in Joseph when he was 15.

245
00:15:29,683 --> 00:15:31,575
Nobody else wanted him.

246
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:34,373
He and Wilder got thick as thieves.

247
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,372
Turned against me.

248
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:37,835
How so, Mrs. Dautry?

249
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:40,630
Called DHS on me.

250
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,448
Imagine that.

251
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:46,379
Yeah, that right there.
That's the look he'd give me.

252
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,129
Wilder disappeared right around
when Joseph died. You know why?

253
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,173
Figured he took off 'cause he ran out 
of people in Philly to mooch off of.

254
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:56,260
They were seen arguing.

255
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,254
Always something with those two.

256
00:15:58,254 --> 00:15:59,952
What do you mean?

257
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:03,914
Well...the last time I saw them,
they were up a creek,

258
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:06,418
looking to me to bail them out.

259
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,253
Look, he needs your help. He's coming 
down and he's got no place to stay.

260
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:15,911
You act like you're better than him.

261
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,945
I read about that place you work.

262
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,804
Kids stabbing each other.

263
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:22,113
I was threatened today about that.

264
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:25,076
I don't want Wilder near me,
it's dangerous.

265
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:28,837
Can't stay here.
I got fosters in all the bedrooms.

266
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:31,958
I want to get him
out of the city to the farm.

267
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,340
That old shack?
Who even knows where the key is?

268
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,485
Reba, look, I know we haven't
been family to each other,

269
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:42,800
but we need this, me and him.

270
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:48,710
You two got enough out of me.

271
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,844
Wilder?

272
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:55,245
Joseph will take care of you,
alright, pumpkin, hmm?

273
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:58,264
- I want to go to my room.
- We've got to go, brother.

274
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:01,728
Come on,  we'll get you to my place,
clean you up.

275
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:10,290
You're the mother of the year, Reba.
Thanks for everything.

276
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:14,986
Sounds like the same award
my mom was up for.

277
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:18,400
So you sent Joseph packing?

278
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,304
With a strung-out drug 
addict for company?

279
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:21,609
Yep.

280
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,343
What was the farm
Joseph asked you about?

281
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:28,896
Family place up Limekiln pike.

282
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:32,154
Just a pile of boards and nails by now.

283
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:34,617
Address, Reba.

284
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,508
Might want to get that hand 
X-rayed, Scotty.

285
00:17:45,508 --> 00:17:47,063
Eh, it's nothing.

286
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:50,741
Just, uh, jammed it in a pickup game.

287
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:53,262
Heading out, Lil?

288
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:57,061
I was, uh,  thinking I'd go out
to the Dautrys' farm now.

289
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:58,735
Go in the morning.

290
00:17:58,735 --> 00:17:59,968
Two of you.

291
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:02,923
Okay, good night, boss.

292
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:05,294
Good night.

293
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,200
Archer?

294
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:38,519
Laura?

295
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,846
You're alive.

296
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,859
Who the hell are you?

297
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,423
I'm the police.

298
00:19:57,423 --> 00:19:59,626
I'd like some proof of that.

299
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,763
Who was murdered in your apartment?

300
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:15,758
My foster brother Wilder.

301
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:18,539
- Did you kill him?
- Of course not.

302
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:22,329
Guy was a mess,
but I loved him like hell.

303
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:25,549
You let everyone think it was you.

304
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:27,931
They thought they'd killed me.

305
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:30,487
If I came forward,
they'd try again.

306
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:32,094
They?

307
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:36,331
What are you doing out here
at night, alone?

308
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:38,296
Looking for Wilder.

309
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,373
Trying to solve your murder.

310
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,945
I guess I should be grateful.

311
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:45,740
These are some odd hours.

312
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,047
What are you, a workaholic, detective?

313
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,817
Who was trying to kill you, Joseph?

314
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,509
I spent the last year
trying to find out.

315
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,596
Get proof the police
have to pay attention to.

316
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,955
Tell me what you know,
I can take it from there.

317
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,225
No, you don't understand.

318
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:02,893
These people have the resources,
and the reach to stop you.

319
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,061
That sounds a little paranoid.

320
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:07,026
I wish it was.

321
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,183
You have to trust me.
I can help.

322
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:16,965
What's your name?

323
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:19,433
Lilly Rush.

324
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:21,872
Detective Lilly Rush.

325
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:23,214
Well, you must think I'm a wacko.

326
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:27,629
This, this, this isn't as Ted Kaczynski 
as it looks. It's a...

327
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:31,967
It's a good life out here.
Quiet.

328
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:35,663
I could see that.

329
00:21:38,914 --> 00:21:42,774
Does it feel like we've met 
before or something?

330
00:21:42,774 --> 00:21:44,659
No.

331
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:54,403
Tell me what happened, Joseph.

332
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:59,096
I was at Robinson house 
the day before Wilder was murdered.

333
00:21:59,747 --> 00:22:03,788
Joseph? I gotta talk to you.
It's important.

334
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:06,526
Could we talk in your office?

335
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:10,073
So, yeah, I'll work on
taking criticism better.

336
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:12,339
Cool. Thanks, Joseph.

337
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:15,443
Is everything okay?

338
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:18,304
I haven't slept in two months,
not since Orlando died.

339
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:19,357
I know.

340
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:21,944
Joseph, the kids who need love 
and support the most,

341
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:23,694
we can't just throw them away.

342
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:25,155
We don't throw anyone away, Jane.

343
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:26,742
What about Corey?

344
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:29,234
- Corey?
- He needs us.

345
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:34,374
We're his family, and you testifying just 
slams the door in his face.

346
00:22:34,374 --> 00:22:36,931
But Corey killed a boy.

347
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:39,013
He needs to take responsibility for that.

348
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:41,492
But Corey had to do it.

349
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:44,704
Orlando was going to ruin everything,
and bring down this place.

350
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:47,484
Bring it down?
What are you talking about?

351
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:51,351
It's none of your business.

352
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:54,804
Look, I don't know what's going on here,

353
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:57,580
but I'm gonna testify, Jane,
no matter what.

354
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,367
You won't testify,
and that's final.

355
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:06,616
Next night, there was a hole in my door,
and Wilder was dead.

356
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:08,169
You think Jane was involved?

357
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,208
I've been following Corey,
see if I could find out more.

358
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,693
That's dangerous, Joseph.

359
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,161
And I tried to find Crystal, see what 
she knows, but she's disappeared.

360
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,733
She just got out of jail.

361
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:18,573
I can talk to her first thing tomorrow.

362
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:22,037
Look, you can't tell anyone I'm alive.

363
00:23:22,037 --> 00:23:23,411
I have to bring you in.

364
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:25,394
I'm not going anywhere.

365
00:23:25,394 --> 00:23:27,391
Trust me.

366
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:32,190
Was that you?

367
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,588
Used the credit card?

368
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:39,743
Laura got chomped by a raccoon,

369
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:42,694
and I had to rush her 
to the vet's in the city.

370
00:23:42,694 --> 00:23:44,614
The card was still in my wallet.

371
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:49,796
I was so upset about the whole thing,
I just wasn't thinng straight.

372
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:52,203
I get it.

373
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,428
Valens.

374
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:15,919
Scotty, I'm at the Dautry farm,
and there's nothing here.

375
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,679
No point in you driving out.

376
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,090
Wait, you went on your own?

377
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,433
Yeah, I was up early,
just thought I'd swing by, you know.

378
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:25,870
Okay.

379
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,693
And, listen, can you tell 
the boss I'm gonna take a sick day?

380
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:29,850
Lil, what's going on?

381
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,044
Nothing, I'm just, um...
gonna take off sick.

382
00:24:33,044 --> 00:24:35,324
Will you tell him?

383
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:38,701
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

384
00:24:44,658 --> 00:24:46,084
She on her way in?

385
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,568
No. She's, uh... 
taking a sick day.

386
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,758
She never takes off sick.

387
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:54,458
Manager from the check cashing 
store called back.

388
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:58,841
Has a security video we can look at
from the night the card was used.

389
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:00,674
Lil's sick.

390
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:03,226
She's never sick.

391
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,101
Ah, detective, good to see you.

392
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:13,174
I'm so sorry, I'm afraid I'm rushing off
to a board meeting this morning.

393
00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:15,110
Actually, I'm looking for your wife.

394
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,938
Uh, she's out.
Can I have her call you?

395
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:21,733
Did you know she asked Joseph
not to testify against Corey?

396
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,531
- Where did you hear that?
- Please answer the question.

397
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:26,466
Someone misunderstood, I'm sure.

398
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:29,104
Well, she was pretty clear about it.
I believe the phrase was,

399
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:32,986
"Do not testify against Corey."

400
00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:35,081
If she said anything like that,

401
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:38,084
it was in the interest of protecting 
Robinson house and the residents there.

402
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:41,694
What exactly was she
protecting them from?

403
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:45,070
I think you're getting in
over your head here, detective.

404
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,320
- Really?
- Really.

405
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:01,116
Crystal?

406
00:26:02,548 --> 00:26:04,448
I'm detective Rush.

407
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:07,435
I'm pretty popular with you guys
these days, huh?

408
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:09,249
I need your help.

409
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:14,712
You had something you wanted to tell Joseph
the night before he got killed?

410
00:26:14,712 --> 00:26:17,854
Kinda weird you know about that.

411
00:26:17,854 --> 00:26:20,890
Help a starving musician, dudes?

412
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,761
No. Later.

413
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:27,459
That guitar's got no strings.

414
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,501
Whatever.
It's the music I care about.

415
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:37,864
You cared about Joseph, too.

416
00:26:38,604 --> 00:26:43,495
And if you know something...
maybe you could tell us who hurt him.

417
00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:48,237
But everyone who's ever said
anything about it... is dead.

418
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:53,098
With your help, we can put
the murderer away for good.

419
00:26:59,707 --> 00:27:03,091
It was the night
before Orlando got killed.

420
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,635
You want to get a game of cards 
or something, before lights out?

421
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:10,932
Lights out is like right now.

422
00:27:10,932 --> 00:27:12,890
I'm gonna go look for Joseph.

423
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,502
You're making a fool out of
yourself, you know that?

424
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:18,687
- You're better than that.
- Not really.

425
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:21,535
Yeah, you are.

426
00:27:21,535 --> 00:27:24,275
Come on, Crys, come hang with me.

427
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,194
Too much energy right now.
Sorry.

428
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:32,105
Cool. Whatever. 
Later.

429
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:56,753
Corey...

430
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,396
I love you.

431
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:09,677
Jane and Corey, together?

432
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:14,471
Totally, creepily, together.

433
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:20,955
Next day, I told Orlando.

434
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:24,672
And you think that's 
what got him killed?

435
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:27,359
I know it did.

436
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,769
He said he was gonna give Corey hell,
maybe make some money off it.

437
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:35,006
Next thing I know...

438
00:28:35,787 --> 00:28:38,997
Orlando's dead.

439
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:50,881
You were right.
I found out what was going on. / And?

440
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:53,219
I need you to come in.
First thing.

441
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:55,604
Look, if Corey doesn't spill,
I'm out in the open...

442
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:58,522
He'll spill.
I'll make him.

443
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:00,824
Will you be there?

444
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:04,584
Yeah, I will.

445
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:09,379
I, I gotta go.

446
00:29:10,897 --> 00:29:13,938
Where the hell you been?
I been trying to call you all day.

447
00:29:13,938 --> 00:29:15,887
Turned my phone off.

448
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:19,293
You don't look sick.

449
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:23,467
What's that?

450
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,701
Security video from the check place.

451
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:28,597
Something on here you should see.

452
00:29:30,472 --> 00:29:33,637
You know what's on here, don't you?

453
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:38,961
I went to the farm last night.

454
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:41,077
- He was there.
- You lied to me?

455
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:42,710
Something got into my head,
I, I can't...

456
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,630
- What the hell's going on with you?
- Stop!

457
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,583
I started having feelings...

458
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:50,093
for this guy I...

459
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:54,772
before I even knew he was alive.

460
00:29:54,772 --> 00:29:58,201
I've gone off the deep end, right?

461
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:04,535
You got to talk to the boss,
tell him what's going on.

462
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,051
I know.

463
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:10,451
I will, first thing.

464
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:14,293
But it's not just the case.
Scotty, it's...

465
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:16,123
him.

466
00:30:16,632 --> 00:30:18,869
Joseph.

467
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:20,931
Okay.

468
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:25,289
Sounds crazy, huh?

469
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:32,905
I get the messed-up-affections thing, 
believe me.

470
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,875
Crap. I screwed up.

471
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:44,159
So...

472
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:47,328
you all right here?

473
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:52,820
Thanks, Scotty.

474
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:01,472
Now how's that feeling?

475
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,012
It's killing me.

476
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:44,011
Corey's sweating in a cell.

477
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:46,684
Where's Joseph?

478
00:31:46,684 --> 00:31:48,905
He's coming.

479
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:53,668
Rush.

480
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:15,388
So?

481
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,785
You went out to the farm alone.

482
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:20,988
Yes.

483
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:25,240
And lied to Scotty,
and then went AWOL all day.

484
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:27,942
I'm sorry.

485
00:32:27,942 --> 00:32:30,499
But Joseph would've ditched out
if I told you...

486
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:34,105
You don't cover for 
a guy dodging the law!

487
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:36,978
That's not how to be a cop,

488
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:40,647
and it's certainly not
how to be a homicide detective.

489
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:43,207
- I know.
- And where is he now?

490
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:45,403
He's...

491
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:50,189
I don't know.

492
00:32:51,808 --> 00:32:55,680
- I don't understand what you did here.
- I don't, either.

493
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:03,762
You should leave my office.

494
00:33:09,214 --> 00:33:12,001
And, and what?
What's gonna happen?

495
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:13,669
I don't know.

496
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:19,087
I don't know that this can be fixed.

497
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:36,895
I don't think you get it, Corey.

498
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:38,964
It's the end of the line for you.

499
00:33:38,964 --> 00:33:40,550
Joseph's alive.

500
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,497
And he's gonna testify
you killed Orlando.

501
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:46,252
Joseph raised from the dead?

502
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:48,643
Where is he?

503
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:50,568
Well, can I see him?

504
00:33:50,568 --> 00:33:52,105
You killed Orlando

505
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:54,517
'cause he knew what
was going on with you and Jane.

506
00:33:54,517 --> 00:33:56,707
You all are crazy.

507
00:33:56,707 --> 00:34:01,145
I'll say it again,
I didn't kill Orlando.

508
00:34:01,145 --> 00:34:03,678
You did, Corey.

509
00:34:05,096 --> 00:34:07,599
I saw you.

510
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:10,532
You're supposed to be dead, man!

511
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:13,570
- She told me.
- Who?

512
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,322
Corey, baby, what happened?

513
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:26,016
- You didn't do it, did you?
- I did it for you.

514
00:34:26,016 --> 00:34:27,682
What?

515
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:29,517
Orlando knew about us,

516
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:32,044
but I got rid of him
before he could tell anybody.

517
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:34,429
Jane, I protected you.

518
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,751
Because I love you.

519
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:42,885
Don't tell me that you don't 
feel like that, Jane, please.

520
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:47,725
I just...
I just wanted to comfort you,

521
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:50,873
to, to hold you. I'm...

522
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:53,687
I'm sorry.

523
00:34:55,778 --> 00:35:00,108
I bet you wouldn't want people talking about
how you touch the boys at Robinson house.

524
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:02,243
- What?
- Look...

525
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:04,221
I'm not saying it was 
like that with us, Jane,

526
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:06,345
but that's how people are gonna talk.

527
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:10,555
Don't say that about me.
Joseph saw me do it.

528
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:13,315
So you got to shut him up.

529
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:15,470
Please.

530
00:35:17,268 --> 00:35:20,735
Jane Robinson promised
she'd get rid of Joseph?

531
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:22,641
But she lied.

532
00:35:23,964 --> 00:35:25,893
I thought she loved me.

533
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:29,549
Well, she tried to kill him, man.
That make you feel better?

534
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:31,863
She still sends me things.

535
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,789
Sends me lots of things.

536
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:41,860
We got this.

537
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:00,805
So, um...

538
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:05,427
You know, this is weird.
I just feel...

539
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:07,569
Yeah, me, too.

540
00:36:07,903 --> 00:36:12,730
From the moment I saw you in my house,
holding a gun on me.

541
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,767
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

542
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:17,897
- It's, um...
- New?

543
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,065
So where will you go?

544
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:29,380
Oh. Farm for a while.

545
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,805
Should I...

546
00:36:31,805 --> 00:36:35,992
keep the door open,
in case you want to...

547
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:38,640
track me down?

548
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:44,947
Keep it locked.

549
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:49,412
All right. Okay.

550
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:52,847
I can break in if I need to.

551
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:58,894
My client has dedicated her life
to Robinson house.

552
00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:01,275
She has helped countless
teenagers kick addiction.

553
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:03,330
And took liberties
with at least one of them.

554
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,403
This is outrageous.
They can't say that to her.

555
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:07,823
You promised Corey you'd kill Joseph.

556
00:37:07,823 --> 00:37:12,735
You seriously take the word
of a deluded youth over my client's?

557
00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:15,350
What are these?

558
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,342
What are they doing?

559
00:37:17,342 --> 00:37:19,310
Your letters to Corey.

560
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,732
He saved them all.

561
00:37:22,518 --> 00:37:26,308
"Dear sweet boy, your letters 
cannot come soon enough."

562
00:37:26,308 --> 00:37:28,855
This one's from last week.

563
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:29,868
No.

564
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:32,338
"Dear Corey, the leaves are
falling from the trees,"

565
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:34,551
"and I know your birthday is coming."

566
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:36,307
"The first day of Fall."

567
00:37:36,307 --> 00:37:38,647
Writing concerned letters is not a crime.

568
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,763
She promised.

569
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:42,038
She promised what?

570
00:37:42,038 --> 00:37:44,882
It's Tom's birthday she's talking about.

571
00:37:44,882 --> 00:37:47,724
The first day of Fall.

572
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,275
Is your wife having problems?

573
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:54,332
She's been depressed...
since our son died.

574
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:57,913
This is why you killed Joseph Shaw?

575
00:37:57,913 --> 00:38:01,604
So you and Corey could keep
your little romance going?

576
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:04,098
We couldn't just 
slam the door in his face.

577
00:38:04,098 --> 00:38:06,304
So you shot Joseph.

578
00:38:06,304 --> 00:38:08,481
It's hard to picture
your wife hurting anyone.

579
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:10,835
She wouldn't, she can't.

580
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:12,467
Tell us, Jane!

581
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:14,635
All I ever wanted was to help him.

582
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:18,189
Jane, stop! Make them stop!

583
00:38:18,189 --> 00:38:20,349
It wasn't her, was it?

584
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:22,972
who took care of Joseph?

585
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,652
We survived the worst thing
parents can live through.

586
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:35,068
We were almost whole again,
and then that kid...

587
00:38:35,068 --> 00:38:38,585
she's all I have left, lieutenant.

588
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:42,434
I would do anything for her.

589
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,504
How could you do this?

590
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:52,195
You could go to jail.
He's 17!

591
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:55,466
- I want to save him.
- You can't.

592
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:59,817
This stops here.

593
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:02,504
This kid is not our son.

594
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:05,187
What about Joseph?

595
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:07,693
He'll tell.

596
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:15,386
I'll take care of that.

597
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,196
But you have got to pull it together.

598
00:39:18,196 --> 00:39:24,215
Starting tomorrow, no more of this.
No more Corey.

599
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:27,914
Okay.

600
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:30,684
No more sleeping all day,

601
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:34,183
and no more of this sadness.

602
00:39:37,236 --> 00:39:40,370
We can be happy.

603
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,996
'Cause that's what Tom would want.

604
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:53,633
I just miss him, Teddy.
I do.
