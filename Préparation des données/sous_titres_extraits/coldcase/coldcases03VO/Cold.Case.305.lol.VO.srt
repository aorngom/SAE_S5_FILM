1
00:00:00,298 --> 00:00:03,441
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:07,018 --> 00:00:09,492
June 24, 1954

3
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:15,043
Otis, maraschinos.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,581
- You want to do them?
- No, you, mom.

5
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:26,855
Yeah, yowie, I like how that looks.

6
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:30,930
- How do you like that, Otis?
- I like that.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,346
Now answer me truly,

8
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:34,146
after you've thought about it,
really thought about it,

9
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:35,344
and I don't want some
off the cuff routine,

10
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,632
I want it from your heart.
Are we done?

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,485
You think about it now, I mean it.

12
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:44,703
Let's make chocolate.
Let's make every kind of sweet ever.

13
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:47,529
Absolutely, little man!
Let's do it.

14
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:49,016
We can do anything we want

15
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:53,782
because we are running on a constantly
replenishing fuel of love.

16
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:56,259
- Do you understand that, Otis?
- Yes.

17
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,587
Put a trivet on the table quickly.

18
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,872
Dad's baked Alaska.

19
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:09,845
Your father loves this dessert, Otis.
It's beautiful.

20
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:16,009
How do eggs shape up to look like
the waves of the ocean, Otis?

21
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,077
Makes the world so small.

22
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:23,571
Everything alike, from
the chickens to the seaweed.

23
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:26,277
It's awful comforting.

24
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:34,536
I smell a forest fire.

25
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:48,221
It's so beautiful.
Do you see it?

26
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,302
These colors, Otis.

27
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:54,194
And to think we made this
from only eggs and love.

28
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:58,508
I've never seen anything like this.

29
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,136
Mom, it's burning!
Get some water!

30
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:07,486
It's okay, little man.
It can't hurt us.

31
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:10,964
It may be a miracle, I think.

32
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:09,327
This old lady dies
in her apartment in Fishtown.

33
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:11,550
M.E. tracks down the son
who's next of kin.

34
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,802
This a homicide?

35
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:14,552
Old age. Seems straightforward.

36
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:19,765
But the guy drives ten hours
from Ohio to ID this Bettie Petrowski.

37
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:22,558
Gets there, says,
"That ain't my mother."

38
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:23,935
Meaning what?

39
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:26,274
Meaning the old lady
on the slab's a fraud.

40
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:29,190
Ain't Bettie, but she's been using
her social security number like she is.

41
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,489
So where's the real Bettie?

42
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,999
Unaccounted for since 1954.

43
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,613
- Probably dead.
- Maybe murdered.

44
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:37,076
Lil has the guy looking
through Jane Does.

45
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:46,720
Detective Valens, Sutton,
this is Otis Petrowski.

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,705
Oh, hi.

47
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:51,443
Sorry, I'm, I'm blinking weird

48
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:53,662
because I've had these peepers
on for hours now.

49
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:55,899
So we're thinking whoever this is

50
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:57,843
might've killed your mom
in order to use her identity.

51
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:00,733
Yeah, well, that's why I'm flipping
through these books of the dead.

52
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:03,815
It would explain why Otis hasn't heard
from her since he was eight years old.

53
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:05,254
How'd you account for
that growing up?

54
00:04:05,254 --> 00:04:07,363
Well, my mother was
a mental patient.

55
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,370
She had a breakdown
when I was eight.

56
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,246
Almost burned down the house
with me in it,

57
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:14,451
so my father committed her
to the Philadelphia city asylum.

58
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:15,791
What was going on
with your mom?

59
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,747
Manic depression.
"Bipolar" is the new term.

60
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:20,727
After she was committed,
you didn't see her anymore?

61
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,390
Yeah, well, we visited her
a few times,

62
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,735
but me and my dad went our own way.

63
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,473
He got married again.

64
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:27,986
You ever try to find your mom?

65
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,946
I mean, it's not like
I didn't toy with it,

66
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:31,591
but I figured she forgot about me.

67
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:35,907
Same way she forgot she shouldn't
be setting fires around your kid.

68
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:41,567
I don't need to look at that twice.

69
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:49,872
- This is your mom?
- That's her face.

70
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:55,218
- You don't forget.
- Jane Doe #17. Killed Winter of '54.

71
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:57,238
We only committed her that summer.

72
00:04:57,238 --> 00:05:00,873
So if this is the real Bettie Petrowski.

73
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:03,729
Who's Frannie got in there?

74
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:43,784
Scotty.

75
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:46,183
What's up, Jo?

76
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:48,425
She's wiping us clean
at poker is what.

77
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,583
Soft players here in homicide.

78
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:54,679
Guy's not parked outside
your house anymore, is he?

79
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,213
- He's keeping his distance.
- Good.

80
00:05:57,213 --> 00:06:00,392
I got to run.
Nice seeing you, Gil. / Yeah.

81
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,485
What's that about?

82
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:06,483
Sergeant White.
Guy's a real piece of work.

83
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,354
Yeah, I heard rumors.
So they had a thing?

84
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:12,210
Yeah, only in his head.
Sexual harassment thing.

85
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,524
You saying she filed
a report on him?

86
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:17,162
She didn't have to.
Guy made a spectacle of himself.

87
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:19,225
Because everyone around here
thought it was the other way,

88
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,354
- her stirring it up.
- No, this White didn't need to get stirred.

89
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:26,469
She's lucky to get transferred out.
Leave that behind.

90
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:33,815
The Jane Doe this guy
ID'd as his mom was found dead

91
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:37,222
in Fairmount park December 28.

92
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,307
Blunt force trauma to the skull.

93
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:41,061
No ID, no personal effects.

94
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,092
Theory was Jane Doe's a drifter,
killed by another drifter.

95
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:47,436
No one ever made the connect that
this Jane Doe was a mental patient.

96
00:06:47,436 --> 00:06:48,477
She'd already checked out.

97
00:06:48,477 --> 00:06:50,783
Bettie Petrowski was signed out
of Philadelphia city asylum

98
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:55,274
by nurse Anika Olsen
on December 26, 1954.

99
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:57,329
That's two days before
the body was found.

100
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,858
Family's gone, out of the hospital.

101
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:00,570
It's got to be a lonely time for Bettie.

102
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,828
People lined up to take advantage
of a woman in that position.

103
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:05,695
Not to mention who she
might've met in the hospital.

104
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:08,751
Rooming with loonies, some of them
could've been head-bashing types.

105
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,997
Let's talk to this nurse.

106
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,973
See if Otis can tell us
anything about the hospital.

107
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:15,402
What about the Jane Doe 2005,
the one Frannie's got?

108
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,495
Survey her neighborhood in Fishtown.

109
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,217
You got to figure we ID this Jane Doe,

110
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:21,937
we're that much closer
to finding Bettie's killer.

111
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:30,813
My, my daughter jumped in the car
when she heard I was coming here.

112
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:35,363
Wouldn't get out. / That's nice of you.
Keeping your dad company.

113
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:37,403
I want to learn
about my grandmother.

114
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:40,010
My thing is, just because
someone's manic depressive,

115
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,245
doesn't mean the family
has to, like, hide her.

116
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:44,890
All right, all right,
we know what you think.

117
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,667
Otis, what can you
tell us about city asylum?

118
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,067
Your mom have any trouble there?

119
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,661
Talk about problems with anyone?

120
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:52,572
Oh, no, my mother never complained.

121
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,452
Especially in her up moods.

122
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,749
Her world was sunshine and roses.

123
00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:00,995
I read on the internet bipolar people
can have full-on hallucinations.

124
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:04,968
So she might not have seen a dangerous
situation for what it was.

125
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:07,882
You know, the day we committed her,
that was definitely true.

126
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:09,384
What didn't she see that day?

127
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:12,975
The lunatics crawling up the walls,
she was sharing with them.

128
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:20,839
Your mommy will have a wonderful,
relaxing time here at our hospital.

129
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,609
Dr. Paquette is a superior doctor.

130
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:25,808
He'll treat your mommy himself.

131
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:28,655
Won't that be nice for her?

132
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,185
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, Otis.

133
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:35,529
This place is really something
else, don't you think?

134
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,752
Look at all these
different kinds of people.

135
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:41,689
I bet I'll come home with
all kinds of stories for you.

136
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,563
Hey, you want to know
what I want to do?

137
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:46,662
I want you and me to take
our own tour of this place.

138
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,527
I want to explore.

139
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,201
I want to know every inch of it.

140
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,889
Stay away from me, fascists!

141
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,793
Her painting is horrifying.
Grab it!

142
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:55,880
Carmen, stop right there.

143
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,863
Come any closer and I'll show
the painting to the kid.

144
00:08:57,863 --> 00:09:01,810
No! It's got a lady...
with a zipper for a mouth.

145
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,442
Hear that?
This girl's a painter, Otis.

146
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:06,771
I have been in a fever
working on this.

147
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:09,356
It's a vision of
what's happening to us.

148
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,951
I plan to hang it on the wall and say,
"Good morning, you."

149
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,414
"It's another day in this
dreadful place."

150
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:17,834
"Hold on for dear life."

151
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,174
You're running out of
chances, Carmen.

152
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:23,384
I'll show it to him.
I swear I will.

153
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:25,576
Do it.

154
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:27,551
Can I take a peek?

155
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,397
Well, I bet it's just
out of this world.

156
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:34,126
Bettie.
Simmer down.

157
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:40,380
It's beautiful.

158
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,803
It's so sad.

159
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:52,420
You lost it.
You lost it!

160
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,669
I hate you!

161
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,116
If someone took my poetry away,

162
00:09:58,116 --> 00:10:00,550
I would totally be in a mental hospital.

163
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,785
You would totally be in law school.

164
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:07,088
So this Carmen's doing these
disturbing paintings of women.

165
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:09,761
- It was a metaphor.
- It was twisted.

166
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:12,361
Kids at school used to ask me,
"Where's your mother?"

167
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,128
What was I supposed to say?

168
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:18,647
"Taking retreat with a maniac painter
and assorted psychos"?

169
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:21,904
I used to say mine was on tour
with a rock band.

170
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:24,521
So Carmen was pretty upset
with your mom.

171
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:26,964
Foaming at the mouth.

172
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:29,119
After seeing that girl
and her painting,

173
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:32,603
I thought for sure my mom
would meet her end at that place.

174
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:41,374
Nurse Olsen, you were the last person
to see Bettie Petrowski alive.

175
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:45,650
You signed her out yourself from
the Philadelphia city asylum.

176
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,877
Everyone who came or went
did so through me.

177
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:53,292
I was a one-woman security check.

178
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,550
What can you tell us about Bettie
the day she left?

179
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,424
She wore the clothes she came in with.

180
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:03,642
She was in good spirits.

181
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:05,858
Insisted on leaving...

182
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:09,497
in spite of the fact that there were
no family members there to meet her.

183
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:11,870
- Good memory on you.
- True.

184
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,521
Was she worried about anything?

185
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:18,462
Happy to leave.
They usually were.

186
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:20,368
Did Bettie make any
enemies durning her stay?

187
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:22,864
Of course.

188
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:25,904
120 women in the same building

189
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:30,328
with only the task of recovery
to busy their idle minds.

190
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:32,700
We talking cat fights?

191
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,291
Cannibalism.

192
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,890
You remember a girl named Carmen?

193
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:44,200
Carmen was explosive,
moody, distorted view of reality.

194
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,550
But it was Zelda that
Bettie was truly afraid of.

195
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:50,816
Some days I can't get out of bed.

196
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:52,656
I've tried storing
casseroles in the freezer

197
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:55,424
so that the boys
will always have supper.

198
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,054
Look at me now, babbling.

199
00:11:58,054 --> 00:12:02,210
- Oh, please go on.
- Zelda, it's not your turn to speak.

200
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:05,439
My son's the only thing
for certain I've done right.

201
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:07,971
Now I think he's afraid of me.

202
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:12,331
I thought you were
gonna die at the end.

203
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,590
That's the only kind
of story I like.

204
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,989
You're absolutely vile, Zelda.

205
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:20,271
- I won't listen to it.
- Can it, ankle biter.

206
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:23,019
- Give that back.
- What? This?

207
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:26,932
It's mine. My son gave it to me
the day I came here.

208
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:30,564
It's all I have of him here.
Please.

209
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:34,579
Then what do I get, huh?

210
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,832
You've got everything I want.
Why can't I get one lousy stinking thing?

211
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:40,456
Zelda, on the count of three,
will you sit down with your arms

212
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,838
- crossed  across your chest.
- If you bring the guards in here,

213
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,546
- I'll absolutely faint.
- One.

214
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:45,590
- I will!
- Sit with me, Annie.

215
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,403
I got a kid didn't make
it past two months,

216
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:48,635
- Two.
- And a cripple husband.

217
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,860
That's it, guards! / That's because
you pushed him down the stairs.

218
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,640
- No, you didn'T.
- I did. He irked me, like you do.

219
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,099
Maybe I ought to do an encore.

220
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:06,168
So then Zelda was jealous
of Bettie's life.

221
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:08,548
Anything'd be better than her own.

222
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:11,282
Good motive for the identity theft.

223
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:13,781
What happened to this Zelda?

224
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:16,106
- She still committed?
- Oh, no.

225
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:18,205
She was too tricky for that.

226
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:21,957
So she got out, despite
there being bats in the belfry?

227
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:25,675
She persuaded Dr. Paquette,
the chief of medicine.

228
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:27,805
How, I don't dare imagine.

229
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:29,723
I signed her out myself.

230
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,763
When was that?

231
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,615
The morning Bettie was released.

232
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:39,592
And there's her opportunity.

233
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:52,017
- Zelda Amatuzzi? Philly P.D.
- Oh, Zelda?

234
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:58,196
We want to talk to you about
Bettie Petrowski.

235
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:00,082
Yeah, you knew her
at city asylum.

236
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:04,385
Yes, he said asylum.
Carry on.

237
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:08,285
We got people telling us
you hated Bettie,

238
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:10,754
threatened to kill her,
like you tried to do your husband.

239
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:15,762
Hey, if a worthless,
drunk son of a bitch

240
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:20,465
falls down the stairs
and no one's around, did he really fall?

241
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:24,261
According to the police report, yes,
and at your hand.

242
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,762
Maybe you waited for her
outside the hospital,

243
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:28,794
got her back for having
what you didn't.

244
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,813
I didn't hate Bettie.

245
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:32,737
Get yourselves up to date, will you?

246
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,281
Well, do us the honors, Zelda.

247
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:36,829
Bettie stuck up for me.

248
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:42,583
She made those other hens realize
that I wasn't just loony as they thought.

249
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,635
Paint by numbers.

250
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:52,719
I feel like a trained seal.

251
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:56,100
-  Carmen!
- Yes, Bettie?

252
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,681
Come take a peek.

253
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:03,187
Carmen, that is delightfully creative.

254
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:06,060
- This thing? I don't know.
- I like it.

255
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,639
Hey, bones, you could
use some of this food.

256
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,708
Carmen had private art lessons
with famous artists,

257
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,960
because her family's
got railroad money.

258
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,116
Ah, which they put to good use
keeping me locked away in here.

259
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:21,692
Why are you here, Carmen?

260
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:24,578
I paint nude ladies and skeletons,

261
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:27,898
and sometimes derelicts with
a bottle of booze in their hands.

262
00:15:27,898 --> 00:15:31,299
I'm a pervert and a ne'er-do-well,

263
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,335
- can't you tell?
- If you're a pervert,

264
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:35,208
I'm Mamie Eisenhower.

265
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,705
Everybody, can it!

266
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:39,552
I hear him.

267
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,624
Oh, all I wanna do is dance.

268
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,780
- Oh, here she goes.
- What is it?

269
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,006
You're imagining things, Zelda.

270
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:49,273
- She thinks she hears Elvis Presley.
- Who?

271
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:52,915
- He sings negro music.
- He invades my dreams.

272
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:57,522
More like your head. / At least I don't
have knee bones wider than my head.

273
00:15:57,522 --> 00:16:00,225
I hear it, too!

274
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:03,752
- Hello.
- Anton.

275
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:06,922
Woo-ee, there he is.

276
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:27,506
That's when Anton got his
new hobby, Bettie Petrowski.

277
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:30,265
- So he pursued her?
- Like a dog on a scent.

278
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:31,768
He know she was married?

279
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:36,847
He'd strut around telling all of us
he'd be the one to turn her head.

280
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:41,705
- Did she return the feelings?
- It's 1954.

281
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:46,942
A young black kid's got the hots
for a white married lady older than him.

282
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:50,074
You think he had
a snowball's chance?

283
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:58,002
Let's talk about Bettie Petrowski.

284
00:16:58,002 --> 00:17:01,089
We heard you had it bad for her.

285
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:02,506
She was a nice lady.

286
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:04,799
Well, Bettie was killed, you know.

287
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,524
Skull bashed in, over her right eye,
an act of rage.

288
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,748
I don't know anything about that.

289
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:14,782
Ah, it must've hurt, Anton,
when you realized it didn't matter

290
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:17,408
if these ladies were locked up,
sick in the head,

291
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:20,356
you still weren't gonna
be good enough for them.

292
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:23,748
You were just the black boy
changing the sheets, right?

293
00:17:23,748 --> 00:17:25,823
No, it wasn't like that
in the hospital.

294
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:29,325
- How was it?
- We could be friends.

295
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:31,401
Way we couldn't on the outside.

296
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:35,438
But you didn't want to settle
for just friends with Bettie.

297
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:38,824
Bettie was devoted to her
husband and her boy.

298
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:43,124
Said that they were what
kept her going in there.

299
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:45,971
Oh, come on.
I'm a romantic.

300
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:50,252
- You two got close.
- Yeah.

301
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:53,710
Bettie got real low
a few weeks in.

302
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,356
They gave her hydrobath treatment.

303
00:17:56,356 --> 00:18:00,195
- What's that?
- Well, it's bathtubs full of ice,

304
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:05,136
girls would have to soak in.
Supposed to snap you out of depression.

305
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:07,932
I looked after her then.

306
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:09,659
Learned about her.

307
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:20,409
Bettie's not moving, Anton.
Take her out.

308
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,589
Wait. Not yet.
It'll help her soon enough.

309
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:25,361
Have you had it?
Because I have.

310
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:27,574
- It don't work.
- All right, girls.

311
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,032
- I'm going in.
- Anton.

312
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:51,362
There you go.

313
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:58,963
Bettie?

314
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:02,469
That's it.

315
00:19:02,469 --> 00:19:04,476
Let me out.

316
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,196
I'm not supposed to.

317
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:12,374
Zelda wanted me to give you this.

318
00:19:13,996 --> 00:19:19,060
All your friends are all
thinking about you, Bettie. / Otis.

319
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,795
Why don't you tell me about Otis?

320
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:25,073
Tell me your favorite time with him.

321
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:27,468
At the park.

322
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:29,153
At the park.

323
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:31,065
We went to the swings.

324
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,109
My little sisters love that.

325
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:37,973
- It started to rain.
- Oh, no.

326
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:43,092
Warm rain.
Spring.

327
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:46,351
Everybody ran to their cars.

328
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,842
Not you?

329
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:52,839
Otis wanted to stay.

330
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:55,548
We did.

331
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:58,409
We stayed.

332
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:01,352
That's wonderful, Bettie.

333
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,183
Let's get you out.

334
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,854
You're all better now.

335
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:29,580
What is this?

336
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,713
What am I looking at?
Hey! What are you two doing?

337
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:35,267
- You put her down.
- I was making her warm, sir.

338
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:39,034
You do not touch her.
Bettie, Bettie, you look at me.

339
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:40,092
She's not feeling well, sir.

340
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:42,575
- She's been in the tub...
- Get out!

341
00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:48,488
What are you doing to me?

342
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:52,389
You better run, boy.

343
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:55,081
He looked at me

344
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:58,503
and I thought I was a dead man.

345
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:04,240
The husband ever follow up
with you? / No.

346
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,251
Maybe he didn't
take it out on you.

347
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:09,824
Took it out on Bettie.

348
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:23,094
Hey, your car still out?
I can get you home again.

349
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:30,155
No, thanks.

350
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,144
Me and Will were just leaving.

351
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:34,823
You two have a nice night.

352
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:38,988
What are you doing?

353
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:40,398
Offering a ride.

354
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:44,083
Maybe keep the charity
out of Vera's earshot.

355
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,450
Ah, they're giving us grief.
It's nothing.

356
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,783
It's nothing when they do it to you.

357
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:55,276
You're not doing yourself any favors,

358
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:58,914
clamming up about what happened
with that sergeant White.

359
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:02,089
Sherman filled me in.
Why don't you tell the truth?

360
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:05,191
Because Vera and them are walking around
thinking you're something you're not.

361
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:08,492
Some thing? Like what?

362
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:12,901
A slut?

363
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:15,848
- Yeah, all right. But you're not.
- Yeah.

364
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:20,087
I'm saying it'd be easier for you here
if people knew the truth.

365
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:24,155
Every guy I've worked with,
cops, you guys...

366
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:26,690
you guys mess around,
you get around.

367
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,755
- You said it about yourself.
- I've made mistakes.

368
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:31,265
And whatever you did,

369
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,510
no one gives you
the up and down in the office,

370
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,885
like you don't deserve to be here.

371
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:36,288
No one thinks that about you.

372
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,604
You don't have to make a presentation
about personal stuff.

373
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:41,710
None of you guys do.

374
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,963
Why should I?

375
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:47,259
It could help you.

376
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:53,017
I'm not helping myself that way.

377
00:22:55,775 --> 00:23:00,103
- Jo, let me drive you.
- I'm walking.

378
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:12,694
Otis, your dad may have thought
your mother was having an affair

379
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:16,154
with a hospital orderly,
a young black guy.

380
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,094
A couple of obvious problems there.

381
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:20,880
No way.
My mom was nuts about my dad.

382
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,984
She loved him like crazy.
Like crazy.

383
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:28,511
Your mother took good care
of that cowboy you gave her.

384
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:33,041
Everyone we talked to mentions her
having it around all the time.

385
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:37,641
I gave it to her to protect her.

386
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:40,943
Maybe this is why mom says you
have trouble showing your feelings.

387
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:45,898
- Because of losing grandma.
- Great. You two analyzing me.

388
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:52,173
Otis, did your dad ever show any violent
tendencies? Any temper problems?

389
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:55,789
My father wouldn't have lost his head
about some orderly, no.

390
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:56,911
How do you know?

391
00:23:56,911 --> 00:24:01,473
Because by then, my dad knew
he had to move on from my mom.

392
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:11,417
Otis asked me
when you're coming home.

393
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,363
I don't want to lie to him anymore.

394
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:16,393
Then tell the hospital
it's time for me to go.

395
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:20,228
- You're not better.
- They said they'd cure me.

396
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:23,303
Doctor said it's manic depression.

397
00:24:23,303 --> 00:24:26,057
- There is no cure.
- Not yet.

398
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:28,188
You don't know what
they'll come up with next.

399
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:32,730
- What do me and Otis do until then?
- Put up with me?

400
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,875
- You almost killed our son in a fire.
- I'm sorry.

401
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:45,089
What is it, Terrence?

402
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:49,480
I met a lady at church.

403
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:56,366
Look, I've got to make
a good home for Otis.

404
00:24:56,366 --> 00:25:00,901
- I can't raise him on my own.
- We're being punished.

405
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:02,861
Me and the girls for something
I did in art class.

406
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:05,535
Terrence, I don't think I'll survive it
if I don't have Otis to come home to.

407
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:08,223
You're not good for him, Bettie.

408
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,368
You can't.

409
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:22,949
I guess I'm no good to him sick.

410
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:26,354
And there's no cure for that.

411
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:33,501
I want Otis to have
the best life there is. Promise.

412
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,944
Promise me straight
from the heart, Terrence.

413
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:38,818
He'll get the best.

414
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:41,717
I promise, Bettie.

415
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:49,559
All right.

416
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:59,074
Otis, let's go.

417
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,839
That's okay, little man,
you can take him.

418
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,266
You give him to me next time, mom.

419
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,626
I love you.

420
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:17,961
Won't you hug your old mom?

421
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,765
What was she being punished for?

422
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:38,230
- I don't know.
- Otis, when was this?

423
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,480
- Right before Christmas.
- Right before your mom died, right?

424
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,843
Bettie said it was
she and the girls.

425
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:49,623
Maybe Zelda knows who was
being punished and why.

426
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:58,699
We heard Bettie and her friends were
by the hospital right around Christmas.

427
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,895
Something involving art class?

428
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:05,616
- That something involve you?
- Yeah, it usually did.

429
00:27:05,616 --> 00:27:08,361
You're talking about
Bettie's big idea.

430
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:09,851
What do you mean?

431
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:15,830
You see, Bettie had this wacky idea that
we needed some culture for our brains,

432
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:21,385
and that Carmen would be the one
supplying it vis-a-vis art class.

433
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:26,835
So, Carmen, the rich one,
she was the art teacher?

434
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:32,263
But it was Bettie that got her heart set
on making this a real class.

435
00:27:32,263 --> 00:27:34,637
- Real, huh?
- Yeah.

436
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:38,675
And, uh, that's how
Carmen got ruined.

437
00:27:39,998 --> 00:27:42,396
I need to stop giggling.

438
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:44,618
This place echoes like a church.

439
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:47,550
I'm ready.
Consider me an artiste.

440
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,118
Okay, we've been talking
about the human form.

441
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:53,263
Last time we did line drawings
of each other's faces.

442
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:56,350
Bettie did a very
beautiful drawing of Annie.

443
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,036
Tonight we move on to the body.

444
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:02,023
Depicting the nude
is an ancient tradition in art.

445
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:06,662
Where artists sought to depict
a more idealized human form.

446
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:09,656
I'll say.
Betty, you're a genius.

447
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:14,551
It is said Michelangelo believed
that the figure of David already existed

448
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:17,087
inside the block of stone
he was carving.

449
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:22,240
And that his art
would merely set David free.

450
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,702
Carmen, I think we're ready
to be set free.

451
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:28,891
I think I'll faint.

452
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:38,666
- Carmen!
- Oh, bones, just take a deep breath.

453
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,946
No.

454
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:45,050
This is absolutely forbidden.
Absolutely against the...

455
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,519
Holy Moses.

456
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:51,196
Mr. De La Rosa.

457
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:55,545
Say good-bye, Carmen.
This was your last chance. / No.

458
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,793
It was my idea.

459
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:05,219
It was Carmen's last chance for what?

460
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:12,930
It was after that, that the hospital
and her family decided it was time

461
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,613
for Carmen to have her lobotomy.

462
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:18,654
Because of the art class?

463
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:21,738
The nude black man
pushed them over the edge.

464
00:29:21,738 --> 00:29:23,618
How'd Carmen feel about getting the...

465
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:25,614
The old ice pick through the eye?

466
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:27,658
What do you think?

467
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:35,168
It was the end of her world.

468
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:51,880
So this is how it is now?

469
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,323
What? / You work with someone,
you need eye contact.

470
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:03,530
It's your own business.
You're right. / Thanks.

471
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,991
- I didn't mean to make you upset.
- All right.

472
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:09,003
As far as you being
part of things here,

473
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:12,784
you've been real good.
Everyone sees you pulling your weight.

474
00:30:12,784 --> 00:30:15,540
I'm trying.

475
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:22,004
Okay.
It's peace?

476
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:24,854
Peace.

477
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:37,178
- I can't do this.
- No, I know.

478
00:30:37,178 --> 00:30:39,524
- I can't afford it.
- Me neither.

479
00:30:39,524 --> 00:30:43,148
So don't look at me like that.

480
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,271
I won't.

481
00:30:51,212 --> 00:30:54,246
Stand aside.

482
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,809
Done and done.

483
00:31:17,365 --> 00:31:20,807
Hospital records say Carmen went in for
the lobotomy, but never checked out.

484
00:31:20,807 --> 00:31:24,493
I ran her name down every which way,
no trace of her after that.

485
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:27,734
Here's why.
The old lady I brought Otis in to see,

486
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:31,455
- she's Carmen Hays.
- Confirmed it from dental records.

487
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:35,658
- So Carmen stole Bettie's identity.
- But here's what's screwy.

488
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:39,138
Carmen's body?
no trace of a lobotomy.

489
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:41,178
So she got out of it somehow.

490
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:44,022
Something interesting
with Bettie's remains, though.

491
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:46,960
This bone was broken when
Bettie's body was found in '54.

492
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,733
Autopsy report said that was
cause of death, blunt force trauma.

493
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:55,189
But this break is clean.
Consistent with a surgical break.

494
00:31:55,771 --> 00:31:58,520
Bettie's the one
who had the lobotomy.

495
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,329
So Bettie goes under the knife,
Carmen walks free using Bettie's name.

496
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:06,955
- How's this get past nurse Olsen?
- The one-woman security check.

497
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:10,149
She would have known
Carmen from Bettie.

498
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:12,507
She was in on it.

499
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:17,200
Nurse Olsen, let me ask you.

500
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,204
You notice anything different
about Bettie Petrowski

501
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,114
when you signed her out
of the hospital?

502
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:26,669
Different? / Like maybe she's not
the same person she used to be?

503
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:29,010
Like maybe she's Carmen?

504
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:34,011
Look, you know what
we're talking about.

505
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:37,259
No one checked in or out of that
hospital without going through you.

506
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:40,807
- That's true.
- And Bettie Petrowski checked out.

507
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:42,374
Only it was really carmen.

508
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:44,083
You helped her escape
with Bettie's name.

509
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,472
Why would I do that?

510
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:47,276
The Hays family was flush.

511
00:32:47,276 --> 00:32:49,360
Carmen would have
compensated you nicely.

512
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,545
I did not do anything for Carmen.

513
00:32:51,545 --> 00:32:55,633
Then how do you explain her getting out
and Bettie getting her lobotomy?

514
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:59,913
You put your professional opinion aside,
and gave Carmen what she paid you for.

515
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:03,268
You're wrong. It was my decision
as a medical professional.

516
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:05,468
To lobotomize Bettie?

517
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:08,543
You have to understand.

518
00:33:08,543 --> 00:33:11,399
At the time we thought
it was the cure.

519
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:17,517
- Absolutely not, Bettie.
- Wait. Hear me out.

520
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:21,301
I told her you'd never do it,
Bettie. Just stop. / No. I won't!

521
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:24,845
Dr. Freeman is the foremost
lobotomist in the country.

522
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:27,368
He is only in Philadelphia
twice a year.

523
00:33:27,368 --> 00:33:30,320
I'm saying Carmen doesn't
want it, but I do.

524
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,833
Let him take me.

525
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:35,032
I'm the one who needs to be cured.
There's nothing wrong with Carmen.

526
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:37,200
You are not a doctor, Bettie.

527
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,637
Carmen's only problem is she's
trapped here by her family

528
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:43,797
and can't show the world her art.
Wouldn't you like that, Carmen?

529
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:47,676
- I don't need to be famous.
- But you need to be free.

530
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:49,806
And the world needs you.

531
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:52,303
How many people can
make pictures like yours?

532
00:33:52,303 --> 00:33:55,183
I don't feel right about this, Bettie.
This is harebrained, isn't it?

533
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:57,090
No. I've read it.

534
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,883
Lobotomy's meant to even out your moods.
That's what I need,

535
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:03,595
so I can see my Otis again.
Please.

536
00:34:03,595 --> 00:34:07,511
Nurse, you said
Dr. Freeman's the best. / He is.

537
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:09,319
This is my last chance.

538
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:12,959
If I wait, Otis'll be moved on with
another mother, a lady from church.

539
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:14,609
And I'll have to let him go.

540
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:17,195
All I want to do is paint.

541
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:19,757
All I want is Otis.

542
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:24,831
I'm sure.

543
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,211
Something in your plan
didn't go right,

544
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:32,927
because Bettie never saw Otis again.

545
00:34:33,796 --> 00:34:38,229
- The snowstorm ruined our plan.
- How?

546
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:41,774
Roads were closed.

547
00:34:41,774 --> 00:34:45,671
So instead of Bettie going to the private
hospital that Carmen had paid for,

548
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:51,279
she was brought back to city asylum
after the lobotomy.

549
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:54,561
That's when Dr. Paquette got involved.

550
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:56,587
The head of the hospital?

551
00:34:57,543 --> 00:35:00,501
What did he do?

552
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:05,702
To protect the hospital
and his reputation...

553
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,806
he...

554
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:17,928
he made Anton clean up my mess.

555
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:32,940
Anton.

556
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:38,872
Did Dr. Paquette tell you
to kill Bettie Petrowski?

557
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:43,181
- I don't remember that.
- You were her friend, Anton.

558
00:35:43,181 --> 00:35:47,976
You cared about her.
Don't tell me this doesn't eat at you.

559
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:50,845
He said to get rid of her.

560
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:54,041
Said nobody would miss her, anyhow.

561
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:59,025
Otis missed her.

562
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:05,496
I thought I could save myself...
and my little sisters.

563
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,040
But I made a bargain
with the devil that day.

564
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:16,864
What happened? / He told me he'd use
the art class against me...

565
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:21,988
turn it into a sexual allegation.

566
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:27,986
If I went to jail, there'd be nobody
to take care of my sisters.

567
00:36:29,952 --> 00:36:35,442
- Where'd you take her?
- She was like a child.

568
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:41,340
Couldn't fend for herself.

569
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:46,597
I put her in my truck.

570
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:52,770
She couldn't understand
where we were going.

571
00:36:55,118 --> 00:37:00,977
I don't know if Otis
still remembers this,

572
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:06,862
but I always thought it should
go back to him some way.

573
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:16,170
What'd you do with her, Anton?

574
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:21,621
I tried to be merciful.

575
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,021
It's all right, Bettie.

576
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:36,650
Isn't it beautiful outside?

577
00:37:39,112 --> 00:37:41,993
It's not so bad.

578
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:47,611
Not so bad.

579
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:13,703
The park?
That's the park.

580
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:17,772
Otis...

581
00:38:22,756 --> 00:38:25,854
All right, Bettie.

582
00:38:47,763 --> 00:38:51,352
Remember when you and Otis
went to the park?

583
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:54,153
And it started to rain?

584
00:38:54,153 --> 00:38:59,472
Everybody else wanted to go to
their car, but not Otis.

585
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,723
You want to go on down there?

586
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:07,948
- Go on out to the swings?
- Yes.

587
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,620
Okay.

588
00:39:17,844 --> 00:39:21,588
It was springtime, Bettie, remember?

589
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:23,980
It was a warm rain.

590
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:29,507
Just like now.
So you won't be cold.

591
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:34,211
Go ahead now.

592
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,440
* the PlattersÀÇ 'Only you' *

593
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:59,507
