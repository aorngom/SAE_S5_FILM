The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,279
November 25, 1999

3
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:10,615
You didn't tell me
these rows would ache, Ma.

4
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:11,836
Fashion hurts.

5
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:13,358
Hurts my eyes, Lutheretta.

6
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,908
Lutheretta? You calling me a girl?

7
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:18,728
It don't look too tough,
that's all.

8
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:21,226
I like it Lu.
There we go.

9
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:25,899
Look at the poster and tell me
I don't look like "The answer".

10
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,331
You look like Brandy.

11
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:34,511
Hey.
Cedric,

12
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:37,480
I saw that.
He needs his strength.

13
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,762
And it's Thanksgiving for him, too.

14
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:42,149
Can I have the wishbone, Vaughn?

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,368
Man, what you gonna wish for?

16
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:46,361
I don't know. Lot's of things.

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,031
First we say thanks.

18
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:59,554
Lord, we are grateful for
the meal we're about to receive.

19
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:02,123
And the blessings of family.

20
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:06,368
For Vaughn who stepped into
his daddy's shoes after his passing,

21
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,716
and for Cedric,

22
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,439
always bringing home his
stray mutts and whatnot.

23
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,191
He ain't a mutt.

24
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,928
And for Quincy, my dreamer,

25
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:18,415
head in the coulds
and Luther the handsome

26
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,015
who don't look like Brandy

27
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,351
- much.
- Hey.

28
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:28,934
And finally for our baby Patrick,
let him get any wish he wants.

29
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:33,154
- And for you, too, Ma.
- And for me, too.

30
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:35,698
Amen.

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,584
Vaughn Bubley, 1999

32
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:58,997
Cedric Bubley, 2001

33
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:09,792
Quincy Bubley, 2003

34
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,593
Yo, if I'm being held, I want a lawyer,
you know what I'm saying?

35
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:45,745
Hey, you wanna talk about
the murders just went down and talk.

36
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:47,557
Otherwise shut up
until we get to you.

37
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:50,642
- Yo, I ain't seen no murders.
- You sit on that stoop all day

38
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:52,427
and you missed these gangsters
trading shots?

39
00:02:52,427 --> 00:02:55,199
You know, screw all the cops
all right, a thousand times.

40
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,232
That's good attitude, doughboy.

41
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,812
Hey, boss,
we're back on the line tonight?

42
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:06,331
Oh, they got a triple,
they need all the help they can get.

43
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:10,102
- Quiet out here, huh?
- Little slice of paradise.

44
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,925
What went down?  / 9th Street gang
had a shoot out with the O's.

45
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:15,643
- What's the score?
- 3 dead, 1 wounded.

46
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:17,679
All gangsters,
community service workers.

47
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,134
- Anybody talking?
- A lot of talk, no help.

48
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:24,862
No!  Luther! Is that Luther?
I need to go. That's my boy out there!

49
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:27,763
Do you understand me?

50
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:31,980
My boy is out there.
That is my son.

51
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,334
- I know her.
- Yeah?

52
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:38,341
Her son died,
it was my first homicide.

53
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:40,148
Practically makes you friends.

54
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:42,784
Maybe she'll talk to you.

55
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:44,617
You get out of my face!

56
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,036
Get out of my face!

57
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:48,831
OK, hey, hey, Mrs. Bubley,

58
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:50,656
- you remember me?
- I gotta get past this tape.

59
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,912
You can't do that right now.

60
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:54,180
I'm Detective Rush,
I worked your son's murder.

61
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,373
Which son?

62
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,878
It was in '99.

63
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,052
- Vaughn.
- Right. Vaughn.

64
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,805
And now we lost Luther.

65
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:06,973
I'm so sorry.

66
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:10,269
Don't be sorry little girl,
just get out of my way.

67
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,728
Any idea who might have
done this to him?

68
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,488
- Why you gonna solve this murder?
- We're gonna try.

69
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:17,940
Like you solved Vaughn's?
Or Cedric's or Quincy's?

70
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,410
- You lost four sons?
- Patrick's all I got left.

71
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,379
And if he gets gunned down,
you won't solve his murder either.

72
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:10,398
- Sutton come?
- Took a leave.

73
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:14,209
- Yeah? She say why?
- Just said it was personal.

74
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:19,878
Four out of five brothers dead.

75
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:23,256
All shot in Fairhill, all unsolved.

76
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,253
Mother give you any help on
who killed them?

77
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:27,971
Mother gave me crap.
Hates cops.

78
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:30,474
So, the shooting last night.

79
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:32,819
There's another turf war
between the O's and the 9th Streeters?

80
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,026
Looks that way but
the gang unit says the leader of the O's

81
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:39,190
Miguel Maldonado has some kind of
running feud with the Bubley family.

82
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,459
What about?

83
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,724
Don't know but Miguel's name

84
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,309
was in every one of these boxes
as a person of interest.

85
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,186
So you think he's behind
all the murders?

86
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:49,180
What if Luther didn't just
get caught up in a turf war last night,

87
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,160
maybe it was perosnal?

88
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,539
The problem is Miguel's untouchable.

89
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,476
'Cause snitches get stiches.

90
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:57,421
He is known as a real sadist.

91
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:59,786
Well there's one brother left.
Patrick.

92
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:02,678
You get anyone to finger
Miguel for these jobs we put him away.

93
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,834
Solve one Bubley murder,

94
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,120
solve them all.

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,490
And maybe keep Patrick from
joining his brothers here.

96
00:06:18,472 --> 00:06:20,097
Ow! What the hell?

97
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:23,714
Why did Luther Bubley
shoot you, Carlos?

98
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:26,735
I didn't see no one shoot no one.

99
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:29,155
We got prelimenary ballistics back.

100
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:33,735
So? / So Luther's gun put that
hole in your leg.

101
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,415
Maybe he shot me.

102
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:39,747
Ain't no thing.

103
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:43,637
And your boys shot him up
outside that market.

104
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:49,942
Your boss Miguel tell you
to kill Luther

105
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,036
over his problem with the Bubley's?

106
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:56,331
Bubley's ain't nothing to Miguel.

107
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,785
So why is he killin' 'em off?

108
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:58,931
You're the police,

109
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,040
you can't be gettin' all torture
chamber on me.

110
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,326
Sorry, what?

111
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:04,690
- My leg!
- Your what?

112
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,438
OK, OK, OK, damn!

113
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:12,414
You're a terrible cop,
you know that?

114
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:14,223
Last night, Yin's Market?

115
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:16,625
How's the shooting start?

116
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,674
I was goofing around
on my scooter.

117
00:07:24,884 --> 00:07:26,745
You grab some milk, man,
I'm grabbing the flakes, all right?

118
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,515
I don't want cereal.

119
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,641
OK well maybe Ma wants some.

120
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:30,927
She only remember smoke no more.

121
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:32,839
You gotta feul up before school.

122
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,096
I ain't going to school.

123
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,729
So what you saying?

124
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,463
You dropped out.
Quit playing ball.

125
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:38,573
Yeah, well you ain't me, all right?

126
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,432
I'm not gonna let you
waste your talent being stupid.

127
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:42,077
You wasted yours.

128
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,350
- Yo, go home, Trick.
- What?

129
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,885
I said go home, now.

130
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:02,090
All right, fine. Whatever.

131
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:10,691
- Yo, man.
- This is for Web D.

132
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:19,503
Fool had no cause to do
what he did.

133
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:21,060
What was he talking about?

134
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,693
Web D?

135
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:24,294
Find out, you tell me.

136
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,861
Like to know why I was capped.

137
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,997
Thanks, Carlos.

138
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:38,428
What?

139
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:41,495
Patrick, this is Detective Jeffries.

140
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:44,688
We spoke to the guy
your brother shot in the market.

141
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:46,920
But he said you were
at the scene. /  Nah.

142
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,039
Luther said the shooting
was for Web D.

143
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,639
What's that mean? /  What happened
to Luther don't concern you.

144
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,954
Oh, 'cause you're gonna
take care of it?

145
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:55,873
Someone's got to.

146
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:00,385
Maeve.

147
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:04,013
You again?

148
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:07,537
We're working
on your son's murders.

149
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,914
Maeve, my name is Will,

150
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:12,654
look we need your help here.

151
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:15,788
I'm clean out of help for the police.

152
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:23,301
We think Miguel Maldonado's
resonsible for killing your boys.

153
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:26,274
And? / And if we solve
Luther's murder from last night,

154
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,601
maybe we can close all
your boy's cases.

155
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,967
I don't know nothing about nothing.

156
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:34,520
- Come on, let's focus here.
- Don't you talk to me like that.

157
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,667
You lost kids? Have you?

158
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:40,636
Then get out of here,
I got no use for you.

159
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:43,305
That's not how you
felt back in '99.

160
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:48,001
When Vaughn died.
I was there. Remember?

161
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,294
You wanted my help, then.

162
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:12,610
Ah, crap.

163
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:15,012
The critter's got family.

164
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:25,774
- Should I notify them?
- Yeah, go on.

165
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,965
I've just never done it before.

166
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,743
This is the perfect opportunity then

167
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:38,410
'cause this here ain't nothing
but an NHI.

168
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,717
- No humans involved?
- Yep.

169
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:42,964
I don't really believe in that.

170
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:48,224
Stick around long enough and you're
bleeding heart'll run dry real soon.

171
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:57,145
That can't be my boy.

172
00:10:57,145 --> 00:11:00,087
- It's Vaughn Bubley.
- Oh, god, no.

173
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:03,481
- Vaughn's dead?
- I'm afraid so.

174
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:07,103
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

175
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:08,896
Any of you?

176
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,243
He wasn't buying and he wasn't banging,
if that's what you think.

177
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:12,267
No, I wasn't.

178
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:15,746
He was a good boy.
He worked hard.

179
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,214
You gotta find out
who did this, lady.

180
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:21,415
He was like a father to his brothers,
you understand?

181
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,433
Yes.

182
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,857
- Vaughn's really dead?
- I'm sorry.

183
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:38,371
I ain't gonna make it without him.

184
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,960
That was a long time back.

185
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,496
We know you've had it rough.

186
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,277
You know. Well, you
understand my life.

187
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:51,147
- I'm trying to, Maeve.
- Don't.

188
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:54,888
Don't waste your time doling out
your sorry ass pity

189
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:57,190
like it's gonna do something
when everyone knows

190
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,997
it ain't nothing but bull.

191
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:02,920
White police woman's bull.

192
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,342
- Come one, Maeve.
- You know, I got a funeral to plan.

193
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:09,789
A burial to see to.

194
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:12,192
Know how much that costs?

195
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:16,837
You think I got money to pay
for another boy dying?

196
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:24,312
Lay him to rest in any kind
of decent way?

197
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:48,828
Any luck with the Bubley's?

198
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,960
No.

199
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,191
Nothing on Maldonado, Wed D.

200
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:58,757
A weird thing happened today
when I was talking to the mother.

201
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,225
Yeah?

202
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:05,679
And she was going off on a tear
and I was just tuned out.

203
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,062
Like I didn't care.

204
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:11,443
You're doing a job, Lil.

205
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:12,890
Sometimes that's all there is.

206
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,245
Ever meet my first partner?

207
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,539
Benny Fulcrum?

208
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,065
Retired now, isn't he?

209
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,977
I keep hearing his voice
in my head, NHI.

210
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:26,198
- Oh, you're not like that.
- I was.

211
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:31,446
- So, tommorrow will be different.
- Maybe.

212
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:33,163
But I'll quit before I look
in the mirror

213
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:35,784
and start seeing Fulcrum's face
staring back at me.

214
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:40,012
I've seen your old partner's face.
Nobody wants that.

215
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:44,923
The Bubleys hate us, boss.

216
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:47,474
A lot of Fairhill does.

217
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:50,385
So how do we keep from
hating 'em back?

218
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:05,214
Boss say how long
Sutton's on leave?

219
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:07,030
Nope.

220
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:11,391
Maybe she ran off
with Seargent White?

221
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,837
Gil Sherman told me
what really went down in Northeast.

222
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:16,979
Yeah? Dish.

223
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:18,810
It was a one way thing.

224
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,636
Guy made her life hell
chasing her skirt around.

225
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,679
So they never...

226
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,348
She could have set
the records straight.

227
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:28,807
Didn't think she had to.

228
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:31,473
That the security tape
from the market?

229
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:33,866
Remember how
no one saw nothing?

230
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:42,051
Interviewed every one of those guys,
no help.

231
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:43,400
Same old same old.

232
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,832
That tall kid with all the bling?

233
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:48,459
He's in Quincy Bubley's file, too.

234
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:51,543
Theodore Clauson,
Street name Cartier.

235
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:54,618
- Busted twice for selling rock.
- And?

236
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:57,628
Was questioned as a witness
in the Quincy Bubley murder '03.

237
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:58,919
He talk back then?

238
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,799
Says here, he couldn't
recall the tragic events in question.

239
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,499
Guy witnessed two Bubley's
get murdered.

240
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:06,705
That's something.

241
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,123
Lied to our faces the other night.
Why's he gonna talk today.

242
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:11,083
We'll give him some incentive.

243
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,892
Cartier's gotta make a living.

244
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:14,473
To pay for all that bling.

245
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:15,980
No drugs today?

246
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,352
Shut him down.

247
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:32,042
I got a lemon,
lemon and lemon.

248
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,680
- No cherry?
- Lemon.

249
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:43,083
You guys friend of Cartier's?

250
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,749
Family, actually.

251
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:46,021
You looking to score?

252
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:47,933
Hook a brother up.

253
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,928
One sec, we'll get him for you.

254
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,151
- Cartier, got another customer.
- Oh, yeah, huh?

255
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,389
Where should we send him?

256
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:02,110
Next villiage over to your competition?

257
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,446
Or a little east, into O town.

258
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:07,610
Man, ya'll mess with my livelyhood.

259
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,407
Hey, Cartier hook a brother up.

260
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:13,564
Are you really as stupid
as you are? / Huh?

261
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:16,035
No drugs today, biff.

262
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,743
OK, OK. I'm playing.

263
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:21,964
Why did Luther Bubley shoot Carlos?

264
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:23,950
I don't know.
For real.

265
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,051
For real?
What's Web D?

266
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,815
Ask me a question I can answer,

267
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:30,180
'cause I cannot afford to have you
on my stoop.

268
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,643
Quincy Bubley '03,
you were there when he was killed.

269
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:33,681
What happened.

270
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:35,868
Quincy messed up.
He went out of bounds.

271
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:36,881
Out of bounds how.

272
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:38,912
He got desperate
to support his family

273
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:41,367
after Vaughn and Cedric passed.

274
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:47,655
Hey, don't anyone know
what day it is?

275
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:48,937
Thanksgiving.

276
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:50,865
That's right.
And look what I brought.

277
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,952
You brought chicken
for Thanksgiving?

278
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:54,324
And I got the sides.

279
00:16:54,324 --> 00:16:56,554
Get some plates on the table.

280
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:02,239
Quincy, you bring me something?

281
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:06,377
Come on Ma, not now.

282
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:07,860
All right, no, you're right.

283
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,501
Ma, let me fix you a plate.

284
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:12,345
Oh, you know, I ain't hungry.

285
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,228
I'll watch you eat.

286
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:17,325
We should say a blessing
like we used to.

287
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:19,662
- Come on Ma, let's do it.
- All right.

288
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:23,436
Thank god I remember
how it's done.

289
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:32,698
Lord, we thank you for
the meal we're about to recieve,

290
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:35,246
for the blessings of family...

291
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,310
Keep going, Ma.
You're doing good.

292
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,863
No. I can't. I'm sorry.

293
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:59,476
- It's OK.
- Yeah, we'll just eat.

294
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:02,675
Will you wait till next year?

295
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:05,116
- I'll set me back to my old self.
- There you go.

296
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,470
You know get my job
at the beauty shop back,

297
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,150
and get you off the streets.

298
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,339
That sounds good.

299
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,740
Next Thanksgiving,

300
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,976
maybe get some of your pumpkin pie?

301
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:14,949
Ah, now you got me thinking about it.

302
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:16,896
Or maybe, maybe it
ain't too late,

303
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,370
maybe I can still whip one up.

304
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,630
I'll go to the store
if you want,

305
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,459
get what you need.

306
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:21,557
But it's Thanksgiving,

307
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:24,038
I'm having dinner with.....

308
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:26,750
Yeah, all right.
All right!

309
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,365
I'm coming.

310
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:33,250
I gotta go, Ma. Sorry.

311
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,858
- We'll save a slice of pie for you.
- Maybe.

312
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:38,908
Come on.
We gotta go.

313
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:46,295
All gonna be different, Quincy.

314
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:00,639
You see who pulled the trigger?

315
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:03,461
Flashing lights, screeching tires.

316
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:05,513
- You got a notion?
- Told you,

317
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:07,498
Quincy was desperate to make bank,

318
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:09,870
- to do right for his family.
- And?

319
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,794
And he branched out.

320
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:14,393
Started selling on the wrong block.

321
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:16,432
Whose block?

322
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,650
He's Jesus Maldonado.

323
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:24,431
Miguel's cousin.

324
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,068
Why didn't Miguel call me?

325
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:38,364
I guess he's busy.

326
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:39,787
He's gonna be a daddy.

327
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:42,463
It's Miguel's girl?

328
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:44,706
5-0, 5-0!

329
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:46,334
What are you doing?

330
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:53,061
- Hey.
- Jesus Maldenato?

331
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:56,925
What do you want?

332
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,052
Let's have a chat.

333
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,778
When's the baby coming?

334
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:01,036
I don't know.

335
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:03,337
Be good to see a doctor.

336
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:05,050
Why do you care?

337
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,328
Ain't like you knocked me up.

338
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:08,387
I know a clinic near by.

339
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:10,021
And you're gonna get me in?

340
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:11,204
I'll take you there.

341
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:13,374
We'll talk about the daddy to be.

342
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:16,604
I ain't no snitch.

343
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:21,133
- Why's he hasslin' my woman?
- Your woman?

344
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,117
Thought she was Miguel's.

345
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:24,787
Whatever.

346
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:27,164
She's pretty.

347
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:30,380
- Hanging with bangers though,
that could get her in trouble.
- Bull

348
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,967
DHS gets word,
they take the baby.

349
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:40,392
Close that up, man.

350
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:42,310
That mean you gonna talk?

351
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,530
- About what?
- Quincy Bubley.

352
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,349
Sold on your corner in '03
when he got shot up for it. / No.

353
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:49,456
Did Miguell give those orders?

354
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:53,116
Man, I hate doing this.

355
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:54,362
Baby should be with their ma.

356
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:56,029
Oh, come on man,
don't twist her up.

357
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,291
Why's Miguel got it out
for the Bubley's?

358
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,099
Bubley's bring it on themselves.

359
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,151
Their fault they're dying?

360
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:03,160
They're defective, man,
they got bad genes.

361
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,315
You made a study?

362
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:05,879
I seen it for myself.

363
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:07,949
The night Cedric Bubley was killed.

364
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:20,378
Why are you on me like that
when you know I'm Miguel's girl?

365
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,914
He don't care about you Letecia.

366
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,302
He just don't like to show it.

367
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:26,404
Don't you know he's all
wrong for you?

368
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:27,683
And you're right?

369
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:29,654
I'll prove it.

370
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:32,537
I'm with your cousin.

371
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,523
And he's with about 10 other girls, too.

372
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:36,818
Don't you wanna be special?

373
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:38,724
I wanna see Miguel.

374
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:42,575
Probably up there
with one of them now.

375
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:44,909
You shut up, Jesus.

376
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,221
Maeve Bubley was partying
with the man who's killing off her kids?

377
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:20,377
The same night
one of them gets dead.

378
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:23,665
See what I'm saying about bad genes?

379
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,557
That's cold.

380
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,263
Mom like you Maeve,

381
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:39,203
it's a wonder you have
any boys left alive.

382
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:42,201
You are one tight ass bitch.
You know that?

383
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:45,004
I think I actually felt bad for you.

384
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:47,128
Cedric's body wasn't even cold yet.

385
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:48,516
And you're lighting up
with his killer.

386
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:49,593
That's what you think, huh?

387
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:51,816
I think you know why
Miguel's killing your boys.

388
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:53,772
And you're so desperate
to get your high on,

389
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,703
you don't even care.

390
00:22:56,604 --> 00:22:57,563
I wanna leave.

391
00:22:57,563 --> 00:23:01,296
That rock in your apartment
says you're staying.

392
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,829
I ain't talking about that night.

393
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:05,650
You wanna stonewall?

394
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,327
Go ahead, stay here
and get good and dope sick.

395
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:30,432
Miguel ever finds out I let a cop
take me to the doctors...

396
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:33,776
He's the one that should be
here with you. / Yeah, well.

397
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:37,316
Too busy, huh?
Killing off kids?

398
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:40,793
I said I ain't a snitch.

399
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:42,367
You know Maeve Bubley,

400
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:47,529
lady you saw Miguel smoking crack with
at the O's one night? / Yeah, so?

401
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:52,534
What was she doing there?

402
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,703
Miguel don't tell me nothing.

403
00:23:56,471 --> 00:24:02,159
So he never confided
he murdered four of her sons?

404
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:07,136
Got any feelings about that?

405
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:11,046
He's bad. I know.

406
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:13,780
Is he bad to you?

407
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,739
Runs with other girls?

408
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:21,459
Catch you in this situation, adios?

409
00:24:22,104 --> 00:24:25,439
- Yeah.
- So why are you loyal to him?

410
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:28,272
He ain't to you.

411
00:24:33,178 --> 00:24:36,489
All I know about that woman
is one of her sons asked for it.

412
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:38,711
Which one?

413
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:42,197
Funny looking one with glasses.

414
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:45,882
- Cedric?
- Yeah.

415
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:48,459
Same night she was at the party
but earlier.

416
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:51,675
When we was out for dinner.

417
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:08,095
Miguel Maldonado.

418
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,751
Who's asking?

419
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:14,204
You killed my brother Vaughn.

420
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:17,979
Vaughn?

421
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:20,122
He urkel-looking like you?

422
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:25,639
It's been two years
and my family can't get back.

423
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:27,730
Two years.

424
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,407
Did  you just find your cojones?

425
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:36,698
We tried getting better
but what you took is still missing.

426
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:39,280
What do you want me
to do about it?

427
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:47,698
This is for Web D.
Come on, then!

428
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:51,562
I know you,
you work at the pet store.

429
00:25:51,562 --> 00:25:55,114
You sold me a scratch post.

430
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:59,568
Come on now bad boy, shoot!

431
00:26:05,337 --> 00:26:07,961
You ruined our family.

432
00:26:13,456 --> 00:26:17,531
Shoulda pulled the trigger
when you had a chance!

433
00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:24,484
So what Miguel set after him?

434
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:27,509
I just know he got shot that night.

435
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:31,202
Probably not a coincedence.

436
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:38,509
I know you're right.

437
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:41,531
Miguel's not good.

438
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:44,476
But I'm hung up on him.

439
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,990
Bet he'll make a hell of a parent.

440
00:26:51,952 --> 00:26:55,997
So Miguel kills Vaughn in '99.

441
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:59,140
And Cedric gets killed in '01
trying to get pay back.

442
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,101
Leaving the Bubley's
without a bread winner.

443
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:04,023
Quincy gets desperate,
starts selling on the wrong corner.

444
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:07,481
Get's himself shot by the O's,
Thanksgiving '03.

445
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:11,457
And Luther trades shots with another O
at Yin's a couple nights ago.

446
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:13,388
And says it's for Web D.

447
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:16,556
Why did Miguel kill Vaughn
in the first place?

448
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:20,360
What's this Web D
everyone's dying over?

449
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,244
Where's my Ma?

450
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:26,635
- I'll bet he knows.
- All right, just settle down, son.

451
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:28,706
It's OK. Come on.

452
00:27:28,706 --> 00:27:30,813
I know you got her here.

453
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:35,048
Got a hold of your report cards, Patrick.

454
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:37,506
- From elementery school.
- You gonna tell me where she is or not?

455
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:40,942
You're a gifted student.
In Honor's classes.

456
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:44,716
Then I checked out high school,
you're failing out.

457
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:47,934
I got other things to tend to.

458
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:50,873
What's Web D?

459
00:27:50,873 --> 00:27:52,075
Why did Miguel kill Vaughn?

460
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:54,247
I wanna see my mom.
Now.

461
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:57,201
- Think I care what you want?
- Yeah that's right.

462
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:58,587
Show me your true colors now.

463
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:01,523
Well I'm busy, Patrick.

464
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:03,740
- You know why I won't talk to you?
- Not really.

465
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,549
'Cause you look at people like us
and think NHI.

466
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:07,999
No humans involved.

467
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:11,659
Think what you want,
just get out of my face.

468
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:24,070
Guess who's crying out
for room service.

469
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:34,530
Twitching pretty bad, huh, Maeve?

470
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,546
I tell you what you want,
you let me out of here?

471
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:38,407
You don't make the deals, we do.

472
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:39,745
I gotta get what I need.

473
00:28:39,745 --> 00:28:41,200
Then start talking about Miguel.

474
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,133
Why were you at his place
the night Cedric was killed?

475
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:45,785
It wasn't for drugs like you think.

476
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:48,031
I was clean my whole life
before that.

477
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:50,665
We don't care
about your drug history.

478
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:53,623
Just why were you partying
with Miguel?

479
00:28:55,755 --> 00:28:57,846
You can't tell Patrick.

480
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:00,711
Crack making you deaf?

481
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:05,352
You talk. We deal.

482
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,533
All right.

483
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:10,297
I'll tell you.

484
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:14,949
And I hope you choke on it.

485
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,784
They say my boy Cedric
is in a dumpster.

486
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:23,772
Someplace.

487
00:29:24,788 --> 00:29:27,152
OK.

488
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:30,490
There's a lot of those in Fairhill.

489
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:39,560
The same boy
who put a gun on my girl?

490
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,466
I gotta find him.

491
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:46,564
Bury him right.

492
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:52,768
I feel you.

493
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:57,406
But ain't nothing free.

494
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:59,200
I don't got no money.

495
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,987
There are other ways to pay,
you know.

496
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:10,871
Just please

497
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:15,678
tell me where my son is.

498
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:23,833
This is my trigger finger.

499
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,210
Wanna start here?

500
00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:40,692
You wanna suck on this first?

501
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:43,380
Get you warmed up.

502
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:59,249
He say where Cedric was?

503
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,381
An alley dumpster.

504
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,970
Cast off like trash.

505
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,018
Happy now?

506
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:23,954
No.

507
00:31:23,954 --> 00:31:26,378
Wanna finish me off?

508
00:31:26,378 --> 00:31:29,428
Go on, tell Patrick.

509
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:32,613
We won't, Maeve.

510
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:38,401
Then I can get the hell out of here?

511
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:40,886
Go get my need?

512
00:31:55,274 --> 00:31:57,425
DA's office say we can charge Miguel?

513
00:31:57,425 --> 00:32:00,340
We can arrest him for sexual assault.

514
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,531
But the case will never make it.

515
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:03,955
'Cause Maeve won't testify.

516
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,895
But Miguel doesn't know that.

517
00:32:05,895 --> 00:32:07,985
Neither does Jesus.

518
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:10,624
So let's make a deal with him.

519
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,264
Get him to flip on his cousin.

520
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,705
Well, then he takes over the O's.

521
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:15,889
We replace one Maldonado
for another.

522
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:16,910
Better than doing nothing.

523
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,448
Patrick Bubley's not gonna care
who's running the O's,

524
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:21,201
he's gonna want revenge
either way.

525
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,837
We ain't gonna get 'em both, Lil.

526
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:24,762
Yeah, we gotta pick our battles,
win the ones we can.

527
00:32:24,762 --> 00:32:28,557
It's no win if Maeve loses her last son.

528
00:32:28,557 --> 00:32:30,871
You got a better idea?

529
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:41,691
You ain't got nothing on me?

530
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:43,348
Keep walking and shut up.

531
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:44,425
I didn't do nothing.

532
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:47,192
I said shut it Miguel.

533
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:48,436
Ain't no thing.

534
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:49,653
I ain't sweating, cous.

535
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:51,790
You will be.

536
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:55,693
Hey what,
you wanna go with him?

537
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:21,150
Get out.
Come on.

538
00:33:23,313 --> 00:33:24,933
You gonna kick my ass
now or what?

539
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,408
I wish.

540
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:28,186
Hey we know
Miguel killed those four brothers.

541
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:30,376
We just can't prove it.

542
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:32,747
Well that's your problem.

543
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:34,258
Well let's think for a second here.

544
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:36,187
You really want Miguel
back out on the street?

545
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:38,749
'Cause it occured to us
maybe you want to run the O's yourself.

546
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:40,884
Well someone's gotta be king.

547
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:43,000
Maybe now you finally
get your queen.

548
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,203
- Letecia?
- Don't talk about her.

549
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:49,134
She's hung up on Miguel right now
but how long's that gonna last?

550
00:33:49,134 --> 00:33:50,950
Her man rotting away
in a jail cell.

551
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,639
She's gonna move on.

552
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:54,855
Miguel's my blood.

553
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:56,696
So's that kid she's having.

554
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:59,196
He's gonna need a father.

555
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:04,686
You give us something
real, Jesus,

556
00:34:04,686 --> 00:34:08,038
Miguel never steps foot
in O town again.

557
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:14,490
Vaughn Bubley. 1999.

558
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,829
How'd it go down.

559
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,420
Wrong is how it went.

560
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,302
All wrong.

561
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:28,567
Like I said Trick, all you gotta do
is push off and then flow.

562
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,426
Push and flow.

563
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:32,338
There, that's it little man.

564
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:34,053
Push and flow.

565
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:36,226
Push and flow.

566
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:40,179
Check me out V, I'm flying!

567
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:49,740
He just showed up.

568
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,951
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's up,

569
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:55,115
- this is my alley.
- Sorry.

570
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:02,002
Hey, what are you doing?

571
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,499
Taking this.

572
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:07,596
Go home, Patrick.

573
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:11,220
- Nah. I ain't leaving you here...
- I said go home.

574
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:19,475
Look that scooter means
a lot to my brother.

575
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:21,560
A lot to me, too.

576
00:35:22,635 --> 00:35:25,607
Scooter ain't his no more.

577
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:29,508
Look man, I'm asking you
with respect

578
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:31,435
please give me back the scooter.

579
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:32,991
Come on, cuz,
it's only a scooter.

580
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:35,277
Whoa, tell that to him, bro,
what's up?

581
00:35:35,277 --> 00:35:36,804
- What you doing man?
- I ain't, man

582
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:39,832
I ain't letting go man,

583
00:35:39,832 --> 00:35:42,088
Man, out of the jaw.

584
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:51,003
You win, dawg.

585
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:56,808
And here's your prize.

586
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:07,371
Four boys dead.

587
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:09,634
All over a scooter.

588
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:20,866
Where we going?

589
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:22,831
I wanna show you something.

590
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:28,807
We arrested Miguel Maldonado
for killing Vaughn.

591
00:36:28,807 --> 00:36:31,335
So who took over the O's?

592
00:36:31,335 --> 00:36:34,906
Oh, you're going after him huh?

593
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:37,633
Road you're going down Patrick,

594
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:41,381
leads right here.

595
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:51,232
There's a spot open.

596
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:54,228
next to your brothers.

597
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:57,826
Maybe this is how it goes.

598
00:36:57,826 --> 00:37:03,946
Patrick, you're 15,
you're just beginning your life.

599
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:07,799
Their death's on my back.

600
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:09,546
You think they want this for you?

601
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:10,544
Think your mom wants that?

602
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:13,409
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't.

603
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:17,379
- But I need to.
- Why?

604
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:23,015
Because it's how I stay human.

605
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:31,400
You are gonna make it without him.

606
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:37,981
Tell me what Web D is.

607
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:39,804
Nothing but dead air.

608
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:42,397
There's gotta be something.

609
00:37:42,397 --> 00:37:46,262
I don't believe four boys
are dead over a scooter.

610
00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:48,662
It wasn't just a scooter.

611
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:51,960
It stood for something?

612
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,267
Everything.

613
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:03,690
And now for the winner
of the 1999 W.E.B. DuBois essay contest,

614
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,048
Patrick Bubley.

615
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:09,800
Come over son,
and get your brand new scooter.

616
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:14,188
Now I'm sure all of us
would like to hear some of that

617
00:38:14,188 --> 00:38:16,041
winning essay of yours.

618
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,786
You want me to read it, now?

619
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:19,903
Maybe just the begining.

620
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:27,738
In our city of Philadelphia,
in 1910, W.E.B. DuBois wrote,

621
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,255
there was in this world

622
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:32,875
no such force as the force
of a person determined to rise,

623
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,963
and I wrote about
how I think so, too.

624
00:38:40,471 --> 00:38:43,427
You did so good, Patrick.

625
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:44,890
You know what I'm going
to call my scooter?

626
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,680
- What, little man?
- Web D, like W.E.B. Dubois.

627
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:51,164
Web D.

628
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,940
That's good, Trick. I like that.

629
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,525
Teach me how to ride.

630
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:56,203
Yeah, man. It's easy.

631
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:59,027
All you gotta do is push off,
and then flow.

632
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:04,043
Push and flow, push and flow.

633
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:11,412
* PM DawnÀÇ Faith In You *

634
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:18,919
* I don't kiss the future like
the fortune tellers do *

635
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:23,660
* So I can't dream with you at night *

636
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,814
* Pessimism's hunger changes everything *

637
00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:34,384
* I wish I walked with faith
and not by sight but... *

638
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:38,270
* You know with anything you do *

639
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:43,987
* there's a hundred people
bringing you down *

640
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:48,353
* No matter who you are *

641
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:50,785
* Don't let'em make you
cause they'll break you *

642
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:54,617
* Don't let'em love you
cause they'll hate you even more *

643
00:39:54,617 --> 00:39:59,716
* So if no one else believes in you  *

644
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:04,588
* I'm completely yours,
and I've got so much faith in you *

645
00:40:04,588 --> 00:40:09,631
* No matter what this life
puts in front of you *

646
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:12,317
* You can save this world *

647
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:16,053
* I've got so much faith in you *

648
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:29,673
* Anyone who knows
you sees the renaissance in you  *

649
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:34,457
* And I have to try and act surprised *

650
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:39,082
* I'm a "prime demotivator"
says my point of view *

651
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:45,168
* I wish I had some cheer
to lead you to but... *

652
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:49,178
* No matter how much good you do *

653
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:53,673
* There's a million people
wishing you harm *

654
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:59,134
* (I'm telling you)
No matter who you are *

655
00:40:59,134 --> 00:41:01,632
* Don't let'em make you
cause they'll break you *

656
00:41:01,632 --> 00:41:05,667
* Don't let'em love you
cause they'll hate you even more *

657
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:10,517
* So if no one else believes in you *

658
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:15,627
* I'm completely yours,
and I've got so much faith in you *

659
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:20,660
