특정 인물과 사건을 묘사하지 않습니다

2
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:06,353
Jaunary 14, 1984

3
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:09,797
- Suction.
- All right.

4
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:14,707
More suction.

5
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:17,649
- You okay, kiddo?
- Is he gonna make it, dad?

6
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,873
Just as soon as I finish
cross clamping this aorta.

7
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:22,363
Boy's not much older than you.

8
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:25,898
Does he need more blood?
I can give. / Nope.

9
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:27,292
'Cause that just about does it.

10
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:28,722
- Need a hand.
- What's going on?

11
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:31,649
55-year-old, needs a stent, angioplasty.

12
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,904
All right, close up.
I'll see what's what.

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,283
- Talk to mom?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:42,883
Got through all her blue books.

15
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:44,527
- She give out any A's?
- No.

16
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,041
Grant!

17
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,019
He's in repack, Seth.

18
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:57,150
Better get a perfusing rhythm
before sending him up to the cath lab.

19
00:00:57,498 --> 00:01:00,530
Paddles.
Charge 200.

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,419
Clear.

21
00:01:04,582 --> 00:01:07,998
Charge.
Clear.

22
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,254
- Your dad's got the touch.
- Yeah?

23
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:21,633
Doesn't miss a trick.
Raises them from the dead.

24
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,053
Don't believe it, Jase.

25
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:26,241
I'm just a glorified electrician around here.

26
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,451
Okay, let's send Mr. Lee
up to the cath lab.

27
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:34,064
Let me through.
I want to see my husband, please.

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,439
My husband, Tong Lee,
is he going to be all right?

29
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,080
- Yes, he's stable, ma'am.
- Oh, thank god. Thank you.

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,156
Oh, we, we can pay.
We have money. Cash.

31
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:49,999
Just think about your husband 
right now, okay?

00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:44,407
Is that a squirrel?

34
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,775
Japanese crane.

35
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,398
Looks like a squirrel.

36
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:50,097
Hey, Nick.

37
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:55,557
Nick Vera, this is David Cage.

38
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,820
- You're the new ADA, replaced Danner?
- Yes.

39
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,727
But trying to live that down.

40
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:01,898
I'm here to mend fences.

41
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:03,650
This is Edwina Davis,

42
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,611
just came forward with new information.

43
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:08,558
Miss Davis witnessed the murder
of Dr. Grant bowen back in '84.

44
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:11,346
- Call me Edie.
- Okay.

45
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:14,138
I was on the streets back then.
Scared of cops.

46
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:16,789
But all that's changed.
Making amends.

47
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:18,794
- Tell us what you saw?
- The man that got shot.

48
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:22,228
The doctor, he was walking 
and talking to a white guy.

49
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:25,549
The guy who was arrested
for the killing was black.

50
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,763
Homeless, history of mental illness.

51
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:31,387
- You see this white guy shoot the doc?
- Right in the heart.

52
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:33,931
- You hear anything they were saying?
- No.

53
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:36,304
But I think your shooter
might've been another doc.

54
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,460
- Why's that?
- Because he had a cap

55
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,496
with the hospital logo on it,
you know, with the hands.

56
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:44,700
- Anything else you can remember, Edie?
- No.

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,680
But I could use a soda.

58
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:53,705
Sure. Come on.

59
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:00,329
- So?
- Good new direction.

60
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm glad.
Like I said, trying to reach out.

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,031
If we take this job, I'd like to 
get my detective off desk duty.

62
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,926
- The one who clocked Danner?
- Will Jeffries.

63
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:15,584
Up to my boss to drop 
those charges, not me.

64
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:19,081
- You putting a good word in couldn't hurt.
- That's true.

65
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:22,184
- I could make a call.
- Could?

66
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,066
Will.

00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:00,594
- Just don't take her there.
- He's harmless.

81
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:01,976
Go to the library instead.

82
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:05,757
You spend too much time with criminals.
You think everyone's doing wrong.

83
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:08,418
- Hey, Kat.
- Hey.

84
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:10,172
Hello.

85
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:14,244
- Scotty Valens, this is my mom, Dina.
- Hi.

86
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:17,364
- And Veronica.
- The ballerina, right?

87
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,141
Do you have a gun like my mom?

88
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:24,603
- I do. Yeah.
- Anyway. The library.

89
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:27,231
See you tonight.

90
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:33,489
Family drama?

91
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,580
There's this guy at Finley park,
where she likes to play.

92
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,168
He up to something?

93
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:43,606
I don't know.
He just sits there, reading.

94
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:46,326
But you don't like how he looks.

95
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:48,818
He doesn't have a kid there.

96
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:51,285
Just bothers me.

97
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:54,860
- Want me to check him out?
- You mind?

98
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,910
Nah.

99
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:03,632
Grant Bowen, 40,
ER doc at st. Walter's.

100
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:06,710
Theory in '84 was a mugging gone wrong.

101
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,185
Killed on his way home after his shift.

102
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:12,971
- St. Walt's is in a rough part of town.
- Shot with a 38.

103
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:16,467
The slug was recovered,
weapon was never found.

104
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:19,515
Homeless guy they arrested
had on the doc's top-siders.

105
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:21,043
But he could've taken them
after the doc was killed.

106
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:23,586
Jury didn't think so.
Guy was convicted.

107
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:25,254
Died in jail two months later.

108
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:29,269
The only physical evidence was a red, 
heart-shaped sticker found by the doc's body.

109
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:33,293
- Valentine's heart?
- Murder was in August, not February.

110
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,966
According to this witness,
doc was chatting it up with the doer.

111
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:40,849
- Who had a hospital baseball cap.
- Huh, something personal.

112
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,411
Will's on his way to Drexel.
Widow's an English professor there.

113
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,288
You could still catch up
with him if you hurry.

114
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:49,406
- He's off desk duty?
- Boss brokered a deal.

115
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:53,355
I had to. The man was playing
with a flying squirrel.

116
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,510
I met Grant when he was a resident.

117
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,108
Broke my ankle ice-skating,
he put on the cast.

118
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,978
And the rest is history?

119
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:04,595
And we were such opposites.

120
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:06,100
Opposites how?

121
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,269
I come from a family of academics.

122
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:11,240
Grant was a steel worker's son.

123
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,911
He sure made good,
becoming a doctor.

124
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,130
And he could've worked anywhere,

125
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,089
but he wanted to give back.

126
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,571
That's why st. Walter's.

127
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:24,290
We have new information that your husband 
may have been shot by someone he knew, Anne.

128
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,770
- A white guy, possibly from the hospital.
- Oh, my god.

129
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,625
Anyone that fits that description
that may have wanted to hurt grant?

130
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,190
Maybe.

131
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,684
- Another doctor in the ER.
- What's his name?

132
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:40,230
- Seth Garvey.
- They didn't get along?

133
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,010
They did, but Seth envied Grant.

134
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,236
- Professionally?
- For starters.

135
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:52,268
We were at a medical convention in Atlantic
city eight months before Grant died.

136
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,639
- Here comes the river.
- What's that?

137
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,278
Last common card dealt.
It's called the river

138
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,827
'cause your hand's fate depends on it.

139
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:05,001
- Very existential.
- I love that.

140
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,765
- Yes! Yes!
- Damn!

141
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:08,352
Fate is with me.

142
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:12,152
Well, I'm in the middle of a great book 
about sir Francis Bacon, so I'm going up.

143
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:14,568
- Coming?
- Another half an hour.

144
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,528
Come here.

145
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:19,808
You got beginner's luck
like I've never seen.

146
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:25,472
Yep, my father used to say
better to be lucky than smart.

147
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:27,391
Adios, boys.

148
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,081
Hey, let me walk you up, Anne.

149
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,050
A lot of shady characters about.

150
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,732
Podiatrists and the like.

151
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,773
You know, I never heard grant
mention his dad before.

152
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:39,164
- Usually doesn't.
- Why's that?

153
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:40,986
He was a drunk. Deadbeat.

154
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,779
And Grant's perfect.

155
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,046
Overcompensating I guess.

156
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:47,504
He's not perfect.

157
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,253
But almost.

158
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:51,838
Must be fun to live with.

159
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:55,669
So where to?

160
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,085
What?

161
00:08:58,085 --> 00:09:02,059
"She is beautiful,
therefore to be wooed"

162
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:06,451
"she is a woman,
therefore to be won."

163
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:08,605
Henry the Sixth.

164
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:11,609
- Are you hitting on me, Seth?
- Yes.

165
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,983
Well, don't.

166
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:19,342
He take the hint, stay away?

167
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:23,137
Asked me to marry him,
few months after Grant died.

168
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:25,822
Guess that'd be a no.

169
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:31,743
Kinda had the fever for
Anne Bowen, huh, Dr. Garvey?

170
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:33,569
No kinda about it.

171
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:36,169
Didn't matter, she was
married to a fellow doc?

172
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:38,230
Not saying I was proud of it.

173
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,775
But the heart is a lonely hunter.

174
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:43,100
Were you lonely enough to try
and get rid of Grant?

175
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,103
Whoa, whoa.

176
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:47,933
- Left field.
- New angle on his murder.

177
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:51,422
He was shot by someone he knew.
From your hospital.

178
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:53,561
You think I killed him
so that I could be with Anne?

179
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:56,134
- Did you?
- That's crazy.

180
00:09:56,134 --> 00:09:59,084
Not really, happens all the time.

181
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:02,587
All right, look,
I admit I was jealous of Grant.

182
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:05,444
He was one of these guys that had it all.

183
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:08,727
- But then he started falling apart.
- What was going on?

184
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:10,688
His past was catching up to him.

185
00:10:10,688 --> 00:10:13,995
- Specifically?
- His genetic past.

186
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:17,343
- Like his dad, he was an addict.
- Drugs?

187
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:21,526
Cards.
Got the bug in Atlantic city.

188
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:25,198
Then we went to a local game
near the hospital.

189
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:30,933
- Last hand.
- You said that two hours ago.

190
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:35,251
- Gonna get lucky this time.
- Said that two hours ago, too.

191
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,103
Crap.

192
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:43,215
Let me make a call.

193
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:47,582
- Got a lie cooked up, doc?
- A lie?

194
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:50,305
Car trouble.
Friend in need.

195
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,952
Why don't you just go home to her?

196
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,035
Or considering that you're a doc, though,

197
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,266
I'd go with a pileup on the expressway.

198
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,812
Lot of casualties.

199
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:08,635
Hey, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I know.

200
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:14,234
Maybe half an hour.
It's been so busy down here.

201
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,494
Actually, there was a pileup 
on the expressway.

202
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:27,610
Yeah. Terrible.
Maybe an hour more.

203
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,266
Okay. 
Bye, honey.

204
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:36,890
That's the spirit.

205
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:45,354
- I'm putting everything in.
- Whoa, doc, that's a lot of money.

206
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:48,484
- You sure about that?
- Nothing's sure.

207
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:51,489
That's what so great.

208
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,757
You bluffing me?

209
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,383
That doesn't cover it.

210
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:18,644
Then I'll throw in my wedding ring.

211
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:25,555
- What do you say?
- See the river.

212
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:35,596
Showtime, doc.
Pair of bullets.

213
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:48,456
You bet everything
on a stinking pair of twos?

214
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:51,788
- You lousy river rat.
- I knew my luck was turning.

215
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:55,241
I'll take you down, doc.
Do you hear me?

216
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,887
You're going down!

217
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,064
- Who was this guy lost his wedding ring?
- Cy Tisdale.

218
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:07,002
He hung around the hospital,
getting paid to be in medical trials.

219
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,337
Think he was dangerous?

220
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,920
He had a pretty shady existence,
degenerate gambler.

221
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,730
Which takes money.

222
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,678
Money a rich doc like Grant had, 
and Cy needed.

223
00:13:30,698 --> 00:13:32,467
Anna Kournikova.

224
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,249
What's that?

225
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:38,322
Ace, king.
Looks good but never wins.

226
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:40,826
You guys want in?

227
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,649
- Like a bunch of roaches.
- Where are you going?

228
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,973
I ain't the ringleader here.
Why are you pick on me?

229
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:51,643
'Cause you knew Grant Bowen.

230
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:55,663
True. Okay?

231
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:58,863
He was shot, not long after you
made a threat against him.

232
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:02,058
Said you'd take him down,
so maybe you did.

233
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:06,317
Aw, that was just card talk.

234
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:08,922
- Besides, a mugger killed him.
- No.

235
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:11,838
New witness says it was a guy
in a st. Walt's baseball cap.

236
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:15,707
Like the one you took
right of of Grant's head. / Nah, I...

237
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:17,893
I gave that back to the doc,

238
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:19,763
same night I took it from him,

239
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:22,090
same night we became friends.

240
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,758
Recall where you were
when Grant was killed?

241
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:29,488
Playing poker at Skinny's tavern.

242
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:32,006
- Ask Skinny, he'll tell you.
- Will do.

243
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:34,445
Besides, I never would have hurt the doc.

244
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:36,240
He was my protege.

245
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,530
No offense, Cy, but...

246
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,612
you don't seem like the mentor type.

247
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:45,516
I tried to teach him the game,
but the guy...

248
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:48,743
was torn between two lovers.

249
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:59,954
Good evening.
Can you check this off?

250
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:01,979
That's okay.

251
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:04,444
- Here you can.
- Yes, of course.

252
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:10,578
Well, a toast to Jason's
future alma mater, Cornell.

253
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,385
I hear you've been shadowing
your dad in the ER, Jason?

254
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:17,134
But he's surgeon material.

255
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:20,014
I like the ER.
People need your help right away,

256
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:22,551
- and then, you save them.
- And they're forever grateful.

257
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:27,101
Like Mrs. Lee who brought another
angelfish for our aquarium today.

258
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:30,210
'Cause that's how she thinks
of you as her angel.

259
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,282
Oh, boy.

260
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:36,013
- You sure?
- I'm afraid so.

261
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:40,446
- What's wrong?
- Credit cards aren't working.

262
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,975
I didn't bring my purse.

263
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:47,131
Uh, I'll just have to write a check.

264
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:48,751
I'm afraid we don't take checks.

265
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:52,380
Well, you just might have 
to make an exception tonight.

266
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,089
I'm sorry, sir.

267
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:03,113
Uh, that's the ER.
Damn it. Uh...

268
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:08,442
- Um, I'll take that check, waiter.
- No, no, we invited you.

269
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:12,501
I'm so sorry, but...
I'm on call.

270
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:16,136
- Sara's dad is not paying.
- No, he's not.

271
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:21,142
We'll get to the bottom of this.
Please, order dessert.

272
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:29,083
What is going on?

273
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,645
I don't know.
It's a bank snafu.

274
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:35,152
- It's really embarrassing.
- Anne, I have to run.

275
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:37,090
You can't just walk out on 
your son's graduation dinner.

276
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,005
It's work. / And stick his girlfriend's
parents with the bill.

277
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,884
It's the hospital.
Look, I have to go.

278
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:46,098
Why are you on call tonight, anyway?

279
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:50,279
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,347
It was the game or the lady.

281
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:02,402
And the lady lost.

282
00:17:02,402 --> 00:17:05,283
You think she knew 
what the competition was?

283
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:10,007
My experience?
Wives always know.

284
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:12,485
I hear you.

285
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:15,342
Did some checking, Anne.

286
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:20,419
You got $1.5 million in life
insurance, after Grant died.

287
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,673
Yes. So?

288
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:24,901
Well, so it must have come in handy,

289
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:27,372
considering you were broke.

290
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:29,645
If you think I'm some
kind of black widow...

291
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:31,505
I know there were money problems.

292
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:34,358
Grant was screwing up your life,
humiliating you.

293
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,085
He was in trouble.

294
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:39,115
But you didn't mention that.

295
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:40,736
What does that have to do 
with him dying?

296
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:42,423
Maybe everything,

297
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:45,862
because maybe you did 
something about it. / I tried.

298
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:48,560
I tried to save him.

299
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,011
- Any luck?
- None.

300
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:00,931
What are you doing?

301
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:06,638
Uh, just, uh...

302
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:09,688
looking for a pen.

303
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,163
You're trying to steal from me?

304
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:16,604
- That's ridiculous.
- Yes, it is, but that's what you're doing.

305
00:18:16,604 --> 00:18:21,766
Cornell called today.
Tuition check bounced.

306
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,912
- Bank snafu.
- Another one? / Must be.

307
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:28,965
Grant, you're a doctor. I'm a professor, 
and both our bank accounts are empty.

308
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:34,336
- What the hell is happening?
- Okay, uh...

309
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:38,640
I've been playing poker.

310
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,170
You gambled away our money?

311
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,430
- But I'm gonna win it back.
- Grant.

312
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,594
When I'm at that table,

313
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:47,844
it's like I'm playing with fate.

314
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:50,602
It's dangerous and exhilarating.

315
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:52,685
It sounds like you're talking about a drug.

316
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:55,144
But you can't get good at a drug.

317
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:56,940
Do you hear yourself?

318
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,863
I'm getting good, really good.

319
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:08,848
- That's the ER.
- No, it's not.

320
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,102
It hasn't been the ER
in a long time, has it?

321
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:15,912
- I'm gonna win it all back.
- Grant, stop. Before Jason finds out.

322
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:17,854
Don't tell him.
It's just a temporary problem.

323
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,195
He's gonna find out 
when we can't pay his tuition.

324
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,280
Just trust me!

325
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:28,031
We'd been married 18 years.

326
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:34,600
And suddenly I didn't know him anymore.

327
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,099
- Did your son find out?
- Yeah.

328
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,562
'Cause we couldn't afford Cornell.

329
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:44,377
That must have crushed him.

330
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:49,476
He had to go to community college.
Work two jobs.

331
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,543
It turned him against Grant forever.

332
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:57,660
So when Grant died,
he and Jason were estranged.

333
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,979
At least with the insurance money,

334
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:03,962
Jason got to transfer
to Cornell the next year.

335
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:06,681
He's a doctor now.

336
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:11,173
Just like he always wanted.

337
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:16,222
You know that witness, Edie?

338
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:17,995
The ex-junkie?

339
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:20,609
- She called me.
- And?

340
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:23,436
That's it. Just saying.

341
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:25,215
Saying what?

342
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,365
Saying that maybe I'm not a 100%
totally washed up in the dating world.

343
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:32,463
Because a crack-ho called you?

344
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:34,662
Why you have to say it like that?

345
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:37,191
I got something on Jason.
One of his two jobs?

346
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:41,037
Was working at the blood
bank at st. Walter's. / That relevant?

347
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:43,481
According to the web site,
each time you donate,

348
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:46,520
you get juice, a cookie,
and a red, heart-shaped sticker.

349
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,554
- Like the one at our crime scene.
- That's the trifecta right there.

350
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:53,323
Knows the victim, associated
with the hospital, and that sticker.

351
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:57,908
And a million and a half reasons
to see his dad dead.

352
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:35,099
Which one's yours?

353
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:38,992
Oh, none.

354
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:46,466
- You like the boys or the girls?
- Excuse me?

355
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:51,235
Seems like you're watching
the kid in blue pretty close.

356
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:55,777
- Don't know what you mean.
- He's weak, no friends.

357
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:58,306
- He's a good pick.
- I'm trying to read.

358
00:21:58,306 --> 00:22:01,368
You'd rather have the blonde kid.

359
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:06,583
He's popular, athletic.
You move on him,

360
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,833
he'll tell you to go pound sand.

361
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:15,884
Guess you know something about it.

362
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:32,651
I know what you are.

363
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,514
I make a study out of people like you.

364
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:40,180
I'm not doing anything.
You're thinking about it.

365
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,631
No law against that.

366
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:49,221
You're not gonna read here anymore.

367
00:22:49,221 --> 00:22:53,433
You're gonna walk away right now.
And if you come back,

368
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:58,760
I'll find you,
and I'll wreck you.

369
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:17,095
We have to talk, Jason.

370
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,331
Who asked you to open
my dad's case again?

371
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:21,837
We don't need a formal invite.

372
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:25,049
I'm just wondering who the hell cares.
I know I don't.

373
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,340
That's pretty tough.

374
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,382
I have surgery in six minutes,
and I'm punctual, so...

375
00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:31,708
So where were you
when your dad was killed?

376
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,256
- You're talking to me like a suspect.
- Picked up on that, huh?

377
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:36,881
We're down to five minutes now.

378
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,942
He embarrassed you
in front of your girlfriend,

379
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:41,846
made you pull out of Cornell.
All 'cause of his gambling.

380
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:44,454
I'm not denying he was a bum.

381
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:47,312
Did you always think that?

382
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:51,186
No. I used to worship him.

383
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:54,522
I watched him raise people
from the dead.

384
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:57,962
Can't see something like that
and not want to be just like the guy.

385
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:01,518
- But then he let you down.
- Yeah, well...

386
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:04,326
that's the way it goes.

387
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:07,147
So that night?

388
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:12,656
I was at a bar, Clancy's.
Got drunk, first, only time in my life.

389
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,277
Why that of all nights?

390
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:17,477
Because I'd just seen first-hand
what my dad had become.

391
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:20,852
- A bum?
- And a menace.

392
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:23,219
Dr. Bowen, my husband is back.

393
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:26,556
Really? Sorry. / He's in the OR.
Will you check on him?

394
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:30,397
- You're the only one...
- Can't just now, Mrs. Lee.

395
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,530
Start a line.
2 million units of penicillin, 500 of gent.

396
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,535
- Dad!
- Quiet, Jason.

397
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:46,386
- But, dad, the chart...
- Jason, you watch, I work. Understand?

398
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:53,851
Dr. Garvey!

399
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,554
He's giving him penicillin.

400
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:01,554
- Stop! He's pen allergic, Grant.
- What?

401
00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:03,431
Clindamycin.
And get Dr. Marsh.

402
00:25:03,431 --> 00:25:05,982
You, come with me.

403
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:15,196
You could've sent him into 
anaphylactic shock. / I missed it, sorry.

404
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,575
"Sorry" is for when you show up
to work a zombie.

405
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:19,992
"Sorry" is for when you borrow
thousands of dollars and never pay back.

406
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:23,016
Spare me the lecture. / But "sorry" 
doesn't cover nearly killing a patient

407
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:26,044
because you're so distracted and tired
that all you think about is gambling.

408
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:28,037
This has nothing to do with the cards.

409
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:30,205
- You have a problem.
- That's crap.

410
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,837
Admit it. / I need sleep.
I worked two shifts.

411
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:36,043
- Stop lying.
- He's right.

412
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:41,521
- What?
- Mom knows it, too.

413
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:44,778
You lie about everything now.

414
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:48,269
Now you're both lecturing me?

415
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,705
- What the hell is this?
- End of the line, Grant.

416
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:54,545
You're coming with me.

417
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:05,119
End of innocence, huh?

418
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,789
You could say.

419
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:10,434
Where was Dr. Garvey taking your dad?

420
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:12,848
I never asked.

421
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:22,178
Something you forgot to tell us, 
Dr. Garvey? /  I don't think so.

422
00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:24,723
You hauled Grant out of the ER, 
day he died.

423
00:26:24,723 --> 00:26:27,258
- Makes you last-to-see.
- And maybe the shooter.

424
00:26:27,258 --> 00:26:29,971
- I didn't shoot Grant.
- You did something you tried to hide.

425
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:32,888
Yeah. I covered for Grant
when he almost killed a patient.

426
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:34,333
The hospital could have been sued.

427
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:37,815
Fact remains, you're
the last guy seen with Grant.

428
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:40,550
You had it bad for his wife,
and you were jealous of him at work.

429
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,997
Not at that point.  I wasn't jealous 
of him in any way. / No?

430
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:48,783
I pitied him.
And, yes, I interfered.

431
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:51,698
I did it for her.

432
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:54,272
- Anne.
- You did what?

433
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:58,523
I took him to a gambler's anonymous 
meeting...basement of saint Michael's.

434
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:00,980
- He sit still for that?
- Far as I know.

435
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,419
I stayed a few minutes,
but I was working.

436
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,882
Anyone see you leave the meeting?

437
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:10,392
Yeah. That mutt Cy Tisdale.

438
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:24,185
Those food stamps you're playing for?

439
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:29,285
Lot of bazooms.

440
00:27:29,285 --> 00:27:32,241
Got some new information, Cy.

441
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:37,058
What now?

442
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:42,753
Witness put you and Grant at a gambler's 
anonymous meeting the day of the murder.

443
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:46,135
Want to tell us why you 
failed to mention that? / Not really. No.

444
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:48,228
Went to talk to your old pal, Skinny.

445
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:51,447
- See about that alibi of yours.
- Oh, yeah? How's he doing?

446
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:53,566
- Not so good.
- Been dead a decade.

447
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,367
But that's no surprise to you, is it?

448
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:58,265
I got feelings, you know.

449
00:27:58,265 --> 00:28:00,326
- That's hurtful.
- Quit bluffing, Cy.

450
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:03,826
Tell us what happened
to Dr. Bowen that day.

451
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:09,526
- The birds is what happened.
- Birds?

452
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:13,792
Pigeons, to be exact.

453
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:17,003
I almost killed someone today,

454
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:20,049
right in front of my son.

455
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,767
And now he hates me.

456
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,844
And it's not even an hour later,

457
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:29,810
and all I can think about
is how to get to a game.

458
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:36,554
I've lost my wife, my son, my job.

459
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:41,007
But I keep thinking my luck will turn.

460
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:44,692
That's the beauty of chance.

461
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:49,995
The beauty I couldn't resist.
I'll try, though.

462
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:55,325
Try accepting I'm going out a loser.

463
00:29:01,964 --> 00:29:04,168
What the hell are you doing here?

464
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:06,276
- I come here sometimes.
- To quit?

465
00:29:06,276 --> 00:29:10,697
To remind myself
why I don't want to quit.

466
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:12,811
Look at these sad sacks.

467
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:16,557
Put a c-note in any of their hands, 
they'd be out the door.

468
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:19,289
Not me. Not anymore.

469
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:21,864
- Had a dream last night, doc.
- Oh, yeah?

470
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:26,028
Had the ten, jack, queen 
and king of spades. And the river...

471
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:29,781
- it dropped me the ace of spades.
- A royal flush.

472
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:33,725
I think it's a premonition
that our luck's about to change.

473
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:36,432
That's your dream, Cy.

474
00:29:36,432 --> 00:29:38,506
Mine are all nightmares.

475
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:41,916
Look at that, would you?

476
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:47,628
A buck says the gray flies off first.

477
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:52,154
- I'm quitting, Cy.
- Tell you what.

478
00:29:52,154 --> 00:29:57,513
You take the gray,
I'll take speckles.

479
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:08,260
- I'll take speckles.
- That's the spirit.

480
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:14,679
You see? Now, that's a hell of 
a good omen if I ever saw one.

481
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,657
Even if I wanted to play,
there's no way to get money.

482
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:24,372
- No one left to hit up.
- There's got to be someone.

483
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:29,863
- There's always someone.
- Yeah.

484
00:30:30,926 --> 00:30:33,911
Maybe one person.

485
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,946
So who was gonna stake him?

486
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:41,893
Said there was a wife
of a guy he saved.

487
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:45,125
Owned a store that sold fish.

488
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,892
He was going to borrow from her?

489
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:49,746
He was past borrowing.

490
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:54,087
He was gonna rob her.

491
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:05,986
So you were right
about that guy in the park.

492
00:31:05,986 --> 00:31:07,455
He was trolling.

493
00:31:07,455 --> 00:31:08,726
I had a feeling.

494
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:11,730
I talked to him.
He ain't coming back.

495
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,683
Really?

496
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:15,493
- 'Cause...
- What?

497
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:20,080
My mom said he was gone yesterday,
but back today.

498
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,234
No kidding?

499
00:31:23,057 --> 00:31:25,396
This is it.

500
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,761
Mrs. Lee?

501
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:38,181
Yes? / We need to talk to you
about Dr. Grant Bowen.

502
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:40,635
Dr. Bowen is dead.

503
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:44,064
That's why we're here.
Your husband was a patient of his?

504
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:46,313
My husband is dead now, too.

505
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:50,548
Did Dr. Bowen come to see you, 
Mrs. Lee? / Try and rob you.

506
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,752
Dr. Bowen was a good man.

507
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:55,397
We know you told him
about having cash on hand.

508
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,137
And how indebted you were to him.

509
00:31:57,137 --> 00:32:00,594
He saved my husband's life.

510
00:32:00,594 --> 00:32:03,643
But he wasn't himself that day.

511
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:08,266
- So he did come see you?
- After closing.

512
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:13,876
And I tried to give him luck.
But it didn't work.

513
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,837
- Dr. Bowen?
- Mrs. Lee.

514
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:32,207
I thought you'd be at the hospital
with your husband.

515
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:36,032
- How did you get in?
- I, uh...

516
00:32:36,032 --> 00:32:38,702
- the back door was open.
- Is my husband okay?

517
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:42,234
Yes. Yes, he's fine.

518
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:46,395
It's, it's the bill that, 
that's the problem. / The hospital bill?

519
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:50,112
Yes. There, there were some
additional charges.

520
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:54,581
Uh, central line kit, anesthesia.

521
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:59,069
Uh, I remember when you said
you could pay in cash?

522
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:02,635
And you're here for the money now?

523
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:07,789
Yes, yeah. $1,000.

524
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:32,539
This isn't all your money, is it?

525
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:36,008
You saved my husband.

526
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:55,603
Wait...

527
00:33:57,042 --> 00:34:00,382
I can't do this.

528
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:14,863
I'm going to take, uh,

529
00:34:14,863 --> 00:34:19,613
three hundred...
and twenty-four dollars.

530
00:34:19,613 --> 00:34:22,052
And I'm not gonna be paying you back.

531
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:28,182
Whatever it is,
it can't be that bad.

532
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:35,955
It's funny, what a life 
ends up being worth.

533
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:44,067
Wait, Dr. Bowen.

534
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:51,812
Take this for good luck.

535
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:55,227
I'm beyond luck.

536
00:34:57,071 --> 00:35:00,866
Everyone needs luck.

537
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,861
So he left with $324.

538
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:08,790
Pretty specific amount.

539
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,493
And my not-so-lucky luck charm.

540
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:25,128
Dealt you hands,

541
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:27,981
but took a peek.

542
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:31,931
You got a gay waiter.

543
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:36,183
A queen with a trey.

544
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:40,813
Where'd you get this, Cy?

545
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:45,398
Won it in a game.
Way back. / Wrong.

546
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:47,207
You took it from Grant
when you killed him.

547
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:49,929
Guess you thought
you could use the luck.

548
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:55,914
I'm gonna need a lawyer.
Except I can't afford one, so...

549
00:35:55,914 --> 00:35:58,439
I guess I'll just clam up.

550
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:00,791
Being a guinea pig at st.
Walt's wasn't the only way

551
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,688
you were making money back then, 
was it, Cy?

552
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,511
You also got paid for giving blood.

553
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:09,604
That's 'cause I got the lucky blood.

554
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:12,765
O negative. Universal donor.

555
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:14,652
You donated the day Grant died.

556
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:16,179
And got yourself a red heart sticker.

557
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:19,963
Which you must have dropped
when you shot Grant.

558
00:36:19,963 --> 00:36:23,612
I'm a poker player, lady.

559
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:27,128
I ain't folding my hand just 'cause
you got some good face cards.

560
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:29,369
Witness who saw Grant's murder is coming in.

561
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:34,337
She's gonna ID you, and you're gonna 
go down without a friend in the world.

562
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:39,582
I don't need friends.

563
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:43,403
I got 52 of them.

564
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:46,698
Right here.

565
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:52,287
We know you did it, Cy.

566
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:57,109
We just don't know why.

567
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:20,671
- They let you play cards in jail?
- Sure.

568
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:27,127
Been a prisoner to this deck so long...

569
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:33,695
bars instead of a door
won't make much of a difference.

570
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:36,656
What made you do it?

571
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:41,264
I thought Grant was your friend.

572
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,254
He was.

573
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:50,326
That's why.

574
00:37:58,019 --> 00:37:59,522
Thought we were gonna meet 
a half hour ago?

575
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:01,881
Had to go to Western union.
Send a money order.

576
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:03,341
Priorities, doc.

577
00:38:03,341 --> 00:38:05,237
Money order can wait.
We got a game to go to.

578
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:08,841
Paid off my life insurance.
$324.

579
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:13,382
- How much you got left?
- Change of plans, Cy.

580
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:18,143
What the hell?
That skinny's gun.

581
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:20,762
Yeah. I took it from behind the bar.
No one saw me.

582
00:38:20,762 --> 00:38:23,015
What do we need a gun for?

583
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:27,815
I think I know a way
to go out a winner, Cy.

584
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,828
Keep my promise to my wife.

585
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:32,819
You need a gun for that?

586
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:36,496
You're gonna kill me.

587
00:38:40,912 --> 00:38:44,347
You're bluffing.

588
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:48,096
My wife and son can't think
I killed myself.

589
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:54,981
Don't be stupid.
Dying isn't winning, doc.

590
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,559
You remember back to when
you were married, Cy?

591
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,679
When you had kids?

592
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:04,292
You would've done right
by them, if you could've?

593
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,980
I ain't shooting you.

594
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:12,041
I go and my family gets 
a million and a half dollars.

595
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,950
And what do I get?

596
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,905
You get to know you did right by me.

597
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:25,969
I'm a louse, doc, remember?
Selfish through and through.

598
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:27,938
And that's where I'm headed.

599
00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:31,925
To where you're at.
To a wasted life.

600
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:35,065
You want that for me?

601
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:37,489
It ain't so bad.

602
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:40,597
Now who's bluffing.

603
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:46,228
So what?

604
00:39:46,782 --> 00:39:50,566
I ain't pretending
my life ain't wasted.

605
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:53,360
But I ain't telling anybody
to shoot me either.

606
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,442
That's 'cause you got
nothing to die for.

607
00:39:57,442 --> 00:40:00,347
And I do.

608
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,892
Please, Cy.

609
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:16,839
I got a ten, jack, queen,
king of spades here.

610
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:23,683
And all you got to do
is deal me that ace.

611
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:55,630
Here, take this for luck.

612
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,370
How do you know you're not gonna be
needing it where you're going?

613
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:03,719
I don't.

614
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:10,543
- That's what I loved about playing cards.
- What's that?

615
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:16,659
The not-knowing what the river
was gonna bring me.

616
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:20,714
It's gonna be aces for you, doc.

617
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:28,732
