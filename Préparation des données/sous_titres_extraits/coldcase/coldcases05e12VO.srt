11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Customers bothering you?

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,750
People are so rude.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,750
And what's with the music?
Christmas is over.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,350
I'm surprised you're not
hiding out in the back room

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
with the rest of them.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,300
I don't smoke.
Makes my hair smell.

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,250
Got anything
going back to China?

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,400
Going back to what?

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:00,949
The manufacturer.

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,450
You've never played
the China game?

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,300
What's that?

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,400
First one to find something

23
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,800
not made in China wins.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,900
Okay.

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,600
"Made in China. "

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,000
"China. "

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,700
Uh-huh, "Made in Taiwan. "

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,350
Same thing.

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,500
No, it's not. Is it?

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,500
* I wrapped it up and sent it *

31
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,500
* With a note that say,
"I love you" I meant it *

32
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,100
* Now Inow what a fool
I've been *

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,350
I never noticed before.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,350
It's like everything's
made in China.

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Kind of sad.

36
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
Anything made here anymore?

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,450
Well, let's see,
thers me,

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,800
there's you, and, uh, depending
on how many kids we have...

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ooh, you're sweet,
but I got a boyfriend.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,200
It's all right.

41
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,150
I got time.

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,950

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,850
With one fatality
and a half dozen injured

49
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,250
in the post-Christmas bombing

50
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,500
at a local Big Box
Electronics store,

51
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,100
authorities are still searching

52
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,650
for anyone
who may have information

53
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,050
that could help find
the responsible party.

54
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,550
The explosion occurred at 7:30
this morning.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,650
A pipe bomb planted in one
of the open gym lockers.

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,850
Half a dozen injured,
one criticly.

57
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,550
The guy who opened the locker?

58
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,050
John Wojciechowski.

59
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,250
Found his left hand embedded
in the opposite wall.

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,850
Air Foe Academy ring
still on it.

61
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,000
Pilo

62
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,149
Not anymore.
IED, Rush.

63
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,900
A nasty little bitch
in a box.

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
What's that, Louie?

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,100
"Improsed explosive device. "

66
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,700
Um, trip wire-triggered

67
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,600
pipe bb enclosed
in some sort of

68
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,100
wooden box.

and nails,

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,599
pieces of metal shpnel.

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,299
Junk bomb.

72
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,300
But not exactly a cold job.

73
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,750
This one may be related
to at least two, maybe three

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,150
prior bombings in the city.

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,650

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,850
Signature is the same.

79
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,049
There hasn't been
a bomb fatality in Philadelphia

80
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,850
in over, what, five years?

81
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,800
Which is why we thought
the guy who did this one

82
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,100
was locked up or long gone.

83
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,150
What, killed himself?

84
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,150
Or maimed.

85
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,900
Often happens to people
who play with explosives.

86
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,700
Or who go to the gym
in the morning.

87
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,850
The feds everlook into it?

88
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,150
Looked, but never found a link.

89
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,000
Attacks were local,
never used

90
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,900
the mail; federal jurisdiction.

91
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,300
Any connectionbetween the targets?

92
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,299
Public places, but otherwisepretty indiscriminate.

93
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,350
So, we have no idea
what this lunatic wants

94
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
or where he's gonna hit next.

95
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,050
Just that he's alive and well.

96
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,850
And back with a vengeance.

for that shirt.

101
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,350
And here I was beginning
to think you were a vampire.

102
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,950
Why's that?

103
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,400
First time you stayed
till sunup.

104
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm not sure
how much longer

105
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,500
we're gonna be able to
keep this on the down low.

106
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,550
People are talking.

107
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,900
Really? Who?

108
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,550
How about that?

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,700
Never met a DA
afraid of publicity.

110
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,700
Depends what kind.

111
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,300
Lady's got a reputation,
you know.

112
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,700
Oh, just when I thought I'd try

113
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,450
to make an honest
woman out of you.

114
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Get real. You haven't even
bought me breakfast yet.

115
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,650
Well, how about dinner?

116
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,600
I know theperfect place.

117
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,400
I was kinda enjoying
the skulking around stage.

118
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,050
Dinner?

119
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,650
That might involve having
a real conversation.

120
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
Well, that's why
they invented wine.

121
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,550
You sure you want to spoil it

122
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
just when things were going so well?

123
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,450
We're adults.

124
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sure we'll find something
to talk about.

125
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,400
You mean besides dirtbags
and doers?

126
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm gonna have to requisition
that shirt now, lady.

127
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,100
Initial forensics confirm
the bomb contained parts

128
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,850
consistent with the
three other attacks.

129
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,000
Two dead
and two critically maimed

130
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,550
over a nine-year period.

131
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,000
Not a lot of help
from the feds

132
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:25,850
in any of the cases.

133
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,050
Or willingness
to share information.

134
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,150
Big surprise.

135
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,450
Locations?
Victims?

136
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,500

137
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,500
Curt Fitzpatrick,

142
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,950
Survived.

143
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,300
Roderick Poole didn't.

144
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,550
30-year-old physician's
assistant

145
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,550
killed at Coun Hospital
back in 20.

146
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,800
And now Wojciechowski
at a Sports Club.

147
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,150
Recently engaged
commercial airline pilot.

148
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,550
Targets are scattershot,

149
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,050
no common denominator.

150
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,950
Except wronglace,
wrong time.

151
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,400
But all in public places

152
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,500
with a lot
of foot traffic.

153
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,950
Could be the locations
he's targeting.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,450
Claim as many victims
as possible.

155
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,500
One angry sociopath.

156
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,400
Bomb construction
tell us anything?

157
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,150
Some trigger mechanism.

158
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,400
Not your garden-variety crackpot
mixing fertilizer and ammonia.

159
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,200
Louie and the bomb squad
are putting together

160
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,500
a full analysis of the parts.

161
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,150
We've got a fresh
crime scene for once.

162
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,850
We line up interviews
with every witness?

163
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,450
Except the night-cleaning crew.

164
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,650
The manager of the Sports Club
is stonewalling.

165
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,500
You don't think
he might

166
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,000
be subcontracting
the work out to illegals?

167
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
Told him he doesn't
give us every last name,

168
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,100
we'll bring in ICEand shut him down.

169
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,700
Let's keep this in our house.

170
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,100
We don't need the feds coming in
now to muck things up.

171
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,900
Just called thhospital.

172
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,400
Our pilot's out of surgery.

173
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,800
After he sees his family,
anything he can remember.

174
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,450
It was like a thunderclap.

175
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,700
I didn't know what hit me.

176
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,050
I know this
is hard, John,

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,550
but if there's anything you
remember, it might help.

178
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,850
Everything juswent blank.

179
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,100
Came to when I was
on the ground.

180
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,200
Reached down to prop
myself up, but...

181
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,100
...couldn't.

182
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,050
Me and Jen

183
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,700
just bought our wedding rings,
too, you know?

184
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,600
You see anyone suspicious
in the area befohand

185
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,850
Looked out of place?

186
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,950
Didn't belong?

187
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,150
No. When I got my hearing back,

188
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,900
there was this awful ringing.

189
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,950
I heard this whistling sound.

190
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,650
Whistling?

191
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,400
All the chaos,

192
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,800
I couldn't tell
where it was coming from.

193
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,800
I know I was going into shock,

194
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,900
but I swear that I heard
somebody whistling.

195
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,600
Who the hell would do that?

196
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,850
You get a look at that guy?

197
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,700
Not a good one.

198
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,800
He... had, like, a cap
pulled down tight.

199
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,500
That song, sound familiar?

200
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,550
Not really.

201
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,100
You think that was the guy
that did this to me?

202
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
's possible

203
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,600
the bomber stayed nearby...
to see if it worked.

204
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,800
Well, if you catch him,

205
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,900
you tell the bastard
that I'm still alive.

206
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,050
It's Angel Perez,
Mexican illegal.

207
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,750
Got his na off the
night-cleaning crew list

208
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,450
from the manager
of the Sports Club.

209
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,500
Whe'd you find him?

210
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,650
Sacks Park.

211
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,200
Tried to skate
when we ID'd him.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,450
 He's pretty upset
right now.

213
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
Doesn't speak
a word of English.

214
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,150
Yeah, we'll see
about that.

215
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,900
Pretty sure I speak
a language he'll understand.

216
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,300
Hey...

217
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,400
You want to tell me why
you ran from the police?

218
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,650
<i>Me entiende?</i>

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,850
<i>Habla pañol?</i>

220
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,400
No?

221
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,550
<i>So, no habla Ingles</i>

222
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,750
and you can't understand
my Spanish, is that the game?

223
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,550
Right.

224
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
I got a cousin
that works in IC

225
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,450
Here's the deal, amigo.

226
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,700
Either you tell me everything
you saw

227
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,900
in the next ten secondsor wbounce

228
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,100
your sorry ass out
on the next bus to the border.

229
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,950
<i>Oye, Jorgito...</i>

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,850
No.

231
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,550
No, it's okay.

232
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,450
Wait. Sorry.

233
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,900
You got something
you want to tell me?

234
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,700
<i>Sí, sí, entiendo, um. i></i>

235
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,500
I understand.

236
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,100
Hold on a sec, will ya?

237
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,600
It'sot what I see.

238
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,300
It's what I hear. 

239
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,950
A music box?

240
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,150
Minute later, bomb
go off, same locker.

241
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,850
Everything go crazy.

242
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,050
I get scared, I run.

243
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,150
I thought it was my fault.

244
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,250
Sit tight.

245
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,700
We're going to need you

246
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,650
to give an exact description
of that box.

247
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,350
<i>Gracias, Angel.</i>

248
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,650
An old music box?

249
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,000
The bomb
delivery device.

250
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,300
Kind with the brass
cylinder inside,

251
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,550
turns and plays a song.

252
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,450
Almost all music boxes
were made of wood

253
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,350
at the turn
of the century.

254
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,100
Can't be too many companies
still in business making those.

255
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,750
I found one company
in Vermont

256
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,850
that still supplies parts.

257
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,150
Nice old lady told me
that they sell cylinders

258
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
that play mostly
American standards.

259
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,200
And that ather
customer in Philly

260
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,050
ordered multiple cylinders

261
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
all playing the same song:
"John Henry. "

262
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,650
"John Henry. "

263
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,500
That could have been the song
playing on the box.

264
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,550
Well, I asked
the DA's office to subpoena

265
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,550
their purchasing records.

266
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,000
John Henry,
steel-driving man.

267
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,350
I remember that
story as a kid.

268
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Railroad guy with
the hammer, right?

269
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,750
Yeah, raced against
a steam drill

270
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:03,999
tunneling through a mountain.

271
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,150
Yeah, and John Henry won.

272
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,850
Then he keeled over and died.

273
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,950
It means something
to this guy.

274
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,200
Man versus machine?

275
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,000
Maybe a disgruntled,
anti-government type.

276
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,300
Could be a
militia nut job.

277
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,050
Doesn't exactly
connect the locations.

278
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,650
Purchaser's nameis Carl Baxter.

279
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,850
Paid with a credit card.

280
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,850
Shipping address is Mantua.

281
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,750
Already got you a search
warrant for the residence.

282
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,900
Anything else you need
on this, let me know.

283
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
Call SWAT and
the bomb squad. Let's go.

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
Nobody home.

285
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,900
 Better pray for no surprises.

286
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Over here

287
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,000
Look familiar?

288
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,200
Fitzpatrick, Schmidt and Poole.

289
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,750
All his
previous victims.

290
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,600
Not so random after all. 

291
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,450
Wasn't the locations
he was targeting.

292
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,400
It was individuals.

293
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,150
Wedding announcement:
Luke and Beth Ross.

294
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,900
That's ten years old.

295
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,150
Luke Ross.

296
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,100
That name was on the
Sports Club member list.

297
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,600
This guy belongs
to the gym, too?

298
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,400
No photo.
Nothing on Wojciechowski.

299
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,050
Our bomber hit the wrong guy?

300
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,800
If hat's the case, he's got
some unfinished business.

301
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,400
Yeah, and we just found
his next target.

302
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,200
??? dusted for
prints. Got the whole block staked out.

303
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,500
 Nothing from the canvass?

304
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,200
Building management
thinks he's a squatter.

305
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,200
What about the guy in the
wedding photo announcement?

306
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,000
Luke Ross,
portfolio manager.

307
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,150
Lives in Chestnut Hill.

308
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,500
 What have we got?

309
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,550
Music box.

310
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,700
Home entertainment system,
circa 1900.

311
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,850
Brass cylinder,

312
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,550
thousand little teeth

313
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,350
turn and slowly
pluck a metal comb,

314
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
out comes the music.

315
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,650
Bomb squad said

316
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,450
the cylinder was rigged
to trigger the explosion.

317
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,650
Trip wire.
Triggers an electric fuse

318
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,000
after a full revolution.

319
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,100
After the song ends. 

320
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,500
People admire the craftsmanship,

321
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,950
want to touch the box.

322
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,950
Soon as they open it...

323
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,700
Starts the song, arms the bomb.

324
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,300
Took some serious

325
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,100
electro-mechanical skill to rig
one of these with a pipe bom

326
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,150
What about the song?

327
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,650
John Henry's the underdog,
a David and Golih story.

328
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,150
It's also a protest song.

329
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,400
Against the machine.

330
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,650
Or management.

331
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,200
Production efficiency
at the expense of the worker.

332
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,000
"Say before I let this
steam drill beat me down,

333
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,300
I'll hammer my fool self
to death. "

334
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,800
John Henry died with a hammer
in his hand. He beat the machine,

335
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,400
but killed himself doing it.

336
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,800
This g thinks

337
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,900
his cause is noble.

338
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,450
And he's got something to prove.

339
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,200
 With his own pretty
little killing machine.

340
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,650
Does that have
real bullets in it?

341
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,150
Mia, why don't
you go watch

342
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,900
<i>The Pink Panther now?
Okay.</i>

343
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,650
You're a financial
planner, Mr. Ross? Yeah.

344
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,150
But I'veever had so much
as a dispute with a client.

345
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,050
Anyone else you know
might be holding a grudge?

346
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,000
Personal or otherwise? No.

347
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,200
No one at all.

348
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,200
You concur, Mrs. Ross?

349
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,700
There was that one call, Luke.

350
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,550
You remember?

351
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,050
What call? A couple of monthsgo.

352
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,750
The one from the bank,
about our credit card.

353
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,650
It was nothing.

354
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,250
No. It was definitely something.

355
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,750
Can you just tell us
if you have any recurring,

356
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,150
monthlcharges on the card,
ma'a

357
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,150
Certainly. Newspapers,
DVD rental subscription,

358
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,100
my husband's monthly
gym membership.

359
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,550
Yes. And the name
of that facility?

360
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,350
Philly Sport & Racquet Club.

361
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,150
Right. And were there
any other additional charges

362
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,850
to that business
that you're aware of?

363
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,500
Other than
the monthly membership?

364
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
Oh. There may be charges
to the juice bar.

365
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,550
And those charges
would occur...?

366
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,900
In the morning, around 7:00,
every Tuesday and Thursday.

367
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,500
Thank you, ma'am,
Just a few more questions.

368
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,250
Is your husband still employed
at Mutual Heritage Bank?

369
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,250
Yes. Why?

370
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,200
Well, it must be nice

371
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,100
to make a living
off thbacks of others.

372
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Excuse me?

373
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,100
I hope you and your husband
are enjoying your new purchases.

374
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,900
Love the blue curtains,
by the way.

375
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Who is this?

376
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,250
Police said they couldn't
do anything about a prank call.

377
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,500
That's how the bomber
knew Luke's routine

378
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
when he went
to that gym.

379
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,000
I just didn't
go yesterday

380
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,600
'cause I took Mia to school.

381
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,900
I was upset by the call
at the time,

382
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,050
but to think
I could have gotten

383
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,900
my husband killed...
You have any idea

384
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,000
what the caller might
have meant by that comment

385
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,600
about how you make a living?

386
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,150
No. We'll chk your phone records,

387
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,750
see if we can trace the call.

388
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,400
I don't understand.

389
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,750
Why is this
happening to us?

390
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
For your own safety,

391
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,750
we'll provide your fily
with a police detail.

392
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,650
Bomber called his targets
posing as a credit card rep.

393
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,400
To get their daily routines,
habits.

394
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,500
Went after them
in public places.

395
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,700
Make it seem random.

396
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,700
Ross got lucky.

397
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,750
Wojciechowi,
not so much.

398
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,650
That info stays here.
Press doesn't know

399
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
he missed his
intended target,

400
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,050
maybe our kier
doesn'either.

401
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,700
No sense
endangering Ro.

402
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,050
A dump on the Ross

403
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,700
home phone
traced the harassing call

404
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,700
back to a pay phone at
the 20th Street train station.

405
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,499
He's on the move.

406
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,850
Worth a canvass.

407
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,950
Check the station'scurity cameras. 

408
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,400
Carl Baxter

409
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,350
isn't going anywhere.

410
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,950
I subpoenaed
the credit card app

411
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,500
toet his Social
Security number.

412
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,200
Turns out the real Carl Baxter
is upstate in Frackville.

413
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,050
Been locked up sce '.

414
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,900
Philly's finest.

415
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,100
Is there a reason for the cell
and strip search, feas?

416
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,600
So you don't
spontaneously combust.

417
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
What gives?

418
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,300
I don't use and I n't deal.

419
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,900
Ask anyone inside.

420
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:03,850
Use what?

421
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,650
Methamphetamine.

422
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,450
What y'all
locked me up for.

423
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,450
Distribution.
Says you used

424
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,250
to drive a truck cross-country.

425
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,000
California.
Crank capital.

426
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,700
Wasn't me that brought it in,
it would have been someone else.

427
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,000
Also spent some time

428
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,100
in the military.

429
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Judge gave me a choice
when I was 18- Army or jail.

430
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,500
Can't say it helped much.

431
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,050
Is that where
you learned about munitis?

432
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,700
Demolition, explosives? No.

433
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Talking about pipe bombs, Carl.

434
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,300
Pipe what?

435
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
Y'all are smoking
some better stuff

436
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,650
than I ever had.

437
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,650
You graduate high school, Carl?

438
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,700
I'm working on my GED.

439
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,100
Forget it.
This guy's a lummox.

440
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,800
A what?
Don't worry about it.

441
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,550
Someone stole
your identity, pal.

442
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,450
Just can't figure out
why he picked you.

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,850
Whoa, whoa, hold up.

444
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,500
Turn around.

445
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,700
Hold your arms out.

446
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,150
John. Henry.
Yeah.

447
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
My two boys.

448
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,250
All but grown up now.

449
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,900
He stole that big galoot's
identity for a reason.

450
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,350
The song, the tattoo.

451
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,000
Maybe he did
time with Baxter?

452
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,000
Baxter's been locked
up for 12 years.

453
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,850
Never shared a cell.

454
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,250
No one on Cell Block D
at Frackville even comes close

455
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,100
to the profile.

456
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,000
So why Baxter?

457
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,150
It's like
he leading us,

458
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,500
trying to tell us something.

459
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,750
About John Henry?

460
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,750
Who fought to
prove something,

461
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,750
that he still had value
as a han being.

462
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,850
To protect his job,
his way of life.

463
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,350
This guy's angry.

464
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,250
He's lashing out
at some personal beef,

465
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
some wrong.
Something he lost?

466
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,550
Checked with Pennsylvania
Department of Corrections

467
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,650
to see if a third party

468
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,650
could have accessed
Baxter's booking info.

469
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,050
Webmaster on the site

470
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,600
found a number of hits
to Baxter's profile page.

471
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,100
Came back to
a local branch

472
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,200
of the Philadelphia
Public Library.

473
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,150
Yes, Mr. Bteris here quite a bit.

474
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,750
Such a nice man.

475
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,700
Uslly on the computer?
The Internet?

476
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,500
From time to time.

477
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,250
But,ostly, he likes to sit
over there at that table

478
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,150
reading or sring
at the photos on the wall.

479
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,400
Lil.

480
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
Look at the captio

481
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,500
"John Henry Road, 1976."

482
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,350
Where is that?

483
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,900
Germantown, I think.

484
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,700
The section with the streets

485
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,300
named after the builders
of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

486
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,200
I only know
because Mr. Baxter

487
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,050
told me that he

488
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,800
grew up on that block.

489
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Here ya go.

490
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,700
Home sweet home.

491
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,400
Just like you
remembered it.

492
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,650
John Henry Road, huh?

493
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,350
Check out the sign.

494
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,300
It's what he's been trying
to tell us.

495
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,000
The place where he grew up.

496
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,950
Gone...???

497
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,250
???

498
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,550
discovered a legal battleover a property

499
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
on the street
back in '96.

500
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,200
The home was occupied
by Alessandro Rossilini,

501
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,000
ok over the mortgage after his
father died and refused to sell.

502
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,400
Developers call it a spike.

503
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,550
A spike?

504
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,849
Lone holdout on a residential
street undergoing

505
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,200
commercial development.
Records indicate Rossilini

506
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,800
clung to the property until
he defaulted on the mortgage

507
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,350
and the bank foreclosed.

508
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,700
The use was finally razed?

509
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,400
Back in '99, about the same time
Rossilini went off the grid.

510
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,850
Pixelerator Media

511
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,250
took over the property, but
never wound up breaking ground.

512
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,450
By the time the litigation
ended, the tech market crashed.

513
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,400
Started outsourcing their
computer programmers overseas.

514
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,600
What do we know about Rossilini?

515
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,600
Worked ten years
at Kinetic Core Engineerin

516
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,100
laid off in '97.

517
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,700
Same firm as Eugene Schmidt,
bomb survivor '01.

518
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,950
Rossilini losehis job,
wants payback.

519
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,550
We know if he has
any family in town?

520
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,900
Divorced in '99.

521
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,700
Had a four-year-old daughter
at the time.

522
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,700
All right, talk to Schmidt,
track down the ex-wife.

523
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,450
See if she knows where
we might find him today.

524
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,000
Hey, boss, you'll be sure to
give us a ads up, right?

525
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,100
What's that?

526
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,450
When they start outsourcing
murder cops.

527
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,350
<i>I left Kinetic Core</i>

528
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,350
after the attack.

529
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,900
Took me a while before I could
walk back into any office.

530
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,550
Bomb went off outside,
the courtyard?

531
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,650
I lost sight
in my right eye.

532
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,850
But then, it made
me quit smoking.

533
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,100
You remember
a mechanical engineer

534
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,700
named Alessandro Rossilini?

535
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,850
Why?

536
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,200
You thinhe did this to me?

537
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,500
You rememberou let him go,
right?

538
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,200
Along with about
20 other guys

539
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,200
in h division.

540
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,950
I was senior VP project design.

541
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,950
It wasn't personal.

542
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,400
But he didn't take it too well?

543
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,950
He was a good
engineer, but...

544
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,500
most of them never
saw it coming.

545
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,250
I just don't understand.

546
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,700
I thought you were
happy with my work.

547
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,850
It's got nothing to do
with your performance.

548
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,100
We're being forced to
restructure our overhead costs.

549
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
But we're profitable every year.

550
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,750
And it's my job
to keep it that way.

551
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,800
Look, you might want to think
abouretraining,

552
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
you know, another
area of expertise.

553
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,550
I'm a mechanical engineer
with a master's.

554
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,000
I have 15 years experience.

555
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,300
We're opening a new
plant in Bangalore,

556
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,350
training enginrs to do
computer-aided design

557
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,600
at one-fifth the salary.

558
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,900
You just can do this
to people.

559
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,000
Look, you're not hearing me,
Alessandro.

560
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,000
Your skills have
been commodified.

561
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,300
We're not the on company
doing it.

562
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,800
I have a wife, a kid.

563
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,050
I have a mortgage.

564
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,100
Take the severance.

565
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,000
Use the time to find
some temp work

566
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,550
until you figure out
something else.

567
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,150
But those jobs
were headed overseas

568
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,850
and they weren't coming back.

569
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,250
Honestly, I haven't talked
to my ex-husband in years.

570
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,800
Pretty much since
the divorce.

571
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,000
What did he doter he was fired?

572
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,900
Alessandro just went
into a spiral,

573
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,800
trying to find a decent job
at even half the salary,

574
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,900
much less benefits.

575
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,550
But you have
a daughter, right?

576
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,500
He didn't petition
for custody, visitation?

577
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,800
What?

578
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,050
We lost our heal insurance

579
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,400
some time before
my daughter got sick.

580
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,500
Sick?

581
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,500
Bilateral retinoblastoma.

582
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,500
It's a treatable cancer
if it'caught early enough.

583
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,600
How old was your daughter?

584
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,800
Four.

585
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,700
We both were
working overtime,

586
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,950
but we couldn't keep up
with our health premium.

587
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,800
What about Medicaid?
We qualified

588
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,200
but... it just bame
increasingly difficult

589
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,050
to find the kind of care
that Sophia needed.

590
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,600
* Caught in your mystery... *

591
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,850
Oh, excuse me.

592
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,900
Excuse me, sir? Sir?

593
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,950
I said excuse me.

594
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,800
Are you a doctor?

595
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,350
A nurse? No, I'm a
physician's assistant.

596
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,400
Oh, hi. I'm-I'm a father
of a four-year-old girl

597
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,150
who's been waiting

598
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,950
in that room for
over two hours now.

599
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,550
I'm sorry, sirWhat's your name

600
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,400
Uh, I already gave thato everybody here,

601
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,500
like, my name and information,
like, five times.

602
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,800
Okay, well, then what you need
to do is just be patient

603
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:01,950
with us, all right?

604
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,350
Excuse me, but my daughter...

605
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,550
she's been waiting

606
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,500
in that room

607
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,400
for a long time
in pain, okay?

608
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,250
Waiting for a doctor,
a nurse,

609
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,900
a physician's assistant or anyone
to just come and see her. Sir.

610
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,600
I understand.

611
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,100
I'm sorry, our
computers are down.

612
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,950
You're gonna have to be
patient and wait your turn.

613
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,250
See, I don't care
about the computers.

614
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,850
I just want a human being

615
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,250
to give my daughter
something for her pain.

616
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,150
Again, I apologize
for the inconvenience.

617
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,000
You have insurance.

618
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,400
You're welcome to try
another hospital.

619
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,900
Wait, that's your answer?

620
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,150
To go somewhere else?
What kind of care is this?

621
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,400
Sir, let go of my arm. If
the damn insurance company

622
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,450
would've screened
my daughter a year ago,

623
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,400
we would've started
the chemo then.

624
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,750
And then the cancer wouldn't have
spread through her entire body.

625
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,950
I'm sorry, sir, but that
has nothing to do with me.

626
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,800
Oh, no, you're sorry
for what?

627
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,500
That the computers are down.
Look...

628
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,150
we're doing
the best we can.

629
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,600
The hell you are!

630
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,850
The hell you are!

631
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,800
This whole damn system,

632
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,950
it just doesn't work!

633
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,150
Your best isn't good enough.

634
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,550
That's victim number two,
physician's assistant at County.

635
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,000
Roderick Poole.

636
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,350
Sophia

637
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,850
was too far along.

638
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,550
She passed six months later.

639
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,950
When did Alessandro leave?

640
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,300
I left him.

641
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,950
When our daughter died,
our marriage died, too.

642
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,250
Any idea where
he could've gone?

643
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,100
I always assumed he went to go
live with his brother Luciano.

644
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,800
His brother.

645
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,600
You know where
we can contact him?

646
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,800
I'm sorry.

647
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,550
It, uh...

648
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,950
it's just...
it's been a long time.

649
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,250
What's the DA doing here?

650
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,650
He called in the feds.

651
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,050
The FBI's here?

652
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,900
Oh, you st missed
thbig press conference.

653
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,350
DA announced
a joint task force

654
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
with the FBI.

655
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,550
"Presently conducting
an investigation

656
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,000
"to locate
the whereabouts

657
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,800
of the person of interest. "

658
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,550
"In cooperation with
the Philadelphia

659
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,300
Police Department. "
Of course.

660
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,100
Forgot the best part.

661
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,500
"The tasforce
has already

662
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,100
"collaborated to thwart
the bomber's attack

663
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,850
on an intended target. "

664
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,550
You're kidding me.

665
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,500
Do you believe this?

666
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,200
That info was stricted
to protect Luke Ross.

667
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,250
Was.

668
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,400
The boss already sent

669
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,800
Vera and Miller to beef up
the security detail.

670
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,800
Can I talk to you?

671
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,600
You brought
the ds in?

672
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,250
No, my boss did.
Yeah.

673
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,850
And just revealed
to the press

674
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,400
that our bomber
missed his last target.

675
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,200
Thanks for thaScotty, it's pretty clea

676
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,450
you needed help
bringing this guy in.

677
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,650
That's a bunch of bull.

678
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,850
It's a joint task force. It's a joke.

679
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,250
Look, the feds
don't share information,

680
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,200
they just taket.

681
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,000
They're not on the ground,
doing the legwork,

682
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,750
dealing with the victims. You need
to look at the big picture, Scotty.

683
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,450
Last I checked, this guy
is still out there.

684
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Look, where I come from,

685
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,700
we try not
to turn witnesses

686
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,900
into collateral damage.

687
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,000
That's the big picture.

688
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,800
My job is to put
this guy away.

689
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,450
That's not my problem.

690
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,400
You know, if he goes back
to finish Ross now,

691
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,550
his blood's on your hands.

692
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,450
I tracked down the name of the
bomber's brother on Accurint.

693
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,800
Luciano Rossilini legally
changed his name back in '98.

694
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,100
Luke Ross?

695
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,950
- Same guy he tried to Kill?
- ???

696
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,650
????

697
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,500
long before I changed it
legally.

698
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,550
What about your
last name, Luciano,

699
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,400
that too Italian?

700
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,950
Or you just running
from something?

701
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,050
In my line of work, it w just
easier to shorten it

702
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,350
when I switched jobs.

703
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,300
We think you knew
about it all along.

704
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,750
That the man we've been
searching for is your brother.

705
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Alessandro.

706
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,000
What's, it's ridicous.

707
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, come on, the harassing
phone call to your wife.

708
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,100
What he said.

709
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,600
All he'd been through,
how angry

710
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,900
and bitter he'd become.

711
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,750
Look, my brother...

712
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,350
has fallen on
some hard times of late,

713
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,150
t he's not
a violent man.

714
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,500
 The bomb he left for you

715
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,050
just blew off another man's arm.

716
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,300
You got lucky
this time, Luke.

717
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,750
I admit we had
a falling out.

718
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,400
But he's still my brother.

719
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,100
Look, you looked up
to him as a kid.

720
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,700
But your brother
needs help now, Luke.

721
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,050
He was like a hero to me
growing up.

722
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,700
He had that job
and the house,

723
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,150
beautiful family...

724
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,700
But he lost it all.

725
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,550
Got dealt some pretty raw blows.

726
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,200
His whole wod just fell apart.

727
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,700
Do you know where he is now?

728
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,100
Last time I saw him,

729
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,100
he was holed up
in our parents' old house. 

730
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,600
Couldn't get him out.

731
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,300
Sandro, we got to talk.

732
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,599
You got to get
out, Sandro.

733
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,850
They're coming to
tear the place down.

734
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
You have to let it go.

735
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,700
Do I know you?

736
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,750
I know things have been hard...

737
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,850
what you've gone through.

738
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,500
You think you know
what I've been through.

739
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,700
I'm sorry.

740
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,200
You don't know
anhing about loss

741
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,150
or sacrifice.

742
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,300
But Dad knew.

743
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,400
He was out of work when
he made us this music box

744
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,100
for Sophia for Christmas.

745
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,400
Look at the detail.

746
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,100
I remember.

747
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,700
The craftsmanship.

748
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,200
He found the time

749
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,600
toreate things
of lasting value,

750
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,050
things with integrity.

751
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,400
Dad had a lot of pride
in his work.

752
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,950
Like the tile work at

753
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:39,700
the 20th Street station.

754
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,200
The stonework
on this house.

755
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,200
This was... this was
our parents' dream.

756
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,250
It's our legacy.

757
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,050
Things change.

758
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,149
Remember he always
used to tell us

759
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,300
the story of John Henry?

760
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,500
He tried to warn us

761
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,850
to work with our brains
rather than our backs.

762
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
And so I did.

763
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,750
We both did.

764
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,500
I got an education...

765
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,400
a good job...

766
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,850
I tried to do good work,

767
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,700
and in the e,
it just doesn't matter.

768
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,900
I'm disposable, like
everything is now.

769
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,100
And now

770
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,800
you want to let them tear down
the street that we grew up on,

771
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,950
so they can build, what?

772
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,800
They can sell
people, what?

773
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,400
Crap that
nobody needs.

774
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,800
The street's gone,
Sandro.

775
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,150
Not everything's meant
to last forever.

776
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,750
So just give up and let them
have the house

777
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,050
that I raised my daughter in?

778
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,950
It's time to move on.

779
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,700
You...

780
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,850
You are perfect for this world,
little brother.

781
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,600
Making money
off the bas

782
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,450
of others.

783
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,850
You're going to have
to pay the mortgage,

784
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,200
'cause I'm not giving
you any moreoney.

785
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,250
You're not my brother.

786
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,000
Get out of my house.

787
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,300
* Who am I? *

788
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,100
He stayed untithe bulldozers
finally came.

789
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,600
I don't know where he went after that.

790
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,950
He mentioned
the train station-

791
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,600
the one your father worked on.

792
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,700
It's the 20th Street station.

793
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,600
My dad did the tile work there.

794
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,750
The same station the call
came from the pay phone.

795
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
There's SWAT and bomb squad
en route, boss.

796
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Security camera at the station
picked him up on a bench.

797
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,200
He hasn't moved
in over an hour.

798
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
I'll have them stop the
train lines, seal the station.

799
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,450
Have Vera and Miller
give Mr. Ross

800
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,800
a ride back home.
I'm comingith you.

801
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,650
My brother's there.

802
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,650
He might talk to me.

803
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,700
Get him a vest.

804
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,200
Keep him behind the shield
in case we need him.

805
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
He's got something
on his lap.

806
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,850
I'm going to make
an approach.

807
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,950
Lieutenant Stillman,
Alessandro.

808
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,400
Call me John.

809
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,850
I used to come heremetimes with my father

810
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,950
and I'd just sit here.

811
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,600
It always calmed me.

812
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,800
You father did
beautiful work.

813
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,850
That's when people

814
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,100
took pride in it,
when they built things to last.

815
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,100
He always said it was
better to be the guy

816
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,450
who designed it, but...

817
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,950
they don't even
do that anymore.

818
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,100
He sounds like a man
of integrity.

819
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,400
Who knew it'd all
come down to this?

820
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,200
You did,
Alessandro.

821
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,900
But you can stop it right now.

822
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,250
It never stops, never stops,
never, never.

823
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,000
At first I thought

824
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,700
I'd gone mad.

825
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,350
But then I realized
it wasn't me.

826
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,300
It's the world
that's gone mad.

827
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,050
Everything that's happened,
all you lost...

828
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,450
you n't bring that back.

829
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You become numb,

830
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,150
disconnected, conditioned
to accept every...

831
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,950
every indignity.

832
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,400
Disposable.

833
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,300
Is that really what this
is all about

834
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,400
It's never
anyone's fault.

835
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,650
Never.

836
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,850
"I'm jusdoinmy job.

837
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,350
's no personal.
It's just business. "

838
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,150
But is is personal,
isn't it?

839
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,100
When it's your family?

840
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,250
People have to answer
for what they do.

841
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,650
I gave them all a chance

842
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,500
again and again.

843
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,300
Put the box down, Alessandro.

844
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,300
But you can only
get pushed down

845
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,150
so far before you have
to stand up

846
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,350
and tell them you have value.

847
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,700
* Last Christmas,
I gave you my heart *

848
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,550
Curt?

849
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,050
* But the very next day
you gave it away *

850
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,550
* This year,
to save me from tears *

851
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,400
What's the problem now, sir?

852
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,500
The prlem is that
this thing doesn't work.

853
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,450
What is it?

854
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,750
It's a shower radio.

855
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,050
You have a receipt?

856
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,700
What's wrong with it?

857
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,750
As soon  it got wet,
the radio broke.

858
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,450
Piece of crap, huh?

859
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,700
What did you say?

860
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,150
I'm sorry,
but it's after 30 days.

861
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,300
So what?

862
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,700
So we can't accept
any returns after  days,

863
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,800
unless you purchased
an in-store extended warranty.

864
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,700
You must be joking.
I wish I was.

865
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,200
You can send it back
to the manufacturer.

866
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,550
It's still under their warranty.
To where, Taiwan?

867
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,850
I mean, it would cost me more

868
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,350
to ship it there
than what it's worth.

869
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,400
I'm sorry, sir.

870
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,000
Uh, next in line.

871
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,900
No, no, just a minute,
just a minute.

872
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,150
No, see,
if you were truly sorry,

873
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,150
you would stand by the product
and just give me my money back.

874
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
I don't make the rules, sir.

875
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,100
So that's it?

876
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,900
Just send it back
to the manufacturer?

877
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,650
You're sure that this is the way
you want to handle this?

878
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,100
Look, man,

879
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,150
you're right,
it's going to cost you less

880
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,750
just to toss it
and buy a new one.

881
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,200
What the hell kind
of product is that?

882
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,600
Disposable.

883
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,350
I'm sorry you feel that way.

884
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,150
I'm sorry, sir,
I can't help you.

885
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,750
Then I can't help you.

886
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,600
* But iyou kissed me now *

887
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,800
Next in line.

888
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,900
* Last Chstmas,
I gave you my heart *

889
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,400
* The very next day... *

890
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,750
Sometimes you have
to wake people up.

891
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,650
Make them realize how
we've all been diminished.

892
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Even the innocent?
No one's innocent.

893
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,550
No one. We're all...
we're all complicit in this...

894
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,800
in this mess.

895
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,300
People need to be made

896
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,700
to understand...

897
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,750
About loss.

898
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,250
You used to bring
your daughter here.

899
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,850
Isn't that really
what this is about?

900
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,400
All the blame...

901
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,800
clinging to everything
in the past?

902
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,400
People expect you toove on.

903
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,250
Yeah, but you can't.

904
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,900
It's not natural to outlive
your own child. 

905
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,400
 But you can't destroy
this place.

906
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,400
All your father built.

907
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
No, I would ner do that.

908
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,800
's not there.

909
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,300
The bomb's not there.

910
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,800
But nothing lasts forever.

911
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,950
Mom, Mom, I've got
to show you something.

912
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Hello.

913
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,300
Oh, hi, Mom.

914
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,650
No, we're fine.

915
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,850
Mom, I got the coolest thing
at school day in my cubby. Look.

916
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,050
Where's your wife now?

917
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,850
Picking up Mia from school.

918
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,450
She should be home by now.

919
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,150
What's going on?

920
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,650
It's okay, Mom.
We have police watching us

921
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,500
wherever we go.

922
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,050
Vera, answer damn it.

923
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,400
Yeah.

924
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,550
Get them out of the house.

925
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,500
How could you?

926
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,500
How could you do this?!

927
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,600
How could
you do this?!

928
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,200
How could you do this?!

929
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,350
* I'm holding on your rope *

930
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,250
* Got me ten feet
off the ground *

931
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,300
* And I'm hearing what you say *

932
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,300
* But I just can't make
a sound *

933
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,100
* You tell me that you need me *

934
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,250
* Then you go and cut me down *

935
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,000
* But wait *

936
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,200
* You tell me
that you're sorry *

937
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,600
* Didn't think I'd turn around *

938
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,450
* And say that *

939
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,000
<i>* It's too late to apologize *

940
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,150
* It's too late *

941
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,900
* I said it's too late
to apologize *

942
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,500
* It's too late *

943
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,600
* It's too late *

944
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,550
* Ooh *

945
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,050
* I'd take another chance *

946
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,200
* Take a fall,
take a shot foyou *

947
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,400
* Oh *

948
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,400
* And I need you like
a heart needs a beat *

949
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,650
* But it's nothing new *

950
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,500
* Yeah, yeah *

951
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,600
* I loved you
with the fire red *

952
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,250
* Now it's turning blue *

953
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,600
* And you say *

954
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,200
* Sorry like an angel
heaven let me think was you *

955
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,900
* But I'm afraid *

956
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,950
* It's too late to apologize *

957
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
*t's too late *

958
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,800
* I said it's too late
to apologize *

959
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:25,850
