2
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,100
Get in the car, homegirl!

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,800
Yeah, it's
party time, yo!

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,900
They're here!

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,700
You don't have
to go, Anna.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,800
Not every Amish person
leaves for rumspringa.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Mom.

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,700
That's why you never
got to see the ocean

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,300
like you always wanted.

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,900
Today's my birthday.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,700
I'm-I'm-I'm 16.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,900
I didn't forget.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,200
It's soil
from the garden,

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,300
so you won't forget
where home is.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,000
I couldn't find any sand.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,100
Don't worry, Mom.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm going to see the real ocean.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,800
I love you.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,900
And I love you.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,700
Get in, get in.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,900
Put this in--
it's great.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,800
Write to me every day.

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,000
Tell me what it's like
out there.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,100
Every single day. I promise.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,600
Whoo! Let's do it.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
How fast can you get us
to the train station?

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
The train station?

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,100
We're going
to Philadelphia, Rachel.

29
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,200
Philadelphia?

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,600
That's a city-- a big city.

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,100
The bigger the better.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
Anna.

33
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,000
<i>City kicked in</i>
 <i>for some new windows.</i>

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,700
Only took them
five months.

35
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,300
Nice not having
that constant reminder.

36
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,200
Heard IAD came by last week 
and talked to Scotty.

37
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,400
Yeah, he talk to you
anything about it?

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
- No.
- You're detectives.

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Right?

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,300
And you are?

41
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,400
Sarah Gunden.

42
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,900
My sister Anna
disappeared a year ago.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,500
We deal in homicides,
not missing persons.

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,100
She wrote to me

45
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,500
every day,
just like she promised,

46
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,300
and then her letters
just stopped.

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
And what was your sister doing
in Philly?

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,300
She came here on rumspringa.

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,900
Mine started today.

50
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,000
Rumspringa. That that
Amish-kids-gone-wild thing?

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,300
The day we turn 16,
all rules stop.

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,200
We're allowed to go
into the world,

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,300
do English things,
till we decide to go back.

54
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,000
Maybe your sister
liked our ways better.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,300
Anna wouldn't have just disappeared 
without telling me.

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,900
I just know.

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,500
Something happened to her.

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,300
Last one's dated
August 20, 2006.

59
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,300
It's a Kensington postmark.

60
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,400
Ain't exactly the
tea-and-crumpets part of town.

61
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,900
You know who
she was staying with?

62
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,200
A friend.

63
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,500
She didn't use names.

64
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,700
Anna ever have
any broken bones?

65
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,800
Dental work?

66
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,200
Something to identify her?

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,300
She's missing a tooth
in the back.

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,000
The way our dentist
fixes cavities.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Is there a number
we can reach you?

70
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Verkler's?

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,900
It's a farm supply store
down the road from my home.

72
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,400
They'll find me.

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
How? Smoke signals?

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,100
You're not
staying in Philly?

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,400
The only reason I care about rumspringa

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,700
is to find out
what happened to my sister.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,200
Amish kid in Philadelphia.

78
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,700
A babe in the woods.

79
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,500
Should've stayed
where she belonged.

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,800
Talked to IAD.

83
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,500
Guy's a real son of a bitch.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
No kidding.

85
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,600
Yeah, and he knew about
the Burrell job,

86
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,300
what went down,
and for the life of me,

87
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,700
I can't figure out
how he found out about that.

88
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,300
I don't know either.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,900
A lot of smoke and mirrors,
these investigations.

90
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,800
Sure about that, boss?

91
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,400
You want to rephrase
that, Scotty?

92
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,700
Is that in my file?

93
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,800
Vigilante dad tried
to kill Burrell

94
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,900
based on info you gave him.

95
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
You think no one was
going to figure that out?

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,900
Are you saying everyone knows?

97
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,400
Your own fault, Scotty.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
You screwed up.

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,600
<i>No shortage of Jane Does</i>

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,700
in the City of
Brotherly Love.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,500
What happens when you got 
406 homicides in a calendar year.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,900
Here's something.

103
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,900
16-to-18-year-old female,
missing molar.

104
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,500
DOD between August 10
and September 10, 2006.

105
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,000
Postmark date of Anna's
last letter fits.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,600
City demolition crew found
her body in the basement

107
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
of an abandoned apartment
building in Kensington.

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,100
Emerald Street.

109
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,400
Surface abrasions on her heels,
carpet fibers.

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,100
Well, she was dragged there.

111
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,300
I'll check real estate files
for owners.

112
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,500
Cause of death's
a five-inch serrated knife.

113
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,500
Ouch.

114
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,100
No signs of sexual trauma.

115
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,400
No drugs or alcohol
in her system.

116
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,700
And no suspects.

117
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,800
Case went cold
almost from day one.

118
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,900
What's an Amish girl doing

119
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,700
in an abandoned apartment
building in Kensington?

120
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,400
Dressed like this.

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,200
That don't look
so Amish to me.

122
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,900
Maybe she runs out of money,
turns to the streets?

123
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,500
Gets killed by a john?

124
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,400
Roller coaster rumspringa.

125
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,300
We get anything
from those letters she wrote?

126
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,800
Nah, just the typical
teenage angst.

127
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Kid that age-- ain't easy
survivin' a brand-new culture.

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
And you would know?

129
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,700
My dad--

130
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,000
he came here from Cuba
when he was 15.

131
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,600
This type of thing
changes a person.

132
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,500
We, uh, Photoshop
her picture

133
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,700
with Amish clothes,

134
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
recirculate it,
maybe get lucky.

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,700
Well, who's going to Lancaster,

136
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,100
see if the family
can make an ID?

137
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,900
I hear the Amish
don't like outsiders too much.

138
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Not into chasing
some horse and buggies?

139
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,000
Hell, no.

140
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,000
No, don't look at me.

141
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,600
So, who's going?

142
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,900
What the hell
these people do all day?

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
No TV, phone.

144
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,800
Place is like a Colonial
day reenactment.

145
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,400
Quit gawking.

146
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,000
And they're looking at us
like we're the weirdoes.

147
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
May I help you?

148
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,100
Philly PD,
Mrs. Gunden.

149
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,800
We're here about your daughter.

150
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
You found Anna?

151
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,600
You brought these outsiders
here?

152
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,700
Where is my sister?

153
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,900
We have a photo
we'd like you to look at.

154
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,800
For identification purposes.

155
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,700
Identification purposes?

156
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,900
A Jane Doe.

157
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
A girl without a name?

158
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,900
We think it might be her.

159
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,100
We'd like to ask a few questions
about the day she left.

160
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
No.

161
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,600
Ma'am?

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,900
Whatever happened
to my daughter...

163
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,300
it was God's will.

164
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,400
It's not our place to interfere.

165
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
It's the Amish way.

166
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,100
Well, it's our job to get
to the truth of what happened.

167
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,500
We need your help.

168
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,800
She left with Rachel Wagler,

169
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,800
her best friend.

170
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,500
She lives down the road.

171
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,800
I'd like to see my daughter.

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,500
We'll make arrangements
to get her back to you

173
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,100
as soon as possible.

174
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,100
My baby has to come home.

175
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,400
Philly PD.

176
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,700
Is this Rachel
Wagler's home?

177
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,600
Yes.

178
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,700
She's inside.

179
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,000
Thanks.

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,100
You can wait here... sir.

181
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,400
Rachel?

182
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,300
I'm Detective Rush.

183
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,000
Philly Homicide.

184
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,200
Homicide?

185
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,800
I don't understand.

186
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,900
I'm here about Anna Gunden.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Her family just

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
identified her body.

189
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
Is there some way
I can help you?

190
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Understand
the two of you

191
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
went to the city together.

192
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,700
I barely even remember that.

193
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,600
Must have been some reason
the two of you split up.

194
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,200
I... wanted to come home.

195
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
She didn't.

196
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,200
Why?

197
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,200
Mighty quiet around here.

198
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Might want to give me a hand.

199
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,700
Hmm.

200
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,100
You must miss her a lot.

201
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,400
It's a real tragedy.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,300
She's better off
in the afterlife.

203
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,600
I was talking about you.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Not having
your best friend around.

205
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,800
And she never even got
to meet your baby.

206
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,100
Of course I miss her.

207
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,900
So help me find
the person who killed her.

208
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,900
I hated it out there.

209
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,200
The cars,

210
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,500
the noise...

211
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,600
And the people--
one minute they're happy,

212
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,100
the next they're mad.

213
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,900
You never knew what was going
to happen next.

214
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,200
Anna didn't mind?

215
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,500
No way.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,700
She loved chaos.

217
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,900
Blasting music.

218
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,200
No rules.

219
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,300
What happened when you went
to the city?

220
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,400
Anna was in heaven.

221
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,800
But for me..

222
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,300
it might as well have been
another planet.

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,400
Jakob!

224
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,200
Anna!

225
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh!

226
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,400
* Suddenly I see *
Anna.

227
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,100
Amish in the house!

228
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,600
What's up, homegirl?

229
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,900
What's up?
We made it.

230
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,700
Gots any news
from the homestead?

231
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,500
My parents still lame as always?

232
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,600
I haven't seen them since
I called you from Verkler's.

233
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,400
Yeah, no worries.

234
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,800
So, ready to par-tay or what?

235
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,500
Definitely!
What about the beach?

236
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,900
Shh. Relax,
female-lady-girl.

237
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,100
Every damn Amish kid
wanting to see the ocean.

238
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,900
First we gots
a scene to check.

239
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,200
- All right? Come on.
- Okay.

240
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Did you hear that?
A party.

241
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,300
But aren't you scared?

242
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,100
Nothing's the same as home.

243
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
No one's telling us
what to do either.

244
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,300
"Keep your voices down, girls."

245
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,100
"Don't be so proud, girls."

246
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,000
It's hard to figure out
who you are

247
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,700
when you're just following
rules.

248
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,200
You promise to stay close?

249
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,800
Yes.

250
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,200
And if you get scared,
just remember:

251
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,800
life is not a dress rehearsal.

252
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,300
I wish I could take it all back.

253
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,300
Say I never cracked a beer,
tried other things.

254
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,300
This Jakob character--

255
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,500
he Anna's connection
to the city?

256
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,700
He left during rumspringa, 
decided not to be Amish anymore.

257
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,700
He loved the
English world,

258
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,800
couldn't understand

259
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,700
why anyone would
want to come back.

260
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,600
And you girls were staying
with him?

261
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,900
At his apartment.

262
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,600
Recall where that was?

263
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,500
Frankford Avenue.

264
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,800
In Kensington?

265
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,200
He said that was his "hood."

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why?

267
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,400
You ready to go?

268
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,100
Yeah, let's get outta here.

269
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,300
Had me fooled, homeboy.

270
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
??? pegge you for Amish.

271
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Amish?

272
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,900
I said good-bye to those
backward folks forever.

273
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,600
So you're English
to the core now?

274
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Word.

275
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,400
Got me a PlayStation,

276
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,700
250 channels

277
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
of satellite TV
and a fridge

278
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,100
full of 40s.

279
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,200
Yeah?

280
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,500
That your bait, luring Amish
girls out to their death?

281
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
I didn't kill Anna.

282
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
I was helpi' her out.

283
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,100
She wanted in, I took her to all
the dope places.

284
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
This relationship
sexual?

285
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Man, she was Amish!

286
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,800
You think I mess around
with farm-raised tail?

287
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,300
You talk that way
around your mother?

288
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm just sayin',

289
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,900
maybe I could've eased her
into the scene gentle.

290
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,300
You know, given her a chance
to accumulate.

291
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,100
Anna...

292
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,900
get herself into trouble
her first night out?

293
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,900
Nah, that was my bad.

294
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,100
Girl had no business
being in that punk's crib,

295
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,500
and I shoulda knew it...

296
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,100
Rachel still
won't wake up.

297
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Word!

298
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,300
One adult beverage,
that whale's beached.

299
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,000
I promised I'd
look out for her.

300
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,300
I don't even know how long
she's been passed out up there.

301
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,100
It ain't your fault

302
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,400
female-lady-girl
slams her booze.

303
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,000
Now, you ready to
party or what?

304
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
The hell's Vince
coming over for?

305
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,200
Who's that?

306
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,300
You don't want to know.

307
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,200
He's crazy.

308
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,500
Hope it's cool, uh,
I heard about your party.

309
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,700
Name's Jakob.

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,400
Damaged freak.

311
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll be back.

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,800
Yo!

313
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,200
The hell you doing?

314
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,100
Living.

315
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Girl had some kinda death wish.

316
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,700
I should've looked out for her
better.

317
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,900
Well, what about
that knife?

318
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Big-ass thing, you know, with
them nasty jags on the side.

319
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,000
Freak always had it on him.

320
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Is that right?

321
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,300
Word on the street is

322
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,200
that he did some time in juvie
for stabbing a kid to death.

323
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,200
This isn't Thing Right Therapy.

324
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,400
Talking.

325
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,400
I gotta put in my hours.

326
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
Standard protocol.

327
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,900
Right.

328
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,700
Your daughter?

329
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,900
Yes.

330
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,100
Her name is Jessica.

331
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,500
If you just wanna fill the paper work?

332
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,800
Say I was here?

333
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,900
Okay.

334
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Lilly?

335
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,700
There's a reason it's required

336
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,800
to talk to someone
after a shooting.

337
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,600
Sure.

338
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Traumatic event like that, yeah.

339
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,100
Are you having any trouble
sleeping?

340
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,300
Nightmares?

341
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,100
No.

342
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,400
Okay.

343
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,400
See you next week.

344
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Looks like
him right here.

345
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,800
Yeah.

346
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,500
Vince Patrielli?

347
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Who's asking?

348
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,700
Philly PD.

349
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,400
So, Vince...

350
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,100
Want to try it
again, dumbass?

351
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,800
- I didn't do nothing!
- So why you running?

352
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,200
Felt like a workout.

353
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,700
Checked your juvie records.

354
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,300
Ain't nothing
about you knifing a guy.

355
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,800
Bunch o' bull to make you
seem like a badass.

356
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
You off Anna Gunden

357
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,300
to prove you were
some kind of man?

358
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,800
She's dead?

359
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,800
Aw, nice touch.

360
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,700
Hustler like you

361
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,100
acting like you give a crap
on the Amish girl.

362
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,900
It ain't like you think it was.

363
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,300
Then clue us in,
'cause the meter's running.

364
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,900
She may have looked Amish,
but she sure didn't act it.

365
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,700
I have a spot
like this, too.

366
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,300
I have six brothers and sisters.

367
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
Louder than
tornadoes.

368
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,100
I bet it's even better
up on the roof.

369
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,000
Ain't gettin!up there
in that muumuu.

370
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,400
So fix it.

371
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Make me look
English, not Amish.

372
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,100
My clothes, they're...

373
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,000
Stupid?

374
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,700
Fix them.

375
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,000
With this...

376
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,100
How do you know I won't do more?

377
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,400
Like cut you?

378
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Because you
believe in God.

379
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
Yeah, right.

380
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,400
If God exists, he was taking
work off the day I was born.

381
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Your parents don't
live here, do they?

382
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,400
What's your problem?

383
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,000
I just meant you're alone,
aren't you?

384
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,200
Maybe.

385
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,100
So, why do you have a spot
like this?

386
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,500
Guess I just don't
like people much.

387
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,800
Maybe I was waiting for you.

388
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,300
Turn.

389
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,800
I look...

390
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,900
Sick.

391
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
You can't tell I'm Amish?

392
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,000
No way.

393
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,600
Well, maybe a little.

394
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,700
We partied together 24/7,

395
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,600
maybe two, three weeks.

396
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,500
Then she split.

397
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,600
No good-bye, nothing.

398
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,300
That's a nice story, Vince.

399
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,000
Your summer of love.

400
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,400
Those Amish kids--
they always go back, right?

401
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,300
I thought that's what happened.

402
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,800
Where'd this knife of yours go?

403
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,100
Someone stole it.

404
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
Around the time Anna took off.

405
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,300
Didn't seem like
an odd coincidence?

406
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,400
Not till you tell me she's dead.

407
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,800
Can I go now?

408
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,500
Nah. I think I'll hang
onto you for a while.

409
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
Valens.

410
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,200
Right.

411
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,100
Pharmacist in Kensington
ID'd Anna's photo.

412
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,200
<i>She came into the store</i>

413
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,800
<i>about a year ago,</i>
 <i>but she wasn't the one</i>

414
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,300
sporting the Amish-wear.

415
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,600
She was with a friend?

416
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,400
Yeah, kind of
mousy girl.

417
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,400
Brown hair,
maybe five foot, three.

418
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,900
Sounds like Rachel Wagler.

419
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,600
Mm.

420
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,700
Anna was the one
wearing normal clothes?

421
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,400
I don't know
if you'd call them normal.

422
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,900
The dress was all ripped up,
kind of dirty looking.

423
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,000
But you know kids these days.

424
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,100
You have a pretty good memory.

425
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,300
I remember all my shoplifters.

426
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
This color's sick.

427
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Don't you think?

428
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,000
Sick?

429
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,900
You should hear yourself.

430
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,000
What's wrong?

431
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,000
Are you mad at me
or something?

432
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,300
I want to go home.

433
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,500
We're just starting
to have fun.

434
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,300
You mean you and Vince.

435
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,700
Well, I think I'm, you know...

436
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,200
What, in love?

437
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,800
Why are you
acting like this?

438
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,500
God.

439
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,000
Why did I listen to you?

440
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,300
About coming here?

441
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,600
We didn't want any more rules.

442
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,400
 <i>You</i> didn't want rules.

443
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,500
I like rules.

444
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,300
I like being Amish.

445
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,800
It's not my fault
nothin's good enough for you.

446
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,000
All right, young lady.

447
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,700
I didn't do
anything.

448
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,900
I was talking to her.

449
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,500
I knew you wouldn't
pay for that.

450
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,300
A pregnancy test?

451
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,400
But... who was it?

452
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,200
If you tell anyone,
I'll kill you.

453
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,400
I swear, Anna, I'll kill you.

454
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,500
Wouldn't usually expect
the dowdy one

455
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,200
to have the sticky fingers,
but...

456
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,600
You press charges?

457
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,400
Girl in a predicament
like that, Amish and all--

458
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,800
I figured
she had enough problems.

459
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,300
And her problem's just going 
a whole lot worse.

460
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,500
<i>So, if Rachel's pregnant</i>

461
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,100
in August '06...

462
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
What's term,
40 weeks?

463
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,900
Don't look at me.

464
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,300
Well, maybe this son of hers
ain't so Amish after all.

465
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,000
If you want to split hairs,
her kid won't decide

466
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
if he's Amish
till after rumspringa.

467
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,100
Thanks.

468
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,400
Been needing one of these.

469
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah, I heard
about shop class, Nick.

470
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,400
You going native on us?

471
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,700
You should take a trip
out there.

472
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,900
No, thanks.

473
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,300
You ever notice
when the power goes out

474
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,900
all the buzzing stops?

475
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,400
Streetlights,

476
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,200
refrigerators,
stuff you didn't even know

477
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
makes noise?

478
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,600
That's what it's like.

479
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,200
Pure silence.

480
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
He is goin' native.

481
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,100
So, Rachel gets back
to the farm pronto.

482
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,400
Passes the kid off
as her new husband's.

483
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,500
Mose.

484
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,300
And no one's the wiser
unless Anna threatens to tell.

485
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,400
Now that's a secret
worth killing for.

486
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
We're a happy family.

487
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,200
Why can't you just
leave us alone?

488
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,000
If you'd been straight with me
the first time,

489
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,900
I wouldn't be here.

490
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
I answered your questions.

491
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,300
Forgot the part where
you got pregnant on rumspringa?

492
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,000
- I didn't mean to lie.
- Course not.

493
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,800
I didn't want to talk about
the worst night in my life.

494
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,700
Night you killed Anna
to keep her quiet?

495
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,100
"Tell anyone,
and I'll kill you."

496
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,800
Your words.

497
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,300
I was scared.

498
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
She wouldn't have told anyone.

499
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,900
You've got motive, no alibi.

500
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,600
We were like blood.

501
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,600
We came from the same place.

502
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,300
It was the English
who were heartless.

503
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,900
I can't believe
we're going to see the ocean.

504
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,500
And the ocean's
going to see you.

505
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,300
Come on,
let's just go.

506
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,600
- Go ahead, I'll catch up.
- Are you sure?

507
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
Just go.

508
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,100
My God.

509
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,600
It's so beautiful.

510
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,000
Anna?

511
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm sorry what I said to you.

512
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I was scared.

513
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,300
Did you take the test?

514
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,400
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

515
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,900
Have you ever seen water so big?

516
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,000
Just the pond
behind the schoolhouse.

517
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,300
Do you think
there's another world out there?

518
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,200
Something better than this one?

519
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,800
I don't know. I...

520
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,200
I doubt it.

521
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,500
Rachel, if you tell me
who it is, maybe I can help.

522
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,100
What's up, homegirls?

523
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Don't even say

524
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,000
Jakob doesn't deliver,
bitches!

525
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
Look at this scene!

526
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,100
You're wasted.
u're <i>always</i> wasted.

527
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,900
I want to be English forever!

528
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,600
Being Amish sucks!

529
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,800
Amish say

530
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,300
they helpin', but they ain't.

531
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,300
Livin' in the
1600s,ll pious

532
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
and crap.

533
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Can't tell me
what to do no more.

534
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,000
Wait.

535
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
You and Jakob?

536
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,800
No.

537
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,900
Then who?

538
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,900
Vince.

539
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What?

540
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,600
It was Vince.

541
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,300
But... how could you do that?

542
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,100
I didn't do anything. He did.

543
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,400
I was drunk.

544
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,800
You promised to stay close,
but you didn't.

545
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,200
And all I can see is his face
on top of me.

546
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,700
The night we got to Philly?

547
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,700
He's not the person
you think he is, Anna.

548
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,100
None of them are.

549
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,300
Anna thought that monster
was her knight in shining armor.

550
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,600
And the baby?

551
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,100
I asked Anna to come
home with me...

552
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,400
But she said she wasn't going 
to let them get away with it.

553
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Will you testify against him?

554
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,000
My husband loves my boy
like his own.

555
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,200
Please, don't make me.

556
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,300
How did I know
I'd be talkin'

557
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,900
to you again, bitch?

558
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Don't know.
Woman's intuition?

559
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Enough!

560
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,700
Scotty.

561
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,200
Wasn't all hunky-dory

562
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,900
with you and Anna like you said.

563
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,600
Unless raping her best friend
is part of ??? ritual?

564
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,200
You got a son out there.
Boy doesn't know who you are.

565
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,800
Cry me a river.

566
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,400
Kid's living
on some sunny-day farm.

567
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,800
You're going away for this.

568
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,200
You saying that
Amish loser is going

569
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
to hop on her horse
and buggy and testify?

570
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,700
She already
agreed to it.

571
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,100
Said she's been living
for the day

572
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,500
she takes you down.

573
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,400
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

574
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
I just bit first this time.

575
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
We're talking
about more

576
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,100
than rape charges
here, Vince.

577
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,700
Try murder one.

578
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,100
I told you...
I didn't kill Anna.

579
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,600
She knew what you did to Rachel.

580
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
She called you out,

581
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,400
didn't she?

582
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,900
Girl like that--

583
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,500
she wasn't afraid of anything.

584
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,900
Not even you.

585
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
For a while, I...

586
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,100
thought it could have
been different.

587
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,100
You know...

588
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,800
if I met her sooner.

589
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
Before you raped
her best friend.

590
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,100
Bottom line is,
Anna wanted to go home.

591
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,300
What's with the silent treatment
all the way from the shore?

592
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,900
Anna, come on. What's with you?

593
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,100
I thought I knew you.

594
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,600
I thought you were special.

595
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,900
You do know me.

596
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,500
She told me, all right?

597
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,700
I don't know
what you're talking about.

598
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,100
Rachel.

599
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,200
I know what you did to her.

600
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,600
It was just a joke, 'cause
she was lame and all.

601
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Somebody dared me.
It was dumb.

602
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,100
I-I didn't even
know you yet.

603
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,700
I can't believe
how stupid I was.

604
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,500
Believing in you and me,
and-and thinking it was fate.

605
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,900
- Anna, come on...
- Don't!

606
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,600
Just don't!

607
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,400
Grow up, Amish bitch.

608
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,300
This is the real world.

609
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,400
Everyone was right about you.

610
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,000
You are a damaged freak.

611
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,100
Yeah, but you're the pathetic
whore who came begging for it!

612
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,000
You're hurting me!

613
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Anna?

614
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,700
Mom?

615
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,000
So, Anna's mother was there?

616
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,800
She forgot to tell us
about this field trip.

617
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,600
Next thing you know,
Anna's dead.

618
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,600
wouldn't be the first christian to kill.

619
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,500
Isn't losing my daughter
punishment enough?

620
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,200
Not if you killed her.

621
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,100
Lying to us about
being in Philly

622
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,800
makes us think you did.

623
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,100
And if I told you,

624
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,800
would that have brought
Anna back?

625
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,200
Your daughter was trying
to figure out a lot of things

626
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,300
while on rumspringa.

627
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,600
To be or not to be Amish.

628
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,000
Tough question
to answer at that age.

629
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,200
But it looks like she was
starting to figure it out.

630
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,800
"I see Mom practically locked
in the kitchen,

631
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,900
raising seven children,
and I don't know

632
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,300
if that's what I want
from my life."

633
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,200
You were losing her.

634
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,000
You couldn't let that happen.

635
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,100
The example she'd
be setting for Sarah,

636
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,400
your other daughters...

637
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,300
Something Anna used to say:

638
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,600
"Life is not..."

639
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,200
"...a dress rehearsal."

640
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,000
I saw that on a...
bumper sticker.

641
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,500
I knew Anna would
appreciate it.

642
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,500
She was...

643
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,300
everything I wanted
to be but couldn't.

644
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,900
She was fearless.

645
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,100
Strong.

646
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,100
Anna's death...

647
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,300
was my fault.

648
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,700
I should have
let her come home.

649
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,600
Why did you come here?

650
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,600
I heard Rachel came back,
so I went to see her.

651
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
And then I was
worried about you.

652
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,900
Why?

653
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,600
A woman doesn't
have seven babies

654
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,100
without knowing what a
pregnant girl looks like, Anna.

655
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,500
I thought there was 
something for me here.

656
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,800
But I was wrong.

657
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,500
I'm coming home with you.

658
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,900
Mrs. Gunden?

659
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Jakob.

660
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,900
Do my parents know
that you're here?

661
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,700
Did they send you?

662
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,800
I thought maybe they were
worried or something.

663
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,800
My mom, maybe?

664
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,600
Mom? He's talking to you.

665
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,600
Jakob Beachy is in bann.

666
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,900
We are forbidden
to talk to him.

667
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,800
Good-bye, Mrs. Gunden.

668
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,400
Tell my folks I miss them, okay?

669
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,100
This is for you.

670
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,900
It's real sand.

671
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,300
You saw the ocean?

672
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,600
I know you think there's some
big world beyond it or whatever,

673
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,000
but it was just pretty.

674
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,600
That's all it was.

675
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,300
Are you sure?

676
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,100
Did you really look?

677
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,000
I don't want you to come home 
out of fear, Anna.

678
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,900
I've seen people give up.

679
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,200
But never you.

680
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,900
Why are you saying these things?

681
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
It's like you want me to stay.

682
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,700
I never had the chance.

683
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
But there is another
world out there.

684
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,200
A world much bigger than...

685
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,900
than this one.

686
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,100
You just have to really look.

687
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,700
All this time,

688
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,100
I thought she'd found
something better.

689
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,400
But I was wrong.

690
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,400
You said Jakob Beachy
was banned?

691
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Excommunicated.

692
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,600
But still,
he'd come back

693
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,500
late at nights, on drugs,

694
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,000
begging to be let back.

695
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,200
And so the church
gave him an ultimatum.

696
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,900
Which was what?

697
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,700
???

698
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,300
or never come back again.

699
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,000
So Jakob gets hooked.

700
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,900
Has no idea
what to do about it.

701
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
What happens when you
send your 18th century kid

702
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,500
into a 21st century world?

703
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,100
Do you want
to take a ride?

704
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,000
Where we going?

705
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,200
Chase some horse
and buggies.

706
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,500
Fools got me on LoJack?

707
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,700
Ain't hard to find
someone in your shoes.

708
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,400
Easiest place
to score in Kensington.

709
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,700
You're a far cry
from home, huh, Jake?

710
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
My family's from Cuba.

711
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,800
You know where that is?

712
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,800
Yeah, I guess.

713
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,400
Guy named Castro
takes over, 1959.

714
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,800
Throws anyone
who objects in jail

715
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,200
or worse.

716
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,900
My family's one of
the lucky ones.

717
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,300
But no matter how long
they've been in this country,

718
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,200
it still ain't... home.

719
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,600
You spend New Year's Eve
with any Cuban,

720
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,300
you hear them give the toast:

721
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,900
 <i>"El ao que viene en Cuba."</i>

722
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,500
"Next year in Cuba."

723
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,300
But 1959?

724
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,400
You do the math.

725
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,100
Been waiting a long time.

726
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,000
You tell me your life story,

727
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,700
I'll tell you mine?

728
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm thinking they're
one in the same.

729
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,000
I mean you lost your home,

730
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,300
your family,
everything you've ever known.

731
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,000
I know what that
does to a person.

732
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,100
How it makes them feel inside.

733
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,900
Lost.

734
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,500
So you pretended
to love the English world,

735
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,800
but deep down
you were scared.

736
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,800
I just want to go home so bad.

737
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,200
They want you to come home,
Jakob-- your parents.

738
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,200
They do?

739
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,500
I just talked to them.

740
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,400
They miss you, too.

741
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah, just like Anna's
parents miss her.

742
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,300
I didn't mean to hurt her.

743
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,500
She had a chance
to get out of this place.

744
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,800
And hear the quiet again.

745
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,500
But she didn't even care.

746
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,800
Jakob?

747
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,500
What's wrong?

748
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,800
Where's your mother?

749
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,000
- She went home.
- How come you get to go home

750
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,500
and I don't?

751
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,200
Why don't they love me, too?

752
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,800
I'm not going home.

753
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,300
Stop lying.

754
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,900
I changed my mind.

755
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm going to do rumspringa
the way we're supposed to.

756
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,200
I don't care.

757
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,700
I just want to go home.

758
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,800
You can.

759
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,900
You've just got
to quit partying.

760
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,800
I don't know how!

761
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,300
I'm going to go back with you.

762
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,200
You're going to tell
my folks I'm better.

763
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,800
You're going to tell them
that I stopped doing bad things.

764
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,000
They'll believe you.

765
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,700
- I'm not going back.
- You have to!

766
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,200
- It's the only way!
- No, Ja...

767
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,900
Stop!

768
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,600
Jakob, I'm going.

769
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,100
Get out of my way.

770
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,500
(stammers)Co

771
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,100
Stand up!

772
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,000
We're going to go home.
We're going to go home.

773
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,200
We're going to go home.
No, no...

774
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,700
We're going to go home.

775
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,000
We're going to go home.
We're going to go home.

776
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:28,100
