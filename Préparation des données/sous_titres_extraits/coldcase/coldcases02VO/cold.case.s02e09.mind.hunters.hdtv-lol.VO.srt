2
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:09,927
Mom, there's nothing to do here.

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,465
Well, you can help me
take out this trash.

4
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:14,265
That's not fun.

5
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:17,757
Well, then play with hammy
for god's sakes.

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,254
Why do you keep looking 
out the window?

7
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,563
Daddy isn't coming.

8
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:28,932
If he does, you remember
what I told you?

9
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:31,531
You hide behind the counter.

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,778
You hear me, Susan?

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,420
I want to go home.

12
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,466
Well, we're not going home.

13
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:52,409
Where are we gonna sleep?

14
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:54,744
What about my clothes 
and my bookbag?

15
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,300
My stuff?

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,513
We'll buy new things.

17
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,116
You can't barely buy anything.

18
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,283
We're gonna be okay.

19
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:12,340
You might not believe it 
right now, but it's true.

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,075
Hey.

21
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:18,999
I love you, little girl.

22
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,606
No, please, don't.

23
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:09,935
Please, please...

24
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,409
Missing Persons 
Lambert, Janet. Nov. 1985

25
00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:31,825
Her body was found by hikers.

26
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:33,280
A dog dug it up.

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,619
Good place to dump a body,
this preserve.

28
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,741
Yeah, nothing 
but woods for miles.

29
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,072
Only witnesses are 
the birds and the bees.

30
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:47,237
We get an I.D. yet, boss?

31
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:49,125
From a medic alert bracelet.

32
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,788
Janet Lambert.

33
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,083
White female, 31 years of age.

34
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,166
Reported missing in '85.

35
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:58,458
Disappeared from 
her place of work.

36
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,024
Last to see was her
11-year-old daughter.

37
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:03,551
Mom goes out with the trash.
Never comes back.

38
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,640
Poor kid.

39
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,257
From her chest cavity.

40
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:11,419
Shattered the ribcage.

41
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,763
Hell of a slug.

42
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:15,691
There's no bullet hole
in the clothes.

43
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:18,354
So the doer stripped her
before shooting her.

44
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:21,313
- Makes sense.
- Now that we know her name.

45
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,514
Next question...

46
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:27,601
Where's her head?

47
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,106
Cold Case 
2x09  Mind Hunters

48
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:57,550
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2004/11/28

49
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:00,481
Janet Lambert.

50
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:03,971
Worked the night shift at a 24-hour 
convenience store off the boulevard.

51
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:07,781
Where she disappeared 
from night of November 2, 1985.

52
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,266
Prime suspect at the time
was her husband, Leroy Lambert.

53
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,215
Says here, same day
Janet goes missing,

54
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:16,295
she filed domestic abuse
charges against hubby.

55
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:20,517
Walked out for beating her up in front
of their 11-year-old daughter.

56
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:22,356
Leaving cost Janet her life.

57
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:23,876
And her head.

58
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:26,430
Takes a lot of hate,
doing something like that.

59
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,593
The kid, Susan, says dad came to the 
store right before mom disappeared.

60
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,261
Not much of an I.D.

61
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:35,545
All she saw were 
a pair of men's boots.

62
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,480
How'd that go down?

63
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,063
Mom told her to hide behind 
the counter if someone came in,

64
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,939
afraid it might be dad.

65
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,841
Loving patriarch, this Leroy.

66
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,318
Missing Persons couldn't
pin him to it in '85.

67
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:48,616
Guy's alibi was solid.

68
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,898
Well, maybe it's crumbled some.

69
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:00,172
I was at the bowling alley
when Janet gone missing.

70
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:02,034
Whole place saw me sitting
up there at the bar.

71
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:05,124
Bunch of drunks passed out 
in their beers. Real reliable.

72
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:07,971
Bartender, too.
He didn't touch a drop.

73
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:09,781
Nice.

74
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:11,299
Helps me think straight.

75
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,919
Think about this.
Your wife's head was cut off.

76
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,556
Sicko who did that had a
personal score to settle.

77
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:19,782
The way we hear it, you've got
a mighty long score, Leroy.

78
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:22,723
That bitch had it coming
for what she did to me.

79
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:26,415
Susan! Time to eat!

80
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:29,330
I want my breakfast.

81
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,917
I promised Susan 
I'd take her to the mall.

82
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,348
I can cook you up something
hot when I get home.

83
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:38,188
I don't eat breakfast
out of no box!

84
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:41,915
Susan's in the next room, Leroy.
Please don't start or she'll see...

85
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:44,777
I ain't eating out of no box!

86
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:51,495
Sweetheart, come on,
time for breakfast.

87
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:54,669
Here you go, sweetie.

88
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:58,686
I'm sorry, honey, I won't be able
to take you to the mall today.

89
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:00,855
Next time, I promise.

90
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:05,241
You always break your promises.

91
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:07,020
Don't sass your mother!

92
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:09,431
Mom...

93
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:20,958
Don't you touch her!

94
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,361
Or me!

95
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,615
Never again!

96
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:33,484
That bitch walked out on me then 
and there. I never saw her again.

97
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:34,846
Your daughter says different.

98
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:36,883
Yeah, well, maybe what happened 
up in them woods to Janet

99
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:38,936
should have happened 
to Susan, too.

100
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:41,056
You're a real door prize, Leroy.

101
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:43,885
Man-hating bitch,
just like her mother.

102
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:46,280
I didn't kill Janet.

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
But I sure wish I did.

104
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:02,953
I always hoped my mother
was out there somewhere...

105
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:05,168
alive.

106
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:10,686
That day, she filed domestic abuse 
charges against your father.

107
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:12,258
Yes.

108
00:07:12,258 --> 00:07:13,757
Could I see that?

109
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:15,164
At the store,

110
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:17,884
right before your mom disappeared,
you said you saw someone?

111
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,637
I know.

112
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:22,310
It could have
been anyone's boots.

113
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,058
I was just a kid.

114
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,391
Scared.

115
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:27,762
Thought your dad 
was coming for you.

116
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:29,895
Your mom.

117
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,365
Walking on sunshine?

118
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:35,326
- What?
- It says it right here.

119
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:39,138
That song was playing on the radio
when my father was beating up my mom.

120
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:41,824
Well, what does that have to do
with her disappearance?

121
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,170
He was singing it.

122
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,940
Who?

123
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:47,793
The man who came into 
the store that night.

124
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,349
Hey.

125
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:53,678
I love you, little girl.

126
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,497
I'm walking on sunshine

127
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:27,756
Oh, yeah...

128
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:31,911
I'm walking on sunshine

129
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,279
Oh, yeah...

130
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:45,097
I waited and waited,
but he never came back.

131
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,302
Neither did my mother.

132
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:49,143
You're positive you 
heard that song?

133
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:51,130
I've never forgotten that day.

134
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:55,310
Thanks for your time, Susan.

135
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:59,710
The court sent me back to him...

136
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:03,203
after my mother disappeared.

137
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:04,829
What my father couldn't 
do to her anymore,

138
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:08,535
he took out on me.

139
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:11,206
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:14,046
Yeah, me, too.

141
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:15,334
Lil,

142
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:17,456
Stillman called.

143
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,576
Needs us at the woods.

144
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,275
Guy in the store could be Leroy.

145
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,352
Gotta be Leroy. Who else
would know about that song?

146
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:30,594
What it meant to Janet?

147
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:33,324
Hey, boss. What's the rush?

148
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:35,489
Canine unit uncovered this.

149
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:37,349
Routine sweep of the crime scene.

150
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:40,363
Single shot to the chest.
Large caliber weapon.

151
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,737
No holes in her clothes.

152
00:09:42,737 --> 00:09:44,463
- How many?
- Eight.

153
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:46,249
All headless?

154
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:48,086
Yes, sir.

155
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:57,501
Three of the nine bodies found at the 
wildlife preserve have been identified.

156
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,480
Body number one, Janet Lambert.

157
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,969
Now, we know she went missing
in November of '85.

158
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,467
Body number two, Tina James.

159
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:09,592
White female, 14 years old,
reported missing in November '99.

160
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:12,830
Number three, Latrice Hicks.
Black female, 50 years old,

161
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,607
disappeared in 2001, November.

162
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:17,859
Coroner's working
on identifying the others.

163
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:19,817
No way Leroy's responsible.

164
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:23,202
Spent 1988 to 2001
in and out of lockup.

165
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:24,896
Same dates our 
victims went missing.

166
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:26,025
All in November.

167
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,202
So, if it wasn't Leroy,
how did he know about the song?

168
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:32,579
What we do know is, he strips them,
probably rapes them, shoots them.

169
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,304
It doesn't explain how he picks them.

170
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,085
They've got nothing in common.

171
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:39,547
Different races, 
ages, professions.

172
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:41,723
Most serial killers have a type.

173
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,668
Uniforms I.D'd a possible witness
in the wildlife preserve.

174
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:47,291
- Let's talk to him ASAP.
- Families are coming in?

175
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,654
Yeah.

176
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:56,231
I keep logs of illegal hunting
here on the wilderness preserve.

177
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:58,266
Poachers, hunters, 
they come by at night,

178
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,523
trying to pinch some deer meat.

179
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:04,027
You heard gunshots early
morning, November 3, 1985?

180
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:05,856
Yeah, I was working.

181
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:09,073
Logged them. / Same night 
Janet Lambert went missing.

182
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:12,248
Yeah, I went out and told that guy
there ain't no hunting here.

183
00:11:12,248 --> 00:11:14,454
Not on my watch.

184
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,101
Hey!

185
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:27,551
Hey! I'm talking to you!

186
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:30,911
There's no hunting 
on this preserve.

187
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:34,602
What's in the bag?

188
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,275
There's no hunting here.

189
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,798
You've been warned.

190
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,370
Real freak show, that guy.

191
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,541
And you never reported this?

192
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,375
No, I thought he was a poacher.

193
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,675
Who cares about that but us?

194
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:02,788
You recorded shots at 5:00 A.M.?

195
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,026
Yeah, that's right.

196
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:08,585
But Janet went missing from the 
convenience store at around 9:00 P.M.

197
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:12,375
So what was he doing
with her all night?

198
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:20,642
It was the last time 
I saw my sister.

199
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,572
Latrice walked you to the bus stop.

200
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:25,183
And that was around 4:00 P.M.?

201
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:26,820
Yes.

202
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,771
You notice anyone suspicious
on the street, Thea?

203
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:53,014
She was always worried,
since the mugging.

204
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,925
What mugging?

205
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:57,557
A few months 
before she disappeared,

206
00:12:57,557 --> 00:13:00,524
my sister was mugged.

207
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:03,353
This happened in 2001?

208
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:05,471
We went to the police.

209
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:07,767
She identified him in a lineup.

210
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,837
Still in prison.

211
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:15,950
You last saw your daughter,
Tina, at around 4:00 P.M.?

212
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:19,074
She was training.

213
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:22,841
Headed out for an afternoon
cross-country run.

214
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:41,994
She never came back.

215
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:45,185
Was there a shortcut she'd take?

216
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:48,318
Not after that pervert jumped her.

217
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:49,648
Tina was raped?

218
00:13:49,648 --> 00:13:51,117
Attempted.

219
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:55,831
Two years before she...
disappeared.

220
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:58,843
I always taught her
to stand up for herself.

221
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,490
She sprayed that rapist in the face.

222
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,260
Pepper spray?

223
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,831
Riot-control tear gas. Knocks 
an elephant down in two seconds flat.

224
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:09,205
Used it in the marines.

225
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:12,252
What happened to the guy
who tried to rape her?

226
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,150
Tear gas blinded him for life.

227
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:21,114
Was Tina...

228
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:24,406
in pain when she...

229
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:28,522
Did my girl call out for me?

230
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,187
Janet, Tina, Latrice...

231
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:37,749
all victims of a violent crime
before they go missing.

232
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:41,069
Domestic assault, robbery, 
attempted rape.

233
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:43,789
Thing is, these doers
ain't our doer.

234
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:45,658
They were either 
in lock up or out of commission

235
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:47,506
at the time their victims went missing.

236
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:49,074
Could be how our guy's picking them.

237
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:52,496
Reads about the crimes in the paper
and hears about them on the radio.

238
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:54,382
Picks the survivors.

239
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:56,502
The coroners I.D.'d 
the other bodies.

240
00:14:56,502 --> 00:14:58,003
Check their histories
for prior crimes.

241
00:14:58,003 --> 00:14:59,588
Report control unit
will be open in the morning.

242
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:01,632
Thought we'd check tonight.

243
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:03,881
- Report still open?
- Yeah.

244
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:10,119
All nine of your girls got 49s.

245
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,985
All victims of prior crimes.

246
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:14,985
Carjacking, rape, assault with 
a deadly weapon. Runs the gamut.

247
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:16,671
Lucky they all survived.

248
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:19,401
Not so lucky if you think about it.

249
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:23,922
After Leroy gets through with Janet, 
he starts in on the kid,

250
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,872
and Janet clocks him in the face.

251
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:27,194
Right.

252
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,823
And Latrice Hicks, 
who got mugged...

253
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:32,831
broke the guy's nose
when he went for her handbag.

254
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,959
Like Tina James with the tear gas.

255
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,751
Yeah. They weren't
just victims of a crime.

256
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:41,341
They all fought back.

257
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:45,469
We'll need any records
on victims who did the same.

258
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:48,030
Uh, might take a few hours.
We're not computerized.

259
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,397
Well, we'll pick them up
in the morning.

260
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,151
You taking the train?

261
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:56,498
I'll walk you.

262
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:00,481
I gotta go somewhere first.

263
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:04,922
Be careful.

264
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:12,088
Classy joint.

265
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,723
Classy girl.

266
00:16:18,423 --> 00:16:20,397
You here to drink?

267
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,347
Or bitch?

268
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:25,472
Gimme a vodka orange.

269
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:27,132
Hold the vodka.

270
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:29,399
Never did take after mom.

271
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,255
Where you staying these days?

272
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:35,236
The Y.

273
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:39,813
There's a daybed downstairs.

274
00:16:39,813 --> 00:16:42,909
Cats might fight you for it, but...

275
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,368
What changed your mind?

276
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:48,359
You can't be wandering
around like some kinda...

277
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,917
- Some kinda what?
- You don't know what's out there.

278
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,420
And you do?

279
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,822
Wish I didn't.

280
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,921
Sometimes.

281
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,641
Just till I get something permanent.

282
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:23,562
Autopsies showed no evidence of rape or 
sexual trauma in even the most recent bodies.

283
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:25,833
Then what's he doing 
with them all night?

284
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:29,462
Well, breaks and fractures were 
apparent in most of the victims' feet.

285
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:33,614
Multiple lacerations on their soles, and 
on the fresher bodies, torn ligaments.

286
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:34,544
Meaning?

287
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:38,222
Types of injuries you get running barefoot 
over rough terrain for several hours.

288
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:40,178
He's chasing them
through the woods?

289
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:42,250
Looks like it, yeah.

290
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,085
Ballistics in on the bullet yet?

291
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:47,905
Arisaka model 38. Japanese.
Bolt-action rifle.

292
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:50,017
Imported after world war II.

293
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:52,310
Can't be many places
that sell that ammo.

294
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,620
Only one in the city is an army 
surplus store on the boulevard.

295
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,322
Let's go.

296
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:01,534
Guy orders the same
kinda ammo every year.

297
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:03,311
We got a name, Will.

298
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:05,413
Peter Brodsky.

299
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:06,522
Check his I.D.?

300
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:09,411
Hell, yeah. Last thing
I need is to lose my license.

301
00:18:09,411 --> 00:18:11,006
Ordered the same thing.

302
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,164
Year after year, except in 1999.

303
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:16,061
Same year Tina James goes missing.

304
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:21,862
In 1999 he also ordered
a military M-95 with CP filter?

305
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:24,017
- What's that?
- Gas mask.

306
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:26,548
- What?
- Special issue.

307
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:28,551
Used for riot control.

308
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:29,954
Filters out tear gas.

309
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:32,394
How'd he know Tina carried tear gas?

310
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,409
You ever see this guy, Peter Brodsky?

311
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:38,028
Couldn't tell you what he looked like
if you had ATF breaking down the door.

312
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:39,398
What do youa mean?

313
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:42,309
The guy was like not there.

314
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:44,449
You know what I mean?

315
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,767
Got your ammo and the gas mask.

316
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,694
Y2K, huh?

317
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,980
Receipt's in there, too.

318
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,037
Damn government taxes.

319
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:03,346
How much?

320
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:04,913
Take all you want, buddy.

321
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,677
On me.

322
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:25,866
Like I said... not there.

323
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,068
And you couldn't I.D. him?

324
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,789
Sorry.

325
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,708
He stopped to look at something.

326
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:36,835
That it?

327
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:39,618
Yeah, that's been up there 
since I opened the store.

328
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:40,870
What is it?

329
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,259
Orion.

330
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:44,338
The constellation.

331
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:48,049
Clears the horizon for the first time
ever year in November.

332
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:50,553
Same month he killed.

333
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:53,349
Orion comes from the greek myth.

334
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:55,976
Means "Great hunter."

335
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:59,313
That's why he makes them run.

336
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,865
He's hunting them.

337
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,404
He hunts them for hours in the woods,

338
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:10,331
shoots them before dawn,

339
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:12,702
- takes their heads.
- He's a hunter.

340
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:14,761
Targeting human prey.

341
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,415
And now we got a name.

342
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,163
Peter Brodsky.

343
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:19,784
What I don't get is 
how he picks them up.

344
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:21,580
Broad daylight, public places.

345
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,673
We know all these women are fighters.

346
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:25,787
But no one ever sees
or hears a thing.

347
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:28,343
So maybe they go with him willingly.
Because they know him.

348
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:29,200
Trust him.

349
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,304
You trust family, friends.

350
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:33,177
A cop.

351
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:34,765
Peter Brodsky.

352
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:37,297
Worked northeast
division. A uniform.

353
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:41,153
Left the job in '84,
drops off the face of the earth.

354
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,644
Guy's nowhere in the system now.

355
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:48,817
All right, let's check for reports 
of suspicious police behavior '84-2002

356
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:51,367
and Brodsky's IAB file.

357
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:55,709
Our victims were 
abducted during the day,

358
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:57,739
before sunset, right?

359
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,152
All but Janet Lambert.

360
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:02,708
- She was picked up at night.
- Well, maybe he tried getting her earlier.

361
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,721
Janet had her kid with her all day.

362
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:08,756
So maybe Susan 
saw something at sunset.

363
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,299
We were in the car. Driving.

364
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,269
Well, you remember seeing a cop?

365
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,507
Yes, I do.

366
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:19,190
We had left the police station
a few hours earlier,

367
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,201
after my mom filed the report.

368
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,823
She was late for work.

369
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,772
Then what happened?

370
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:28,778
We weren't even speeding, but
then this cop pulls us over.

371
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:34,446
What'd I do?

372
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,927
I know why you're mad at me.

373
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:38,984
I'm not mad.

374
00:21:38,984 --> 00:21:41,540
Because of what your 
daddy did today.

375
00:21:42,394 --> 00:21:45,060
He does that every day, mommy.

376
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,743
He won't.

377
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:49,717
Not no more.

378
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:51,426
I promise.

379
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:55,163
I'm not breaking any more
promises, not to you, Susan.

380
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:00,033
Officer?

381
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,012
I don't think I was speeding.

382
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:03,481
What's she doing here?

383
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:04,817
Excuse me?

384
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,819
No speeding. 
You got your warning.

385
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,000
You think a cop had something 
to do with my mother's murder?

386
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:24,688
We don't know yet.

387
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,952
You think you could I.D. him, Susan?

388
00:22:26,952 --> 00:22:29,099
I barely saw him.

389
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:31,470
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:34,506 --> 00:22:36,971
It wasn't your fault,

391
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:40,305
what happened to your mom.

392
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:42,984
If I could have that moment back?

393
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:44,974
I would have told her.

394
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:47,574
What?

395
00:22:49,692 --> 00:22:52,102
That I loved her, too.

396
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:54,937
Lil...

397
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,571
Got something.

398
00:22:57,745 --> 00:22:59,279
I'm sorry.

399
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:03,240
Boys found a live one.

400
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,867
Woman who reported
a cop abduction in '97.

401
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:07,498
A survivor?

402
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:14,261
He brought me here.

403
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:17,489
Yeah.

404
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,395
Help me!

405
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,133
I was working at the bar that night, 
you know, doing a little...

406
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:28,197
in the parking lot...

407
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:29,640
When this cop rolled up,

408
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,146
said he was bringing me in
for disorderly conduct.

409
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,326
Did you get a look at him?

410
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:37,989
I was wasted.

411
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:41,200
Could've been mickey mouse
and I wouldn't have known.

412
00:23:41,418 --> 00:23:43,706
Got his name, though.

413
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:46,539
Brodsky something.

414
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:49,940
Lot of good it did.

415
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,888
Cops looked at me like
I was making it up.

416
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:54,979
They filed a report.

417
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:58,343
They didn't do nothing 
with it, did they?

418
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:02,547
This cop, Brodsky, gets you 
in the car. Then what?

419
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:06,101
He starts driving and driving...

420
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:08,391
then he stops.

421
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,996
Get out.

422
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:26,110
I didn't see your face, officer.

423
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,194
I can't I.D you.

424
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:30,835
We can do it in the back seat.

425
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:34,136
Any way you want. 
I'm real good, I'll be real good.

426
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:37,007
Just don't hurt me, please.

427
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:40,077
Don't act dumb like an animal.

428
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:43,489
Don't. Please.

429
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:47,172
Don't and please.
They always say those words.

430
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:50,122
Ready to run, Atalanta?

431
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:54,722
What did you call me?

432
00:24:56,993 --> 00:24:59,939
Help! Help!

433
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:04,104
Help! Help! Help!

434
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:11,967
What's Atalanta?

435
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:15,130
Princess Atalanta.

436
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,996
A story I heard as a kid.

437
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:20,841
See, a few years ago
when I almost got raped,

438
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:22,956
I couldn't do nothing.

439
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:25,020
I just lay there...

440
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,167
waiting to die.

441
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:31,265
Then I remembered Atalanta,

442
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:34,280
the princess who was
the fastest in the land.

443
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,594
Gave me the strength to run away,

444
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:38,825
remembering that.

445
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:42,201
Did you tell anybody 
else about that?

446
00:25:42,762 --> 00:25:44,243
No one.

447
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:48,619
Just me and god.

448
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:51,379
How could he know?

449
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:57,813
Found Peter Brodsky 
in Butte, Montana.

450
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:01,002
Hasn't been in Philly for 20 years.

451
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:02,592
We sure?

452
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:04,597
Him and his wife
left town for good in '84.

453
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,098
He was shot on the job.

454
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,834
Been in a wheelchair since.

455
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:10,260
So someone knew Brodsky 
was out of commission.

456
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,470
And stole his identity.

457
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,703
Well, he knew these women were 
victimized before, that they all fought back.

458
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:18,580
And how they defended themselves.

459
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,860
Tina James with tear gas.

460
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,033
Other people could've known.
Her old man knew.

461
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:25,665
But he knew the song, Scotty,
and what it meant to Janet.

462
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:27,973
She told the cops about the song.

463
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:31,114
But Atalanta? 
How'd he know about that?

464
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:35,409
Well, he knows about the song
and the tear gas and...

465
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:40,770
the childhood story
because it's in the report.

466
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,620
He's reading these reports.

467
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,539
Well, let's say he ain't a cop,

468
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:45,938
but he's got access.

469
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:50,101
Well, who else would have access 
to the reports, to a cop's identity?

470
00:26:59,571 --> 00:27:03,002
I appreciate you 
coming up here, George.

471
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,940
We're hoping you can help us.

472
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,967
See, we're looking for
fresh eyes on this thing.

473
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:14,053
Sure. Fire away.

474
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:16,446
Who could've read all these reports?

475
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:20,174
I mean, you see the back and forth.
Who has access to all that?

476
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:22,138
Well, uh,

477
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:23,994
I'm the gatekeeper,
everyone goes through me.

478
00:27:23,994 --> 00:27:26,188
So you're the only one
who has access to the 49s?

479
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:28,233
And I run a tight ship.

480
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:32,769
What stumps me 
is the women he picks.

481
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:34,307
Fighters.

482
00:27:34,307 --> 00:27:37,125
Most of us, we already 
got the ball and chain.

483
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:42,573
Well, might be different
if you were looking to kill her.

484
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:43,736
That so?

485
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:44,832
He hates women.

486
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:47,779
Because of his mother 
who was domineering,

487
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,292
controlling. Serial killer 101.

488
00:27:50,923 --> 00:27:53,164
You read a lot, huh, George?

489
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:55,097
It's what I do.

490
00:27:55,097 --> 00:27:58,500
Spend a lot of time with those records,
reading about our dead women.

491
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:01,926
Yeah, it's better than fiction, right?

492
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:02,940
How so?

493
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,867
No one reads them,

494
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:07,294
no one cares about them.

495
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:09,883
But me.

496
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:12,678
Oh, by the way?

497
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,837
You're not gonna find
anything in my house.

498
00:28:30,955 --> 00:28:33,912
Not a hair out of place.
No dirty dishes,

499
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,913
no stained laundry, nothing.

500
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:38,707
He had to wash the blood 
off somewhere.

501
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:40,590
CSU's pulling the drains now.

502
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,120
They're dusting his clothes for prints.

503
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,416
If our victims fought back,
maybe we get lucky.

504
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:48,060
I'm not even getting dust here.

505
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:49,416
You hunt, Nick?

506
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,006
Yeah, Course.

507
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:52,716
Look at this.

508
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:16,242
Found your boots, George.

509
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:19,496
Lot of blood, taking off a head.

510
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,558
Tough to wash out.

511
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,171
But not impossible.

512
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:28,318
We're just talking here, right?

513
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:29,580
Right.

514
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,445
Just talking.

515
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,822
And I'm free to walk out

516
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:36,054
anytime I want.

517
00:29:36,178 --> 00:29:39,438
Most people think 
they have to stay, talk.

518
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:41,717
Dumb civilians.

519
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:43,922
Not you, though.

520
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:50,398
What are your thoughts 
on this guy, George?

521
00:29:50,564 --> 00:29:54,404
Why did he take their clothes off?
He's not raping them.

522
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,690
What's the point?

523
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:00,320
Good question. Uh...

524
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:02,589
Control?

525
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:05,031
Humiliation?

526
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:09,991
The way their tits pucker in the cold?

527
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:14,485
It's tough, getting a woman's 
clothes off when she's not willing.

528
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:18,734
Must've been scratching,
kicking, fighting.

529
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,009
They fight you a lot, George?

530
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:36,316
Statistically speaking,

531
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:41,192
victims rarely fight back when a firearm 
is used in the commission of a crime.

532
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:44,081
And you mean "him."

533
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:47,233
Well, like we said, just theorizing.

534
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:48,984
Hypothesizing.

535
00:30:48,984 --> 00:30:50,744
We appreciate your insight, George.

536
00:30:50,744 --> 00:30:52,049
Any time.

537
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:57,177
So, why do you think 
he picks survivors?

538
00:30:57,177 --> 00:30:59,580
Wants a challenge.

539
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:02,184
That's obvious.

540
00:31:02,184 --> 00:31:05,797
Once he finally tracks them down,
I bet they're not so uppity anymore, huh?

541
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,487
And then he teaches them a lesson.

542
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:12,382
Oh, I imagine there are
many lessons taught...

543
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:15,152
in the woods.

544
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:17,781
Know what I think?

545
00:31:17,781 --> 00:31:19,784
This guy?

546
00:31:20,615 --> 00:31:23,596
Never got laid once in his life.

547
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:27,233
Because, you know,
it sounds to me like...

548
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:31,242
he's got a real problem
with the ladies. You know?

549
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:35,090
You're the one with
the lady problem...

550
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,676
from what I hear.

551
00:31:38,803 --> 00:31:41,724
Nothing that a little
thorazine can't fix.

552
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,381
- Don't you talk about her.
- Scotty...

553
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:49,053
You know what I mean, lieutenant.
Got a few lady problems of your own.

554
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:50,889
Is that right?

555
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:52,805
Ex-wife who hasn't
spoken to you in ten years,

556
00:31:52,805 --> 00:31:57,112
daughter who only pretends
to love her daddy.

557
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:01,710
Those second-rate medals
hanging in your second-rate office.

558
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,297
Were they really worth it?

559
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:06,881
Like I said,

560
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:10,055
I can stop talking.

561
00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:12,861
And I'm done talking to you.

562
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,958
Saw your place, George.

563
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:19,582
You're a hell of a neat freak.

564
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:24,237
How's such a tidy guy do the messy 
business of taking off heads there?

565
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:26,387
I didn't take off anyone's head.

566
00:32:26,387 --> 00:32:29,507
I meant animal heads, George.

567
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:32,388
You hunt, don't you?

568
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:36,068
Chasing dumb animals in the woods...

569
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:37,741
no challenge.

570
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:40,486
You like a challenge, George?

571
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:43,190
I bore easily.

572
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:47,455
So if our killer wants a challenge,

573
00:32:47,455 --> 00:32:50,170
why hunt women, why not men?

574
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,144
An NBA player, olympic athlete,
guy at the gym.

575
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:58,253
Why does he always go for the doe,
the weaker sex? Why is that?

576
00:32:58,253 --> 00:33:01,137
Maybe those females
had more to live for.

577
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:02,858
Like the ones with children put
up a real squall,

578
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:06,620
I bet, if he promised to bring their 
little ones into the woods, too.

579
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:09,480
Some hunter.

580
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,022
Taking down children, women.

581
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:15,776
Plus he let one get away.

582
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:18,328
What, you mean the drunk?

583
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:21,855
Or is she a full-blown addict by now?

584
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:24,119
How'd you know 
who we're talking about?

585
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,573
I read her report.

586
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,496
No D.A. would ever 
put her on the stand.

587
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:29,411
Sloppy police work.

588
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:31,506
Kite'll be disappointed...

589
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:33,502
again.

590
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:36,461
Another bungled lead.

591
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:38,540
Kind of like the chimayo case.

592
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,138
What's that?

593
00:33:40,138 --> 00:33:44,461
Oh, I read those files, too, Nick.
You screwed the pooch big time.

594
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:48,984
Or rather, someone screwed a lot of
juicy pooches because of you.

595
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:50,276
That's it. Come on, get up.

596
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:51,522
- Hey, hey, Nick, Nick!
- Get up! Come on!

597
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:53,153
- Get him up!
- Come on, come on.

598
00:33:53,153 --> 00:33:56,299
Fine line between being 
human and an animal.

599
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:58,697
Look at you.

600
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:03,197
So, tell me about
those dumb animals, George.

601
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:07,286
I once read a pursued animal will 
run on broken toes, fractured shins,

602
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:10,415
bloody stumps of feet.

603
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:14,040
There are worse things
than rape, Nick.

604
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,782
Things that go on for hours.

605
00:34:23,884 --> 00:34:26,476
I want my daddy.

606
00:34:27,556 --> 00:34:30,517
Daddy...

607
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:34,970
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

608
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:37,977
She was just a little girl.

609
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:40,862
Oh, I imagine at the end she wasn't.

610
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:46,571
The things a female will beg to do,
if only you'll let her live.

611
00:34:48,245 --> 00:34:54,256
Ever wonder what Mrs. Jeffries begged for
on that lonely highway before she died?

612
00:34:54,486 --> 00:34:56,299
Not gonna work, George.

613
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:58,170
Sorry.

614
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,578
Because I know.

615
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:06,926
Don't forget your deer eye.

616
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,756
Deer eye, George?

617
00:35:09,756 --> 00:35:12,967
You, uh, a taxidermist?

618
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:18,599
Done talking to you.

619
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,432
Because if you never hunted,

620
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:25,110
why you have these at your place?

621
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,331
Done talking.

622
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:33,249
I want the blonde.

623
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:38,415
All we need is one admission,
just one slip-up.

624
00:35:38,415 --> 00:35:40,547
Get him to say he was there.

625
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:43,045
Results are back from the lab.

626
00:35:43,045 --> 00:35:45,246
On his boots...

627
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:47,004
no blood residue.

628
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:49,055
Nothing.

629
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:51,108
Ditto on the house.
Drains are clean.

630
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,970
No hair, no trace evidence.

631
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,041
Couldn't even lift George's prints.

632
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,967
This guy wipes down his own house?

633
00:36:01,031 --> 00:36:02,875
I'm going out for coffee.

634
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,945
You okay?

635
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:17,128
Put him in those woods, Lil.

636
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,048
Like being in this room, George?

637
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:25,317
Playing games...

638
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,250
excite you?

639
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,632
I've watched you here.

640
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:32,771
Upon occasion.

641
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:36,030
Really?

642
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:38,647
Really.

643
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:45,317
So, you snuck into observation?

644
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:47,492
Groped your ding-a-ling in the dark?

645
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:50,363
I wouldn't flatter myself
if I were you.

646
00:36:50,363 --> 00:36:52,952
That thing only work in the woods?

647
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:54,453
Or maybe not even there?

648
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:56,779
Yet another tired-assed Lilly trick.

649
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:58,622
Seen it before...

650
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:00,670
Seen it before. Yawn.

651
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,250
We're just warming up.

652
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:04,642
Show and tell.

653
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:05,785
That's right.

654
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:09,261
Then let me tell you something
about Lilly Rush.

655
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:13,976
Why you really became a cop.

656
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:19,580
What you've never told a soul.
The bad thing that happened to little Lilly...

657
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,199
long, long ago.

658
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:27,055
I read your 49.

659
00:37:30,102 --> 00:37:32,144
Did you?

660
00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:35,733
You ever dream about it, Lilly?

661
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:38,159
No. No, I don't.

662
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,704
Keep telling yourself that.

663
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:46,461
Know your enemy.

664
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:49,703
You've done your homework.

665
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,439
So have I.

666
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,939
Age 18...

667
00:38:02,174 --> 00:38:04,778
failed the police academy entry exam.

668
00:38:04,778 --> 00:38:08,577
Age 20, you fail the
physical for a, uh...

669
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,853
Shopping mall security guard?

670
00:38:12,153 --> 00:38:14,828
Couldn't even make it as a rentacop.

671
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:19,237
So, here you are, 45...

672
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:21,942
filing away pieces of paper.

673
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:25,172
No wonder you like to play dress up.

674
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:28,044
You know, you wanna walk, 
be my guest.

675
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,376
I'm done with you.

676
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:35,250
Oh, uh, one more thing.

677
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:39,002
Age 12...

678
00:38:39,646 --> 00:38:42,065
your mother is murdered.

679
00:38:45,578 --> 00:38:48,280
What could she have done to you?

680
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:54,239
Ever dream about it, George?

681
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:03,711
No wonder you're such 
a small, little man.

682
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:06,911
Don't you walk away from me!
Don't you walk away from me!

683
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:13,348
Not there he's not.

684
00:39:13,348 --> 00:39:15,259
Where?

685
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:17,585
In the woods?

686
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:18,879
Tell me...

687
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:21,953
who you are in the woods.

688
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:23,064
He's...

689
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:26,111
You. Who you are.

690
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,395
Tell me.

691
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:30,693
God.

692
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:41,010
No. No.

693
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,991
Please, don't, please!

694
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:46,273
I have a daughter,

695
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:49,211
and I can't break any more
promises to her,

696
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:52,239
because she doesn't have nobody.

697
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,892
Nobody in this world but me...

698
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:08,775
I love you, little girl.

699
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:16,366
I'm done with you.

700
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:19,089
Tell me how you killed her.

701
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:21,607
I gave you my thoughts.

702
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:23,813
My conjecture. 
We were just talking, right?

703
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:25,274
What did you do with her head?

704
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:26,663
You mean, what did he do?

705
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:28,625
Where did you put them, George?

706
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,795
Ask him. I have no idea.

707
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,806
- It's over.
- No, it's not over, so sit down!

708
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,688
Oh, no.

709
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:38,735
It is over.

710
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:47,091
He's just gonna walk?

711
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:48,701
No confession.

712
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:51,106
She was close.

713
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:56,152
I'll be watching you.

714
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:02,456
Think I might leave town.

715
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:04,535
Do some traveling.

716
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:08,455
Beautiful country we live in, 
lots of empty woods...

717
00:41:09,716 --> 00:41:12,588
You ever hunt?

718
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,296
No.

719
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:18,174
We should do it sometime.

720
00:41:18,174 --> 00:41:20,676
Together.

721
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:23,085
Maybe we will.

'Long Long Way To Go' By Phil Collins

723
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:06,054
¢Ü While I sit here trying to ¢Ü

724
00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:09,942
¢Ü think of things to say ¢Ü

725
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:15,345
¢Ü Someone lies bleeding 
in a field somewhere ¢Ü

726
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:25,065
¢Ü So it would seem we've still 
got a long long way to go ¢Ü

727
00:42:26,221 --> 00:42:31,330
¢Ü I've seen all I wanna see today ¢Ü

728
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:54,900
¢Ü While I sit here trying to 
move you anyway I can ¢Ü

729
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:03,320
¢Ü Someone's son lies dead 
in a gutter somewhere ¢Ü

730
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:11,402
¢Ü And it would seem that 
we've got a long long way to go ¢Ü

731
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:18,952
¢Ü But I can't take it anymore ¢Ü

732
00:43:23,189 --> 00:43:27,045
¢Ü Turn it off if you want to ¢Ü

733
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:31,301
¢Ü Switch it off it will go away ¢Ü

734
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:35,204
¢Ü Turn it off if you want to ¢Ü

735
00:43:35,204 --> 00:43:40,899
¢Ü Switch it off or look away ¢Ü

736
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:51,994
¢Ü While I sit and we talk and talk ¢Ü

737
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:56,235
¢Ü and we talk some more ¢Ü

738
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:58,949
¢Ü Someone's loved one's heart ¢Ü

739
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:04,455
¢Ü stops beating in a street somewhere ¢Ü

740
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:12,586
¢Ü So it would seem we've still 
got a long long way to go, I know ¢Ü

741
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:17,080
¢Ü I've heard all I wanna hear today ¢Ü

00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:21,492
