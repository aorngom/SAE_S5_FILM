00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,130
the following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,680
March 22,1964.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,550
I forgot to pack my flannel pj's 
and my rabbit-hair slippers.

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,750
Maybe I can bring them to her,Bill?

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,940
We talked about this.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,850
No visits.

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,690
I gotta use the kybo.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,320
- What did she say?
- She needs the bathroom.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,750
You'll have to hold it.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,950
And speak English,Hilary.

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,280
If I could take it back,I would.

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,800
It's just... no one told us it could happen,you know?

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,910
Let's not talk about it,honey.Please?

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,680
I'm sorry,Mom.

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,680
Here we are.

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,250
Looks even prettier than the brochure.

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,820
I'm sure everyone will be very nice.

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,870
Please don't leave me here.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,640
I'll make sure no one sees me at home,Daddy,I swear.

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,610
Patricia.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,610
Come on,Hilary.

22
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,280
Huck said he'd marry me.

23
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,160
Huck's a child. So are you.

24
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,980
But it's our baby. (sighs)

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,510
Do you have any idea what it's like to raise a child?

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,710
Now,please,Hilary,I know what's best.

27
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,140
Will you visit me,Mom?

28
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,290
We'll see,sweetheart.

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,060
Get in the car,Patricia.

30
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,850
You're not coming in?!

31
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,040
She's never spent a night away from home,Bill.

32
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,970
And if you'd watched her better,

33
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,740
she wouldn't be in this mess in the first place.

34
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,550
Please don't leave me here.

35
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,510
Mommy?

36
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,810
My mom passed away two months ago.

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,290
She was a great mother,but...I found this in her belongings.

38
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,010
Your birth certificate?

39
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,490
My original birth certificate.

40
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,020
I never knew,but I was adopted.

41
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,210
You know we deal in homicides,right,Ms. Lakey?

42
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,410
I tracked down my real mother.

43
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,320
She was murdered the day after I was born.

44
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,850
Her name was Hilary West.

45
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,760
She was 17 years old.

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,850
Never found the doer.

47
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,240
I was hoping if you did,
you might be able to tell me...

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,530
Why she gave you up?

49
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,970
- Yes.
- Your mom was 17.

50
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,930
Probably couldn't raise you the way she wanted.

51
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,600
I have a nine-year-old son.

52
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,590
I can't even fathom doing something like that.

53
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,150
Yeah.Times were different.

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,340
Are you... close with your mother?

55
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,100
People shouldn't have kids till they're ready.

56
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,630
Sounds like your mother wasn't.

57
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,400
Still,I'd like to know.

58
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,920
Well,this is from St. Mary's Home for Unwed Mothers.

59
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,360
Where she gave birth.

60
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,040
There's no mention of St. Mary's in the article.

61
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,150
Maybe they were keeping it out of the press?

62
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,550
Maybe they didn't know.

63
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,030
How's that possible?She was there right before she died.

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,890
Could be someone was keeping it secret.

65
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,710
Who?

66
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,300
Someone with a secret of their own.

70
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,210
Hilary West. Blunt force trauma to the head.

71
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,650
Weapon never found.

72
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,890
Autopsy didn't pick up the recent pregnancy?

73
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,520
Back then,only did a cursory check for sexual assault.

74
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,290
Field where she was killed was a mile from St. Mary's.

75
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,440
No wonder the cops back then didn't put her there.

76
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,540
St. Mary's closed in '74.

77
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,450
Checking on who might still be around.

78
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,220
Parents said they'd been keeping Hilary home

79
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,330
from school to recover from mono.

80
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,330
Claimed she snuck out in the middle of the night.

81
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,200
No idea where she was going.

82
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,690
Pretty elaborate lie to cover up a pregnancy.

83
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,640
Well,daughter getting pregnant out of wedlock--

84
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,600
real stigma for a family back then.

85
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,510
Worse than murder?

86
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,570
A few girls in my high school "went away."

87
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,200
We all knew the reason why.

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,150
Abortion's illegal,and no single mothers back then.

89
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,690
No sex ed either.

90
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,120
Couldn't buy birth control 
unless you were married.

91
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,460
Abstinence was the answer.

92
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,850
That always works.

93
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,890
Everyone was doing it; 
no one was talking about it.

94
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,340
Lucky for me,I had an older brother.

95
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,200
Yeah.Who turned out to be a priest.

96
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,400
Could be the boyfriend.

97
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,360
Barbara's father?

98
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,390
If he even knew about the pregnancy.

99
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,330
Well,let's start with him.

100
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,560
Yeah?

101
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,100
Hey.Mr. Oberland around,buddy?

102
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,910
Grandpa!

103
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,930
Detectives Valens,Vera.

104
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,750
Got a few questions about a Hilary West.

105
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,520
Haven't heard that name in a long time.

106
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,960
She was pregnant,gave birth right before she was killed.

107
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,580
My family is in there.

108
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,690
This is sensitive.

109
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,500
Murder tends to be.

110
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,990
So,you knew about the pregnancy?

111
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,990
We were just kids.

112
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,050
Still in high school.

113
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,780
So you were the father.

114
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,880
Hilary told me that she was... that way.

115
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,550
And you didn't think that her being "that way"

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,130
could've been helpful to the investigation?

117
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,670
Look,I was 17.

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,140
I didn't know what to do.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,750
You knew about St. Mary's Home for Unwed Mothers?

120
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,090
I knew her parents were planning to send her away,

121
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,140
but I didn't know where.

122
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,580
Then Hilary disappears,

123
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,490
and two months later,I hear she's dead.

124
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,350
And you had no contact with her after she left?

125
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,120
Her folks made sure of that.

126
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,890
So why keep your mouth shut?

127
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,280
Because we were good kids...

128
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,530
and good kids didn't get caught.

129
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,770
My school uniform doesn't fit anymore.

130
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,850
I can't keep anything down.

131
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,950
Maybe you're just eating too much.

132
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,380
Huck...I'm scared.

133
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,480
My parents are going to kill me.

134
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,010
But it was just that one time.

135
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,540
You told me it wouldn't happen the first time.

136
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,310
It's not supposed to.

137
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Right?

138
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,560
What are we going to do?

139
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,930
Maybe there's a way to... get rid of it?

140
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,360
No.

141
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,750
Girls die.

142
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,880
Then we'll just...get married.

143
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,650
We've only been going steady two months.

144
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,850
We get along all right.

145
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,760
What about Yale?

146
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,220
Forget Yale.

147
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,940
I'll never get in.

148
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,030
Married...?Are you sure?

149
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,130
It's what everybody does,right?

150
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,240
Get married?

151
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,290
But do you love me?

152
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,540
Yeah,sure I do,Hil.

153
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,810
I tried to do the right thing.

154
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,340
Those wedding bells never rang.

155
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,440
Not after Hilary's father found out.

156
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,020
Ain't so copacetic about the whole thing?

157
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,170
Let's just say that was the end of our pipe dream.

158
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,270
You know,back then,adults gave the orders.

159
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,570
Kids listened.

160
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,960
Thanks for your time.

161
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,110
I don't even know if it was a girl or boy.

162
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,280
Her name's Barbara.

163
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,430
We know sent Hi to the ***.

164
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,430
I thought I was doing what was best.

165
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,800
By not helping solve your daughter's murder?

166
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,240
It was Bill's idea to keep quiet about St. Mary's.

167
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,580
And you just went along with it?

168
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,060
He was my husband. I didn't have a choice.

169
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Till the day he died,we never discussed it again.

170
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,120
Instead you pretend that it never happened.

171
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,510
I convinced myself I was protecting Hilary's memory.

172
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,400
Better than people thinking her cheap.

173
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,220
So giving the baby away was the only real option?

174
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,280
Nothing more important than what the neighbors think,right?

175
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Talk about St. Mary's.

176
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,670
I visited once when Bill was away on business.

177
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,870
Brought the rabbit-hair slippers she loved so much.

178
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,260
What happened?

179
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,650
Well,I thought we sent her to the right place,

180
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,990
but I was wrong.

181
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,240
I heard we only get 15 minutes to say good-bye to our babies.

182
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,670
I'll only need one.

183
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,410
Alien's the only reason I'm in this prison.

184
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,880
I think she has the hiccups.

185
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,500
She?

186
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,460
You're crazier than I thought.

187
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,420
It's kind of nice,

188
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,580
a little person growing inside,you know?

189
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,690
Yeah,sucking your blood,scarfing your food.

190
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,890
The sooner it comes out,the better.

191
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,280
Dr. Frankenstein strikes again.

192
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,710
Dr. Frankenstein?

193
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,670
Guy's a hack.Bottom of the barrel.

194
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,400
Heard he killed a girl during labor.

195
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,730
- Next patient: Hilary W.
- No.

196
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,300
Dr. Finnegan doesn't have time to waste.

197
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,790
I don't want him to touch me.

198
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,840
You're lucky to have him,a girl like you.

199
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,660
You're a nut job if you think any of us

200
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,670
are going to put our legs in those torture devices.

201
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,440
If you'd kept your legs together in the first place

202
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,730
you wouldn't be here.

203
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,170
Bad things happen to bad girls,Hilary.

204
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,790
If you don't behave,I promise,it's only going to get worse.

205
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,250
A day doesn't go by I don't beg for forgiveness.

206
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,970
Leaving my little girl in that place.

207
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,100
Give us a call,

208
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,490
anything else comes to mind.

209
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,150
How is the baby?

210
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,630
She's a grown woman now.

211
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,360
Will you tell her... that she has a grandmother?

212
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,040
Sounds like this Dr. Finnegan was a real butcher.

213
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,280
Girls dying on the table.

214
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,730
Maybe Hilary was one of them.

215
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,030
St'Mary***covered up.

216
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,330
You find this Dr. Finnegan?

217
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,430
Loser bit the dust in '75.

218
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,770
Cirrhosis of the liver.

219
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,650
Serious drinker?

220
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,880
Six women bled to death on his delivery table between '61 and '68.

221
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,270
Scumbag finally lost his medical license.

222
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,040
Took six deaths for the medical board to yank his license?

223
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,570
"Doctor knows best."

224
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,390
Glad I was an unwed mother in the '90s,not the '60s.

225
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,160
What about this nun who ran St. Mary's?

226
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,790
Sister Margaret's still alive and kicking

227
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,940
in a convent retirement community.

228
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,950
A community of retired nuns?

229
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,530
Sounds like a par-tay.

230
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,010
If girls were dying at St. Mary's,

231
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,160
it'd be on her head.

232
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,360
Giving her motive to keep it hush-hush.

233
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,800
Keep thinking one of them is going to jump out

234
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,090
and thwack my hand with a ruler.

235
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,270
Back at St. Francis,we got the yard stick.

236
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,800
Sister Margaret?

237
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes?

238
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,930
Detectives Valens,Vera.Philly Homicide.

239
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,280
It's about St. Mary's.

240
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,750
That was a long time ago.

241
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,810
And Hilary West's murder.

242
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,240
Like I said... a long time ago.

243
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,780
Wondering why you never came forward when she was killed?

244
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,310
Well,the detectives never came to us.

245
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,190
And I never lied to anybody.

246
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,530
VALENS: By omission.

247
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,820
You knew the truth.

248
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,490
I couldn't jeopardize our reputation.

249
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,640
We were the last place those girls could go.

250
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,310
Maybe you remember the quack you hired to work there--

251
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,560
Dr. Finnegan?

252
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,330
Well,we didn't have a lot of resources.

253
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,870
His,um... price tag fit our budget.

254
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,500
You get what you pay for,right?

255
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,650
So maybe he kills Hilary and you dump her in a field?

256
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,100
That's a ridiculous accusation.

257
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,590
That hack lost his medical license.

258
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,830
Women were dying while he was three sheets to the wind.

259
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,840
Well,I'm sorry to hear that,

260
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:48,590
but you must understand that society had rejected those girls.

261
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,550
You saying beggars can't be choosers?

262
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,750
I'm saying a houseful of pregnant teenagers--

263
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,370
there was a reason that they called them "bad girls."

264
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,000
Wedding bands go on the left ring finger,girls.

265
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,580
No need for anyone in town to know your predicament.

266
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,920
Thank you,Sister Margaret.

267
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,500
Thank you,Sister

268
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,720
I'll just put these away.

269
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,290
Always gotta be a kiss-up in the bunch.

270
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,010
Soon I'm going to have a real one.

271
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,400
That why you're being a good girl?

272
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,480
So Huck will marry you?

273
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,350
He needs a little more time to tell his parents.

274
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,170
But once he sees the baby...

275
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,180
You live on a street called "Denial."

276
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,860
You haven't heard a peep outta that cat since you've been here.

277
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,580
He's busy with final exams.

278
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,180
Forget about him.

279
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,190
And forget about your little sunshine,too.

280
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,250
He's going to marry me,Karen.

281
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,440
He promised.

282
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,730
You fat cows get knocked up at the submarine races?!

283
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,450
Moo...!

284
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,500
You sweathogs are so easy,

285
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,800
any ol' dude could score with you!

286
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,250
Think you're tough?Nothin' but a buncha pantywaists!

287
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,670
Hilary,think fast.

288
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,860
Aim for the runt with the duck butt!

289
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,250
Throw it,spaz-o!

290
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,790
Oh,you're worse than I thought. Oh!

291
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,990
Candyass! You better run!

292
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,720
Who's responsible for this?

293
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,060
Those hoods called us sluts! They deserved it!

294
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,450
I said who's responsible?

295
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,950
At least one of you has learned her lesson.

296
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,010
Ow! Get off of me,you ugly bitch!

297
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,200
You're going to the isolation room. No!

298
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,740
Sister Abigail!

299
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,220
You're going to pay,good girl.

300
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,940
Karen Watson was a hellion.

301
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,330
Uncontrollable.

302
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,860
She and Hilary butt heads again?

303
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,970
All I know is that before Karen came to us,

304
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,690
she was expelled from her high school.

305
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,170
Expelled for what?

306
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,590
For hitting another girl in the head... with a rock.

307
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,180
Heard u got a real temper,Karen.

308
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,480
Take it you're not going to order the blue plate special?

309
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,940
Detectives Jeffries,Rush.Homicide.

310
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,710
Hey,blame the cook.

311
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,070
I'm just the messenger.

312
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,480
Hilary West,St. Mary's home.

313
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,440
That jog any memories?

314
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,980
Maybe you knocked her out,too?

315
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,290
Like you did your high school classmate.

316
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,300
Yeah,and that harlot had it coming.

317
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,330
What about Hilary? She have it coming,too?

318
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,640
Hilary was harmless.

319
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,500
Goofball actually grew on me.

320
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,030
Where were you the night she was killed?

321
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,450
Sleeping off a 46-hour delivery.

322
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,280
You try pushing out an eight-pound bowling ball without pain killers.

323
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,670
Didn't drag my ass out of bed for a week.

324
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,340
So why didn't you tell the cops she'd been staying at St Mary's?

325
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,400
Same reason I never tried to find my kid--

326
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,700
some secrets are easier to keep.

327
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,130
Easy to find out,too.

328
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,050
Look,lady,

329
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,390
all we girls had was each other in that hellhole.

330
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,110
So who had it out for Hilary?

331
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,830
Who do you think?

332
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,940
Guy who got her in trouble in the first place.

333
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,140
Check it out!

334
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,770
Look what I just bought!

335
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,020
You can record yourself.

336
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,660
What is it,Hilary?

337
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,720
Your water break?

338
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,060
Huck...?

339
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,950
Hilary?

340
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,960
I didn't know... you'd be here.

341
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,360
I'll meet you back at the car,Mary Lou.

342
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,180
Mary Lou.

343
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,050
She's pretty.

344
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,990
You've been gone a long time...

345
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,950
Did you tell your parents about the baby yet?

346
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,430
I got into Yale.

347
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,680
I can't get married.

348
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,640
But you said you were going to do the right thing.

349
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,210
- You promised.
- We're 17,Hilary.

350
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,360
We're kids.

351
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,370
Yeah,and I'm going to have one.

352
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,660
- You have to tell them.
- I can't.

353
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,940
If they knew about this,they'd kill me.

354
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,800
Feel.Can you believe that?

355
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,720
She's kicking... Hilary,stop.

356
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,160
What am I going to do?

357
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,170
Give the baby up.

358
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,310
But she's our sunshine.

359
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,510
I don't want to be a father.

360
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,140
You already are.

361
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,020
If you won't tell your parents...I will.

362
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,040
What?

363
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,140
You better not.

364
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,120
Hilary!

365
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,760
A week later,Hilary was dead.

366
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,200
Thanks for your time.

367
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,940
Maybe Huck killed Hilary before she had a chance to tell.

368
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,140
Shut up for good.

369
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,500
Parents will not be too happy about you knocked up that girl.

370
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,410
Give up be in Yale for a 17-year-old bride.

371
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,280
You got it all wrong.

372
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,160
They would've killed you.

373
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,640
Your words.

374
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,500
So you stopped her before she told.

375
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,370
I didn't kill Hilary.

376
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,520
That's original.

377
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,860
We made a baby together.

378
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,300
A child.

379
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,590
Even back then I knew that meant something.

380
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,600
Yeah?So why'd you lie about seeing her again?

381
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,090
Where were you the night she was killed?

382
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,330
With Mary Lou MacLaren.

383
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,910
The cheerleader you started boffing the minute Hilary was shipped off?

384
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,070
We were at a movie.

385
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,700
Frankie Avalon,Annette Funicello.

386
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,830
Bikini Beach.

387
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,890
You're a real door prize,Huck.

388
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,140
Look,I know I abandoned Hilary.

389
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,030
If I'd been a better guy,maybe she'd still be alive.

390
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,890
What about her threat to tell your parents?

391
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,470
She never did.

392
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,540
Saying she just forgot?

393
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,490
Saying I told her mother.

394
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,070
Mrs. West?

395
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,230
What exactly did you tell her?

396
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,650
That Hilary was planning to keep the baby.

397
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,660
She hit the roof.

398
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,140
That right?

399
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah.

400
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,730
Said she'd go to St. Mary's,

401
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,420
set Hilary straight.

402
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,920
It was bad enough Hilary gets pregnant--

403
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,540
now she's determined to keep the kid.

404
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,600
Didn't sit well with you,according to her boyfriend.

405
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,320
I didn't kill my daughter!

406
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,950
The rabbit-hair slippers...

407
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,570
wasn't the last time you saw her,was it?

408
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,630
I loved her more than anything in the world.

409
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,540
That's what they all say.

410
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,810
Well,I just couldn't let her life turn out the way mine did.

411
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,110
Yeah? How's that work?

412
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,640
I dropped out of college to get married.

413
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,790
Six months later,I had Hilary,

414
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,890
and that was the end of me.

415
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,990
Having a kid ended your life?

416
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,300
Being married to one did.

417
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,120
Bill wouldn't let me get a job.

418
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,850
Turned me into his cook,his laundry girl.

419
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,220
I wanted Hilary to be more than that,

420
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,510
the way I was more than that.

421
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,800
And when Hilary wouldn't give up the baby?

422
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,870
She never had a choice.

423
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,690
Mom... what are you doing here?

424
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,820
Today's an important day.

425
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,400
Sister Margaret has some paperwork for you to sign.

426
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,880
To give up the baby?

427
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,100
Yes,Hilary.

428
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,300
I don't want to.

429
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,450
Huck doesn't want to marry you,Hilary.

430
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,980
You can't raise a child on your own.

431
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,630
You are just a child yourself.

432
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,490
Adoption will save both you and the baby from a lifetime of shame.

433
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,690
You don't want people calling the baby a bastard,do you?

434
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,930
No man will ever marry you if he knows what you've done.

435
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,330
I know you want a nice family someday,don't you,Hilary?

436
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,720
On one side,I want you to write

437
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,680
what an adoptive family can offer the baby.

438
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,550
A father.

439
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,280
A house.

440
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,780
A job.

441
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,880
Clothes.

442
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,930
Food.

443
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,800
Excellent.

444
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,140
On the other side,I want you to write

445
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,910
what you can offer the baby.

446
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,400
What did you put on your side?

447
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,630
"love" That's all I have.

448
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,790
There is still so much ahead of you.

449
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,910
College.

450
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,600
Marriage,a family.

451
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,970
Trust me,sweetheart.Please.

452
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,700
I'm going to make a tape for her,

453
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,380
with my new tape recorder.

454
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:01,940
- Her?
- The baby.Sunshine.

455
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,750
I want her to hear my voice.

456
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,860
Of course you do.

457
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,510
At least now I'll get a chance to tell her.

458
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,710
Tell her what,sweetheart?

459
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,000
Good-bye.

460
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,410
Surrender documents are the only legal contracts in America

461
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,070
that can be signed by a minor.

462
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,370
Doesn't seem fair.

463
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,040
I was her mother.

464
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,960
If anyone should've protected her,it was me.

465
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,780
What happened with the tape Hilary made for her baby?

466
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,740
I tried to listen to it.

467
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,700
Cried for a week.

468
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,000
Still got it?

469
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,260
It's all I have left of her.

470
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,840
Would you give it to Barbara when you're done?

471
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,420
And tell her I'm sorry.

472
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,060
Hilary's good-bye tape to her kid.

473
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,940
Heartbreaking stuff.

474
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,770
Well,it's tough to give up a child.

475
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,350
Especially when you're falling in love with her.

476
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,360
I can't even imagine it.

477
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,210
Hilary recorded everything that went on that last week before she died.

478
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,330
Anything relevant?

479
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,850
The last entry might be.

480
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,380
Night Karen had her kid,

481
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,530
Hilary found out what was really going on at St. Mary's.

482
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,680
Dear Sunshine,

483
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,170
tonight Karen had her baby,her beautiful little boy.

484
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,890
But then she had to say good-bye.

485
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,290
I used all my 15 minutes to say good-bye to him.

486
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,010
You're going to be all right,Karen.

487
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,960
It felt like less than a second.

488
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,310
I unwrapped him.

489
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,030
Counted his fingers and toes.

490
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,040
He was so perfect.

491
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,290
The minute I saw him lying in his bassinet,

492
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,440
I knew he belonged with me.

493
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,620
How could they take him away?

494
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,580
Shh,shh,shh.

495
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,990
We'll get through this,okay?

496
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,480
It's not going to be easy,but we'll help each other.

497
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,340
I want him back. I want my little boy.

498
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,630
Sister Margaret said it's a lawyer and his wife.

499
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,060
That they're rich.

500
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,260
They'll be a good family.

501
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,980
They might be better parents,but he's mine.

502
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,850
I want him back in his bassinet.

503
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,720
Put him back...

504
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,680
Let's go to your room,Karen.

505
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,290
Back in his bassinet.

506
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,320
Sister Margaret was selling the babies?

507
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,800
We talking black market?

508
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,090
And Hilary found out.

509
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,430
Sister we know the real reason why you didn't tell police about St Mary's.

510
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,440
You were sellin' babies to the highest bidder.

511
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,970
And Hilary found out.

512
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,750
You have no proof of that.

513
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,800
Dug up your old records at St. Mary's Parish.

514
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,400
140 girls came through the home on your watch.

515
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,600
112 official adoptions,Sister.

516
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,370
28,untraceable.

517
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,290
I did it for the greater good.

518
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,650
Is that how you sleep at night?

519
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,470
It took more than church donations to keep St. Mary's running.

520
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,880
And those babies went to couples
who could afford to raise them right.

521
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,100
You mean couples who could afford to cut in line.

522
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,160
I never harmed any of those girls.

523
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,640
Isolation room,selling their kids.

524
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,220
You got a funny way of defining "harm."

525
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,520
The church told us that they were unfit to be mothers,

526
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,950
and they'd just go out and do it again

527
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,870
if we didn't reform them.

528
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,480
I had to believe that... to do what I did.

529
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,100
Until Hilary convinced me that I was wrong.

530
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,400
Your time is up,Hilary.

531
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,640
What?

532
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,740
I said your time is up.

533
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,570
I labored in the dark for 18 hours.

534
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,070
No one held my hand or told me what was happening.

535
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,300
I thought I would die from the pain.

536
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,170
I thought I couldn't go on.

537
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,270
And then I saw her.

538
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,090
And she saw me.

539
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,660
And she knew I was her mother.

540
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,860
No matter what you do,you can never take that away.

541
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,340
I'm her mother.

542
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,820
I suppose a few more minutes wouldn't hurt anyone.

543
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,830
What you're doing here...

544
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,600
you lied to us about everything.

545
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:54,710
Because how could I be bad and make an angel like her?

546
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,650
Sister?

547
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,900
Isn't love enough?

548
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,340
Your baby's adoptive parents won't be here till the morning.

549
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,710
The nursery door is always open.

550
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,190
Tonight the back door will be,too.

551
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,670
Sometimes,when I can't fall asleep,

552
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,660
I try to picture their faces:

553
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,620
the girls and their babies.

554
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,350
I ask them to forgive me.

555
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,550
That was the last you saw of Hilary?

556
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,170
Yes.

557
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,110
She left that night.

558
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,490
So why didn't she leave the baby behind?

559
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,540
She must have been in a real hurry

560
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,450
because she put her in a boy's bassinet.

561
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,370
That created some confusion the next morning.

562
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,900
The boy's bassinet? You remember whose?

563
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,480
Karen Watson's.

564
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:02,890
This one time I'm six years old,in the mall.

565
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,860
I stare into the toy store,

566
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,910
and I realize my mom's gone.

567
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:15,930
So I go in,play with the toys till someone notices me.

568
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,690
Calls her over the loudspeaker,

569
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:28,060
and,uh...she plays it off like she lost me 'cause of the crowds.

570
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,880
But I could smell the booze on her breath.

571
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,440
There a point to this?

572
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,920
Some mothers,

573
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,320
not really meant to be mothers.

574
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,470
That's why you brought me here?

575
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,450
Take a trip down memory lane?

576
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,580
You don't think about it at all?

577
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,910
Giving up your baby?

578
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,350
Did it,and it's done.

579
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,400
It's not a big deal.

580
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,350
A lot of people say the worst thing that can happen

581
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,640
is losing your kid.

582
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,080
Probably no different for a mother forced to give up her baby.

583
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,660
It was a piece of cake for me.

584
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,860
Then why wasn't 15 minutes enough?

585
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,110
The only way you could handle the pain

586
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,310
was to live like you didn't care,

587
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,550
but I know you do.

588
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,660
Turns out you're not the tough girl you pretended to be.

589
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,600
You've been looking for him your whole life.

590
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,730
A member of every online-adoption-search group.

591
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,310
You couldn't let go of him,could you?

592
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,610
They said it was going to be easy.

593
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,290
They lied.

594
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,160
Not a day goes by that I don't think about him,

595
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,360
pray that he's okay.

596
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,440
Whatever mistakes a mother makes...

597
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:19,360
nothing is stronger than her love for her child.

598
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:25,140
No different if she surrendered him or she lost her in the mall.

599
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,500
I found your son.

600
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,720
My son?

601
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,020
He wants to meet you.

602
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,640
You took Hilary's baby,didn't you,Karen?

603
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,490
You put her in your son's bassinet.

604
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,900
I wanted to keep her.

605
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,850
Until I realized...

606
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,000
no one in the world could replace my little boy.

607
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,860
Hilary!

608
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,250
Hilary,wait! It's me!

609
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,110
What are you doing?

610
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,010
They're selling the babies,Karen,

611
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,940
not giving them to families.

612
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,090
That's not true.

613
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,540
Hilary!

614
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,830
Hilary,stop!

615
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,550
They lied to us about everything.

616
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,850
We won't forget them. We're mothers now.

617
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,150
I'll never love anything more.

618
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,630
But you said we'd help each other.

619
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,930
I'm sorry.

620
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,140
I have to go.

621
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,200
Go?! What?!

622
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,240
Me and Sunshine! You can't just take her!

623
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,680
It's the only way I can keep her!

624
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,550
I had to give up my baby,so do you!

625
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,600
No! She's mine.

626
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,610
She needs to go back.

627
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,050
You got to put that baby back!

628
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,770
Put him back!

629
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,160
гн What? 
гн Put him back!

630
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,260
You can't take her from me! You can't take my baby!

631
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,840
Karen,what are you talking about?

632
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,370
He's mine,not yours. He's my baby.

633
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,290
I want him back!

634
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,670
I want him back!
