Truthfully?

113
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,490
Better for me than for her.

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,180
no. It's too many!

115

That's what you get

117
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,190
puck. Martha.

118
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,760
Is this for...

119
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,400
It's for you.

120
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,700

Martha.

124
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,110
I really liked your tape.

125
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,150
Uh,you don't know how
many tapes I've watched.

126
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,670
It seems like every girl's
stuck-up or into herself.

127
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,910
So... baseball,uh...

128
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,370
italian food,ice skating
on a lake,not a rink--

129
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,350
dogs,cats,any kind of
animal,traveling places...

130
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,810
uh,laughing.

131
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,090
Yeah,that's me.

132
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,140
Well,if that's not corny as hell,

133
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,360
maybe you'd like to
meet me in person.

134
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,110
did you see...

135
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm sorry,sweetie.

136
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,370
- That guy?
- What?

137
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,270
he didn't even make me a tape.

138
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,800
Well,maybe he's looking
for someone more my type.

139
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,190
That was my first tape.

140
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,970
What are the chances of finding
my dream man on the first tape?

141
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,480
You'll find your mr. Right.

142
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,000
And it'll be when
you least expect it.

143
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,480
I was trying to protect
martha from people like that.

144
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,540
People like what?

145
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,260
Users,scumbags,arrogant bastards.

146
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,960
You know how you people can be.

147
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,590
Uh,did she ever take
ramon up on his offer?

148
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,690
I never saw him again.

149
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,420
- Thanks for your time.
- Oh,detectives.

150
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,060
I have a box of martha's stuff
and no one to give it to.

151
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,680
Sure.

152
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,480
Look,I don't mean to make martha out to be some
loser just because the dating thing didn't work out.

153
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,390
It doesn't always work out and it
doesn't mean something's wrong with you.

154
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,560
Couldn't agree more.

155
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,770
Hi,sorry.

156
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,990
Ramon and martha made contact
through this dating service.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,700
He sees her tape,tries to
lure her in and rip her off.

158
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,530
You think it's impossible he could have
been interested because of how she looks?

159
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,990
Yeah,impossible.

160
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,350
I'm not sure I want you
speaking for all men.

161
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
The milkmaid's manor?

162
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,640
Research.

163
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,280
Prized possessions here
are all romance novels.

164
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,460
She was obsessed with these things.

165
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,220
Only one of 'em turned
out to be her diary.

166
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,390
Stuffed in a book jacket.

167
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,850
Hiding it.

168
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,760
Diary give us anything?

169
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,130
The novels got to her head.

170
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,530
She wanted a man,big time.

171
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,920
The romantic fantasy is why martha
didn't listen to stephanie.

172
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,340
So she did follow
up with ramon?

173
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,200
January 16,1989.

174
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,110
Martha agrees to meet
him at the perfumed rose.

175
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,470
Exhibit A.

176
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,360
<i>I told him I'd be the one
with the flower behind my ear.</i>

177
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,980
<i>If he saw me and wanted
to walk the other way,</i>

178
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,810
<i>I swore my feelings
wouldn't be hurt.</i>

179
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,920
martha.

180
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,300
Ramon.

181
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,400
Come here. Come here.

182
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,420
When's the last time
you had a cheesesteak?

183
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,150
Are you making fun of me?

184
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,780
What? No. No.

185
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,900
No,I asked because I know
after we have a few drinks

186
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,870
and talk for a long time I'm
going to want a cheesesteak.

187
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,310
- Geno'S.
- Okay.

188
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,330
A lot of girls,they don'T...

189
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,200
they don't bother
with the cheesesteak.

190
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,730
Gets old fast.

191
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,510
I guess I'm probably not
like a lot of other girls.

192
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,150
That's good.

193
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,590
That's why I'm here.

194
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,750
I think it's great what you do.

195
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,420
My parents died when I was ten.

196
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,360
Oh,my goodness.

197
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,850
You were an orphan?

198
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,850
Well,I...

199
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,140
I didn't have like a little
tin cup and a crutch,but...

200
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,390
Anyway,look,I-

201
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,870
I just wanted to tell you that it meant a lot
to me when they fixed up my mom to look nice.

202
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,300
At the wake.

203
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,240
That's why I'm in mortuary studies.

204
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
I felt the same way
when my mom died.

205
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,330
She had a strokewhen I was four.

206
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,260
I laid by her side for two days,

207
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,700
before a neighbor figured
it out and called the cops.

208
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,870
- That's sad,martha.
- No.

209
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,340
It was peaceful.

210
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,880
She was finally happy.

211
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,010
How do I look?

212
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,820
Very dashing.

213
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,240
Um,manly.

214
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,730
So martha and ramon hit it off.

215
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,370
'Spite of him being full of it.

216
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,630
Guy did all right.

217
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,360
All first date talk is crap.

218
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,340
Well,martha thought
ramon was sincere.

219
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,540
She slept with him that night.

220
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,220
Here's a last entry:

221
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,730
<i>Today ramon told me the reason he was drawn
to me is becaures i like his late mother.</i>

222
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,180
I never thought I could be so happy.

223
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,050
Now is that romantic or creepy?

224
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,610
That's not the last entry.

225
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,260
There's a space
in the binding.

226
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,420
Used to be other pages here.

227
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,090
Did they fall out?

228
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,360
Somebody took them out.

229
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,100
Jeffries just called.
He's got something.

230
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,710
Delgado had this storage
unit since 1980.

231
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,520
Love poetry from the
early 19th century.

232
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,110
Musings on women.

233
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,320
These are seduction tools.

234
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,890
Meet the seductees.

235
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,830
what are we watching?

236
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,490
Video dating tapes.

237
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,330
19 of them.

238
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,400
Love juncture.
Soul of a lifetime.

239
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,610
View and woo. What was
he doing with these?

240
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,310
Targeting women.

241
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,360
Credit card fraud?

242
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,370
We ran the names on the tapes.

243
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,420
Five of these women are dead.

244
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,220
Martha puck's dream man
wasn't just a con artist.

245
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,760
He was a serial killer.

246
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,710
6:00 in the morning.

247
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,910
You say it like i don't know that.

248
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,880
You got a name,kid?

249
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,900
Andre.

250
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,030
How 'bout you give it a rest,andre.

251
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,070
How 'bout you put some pants on?

252
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,460
I'm a cop,smart-ass.

253
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,530
So what you going to
do,homes,arrest me?

254
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,210
Ramon delgado had video dating
tapes on each of these women.

255
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,920
From five different dating
services where he was a client.

256
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,770
And each of these women died in a
hit-and-run accident in 1989.

257
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,080
Crossed state lines to hide his tracks.

258
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,990
One in jersey,one in new
york,the rest in philly.

259
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,750
Nobody made the connect.

260
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,530
- Any witnesses?
- One.

261
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,140
Crackhead named cherry lesure,saw victim number one,
buella stiffler,get mowed down in the badlands.

262
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,730
<i>Cherry said she saw bells and bubbles.</i>

263
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,090
Why do we ite it down?

264
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,690
So that was delgado's M.O.

265
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,410
He hit tir bank accounts,
then he hit them.

266
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,850
These five emptied their
bank accounts themselves,

267
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,090
day before they were killed.

268
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,790
Delgado convinced
them to do it. How?

269
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,290
Well,look at 'em.

270
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,490
Not exactly the
seasoned dating types.

271
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,540
You track down any of the other
women from his tape collection?

272
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,830
Yeah,found a live one,uh,eugenia karpathian.

273
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,000
Always like fishing a lot.

274
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,790
But what with water pollution
what it is these day....

275
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,860
Well,see what eugenia can tell
you about ramon and his magic.

276
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,330
Six tons of plush toys
can't deliver themselves,guys.

277
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,850
Well,he was good-looking,
at least I got that excuse.

278
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,090
Eugenia,did ramon delgado
ever make you feel threatened?

279
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,950
Uh,in danger?

280
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,590
Au contraire,he
was sugar and spice.

281
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,890
How do you think he convinced
me to let him invest my savings?

282
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,290
Invested it,all right,into his own pocket.

283
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,280
You never reported it?

284
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,040
Would've,if it weren't half
my fault,fallin' for his bs.

285
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,220
He ever say anything
to you about other women?

286
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,910
He didn't have to say.

287
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,170
After he wronged me,
I staked out his place.

288
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,050
Sure enough,
there was a new girl.

289
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,830
Floral print-type.

290
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,170
You don't know me,
technically,

291
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,660
but you and i are
one in the same.

292
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,120
- I have to go to the pretzels now.
- No.

293
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,920
Ramon delgado.

294
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,720
He took me for all I'm worth.

295
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,650
And he'll do the same to you.

296
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,210
I don't know what you're
talking about. Excuse me.

297
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,110
Yeah,I'm a single mom.

298
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,230
I got my boy asking
for soccer camp,

299
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,530
and I can't even give him sauce for
his noodles since ramon cleaned me out.

300
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm sorry if he hurt you.

301
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,990
But it's different
with me and ramon.

302
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,660
So... I don't need your warning.

303
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,410
You look like my dead ma.

304
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,990
He say that to you?

305
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,570
Next he'll ask for
a key to your place.

306
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,820
Stuff will disappear.

307
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,320
He'll borrow your car.
It'll get stolen.

308
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,150
What's going on?

309
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
She knows ramon.

310
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,740
You got to have hope.

311
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,020
Just because we ain't
morgan fairchild,

312
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,240
doesn't mean we don't
deserve somebody nice.

313
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,910
Martha,who is this?

314
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,060
We got to go home.

315
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,890
Poor martha. I've been there.

316
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,150
One day you're on vacation
in denial city,

317
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,500
next day you're in a prison
of your own stupidity.

318
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,330
Thanks,eugenia.

319
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,550
Well,stephanie,the roommate
lied about martha and ramon.

320
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,930
Said they didn't follow up.

321
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,790
Well,this guy was a
svengali with the ladies.

322
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,230
Maybe stephanie fell
for his schtick,too?

323
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,570
Oh,please. Protect ramon?

324
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,240
I couldn't stand him.

325
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,820
Oh,you think you can just pick
and choose what you tell us?

326
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,230
I have a reputation you know.

327
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,820
As what?

328
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,770
The kind of men I date
have money,and prestige,

329
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,660
and they do background checks.

330
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,060
If they found out that
I lived with a thief,

331
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,370
all this... means nothing.

332
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,540
Thief. Oh,you mean ramon?

333
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,700
Martha?

334
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,420
look,martha was your roommate.

335
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,740
Doesn't mean she reflects on you.

336
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,640
I can tell you're... classy.

337
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,330
True.

338
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,840
So you can imagine how I felt.

339
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,570
About what?

340
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:38,070
The day that lady with the
braid saw us at the supermarket.

341
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,300
We raced home,and martha she just...

342
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,250
transformed.

343
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,290
baby.

344
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,790
This thing's out of whack. I was,uh,

345
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,650
I was going to run it down to my buddy's shop
and get it fixed before murphy brown comes on.

346
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,590
Steph,will you give us a sec?

347
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,590
I know you don't really love me.

348
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,420
You lied to me for two weeks
to take my frickin' tv?

349
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,040
You can't call the cops.

350
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,400
They can't prove it.

351
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,080
Please,don't go.

352
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,270
I can't get over you.

353
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,260
It would be too hard.

354
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,920
I dreamt about you.

355
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,820
And then you were here.

356
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,030
And now I'm gone.

357
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,500
'Cause I got what I need.

358
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,980
You could get more.

359
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,460
From the girls.

360
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,080
That you lie to.

361
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,520
Oh,yeah?

362
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,500
You can marry them.

363
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,630
why would I do that?

364
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,200
It's all we want.

365
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,090
To have somebody say
that we're the one.

366
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,710
If you do that,we'll
give you anything.

367
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,630
Anything like what?

368
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,690
Secret stashes.

369
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,600
We have 'em...

370
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,280
because we think we're
going to be alone forever.

371
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,070
So I take the money...

372
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,110
then I got a wife.
Forget it.

373
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,040
- Divorce her.
- That's too messy.

374
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,620
Get rid of her.

375
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,400
that don't work,babe.

376
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,690
I can't do jail.

377
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,590
We can think of a way.

378
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,770
For us to get
away with it.

379
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,040
Us?

380
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,110
People die every day
crossing the street.

381
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,460
Martha...

382
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,690
ramon.

383
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,540
Obviously,she wasn't serious
about taking anybody out.

384
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,650
Oh,obviously.

385
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,430
People die crossing
the street?

386
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,810
That's how our five
women were taken out.

387
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,200
Hit-and-runs were
martha's idea.

388
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,820
She wasn't ramon's victim.

389
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,820
She was his accomplice.

390
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,980
Well this is a big,
fat waste of time.

391
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,930
Solving a murderer's murder.

392
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,700
Case gets closed...
all five of them.

393
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,620
Doesn't matter how we
feel about the victim.

394
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,150
She's not a victim.
She's a psycho.

395
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,080
She did it for love.

396
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,600
Love with a two-bit hood.

397
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,690
Ramon wasn't pickin' anyone
off until martha came in.

398
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,110
That's my piece.

399
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,720
I found a pattern in the
victims' credit card charges.

400
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,560
Day she died,buella stiffler made
a purchase at a florist in new jersey.

401
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,330
Anastasia farelli went
to the beauty parlor.

402
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,930
And petunia marshall
got a five-point wax.

403
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,860
It's martha's wedding plan in
action. Flowers,the primping.

404
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,040
Purchases were made
on the day they died.

405
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,030
He was marrying them,and then kills 'em
before they have to pay for a honeymoon.

406
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,840
They did the ceremony,offed the
girls and never filed the paperwork.

407
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,550
Which would explain why there's no
record of ramon delgado being married.

408
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,120
I called the florist in atlantic
city,where buella used her card.

409
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,020
They said they doo a lot of orders
for the quickie chapel next door.

410
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,270
Midnight love chapel,it's called.

411
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,080
I'll send nick and
scotty down there.

412
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,860
I can do it,but it's
not legal in this state.

413
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,060
Yeah,I remember rico suave
and the two big girls.

414
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,730
buella and serena.

415
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,000
This "serena" by any chance?

416
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,840
Yep,that's her.

417
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,710
Serena montagne.
The groom's sister.

418
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,030
Sister?

419
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,730
Tell us about serena
and her brother ramon.

420
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,630
I've seen some wacky
couples in here,

421
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,340
but that brother and
sister duo make my top five.

422
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,220
S you two don't look alike.

423
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,500
I'm adopted.!!

424
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,970
I'm adopted.

425
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,340
Hey,baby.

426
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,060
Maybe you should check the
girls' room. Maybe she split.

427
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,900
No,she's coming,ramon.

428
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,050
She's been in there 40 minutes.
What'd you say to her?

429
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,420
The first time you saw her tape,

430
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,490
it was like you got tunnel vision
and all you could see was her,

431
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,640
and then you called me from
a payphone and you said,

432
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,350
sis,I can't believe it.
I think I found the one.

433
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,790
That's nice.

434
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,290
You look hot in a hat.

435
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,660
I wish it were me.

436
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,690
Walkin' down the aisle to you.

437
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,280
Wouldn't mom be proud?

438
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,540
well,hi.

439
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,590
serena montagne-- name martha used--
it's from one of her romance novels.

440
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,900
No kiddin'.

441
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,520
Yeah,a busty milkmaid
finds out she's a princess.

442
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,250
Isn't that always the way?
Thanks a lot.

443
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,050
Hey,these bubbles?

444
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,190
yep. Less mess than birdseed.

445
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,010
you givin' these away in '89?

446
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,980
Since we opened.

447
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,230
Help yourself.

448
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,620
Bells and bubbles.

449
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,970
For free. It's your lucky day.

450
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,170
Crackhead who saw buella's hit-and-run
talked about bells and bubbles.

451
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,320
We're looking for.. Cherry lesure.

452
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:44,930
I'm outta breath from
runnin' over here.

453
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,110
My girlfriend said there was a delicious
scoop o' chocolate in a suit lookin' for me.

454
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,790
Hello.

455
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,020
cherry lesure?

456
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,800
Detectives jeffries and rush.

457
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,600
Back in '89,you saw a
hit-and-run down here.

458
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,480
Big girl,buella stiffler.

459
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,150
Dark days for me.

460
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,260
You recall the incident or not?

461
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,120
He always this feisty?

462
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,670
I told them boys
in blue what I saw.

463
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,470
They chose not to listen. Feisty.

464
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,410
You described seeing
bells and bubbles.

465
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,610
That's right. 'Cause they
were doin' a housewarming party.

466
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,470
What do you mean?

467
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,030
It's crazy,but they came down here
and acted like they found paradise.

468
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,930
Watch your step.

469
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,460
keep them closed. No looking.

470
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,210
You guys are hysterical.

471
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,110
Where are we?

472
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,080
oh,you'll see in
a sec. No looking.

473
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,130
- Okay.
- Okay...

474
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,490
home sweet home.

475
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,790
this is what we put
our down payment on?

476
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,190
You're kidding,right?

477
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,860
You have to use your
imagination,buella.

478
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,270
I mean,it's not built yet,but,
oh,it's going to be beautiful.

479
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,700
You know what?
Here we go.

480
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,380
I just carried you
over the threshold.

481
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,050
- You did?
- I did.

482
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,240
Close your eyes so
you can picture it.

483
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,230
- Okay.
- Okay?

484
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,320
- They closed?
- Yes.

485
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,010
Yeah? There's the front door.

486
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,620
There's the little stone path
leading up toward the fence.

487
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,340
Little front yard.

488
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,560
Seriously? Like with
bushes and stuff?

489
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,550
Keep 'em closed.

490
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,910
- keep 'em closed.
- All right.

491
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,050
Yes,with bushes and stuff.

492
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,630
I love you.

493
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,290
Oh,my god!

494
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,570
Martha... stop crying.

495
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,850
Martha,martha,stop crying.

496
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,610
That was fantastic.

497
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,060
You were freakin'
gorgeous just then.

498
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,410
Really?

499
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,350
This stuff becomes you,baby.

500
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,100
You sure that wasn't a vision
from your crack pipe,cherry?

501
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:27,670
That's what happened.

502
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,980
Big girl's shakin' like a leaf,
but she took that other broad out.

503
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,930
come see my show at the
manhole tuesday night.

504
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,760
It's slammin',girl.

505
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,790
And give choco-love my flyer.

506
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,760
sure. Thanks,cherry.

507
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,710
For you... choco-love.

508
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,290
That was vera.

509
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,940
Ran martha's alias,serena
montagne,and got a hit.

510
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,670
She used it for something other
than marriage certificates?

511
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,930
Turns out serena took out
a life insurance policy.

512
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,970
On who?

513
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,300
Ramon delgado.

514
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:11,730
Guess martha got the
hang of the con game.

515
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,030
Decided to step it up a notch,
take out her true love.

516
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,890
So martha tried to turn
the tables on ramon.

517
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,950
And scam the scammer.
Maybe he found out.

518
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,480
- And he took her out first.
- She was deep in the game.

519
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,360
Her fake name--
serena montagne--

520
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,820
she used it for a lot more than
the life insurance policy on ramon.

521
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,940
Credit cards.

522
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,120
And a safe deposit box.

523
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,660
And guess what was in it?

524
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,440
Other half of the diary.

525
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,460
What'd she give us?

526
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,430
Writes about buella stiffler and the
four other women she and ramon murdered.

527
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,000
Any insight into martha's murder?

528
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,510
Nothing caught up with them
from their crime spree.

529
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,790
Except martha's conscience.

530
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:52,620
<i>dear love,</i>

531
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,460
<i>may you keep track of every second
that we are together on this earth.</i>

532
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,090
Your husband,edwin.

533
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,000
1947.

534
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,980
This is so romantic.

535
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,460
What?

536
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,350
And we took it.

537
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,250
This is someone's
heirloom of love...

538
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,200
this loser's into ferns.

539
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,130
You know anything about that?

540
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,760
I don't think I want
to do it anymore.

541
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,940
Martha needs a rubdown.

542
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,680
I've become a terrible person.

543
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,250
And for what?

544
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,410
So that I can pretend to be your sister while some
girl who thinks she's your wife climbs all over you?

545
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,880
You think I like it?

546
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,870
But we can't quit.

547
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,690
Think I need to go for a walk.

548
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,470
Martha...

549
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,440
come on,baby.

550
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,280
What we have is special.

551
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,800
We are bonnie and clyde.

552
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,980
And it feels good,right?

553
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,210
It doesn'T.

554
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,180
you don't like us?

555
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,920
You don't like me?

556
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,270
I don't like me.

557
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,230
Let's get married.

558
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
You want a wife?

559
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,170
I want you.

560
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,090
The second I saw you,

561
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,020
I got tunnel vision.

562
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,470
And I knew you were the one.

563
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,520
Martha puck,

564
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,540
will you marry me?

565
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,400
<i>Ramon only marries a girl when
he's ready to get rid of her for good.</i>

566
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,920
I've got to get him before he gets me.

567
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:22,200
<i>Mart ha's serena montagne credit card</i>

568
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,470
had three charges on it the
week after she was shot.

569
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,850
Ramon used it?

570
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,790
Take a look at the charges.

571
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,710
Grocery store,clothing
boutique,pee wee soccer camp.

572
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,600
Soccer camp?

573
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,360
Eugenia said she wanted to send her son
there before ramon cleaned her out.

574
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,380
Martha dies and eugenia's
luck turns around.

575
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,740
Thing about martha
is she was frustrating.

576
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,080
Some women,they think
so low of themselves,

577
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,370
gets them into trouble.

578
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:59,060
mean well, You weren't
angry with martha?

579
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:04,260
Well,I was disappointed.

580
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,060
Disappointed doesn't explain taking credit cards
off her dead body and using them to buy things.

581
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,200
I got to stop you right there.

582
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,580
I don't do killing.

583
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,310
That's too bad. 'Cause if you did,
maybe ramon wouldn't have dumped you.

584
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,300
I wouldn't say he dumped me.

585
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,000
I wouldn't use that word.

586
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,060
It was meant to be,though.

587
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,860
Him and martha were
the real love match.

588
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,100
Well,there's no
accounting for taste.

589
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,340
You still love him.

590
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:42,860
Oh,go ahead and judge me.

591
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,590
You don't know what it's like to be
a woman and want somebody to love you,

592
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,270
but you're too old,you're too fat,

593
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,490
you're too loud,
you're too something.

594
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,680
And every damn thing hurts your
feelings like it's the end of the world.

595
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,820
And you...

596
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,510
we might as well be
from different planets.

597
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,030
Martha was planning
on killing ramon.

598
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,690
You found out about that.

599
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,880
Guy like that?
You don't toss that out.

600
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,300
He was using her just
like he used you.

601
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,120
I wish! After she was gone,

602
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,000
I told him I'd be his new
bonnie,he could be my clyde.

603
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,180
But he couldn't get over losing martha.

604
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,030
He was watching her tape
when he killed himself.

605
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,450
Some people get lucky with love,

606
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,480
some people don'T.

607
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,300
That's life.

608
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,090
How did you know about martha's plan?

609
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,730
She called me up.

610
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,010
Said I was the only person
she could really confide in.

611
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,850
'Cause us two...

612
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,760
we knew what it was like
to be under his spell.

613
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,940
Thank you so much for meeting me here.

614
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,920
I know it's out of your way,

615
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,660
but I don't want ramon to find me.

616
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,750
Smells good,doesn't it?

617
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,280
Deep dish place.

618
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,410
I'm guessing your problem has
something to do with ramon.

619
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,180
He wants to get rid of me.

620
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,610
What,like kill you?

621
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,810
he's not that bad.

622
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,560
Yes,he is.

623
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,670
Oh,eugenia.

624
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,560
we've done things.

625
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,800
I just lost my way.

626
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,310
<i>we?</i>

627
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,830
I helped him steal and...

628
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,630
do horrible,terrible things.

629
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,290
You and him?

630
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,450
So,uh...

631
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,480
what,you live together?

632
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,600
I'm gonna kill him.

633
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,320
can I touch it?

634
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,710
I have life insurance on him,

635
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,840
and I am giving the money
to you and your son.

636
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,590
'Cause I want to make it
right,what happened to you.

637
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,810
Did he ever tell you
you had beautiful hair?

638
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,710
I don't think so.

639
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,960
Yeah,well,he,uh...

640
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,510
he told me that.

641
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,410
You do have nice hair.

642
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,440
Can you put the gun down?

643
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,730
I can't really stand
it if you kill him.

644
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,790
'Cause maybe,if you
don't want him,then,uh...

645
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,320
what?

646
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,400
Eugenia!

647
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,070
He's a bad person.

648
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,360
He isn't good enough for you.

649
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,040
Well,he's all there is.

650
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,530
But what about hope?

651
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,870
You said there would
be someone nice.

652
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,300
I'm sick of saying that!

653
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:49,780
It's bad enough to have...

654
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,690
every damn ad,song,tv show lying to you
about how anybody can find true love.

655
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,220
But I am so sick of lying to myself.

656
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,880
Oh,eugenia.

657
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,490
Don't give up.

658
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,230
Love could find you when
you least expect it.

659
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,070
You could be sitting in the
park one day,reading a book...

660
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,410
'cause I am so... damn...

661
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:12,510
tired.
