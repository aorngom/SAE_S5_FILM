00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:04,717
January 13, 1979

2
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:11,077
Shake it, baby.

3
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,281
I just finished reading 
The Feminine Mystique,

4
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:15,916
and I don't get it,  Alison. I mean,

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,483
I'm not some kind of man-hater.

6
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,913
Cause there's so much to love.

7
00:00:23,183 --> 00:00:28,412
I mean, I'm proud, being a housewife,
a mother. I don't hate my life.

8
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:31,389
Well, hating your life isn't 
Betty's point. / Then what is?

9
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:35,342
Loving it.
Do you love your life, Libby?

10
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:38,115
Last chance, macho men.

11
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:41,605
If your keys aren't in the bowl, I can't pick'em!

12
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,334
Whoo! You heard my wife!

13
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,640
Time to get real free and real naked!

14
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,185
- Now that's women's lib for you.
- What's going on?

15
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,228
Carl didn't tell you?

16
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:57,364
It's a key party.
Everyone's doing it.

17
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,002
Not everyone.

18
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:05,436
Carl, let's go.

19
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:08,764
- What? We just got here.
- I want to go home.

20
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:10,799
Loosen up, Lib.
Get yourself a drink.

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,269
You knew about this, didn't you?

22
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,968
I promised Joe I'd play.

23
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:18,916
It's something he heard about 
when he was in California.

24
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,053
We live in Pennsylvania.

25
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:22,775
It's just a game, Lib.

26
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:27,444
When Joe got home, he left his wife
for a 23-year-old stewardess.

27
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:31,615
It's not just a game.

28
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:35,362
Take a cab, then. I'm staying.

29
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,245
God knows it's been a frigid winter.

30
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:40,675
Let's go, foxy ladies.
You pick his keychain,

31
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:44,035
and he sticks his keys in your ignition.

32
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:48,648
Who's gonna kick things off?

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,209
I will.

34
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:57,096
Libby?

35
00:01:57,556 --> 00:01:59,638
I said, I will.

36
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:16,821
Who's the lucky macho man?

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,983
Mom?

38
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,678
- Mom!
- I hate this part.

39
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:39,419
Mom! Mommy!
Mom! Oh!

40
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:40,809
Young lady, you're gonna 
have to step back.

41
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:43,253
Oh, my God!

42
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:46,271
That's my mom!

43
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:51,064
Breathe.
Breathe.

44
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:53,482
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

45
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:55,317
You're going to be all right.

46
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:02,613
We'll find the person who did this.

47
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:05,075
You will?

48
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:07,305
Yeah.

49
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:09,988
I promise.

50
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:47,369
Got here fast as we could, Will.

51
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:49,595
Missing my beauty sleep.
Better be good.

52
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:54,130
Kids camping out, having some sort
of Blair Witch scarefest.

53
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,415
Making a movie?

54
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:56,870
Looking for a ghost.

55
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,528
As in Casper the Friendly?

56
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,276
Libby Bradley.

57
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:02,302
Found stabbed in tse woods, 1979.

58
00:04:02,302 --> 00:04:04,994
Kids been calling the place
haunted ever since.

59
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,262
What'd they find?

60
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:09,782
Ski jacket stuffed in a tree trunk.
Doer must've dumped it.

61
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,926
Amount of blood looks like a stabbing.

62
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:14,058
From 27 years ago.

63
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,226
Half mile from where we found her.

64
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:18,939
A few hundred yards
beyond our search area.

65
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,449
Called her daughter to ID it.

66
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,341
You called a family member 
at 2:00 a.m. over a jacket?

67
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:26,668
She's been calling me for 27 years.

68
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:29,009
You worked the job back in '79?

69
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,360
And made a promise I couldn't keep.

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,298
Rookie mistake.

71
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,450
Will?

72
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:40,851
Helen.

73
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:43,013
Detectives Rush, Vera.

74
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,736
You found something?

75
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:51,038
Ski jacket.
Thinking it might be your mom's.

76
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:54,569
Oh, my God.

77
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:56,889
You recognize it?

78
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,615
She used to call it her bumblebee jacket
because of the black stripe.

79
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:07,330
Found this in the pocket.
Car keys.

80
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,219
- That doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't?

81
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:13,164
- Those car keys couldn't be hers.
- Why not?

82
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:16,328
Because my mother didn't know 
how to drive.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2006/11/05

96
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:53,299
Blood on the jacket's O-positive,
same as Libby Bradley's.

97
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:56,660
Best theory back in '79 was
a mugging gone wrong.

98
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,408
Lots of transients 
in those woods back then.

99
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:01,065
- No signs of sexual assault?
- Nope.

100
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:04,231
Always wondered why she wasn't 
dressed for the cold. Dead of winter.

101
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,968
Doer must have lifted her jacket.

102
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,778
- Never found the murder weapon?
- Never ID'd it.

103
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:12,688
Puncture wound to the left lung.
Drowned in her own blood.

104
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,914
Husband Carl and daughter Helen
were the last to see her

105
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:16,830
before they left for work, school.

106
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,947
Estimated time of death: 2:00 p.m.

107
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:22,569
Carl was at work all day.
Alibi checked out.

108
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:24,605
Real stand-up people.

109
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:28,530
Every year, Helen sends me a card
on her mother's birthday.

110
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,741
Not this year.

111
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,465
It's tough to hold on, keep believing.

112
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:37,319
I never forgot.

113
00:06:38,802 --> 00:06:40,459
Checked with the manufacturer.

114
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:43,881
Key was for a '75 Cadillac Eldorado.

115
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:48,521
Transients don't drive Cadillacs.

116
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:51,759
Doer was close to home,
same social circle.

117
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,726
Let's talk to the husband.

118
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:56,336
Oh, and, uh, boss needs you.

119
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,311
Scotty. ADA Thomas.

120
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,402
Heard you on the stand
a few months back. Impressive.

121
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:13,723
Thanks.
So what's up?

122
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:18,473
My sole witness in the Fitzpatrick
molestation trial committed suicide.

123
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:20,792
You talking about Jimmy Donohue?

124
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:23,058
Yeah. You know him?

125
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,707
Yeah, old neighborhood.
When'd it happen?

126
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:29,005
Last night.
He hung himself.

127
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:32,603
You knew the guy.
Sorry. Don't pull punches.

128
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,479
Don't need to.

129
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,793
Bottom line, Scott, is
Fitzpatrick's gonna walk.

130
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,468
no else is willing to come forward.

131
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:40,520
Unless your brother does.

132
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:44,555
Already talked to him.
No dice.

133
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:46,788
It's tough when it's family.

134
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:47,851
Your meaning?

135
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,912
Seen you on the stand, detective,
working that magic.

136
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:52,295
Ain't my brother's keeper.

137
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:55,525
But you are a cop, right?

138
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:02,014
You know where you can reach me.

139
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,574
Sure, Alex.

140
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:18,017
We have new evidence
in your wife's murder, Carl.

141
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:20,706
New evidence.
Like what?

142
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:23,852
Kids out in the woods found
her ski jacket.

143
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,448
Keys in the pocket.

144
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,833
For a Cadillac.

145
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:30,372
Wondering if you might
know something about it.

146
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,392
Well, I, uh...

147
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,322
I don't know what to say.

148
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:39,242
Your daughter wants answers.
I assume you do, too.

149
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:43,580
You have to understand, 
it was the '70s.

150
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,926
Okay.

151
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:48,819
We didn't always behave like that.
We had families.

152
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,764
We were decent people.

153
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,029
Talk about the keychain.

154
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,888
Libby picked it.

155
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:58,767
What do you mean,
picked it?

156
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:01,270
At a key party.

157
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:05,776
Who's the lucky macho man?

158
00:09:06,944 --> 00:09:08,855
I guess that'd be me.

159
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,055
Far out!

160
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:15,911
Man of the house goes home
with the foxiest lady at the party!

161
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:17,198
Oh.

162
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:20,361
Don't let me get in the way,
honey bunny.

163
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,215
You pick now, hot pants.

164
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:25,181
I want to know who's grooving
in our pad tonight.

165
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:27,119
You sure about this, Libby?

166
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:30,068
I-I think so. I don't know.

167
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:33,262
Those are mine!
Those are mine.

168
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:36,282
You be easy on my wife, macho man.

169
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:38,763
Think you mean your second wife.

170
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:42,731
I'll just get my coat.

171
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:49,769
Hey, I thought you were in bed.

172
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,448
It's hard to sleep in Studio 54.

173
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:57,820
- Hi, Mrs. Bradley.
- Hi, Jed.

174
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,325
Ready if you are.

175
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:02,705
Night, son.

176
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:10,310
So...

177
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,067
Libby and Bill left together.

178
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:18,224
And two months later, she's dead
with his keys in her pocket.

179
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:20,237
I started this.

180
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,974
Taking her to that key party.

181
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:25,264
Maybe Bill finished it.

182
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,436
- Bill Huxley?
- Son of a bitch!

183
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:42,623
Detectives Rush, Vera.

184
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:44,503
This is a members-only establishment.

185
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:48,048
So is police headquarters.
How about we chat down there instead?

186
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:51,547
I'll catch up on the next hole.

187
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:55,454
You remember Libby Bradley,
stabbed in '79?

188
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,063
That was a lifetime ago.

189
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:58,594
Maybe for you.

190
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:00,615
For some, still feels like yesterday.

191
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:01,960
Something going on between you two?

192
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,802
What? No.

193
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:06,226
We just knew each other 
from the neighborhood.

194
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:08,488
What about that key party?

195
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:11,057
- Oh, that. 
- Yeah, that.

196
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:13,105
- It was one night.
- Really?

197
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:16,644
Then why were your car keys 
in her pocket the night she died?

198
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:21,094
Maybe sitting in a cell
for a few hours will jog that memory.

199
00:11:22,612 --> 00:11:25,781
She had my keys because 
it wasn't just a one-night stand.

200
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:27,294
Go on.

201
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:30,622
We had something special.

202
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:36,267
I've never done this before.

203
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:39,668
Don't tell anybody, but neither have I.

204
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:46,659
Well, I guess we should just, 
you know, what Joe said.

205
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:49,840
Take off our clothes.

206
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,060
Right, right, okay.

207
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,541
Wow, you look...

208
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,267
You have a nice body.

209
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,435
Thank you.

210
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:47,241
What's wrong? You okay?

211
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:50,779
I've been with Carl since was I was 18.

212
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:55,492
He's the only man I've, I've ever...
been with.

213
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,239
When everybody else was going 
to Woodstock,

214
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,993
the whole sexual revolution thing,

215
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:01,377
we were raising families.

216
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:02,981
I got pregnant when I was 20.

217
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,460
Yeah, same as Alison.
Well, 21.

218
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,355
Carl and I were just kids
when we met, I mean...

219
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,387
We don't even have anything 
in common anymore.

220
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:15,314
Maybe that's why he cheats on me.

221
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,869
Alison and I haven't had sex 
in over two and a half years.

222
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:24,843
I'm sorry. I'm telling you things 
you don't want to hear.

223
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:28,865
No, no, it's just I-I didn't know that, 
that other people...

224
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,726
Yeah.

225
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:34,928
- Bill?
- Yes, Libby.

226
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:40,161
You ever feel like we missed out on things?

227
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,177
Maybe it's not too late.

228
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:03,378
So how'd your wife feel 
about your newfound soulmate?

229
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:05,813
What the hell am I protecting her for?

230
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:07,715
We're divorced 25 years.

231
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:08,749
Okay.

232
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,537
After that key party,

233
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:14,215
Alison took the angry, 
cynical thing to a whole new level.

234
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:16,457
She became downright hostile.

235
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:20,220
That Cadillac was the family car.
Alison drove it mostly.

236
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,669
So the happy face keychain?

237
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,140
Wasn't mine.

238
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,016
It was hers.

239
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,525
Alison Huxley?

240
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,151
You're new here.

241
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:42,608
I know just the class
to open up your chakras.

242
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:44,111
My chakras can't wait.

243
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:46,483
We're here about Libby Bradley.

244
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:49,782
Oh, real tragedy, that.

245
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:52,153
It threw all of us into a tailspin.

246
00:14:52,153 --> 00:14:55,950
On the bright side, it put an end 
to her affair with your husband.

247
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:59,881
I wasn't happy Libby was 
banging my husband,

248
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:01,991
but somebody had to do it, right?

249
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:04,469
So... you knew about the affair?

250
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,467
Maybe you helped bring it to a close.

251
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:10,859
I was too blitzed to get out of bed
in the morning, never mind murder.

252
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,242
Bill said you were pretty angry.

253
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:14,251
Oh, and Bill's still an idiot.

254
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:17,135
I wasn't angry. I was depressed.

255
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:20,124
I was popping "Mother's Little Helpers"
by the fistful.

256
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:22,242
- Self-medicating.
- Bingo.

257
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:24,854
No one ever talked 
about depression back then.

258
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:27,401
We were just bored housewives.

259
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:29,953
So, why'd Libby have your car keys?

260
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:31,612
Don't ask me.

261
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:34,536
I wasn't the one driving that boat.

262
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,145
You are a stone fox.

263
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:44,091
Think we can sneak out of here?

264
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:47,798
Okay. Julie and I have 
an announcement to make.

265
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:52,630
Hot stuff? / You say it, Joey baby,
you're so dynamite with words.

266
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,493
The key party was, 
like, the coolest,

267
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:58,367
most far out thing 
that ever happened to us.

268
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:02,269
Right on. / We don't need a game
to do what comes naturally.

269
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,934
We decided to have an open marriage.

270
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:08,958
Pigs in a blanket?
Anyone?

271
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,174
They're from a box.
My mom's specialty.

272
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:13,001
Helen, please.

273
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:18,246
We're totally into it and we think 
you guys should be, too.

274
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:24,703
Our egos are liberated
from our fear of our own id.

275
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:26,246
What the hell are you people 
talking about?

276
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:30,312
Means Mr. Puka Beads here gets 
to dip his fondue fork in all our pots.

277
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:33,053
Jed, pour me another.

278
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:36,129
Wow, Mom, you actually
remember my name.

279
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,485
Well, that's one way to put it, Alison.

280
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:40,770
But yeah, sure.
I can dig it.

281
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,511
Maybe we should give it a try.

282
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:44,539
How 'bout you ease up on those martinis?

283
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:47,570
How about we quit pretending 
like our marriages mean anything?

284
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,228
That's the attitude 
I'm talking about.  / Oh.

285
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:54,053
You know, maybe I have had 
a little too much to drink.

286
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:57,041
I should go.
I'm really not feeling too hot.

287
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,337
You look fine to me.

288
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:00,842
Way too hot for a fifth grade teacher.

289
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:02,167
Why don't you stick around?

290
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,853
Oh, I think I'll be fine once 
I've had a good night's sleep.

291
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:08,213
Hey, Jed, why don't you give her
a ride home, buddy, would you?

292
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,904
More cheese for the rest of us.

293
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:19,669
Last time I saw those keys--

294
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:22,739
the night my hubby recruited our son
to help with his affair.

295
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:23,936
Help with his affair?

296
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:26,304
The whole I'm-not-feeling- well routine

297
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:29,740
was a ruse for them to meet 
while the rest of us got hammered.

298
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,572
Jed was their personal chauffeur.

299
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:35,861
You're kidding. / Wish I were. 
My son was an innoct bystander.

300
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:38,128
How'd you find out 
about this arrangement?

301
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:41,077
Well, I was drugged, not brain-dead.

302
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:46,049
Ask Jed. His memory was
a lot better than mine.

303
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,137
Chauffeuring your father's mistress,

304
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:55,750
not exactly an ideal childhood.

305
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,684
Whose was?

306
00:17:57,684 --> 00:17:59,276
Got a point there.

307
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:04,455
Still, not many fathers asking their kids 
to get involved like that.

308
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:06,272
Make you upset?

309
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,555
Your dad running around like that?

310
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:13,070
I was a lonely kid,

311
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,376
sort of caught in nowhere land.

312
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:17,983
- Meaning?
- I was happy to do it.

313
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,074
Because I got something out of it, too.

314
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:22,913
- What's that? 
- A friend.

315
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:33,491
- You know, Mrs. Bradley...
- Libby. Please, I'm not that ancient.

316
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:36,107
You were, like, my favorite teacher 
in fifth grade.

317
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:38,145
All that stuff you taught us 
about astronomy?

318
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:39,877
I'm, I'm totally into it now.

319
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:41,845
Well, that's nice, Jed.

320
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,744
There's so much going on out there.

321
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:49,183
The universe is expanding.
Here it's just...

322
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:51,829
it's always the same.

323
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:54,178
Ah, here's not that bad.

324
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:57,540
Yeah.
It kind of is.

325
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:02,680
You've got your whole life ahead of you.
You can do anything that you want.

326
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:07,067
Just don't wait until it's too late.

327
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:09,847
Like you did?

328
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:12,668
Yeah. Right.

329
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:20,731
There's an eclipse coming.

330
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:22,432
That's right.

331
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:26,590
- They say it's like once-in-a-lifetime.
- Ah, true. It is beautiful.

332
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,724
But you can't even look at them.
You'll go blind.

333
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,408
You can with a pinhole camera.

334
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:37,502
Oh, yeah, you showed us in class.
Mine fell apart.

335
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:41,155
How about I help you make a new one?

336
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,938
Okay.
Thanks.

337
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:54,901
Um, and I can teach you
to drive if you want.

338
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:56,773
About time I learned.

339
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:01,003
Oh, here, um,
take your own set.

340
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:04,607
- You planning to walk home? 
- Oh, no, I...

341
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:06,529
I got a spare.

342
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:11,269
- Um, you know, Mrs. Bradley...
- Libby.

343
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:13,063
Oh.

344
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:16,442
I know about you and my dad.

345
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:18,488
- Jed. 
- No, no, it's cool.

346
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:23,342
Really, because he 
and my mom don't really talk.

347
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:27,401
Your dad's a special kind of guy.

348
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:29,705
Once-in-a-lifetime?

349
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:31,479
Yeah.

350
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:35,894
See you soon, Jed.

351
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:39,083
Bye.

352
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,964
Once a week, I'd take her driving

353
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,136
and we'd talk about astronomy.

354
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:48,312
Got close.

355
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:52,412
Jed. Libby ever mention someone 
she might have been afraid of?

356
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:57,042
You know, a few times 
after our lessons,

357
00:20:57,042 --> 00:21:01,070
I'd drop her at her house 
and he'd be waiting.

358
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,860
Who?

359
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,737
Joe Livingston.

360
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:07,657
Dr. Free Love
was hot for Libby?

361
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:11,621
Seemed that way. Always there 
when Mr. Bradley wasn't around.

362
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:14,498
Never thought to mention 
that back in '79?

363
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:19,240
Everyone said it was 
a homeless person.

364
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:23,948
Right?

365
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:36,275
Scotty.

366
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:39,935
Since when do you smoke?

367
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,686
Bad habit.

368
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:46,763
What are you doing here?

369
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:49,485
Something came up.

370
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:53,296
- Something like what?
- With that Coach Fitzpatrick thing.

371
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:55,145
What the hell is wrong
with you, Scotty? / Just listen.

372
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:56,381
No. No. I told you 
I've got nothing to do...

373
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,661
Jimmy Donohue killed himself.

374
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:02,050
What?

375
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:06,562
You gotta tell them, Mike.

376
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:07,974
I'm going inside.

377
00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:10,179
Hey, you're on the same road as Jimmy
unless you say something.

378
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:11,945
Get off of me.

379
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:16,768
- I know what happened.
- You shut up.

380
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:20,000
You didn't come home.
So I went to the gym. / Shut up!

381
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,458
You always came home at 6:00,
so I went to find you.

382
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,713
Swear to God, 
you don't shut your mouth...

383
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:27,361
- I saw you in his office. 
- You don't know what you saw.

384
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:30,296
- I saw what he was doing! 
- Shut up!

385
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:33,908
I saw what Coach Fitz was 
doing to you. / Shut up!

386
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:36,157
I never told no one.

387
00:22:36,644 --> 00:22:38,474
I...

388
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:41,390
I let you down, Mike.

389
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:45,314
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:57,816 --> 00:23:01,609
- Heard you were a free love swinger-type, Joe.
- Still am.

391
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:04,524
Also heard you were trying to get 
in Libby Bradley's bell bottoms.

392
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:05,457
Come again?

393
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:08,192
Why else camp out
on her doorstep 24/7?

394
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:11,180
She was a foxy lady. 
I wanted a piece of the pie.

395
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,065
Can you blame me?

396
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:15,678
And when she told you to take 
your puka beads and shove 'em,

397
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:16,821
maybe you killed her.

398
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:20,540
Lots of fish in the sea back then.
Now, too.

399
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,757
Not much of an alibi, Joe.

400
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:27,055
The day Libby was killed, Julie and I 
were joining the Mile-High Club

401
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:28,983
first class to Waikiki.

402
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:30,877
I'll check that out.

403
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:33,834
Bottom line:

404
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:37,363
Libby turned me down; 
I moved on to greener pastures.

405
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:39,726
- Too bad she couldn't.
- What do you mean?

406
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:43,330
Took her little affair too seriously.
She thought Bill was the answer.

407
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,078
I'm guessing he wasn't?

408
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:49,386
She found out the hard way 
at Helen's Sweet 16 party.

409
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:05,311
And at our next lesson,
I'll teach you how to parallel park.

410
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,472
My dad, he's just...
He doesn't mean it.

411
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,351
dance with me

412
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,762
Just stop, would ya?

413
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,378
What's wrong?

414
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:30,738
You're crowding me, Libby.
Let me breathe.

415
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,070
You said that we had something special.

416
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,521
Yeah, yeah, we did.

417
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:36,656
- "Did"?
- I wanted to have fun.

418
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:39,470
But now you're just suffocating me.

419
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,084
I thought what we had was...

420
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:45,001
Was...what, Libby?

421
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:47,933
Once in a lifetime.

422
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:50,847
If you were going to fall in love

423
00:24:50,847 --> 00:24:53,234
I never would've climbed into the bed.

424
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:55,274
Oh.

425
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,121
I don't want another wife.

426
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,227
Sorry.

427
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:14,595
Mom.

428
00:25:57,969 --> 00:25:59,994
You okay?

429
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,055
- What the hell is your problem?
- Leave me alone.

430
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:03,683
You're embarrassing me,
acting like a fool.

431
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:06,473
You're the one that started all this 
wanting to spice up the marriage.

432
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:08,338
- Well, now I don't.
- Too late. Shut up. We're going home.

433
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:09,869
Take it easy, man.
You're hurting her.

434
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:12,894
- It's too late to go home.
- I told you to shut up! Let's go!

435
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:22,045
So Carl wanted to go back 
to the way it was.

436
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:23,737
It was too late.

437
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:25,683
Genie was already out of the bottle.

438
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:28,573
I'd never seen him lose 
his cool like that.

439
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:29,974
When was this party?

440
00:26:29,974 --> 00:26:32,576
The night before Libby was killed.

441
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,505
Real ugly fight,

442
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:39,152
night of your daughter's party.

443
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:40,999
Night before your wife died, in fact.

444
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:45,933
You couldn't control her anymore 
and you like control.
Don't you, Carl?

445
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:48,294
It doesn't mean that I killed Libby.

446
00:26:48,294 --> 00:26:49,806
Lot of times that's how it happens.

447
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:52,071
Wife changes on you, you go nuts.

448
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:55,789
- I did not kill my wife!
- Never heard that before.

449
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:59,009
I told you.
I was at work all day.

450
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:00,941
Three-martini lunches back then.

451
00:27:00,941 --> 00:27:03,410
Plenty of time to duck out and do murder.

452
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:09,064
Libby wanted a divorce.
And I didn't.

453
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:11,393
Never mentioned that back in the day.

454
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:12,998
Well, I knew how it would look.

455
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,498
It would've put a serious crack 
in that perfect image of yours.

456
00:27:15,498 --> 00:27:16,991
Big house. Beautiful wife...

457
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:18,899
Not to mention a motive for murder.

458
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:20,926
I tried to talk her out of it.

459
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:24,207
Till I saw the damage we were doing.

460
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:27,829
The person who was 
suffering the most.

461
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:29,464
Who was that?

462
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:31,660
Our daughter.

463
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,835
We're not going to make it, Carl.

464
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,400
You don't just walk out 
on a marriage.

465
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,888
Why?

466
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:46,460
It's not what people do.

467
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:53,264
I've been doing what people told me 
my whole life. I'm sick of it.

468
00:27:54,184 --> 00:27:55,741
We built a life together.

469
00:27:55,741 --> 00:28:00,025
No, you built it, Carl.
I was just along for the ride.

470
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:02,179
You're leaving me for Bill?

471
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,359
No, this has nothing to do with him.
Not anymore.

472
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,752
I've always been scared to be alone.

473
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:17,252
But maybe not anymore.

474
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:20,814
Maybe we can both make it on our own.

475
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:35,316
See what you did?

476
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,705
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

477
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:41,707
You humiliated me!
In front of the whole world!

478
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:45,841
- What the hell were you trying to do?
- I hate my life! I hate both of you!

479
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:47,677
Get away from me! 
Don't touch me!

480
00:28:47,677 --> 00:28:50,018
- Helen, enough! 
- Give me your hand!

481
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:52,579
You're sleeping with our neighbors.

482
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:55,128
You're a joke, you know that?
Just a common whore!

483
00:28:55,128 --> 00:28:57,087
- Helen, please. 
- Don't touch me!

484
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,187
You come near me and I swear to God 
I will kill you!

485
00:29:00,187 --> 00:29:03,705
- Helen, put that down.
- I swear to God!

486
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:05,512
I will.

487
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,078
No suicide attempt on record.

488
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:16,921
It was a family secret.

489
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,132
Now Helen picked up an ice pick?

490
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,200
Yeah. Why?

491
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,529
Could've caused a puncture wound.

492
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,978
Probably didn't go to school
the next day. / Of course she did.

493
00:29:25,978 --> 00:29:28,569
After a traumatic night like that?

494
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,029
Wh-- what exactly are you implying?

495
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:35,016
Your daughter was home 
the day Libby was murdered.

496
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:36,492
That's crazy.

497
00:29:36,492 --> 00:29:39,625
Explains why she's been
hounding us all these years.

498
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:42,427
Maybe she was looking to get caught.

499
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,351
We spoke to your father, Helen.

500
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,191
Know about your suicide attempt.

501
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:51,656
And the fight with your mom.
Night before she was killed.

502
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:54,111
What are you saying?

503
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:57,701
Your mother embarrassed you 
in front of all your friends.

504
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:59,602
Bad enough you wanted to die.

505
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:02,800
That state of mind make 
you do crazy things.

506
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,453
You should have told me, Helen.

507
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:08,585
I couldn't.

508
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:11,863
I was so ashamed.

509
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,054
The day after the party,

510
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:19,396
we were in the house together alone--
my mom and me.

511
00:30:19,396 --> 00:30:20,992
Go on.

512
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:24,186
She tried to talk to me.

513
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:27,859
And I just pushed her away.

514
00:30:28,428 --> 00:30:31,679
When all she wanted to do 
was make things right.

515
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:58,224
We need to talk about last night, Helen.

516
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,538
I don't want to talk to you.

517
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:06,419
How about I talk?

518
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:10,617
You just listen. Okay?

519
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:17,664
I'm sorry for how I acted
these last few months.

520
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:21,669
I haven't been much of a mother to you.

521
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,072
I don't care, Mom.

522
00:31:24,072 --> 00:31:27,233
Helen, please. Just listen. Okay?

523
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,188
All my life...

524
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:34,053
I've been somebody's daughter or wife.

525
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:37,851
Always someone else's somebody.

526
00:31:37,851 --> 00:31:41,197
I never had the chance to just...

527
00:31:41,197 --> 00:31:43,586
be me.

528
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:50,604
But what you did last night made me
realize what is truly important to me.

529
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:53,760
You.

530
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:57,868
I don't need a man.

531
00:31:57,868 --> 00:32:00,830
But I need my little girl.

532
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:07,366
You can't act like that anymore.

533
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:09,687
You're the grown-ups, not us.

534
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:14,324
I promise you things are going to change.

535
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:18,213
I just want my mom back.

536
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:20,938
- I'm right here.
- No.

537
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:28,350
I just need to be alone. Okay?

538
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,269
Okay.

539
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:42,309
You're my once-in-a-lifetime.

540
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:45,115
I don't even know what that means.

541
00:32:45,115 --> 00:32:47,182
You will.

542
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:09,563
Cardboard box and tinfoil?

543
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:11,714
Where was she going 
with those things?

544
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:13,470
I-I don't know.

545
00:33:18,845 --> 00:33:22,063
That was the way I treated my mother

546
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:25,384
the last time I saw her.

547
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,069
She knew you loved her, Helen.

548
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:35,591
16-year-old acting out
doesn't fool anyone.

549
00:33:43,707 --> 00:33:47,674
Know what you can make 
with a cardboard box and tinfoil?

550
00:33:48,182 --> 00:33:49,725
Mm, I give up.

551
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:51,563
Pinhole camera.

552
00:33:52,212 --> 00:33:53,977
I'm supposed to know what that is?

553
00:33:53,977 --> 00:33:56,549
It's used to watch an eclipse.

554
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:59,694
Only other thing you need to make it
is a sharp object.

555
00:33:59,694 --> 00:34:01,660
- Like an ice pick. 
- Right.

556
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,620
The day Libby was killed, 
February 26, 1979,

557
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,267
there was a total solar eclipse.

558
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:10,535
Which Jed wanted to see.

559
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:13,209
Let's bring him in to talk about.

560
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,338
Excuse me

561
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:23,695
Hey.

562
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:26,148
Hey.

563
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:39,334
I been thinking about 
what you said the other day.

564
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:41,977
- Letting me down. 
- Forget about it.

565
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:44,948
That wasn't your fault.

566
00:34:45,595 --> 00:34:49,913
- You know. 
- Yeah. I know.

567
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:54,941
So let's do it.

568
00:34:57,884 --> 00:35:00,041
Let's put this guy away.

569
00:35:34,825 --> 00:35:37,505
Ever get around to seeing 
that eclipse, Jed?

570
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,939
What eclipse?

571
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:41,276
The one Libby promised to show you.

572
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:45,459
Libby...
didn't promise me that.

573
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:48,266
Oh, that's too bad.

574
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:51,416
Once-in-a-lifetime thing to see.

575
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:53,287
Right.

576
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,288
Your mom told us you were 
in the woods that day,

577
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:00,437
watching the eclipse.

578
00:36:00,437 --> 00:36:02,218
She couldn't have known that.

579
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:04,941
My parents never knew where I was.

580
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:07,841
So you were out in the woods.

581
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:10,268
Well, I...

582
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:13,273
went out there, but not near Libby.

583
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:17,077
I mean... not where she was found.

584
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:20,788
So if you weren't out there watching 
the eclipse, what were you doing?

585
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:23,940
Musta been confusing.

586
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,552
Parents acting like kids.

587
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,411
And where'd that leave you?

588
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,164
I was fine.

589
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:34,165
Fine?
Driving your dad's mistress around?

590
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:38,287
Pouring their drinks while they talked 
about open marriage and key parties?

591
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:40,999
Dirty dancing with your fifth-grade teacher?

592
00:36:41,536 --> 00:36:45,298
I was 15, that would've 
screwed me up good.

593
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:50,112
It was like they forgot we were there.

594
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:51,976
But you were there.

595
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,181
Listening to every word they said.

596
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:56,586
Watching everything they did.

597
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:59,151
We were just kids.

598
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,174
They took that all away.

599
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,583
What they did to you was wrong.

600
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:09,702
What Libby did to you was wrong.

601
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:13,049
Talking to me...

602
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:15,384
dancing with me like that.

603
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:18,809
So when she met you in the woods...

604
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:20,748
I...

605
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,261
I thought she wanted more.

606
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:36,291
Libby, I didn't think 
you were going to show.

607
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,314
You must be freezing.

608
00:37:38,314 --> 00:37:43,113
Here. / I wasn't sure, you know, I mean...
after last night with you and my dad.

609
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:47,366
Oh, that has nothing to do with us, Jed.
I'd promised you I'd show you this.

610
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:50,442
When are we going driving again?

611
00:37:54,785 --> 00:37:59,001
Look. You have been a great teacher.

612
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:01,458
But I need to give these back to you.

613
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:04,595
I don't get it.

614
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:06,733
I can't meet you anymore.

615
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:09,911
- Why? Did I do something wrong?
- No, no.

616
00:38:09,911 --> 00:38:14,344
- So why are you... 
- I need more time with Helen.

617
00:38:14,344 --> 00:38:16,077
But what about me?

618
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:17,377
What do you mean?

619
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:21,669
Dancing last night... that blew me away. 
I mean, it was hot.

620
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:24,152
And now that you and my dad are done...

621
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:25,827
What?

622
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:28,230
You and me can. You know.

623
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,369
Jed, that's not...
I never meant to give you that idea.

624
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:35,048
But I make you laugh.

625
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:37,937
And on our driving lessons sometimes
you touch my hand.

626
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:39,925
No, Jed, that's not what I meant.

627
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:41,447
But you held me against you.

628
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:43,455
You turned me on, on purpose.

629
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,581
- I have to go. I'm sorry.
- Don't walk away from me.

630
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:47,903
Jed, you're a kid.
We're friends. That's all.

631
00:38:47,903 --> 00:38:51,185
We have something heavy, okay.
Our egos are liberated and...

632
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:55,229
- I want to get it on with you.
- Jed, stop!

633
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:58,994
You did it with my father.
What's wrong with me?

634
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:01,831
- Jed, stop. 
- You promised.

635
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:03,685
You promised.

636
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,159
Mrs. Bradley?

637
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,422
