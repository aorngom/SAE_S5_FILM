00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
THE FOLLOWING STORY IS FICTIONAL AND DOES
NOT DEPITC ANY ACTUAL PERSON OR EVENT.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,600
Mr. Caceres
is looking at car theft,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,800
assault, eluding police.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Your Honor, Alex
is a good kid.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,400
Mr. Caceres
was in front of this court

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,000
on drug trafficking charges
less than six months ago.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,200
Because he was forced to mule drugs
for his previous foster parents.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,700
His father's been incarcerated
since he was an infant.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,100
His mother and his brother
were killed two years ago.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,600
If you could just
let Alex explain.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,100
30 seconds, Mr. Caceres.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,300
Judge...

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,300
Your-your Honor... sir...

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,200
I... I took my foster father's
car for a ride.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,600
I-I know I was wrong. Just...

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,600
needed to get away.

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,700
Does that explain your
foster father's broken wrist ?

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,500
He tried to hit me.
I got scared, moved out of the way.

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,100
The DA recommends
a suspended sentence.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,700
I'm not so inclined.

21
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,300
Mr. Caceres needs to learn

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,800
the consequences of his actions.

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,500
Your Honor,

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,200
I have a decorated
police detective

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,100
ready to testify on behalf
of Alex's character.

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,100
He must be running
a little late.

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,100
So am I.

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,900
18 months at Havenhurst Academy.

29
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,200
Approach the bench,
Mr. Caceres.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,500
<i>"In this world" by Moby.</i>

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,200
It's over ?

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,700
Hang 'Em High Harry
never goes past two minutes.

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,900
- Where were you ?
- I got caught up.

34
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Don't tell me.

35
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,100
Alex...

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,200
It's cool,
Detective Valens.

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,600
They're taking me
to this Havenhurst place.

38
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,900
Can't be worse
than foster care, right ?

39
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,300
Hey, look, I'm going to talk
to the judge.

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,900
Hey, Alex.

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
I got your back, okay ?

42
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,500
Jamal wouldn't step off.

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,900
Up in Franco's grill.

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,000
Franco put two in his.
Bam, bam.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,300
Just left him there.

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,100
Colorful story, Michael.

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,800
The thing is,
Jamal was shot in the chest.

48
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,000
Booked the doer last week.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It wasn't Franco.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,900
Look, you're up on petty theft.
I mean, doing three months.

51
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,900
Why yank our chain ?

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,500
They're sending me
to Havenhurst. I can't go back.

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,900
We're homicide, not concierge.

54
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,500
You don't help,
going to be a homicide-- mine.

55
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,600
They'll do me
like they did Alex.

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
Alex who ?

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,600
Caceres.

58
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
Hey, that was an accident.

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,500
You know who he's talking about?

60
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,700
Said he slipped.

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,200
But I found him.

62
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,800
Bruises all over.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,700
Wrists had marks
like he was tied up.

64
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,200
I read the coroner's report.
There was nothing
about bruising.

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I know what I saw.

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,900
You're saying someone
at Havenhurst

67
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,500
killed him and made it look
like an accident ?

68
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,000
He talked about you.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Hey, you make up that crap
about Jamal to get me in the room ?

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Didn't even know
if you'd remember him.

71
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,600
Yeah, well, I do, so talk.

72
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,600
I ain't saying another word

73
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
unless you're going to keep me
out of Havenhurst.

74
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
Got your back, Michael.

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,100
Said the same thing to Alex,

76
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,100
and look what happened to him.

77
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,500

Jurisprudence

80
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,600
Alex died
of a subdural hematoma.

81
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,000
Havenhurst said it
was an accident.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
- Well, accidents happen.
- Yeah, well, this one happens

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
in the middle of the night--
no one heard a thing.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,700
The next morning,
they moved him out of his room

85
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,100
- before the cops got there.
- Wasn't it investigated ?

86
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Yeah. M.E. called it a slip and fall,
and that's that.

87
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,600
Thing is, M.E. was a hack.

88
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,700
Scotty, overtime has
been cut to the bone.

89
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,600
Deputy Commissioner is
breathing down my neck.

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Oh, come on, boss.

91
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,200
You're going to let
a tool bag like Doherty

92
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
back you off a case ?

93
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,900
- I don't see a case here.
- Well, I didn't, either,

94
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,000
till I found the autopsy photos.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,300
I'd never
seen them before.

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,300
The bruising consistent
with a physical altercation.

97
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,000
These marks on the wrists
look like restraints.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're thinking abuse.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
It wouldn't
be the first.

100
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
I mean, you know-- uh...

101
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,700
private facilities like this
are barely regulated.

102
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,300
Should have looked closer
back then.

103
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
What does this kid mean
to you, Scotty ?

104
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,200
A few years back in Narcotics,

105
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,100
Alex's mother
was going to testify

106
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,600
against a dealer
in a case of mine.

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,500
Detective V, what's it take

108
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,300
to get a snack around here ?

109
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,200
If I can't get some change
for the vending machine,

110
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,600
I'm gonna sue
for police brutality.

111
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Uh, I'm just playing.

112
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,000
You know I got much love

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,300
- for Philly's finest.
- Alex.

114
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,900
Something happened.

115
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,900
His mom and ten-year-old brother
were killed in a drive-by.

116
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,900
I transferred out of Narco.

117
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Tried to look after Alex, but...

118
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,900
You sure this isn't
the guilt talking, Scotty ?

119
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,000
A kid like Michael's been
in the worst facilities,

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,300
and Havenhurst terrifies him.

121
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,100
I mean, something's up.

122
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,200
All right, on the QT, Scotty.

123
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,100
Keep it small.

124
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,300
<i>We don't think of our kids
as offenders.</i>

125
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,500
They need a chance
to work out their problems.

126
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,700
We give them a voice.

127
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,000
How's that working out ?

128
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,000
Seven percent improvement
on recidivism rates

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,300
compared to the state for
half of what they spend.

130
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,400
Minimal oversight,
too, right?

131
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,700
Regulation never kept
a kid out of jail.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
State rewards us

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,500
with more cutbacks
and more kids.

134
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Can't turn them away.

135
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,200
We're trying to help.

136
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, how about Alex Caceres ?

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
You able to help him ?

138
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,700
Alex Caceres.

139
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,700
Yeah, that was a
terrible accident.

140
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,000
We're looking
into that.

141
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,300
What do you mean ?

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean, he slipped in his room,
trying to open a window.

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
AC was on the fritz.

144
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,000
The cops never
got a look

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,700
at the body 'cause you moved it
before they got here.

146
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,100
Wasn't a body to me.

147
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,500
We moved him to
the infirmary,

148
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,000
trying to save his life.

149
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,300
Who has access
to the rooms at night ?

150
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,700
Just the counselors.

151
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,900
Counselors...
that like a guard ?

152
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,400
Um, "guard" sends
the wrong message.

153
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,900
"Counselor" is much better.

154
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,900
Laticia Myers
oversaw Alex's dorm.

155
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,300
She still works here.

156
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,700
You ever use restraints
on the kids ?

157
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,200
Never on a kid
like Alex.

158
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,500
He was pretty well-behaved.

159
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,900
Any other kids have a problem
with him or... ?

160
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,000
I wish I could
tell you more.

161
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,100
Alex wasn't here for very long.

162
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,800
This happened five years ago.

163
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,200
- Why are you guys here now?
- New information.

164
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,100
We'll need a list of all staff
and teachers from 2004.

165
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700
Employment records,

166
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
security logs, time cards.

167
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Whatever you need.

168
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,500
Only a matter a time before
something like that happened.

169
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,800
Your boss says the
place runs smooth.

170
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,600
You got the song and dance
from Mr. Price ?

171
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,300
All the "Kumbaya" crap?

172
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,300
It ain't true?

173
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Place is understaffed,
over capacity.

174
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,500
Add kids who've never had
adult supervision...

175
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,400
you do that math.

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,100
A lot of pressure
on you counselors.

177
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,700
Keep your hands
to yourself, Alberto !

178
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,400
I mean now.

179
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,800
I came up Third and Diamond.
I'm used to
boys like this.

180
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,800
Alex was killed in his room.

181
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
It possible another kid
could have done it?

182
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,600
Place like this,
doesn't take much to set it off.

183
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,400
Lights out is 9:45.

184
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,200
I catch you out of bed,
it's detention.

185
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,600
Catch you in the common room,
it's detention.

186
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,200
I catch you in the bathroom...

187
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,000
it's detention.

188
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,800
You don't mess with me.

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,300
I don't mess with you.

190
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,800
You do, I take you down.

191
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500

192
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,800
Open the door
right now!

193
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,500
Give me this
backpack, man.

194
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,100
Look what we got here.

195
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,400
Give it back !

196
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,200
Oh, you wanted that ?

197
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,900
My bad, man.

198
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,100
I didn't even know.

199
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Belongs to him, King Kong.

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,900
What you call me ?
You call me a monkey, homes ?

201
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,100
Sure smell like one, bro.

202
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,700
I'm gonna knock
your little smart-ass

203
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
Puerto Rican head in half.
How about that?

204
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Ray-Ray !

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Get up ! Get up right now !

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,500
- Man, get off of me, man.
- Stop!

207
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,600
Come on, Alex.

208
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,600
It's over, boys.
It's over.

209
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,400
We're going to
talk this out.

210
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,500
Evan had a conference with them.

211
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,800
Made them shake hands.

212
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,500
Sent them back
in time for lunch.

213
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,800
This Ray-Ray...
type to hold a grudge ?

214
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,600
Miracle Alex lasted
as long as he did.

215
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Ray-Ray.

216
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,000
Big, bad stickup boy on parole
after serving a deuce upstate.

217
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
Yet you got a library card ?

218
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,400
All right, all right.

219
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,600
Be a gentleman.

220
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
Darleen...

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Lydia...

222
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,500
Marissa.

223
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,300
Just...
breaking hearts all over South Philly.

224
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,600
What you doing, man?

225
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Tell us about Alex Caceres.

226
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,600
Who ?

227
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
Played you in front of your boys
day he got to Havenhurst.

228
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,300
Lived in the same dorm.

229
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Till he woke up dead
in his room one morning.

230
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,200
I don't know nothing about that.

231
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,600
Adios, Darleen.

232
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,500
Lydia.

233
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,500
Ooh, Marissa.

234
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,200
Marissa ? No.
Can you leave that one?

235
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,500
Look, man, I ain't got
nothing to hide, man.

236
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,900
All right ? Me and Alex
was tight, for reals.

237
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,300
<i>"Get by" by Talib Kweli.</i>

238
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,800
Hey, man, I'm outside waiting
on my ride, right ?

239
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,900
Cops roll up before I can even
empty my pockets, dog.

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,300
Got me on felony weight, man.

241
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,500
Looking at some
serious time, man.

242
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Ain't you got a younger cousin ?

243
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Say what ?

244
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
You get a little kid
to deliver your product.

245
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
They do what you tell
them 'cause they scared.

246
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,700
And if they're caught,
they can't do serious time.

247
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,100
Man, how do you know that?

248
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,000
Lived it.

249
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,700
Can't throw a punch,
but you're smart.

250
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
Heard you was the one got open
the window in your room.

251
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Been trying out
for a month, man.

252
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,100
I almost broke my hand
trying to work the hinge.

253
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,700
Ain't about muscle.

254
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,200
It's finesse.

255
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,400
You stealing from me, boy?

256
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,000
Sit your ass back down.

257
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,400
Take from me again,

258
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,200
I'll pull your arm
right out of the socket.

259
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
The look in Jimmy's eyes.

260
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,300
We all knew he'd been upstate.

261
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,200
This Jimmy get rough
with the kids ?

262
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,800
Look, man,
that place was a joke to me.

263
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,900
Except Jimmy.
Him, I took serious.

264
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Oh, sorry, Dad.

265
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,500
I got caught up.

266
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,000
No, no.

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Tomorrow works.

268
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Same time. Bye.

269
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
Oh, no. You didn't have
to cancel your plans.

270
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
Partner's right ?

271
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
Share the load ?

272
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,000
Well, the files are a mess.

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,200
Employment records mixed
with offender intake forms.

274
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,700
I mean, nothing's where
it's supposed to be.

275
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,800
Well, I did find this.

276
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,900
Criminal record for our shop
teacher-- Jimmy Clarke.

277
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,399
Picked up his prison stare

278
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,900
in New Jersey State Pen.

279
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,400
Seven years
for ag assault.

280
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,700
Nearly killed a guy
with the butt of his gun.

281
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,100
How's an ex-con like this get
hired to teach at Havenhurst?

282
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Well, not a long
line of applicants.

283
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,900
No pay, no benefits,
no background check.

284
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,000
No problem.

285
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,800
Yeah.

286
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
It's a gold Mercury Sable

287
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,400
registered
to a Maurice Kitchener.

288
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Whatever you need,
I'll back you up.

289
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,800
Okay.

290
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,100
Deputy Commissioner
Doherty.

291
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,300
Trying to introduce myself

292
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,500
to all the detectives
under my command.

293
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,800
Miller, right?
Used to work Narcotics?

294
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,100
- That's right.
- You the one who opened

295
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,100
this Alex Caceres can of worms ?

296
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That'd be me, Pat.

297
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Just can't help yourself, John.

298
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Got to find new ways
to piss me off ?

299
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,000
Keeps me busy
during the slow times.

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,900
Want to tell me why the hell
we're investigating an accidental death ?

301
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,800
What's it matter to you
what cases we take ?

302
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,000
We need closed cases,
not whodunits.

303
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,000
You let me worry about closing them.
You can always take the credit.

304
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,700
I oversee the Detective Bureau
now, John.

305
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,800
Gonna have to get used to it.

306
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,500
You're shutting this
investigation down immediately.

307
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,900
We clear ?

308
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
I need to hear you say it, John.

309
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,300
We're clear.

310
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,200
Whatever you need
on the Alex Caceres job, you got it.

311
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Got anger management
issues, Jimmy ?

312
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,900
Meaning ?

313
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,400
You beat a guy to a bloody pulp
in a parking lot in Atlantic City.

314
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
Guy owed me money,

315
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,900
wanted to pay me back
with a crowbar.

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,500
I was protecting myself.

317
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,400
Did my time for it, too.

318
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,100
Why take a job
at a place like Havenhurst ?

319
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,100
When I went upstate,
I arned carpentry.

320
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,400
Figured that was something

321
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,000
I could give back
to these kids.

322
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,600
- A way out.
- Well,

323
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
an ex-con altruist.

324
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,500
Teaching street
kids they could use

325
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,400
their hands to build.

326
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,800
Give 'em pride.

327
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,700
Call it what you want.

328
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,100
What about trouble kids ?

329
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,100
Alex Caceres, for instance.

330
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,300
- This is about Alex ?
- Well, he stole from you, right ?

331
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,300
Like that guy in AC.

332
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,800
Nah, he just made a mistake.

333
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,600
We-we were cool.

334
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,400
Don't seem surprised
to hear his name

335
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,500
come from a homicide detective.

336
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Never believed it
was an accident.

337
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,300
Could have spoken up
back in the day.

338
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

339
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,600
Me and cops
don't get along too good.

340
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,600
You have access
to the dorms at Havenhurst ?

341
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,500
Rules were clear. I was only
allowed in the classroom area.

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
Where were you the night
Alex died ?

343
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,900
Working nights
in a hardware store

344
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,600
so I could afford supplies
for my shop class.

345
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,900
I was the only one looking out
for that kid.

346
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,400
Did a pretty lousy job
of it, Jimmy.

347
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Don't think I know that?

348
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,400
Eats me up every day.

349
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,500
Got any with nuts ?

350
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,100
Two dollars.

351
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,500
Yeah, not today, my man.

352
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,700
I can get other stuff, too.
Anything you want.

353
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,500
Just name it.

354
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,000
Acclimating yourself
like a pro, huh?

355
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,500
Gaming the system
prepares you for one thing--

356
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,700
becoming a repeat offender.

357
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,600
You a smart kid.

358
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
You need to put your mind
to something constructive.

359
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,800
Like what ?

360
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,200
Building birdhouses ?

361
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Do the time,
or the time does you.

362
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,600
Gonna tell me
to work the system ?

363
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,500
'Cause all the system done
for me

364
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,900
is take my family,

365
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,100
stick me in places
like this.

366
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,500
That's a raw deal, my man.

367
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,700
For real.

368
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
But you can't
keep it bottled in.

369
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,100
It festers in there.

370
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,400
Trust me, I know.

371
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Old picture.

372
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,600
Guess you don't see
him much anymore.

373
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,300
Don't say another word
about him.

374
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,400
Didn't mean nothing.

375
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,800
Let's keep it on you.

376
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,200
Why you got blood
on your shirt, hmm ?

377
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Come on, Alex !

378
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,300
Either you're getting beat,
or you're doing

379
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,700
I gots to go.

380
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,800
Figured he was getting bullied.

381
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,700
Tried a couple more times
to get through to him.

382
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,100
He wouldn't talk.

383
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,900
- Give up after that ?
- Of course not.

384
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,400
I called the only person
who might've actually helped.

385
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,700
His lawyer.

386
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,100
What do you want me to say ?

387
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,400
A lot of kids I used to
work with got hurt.

388
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
Many of them
reach out to you,

389
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,200
like Alex Caceres,
days before they died?

390
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,300
I don't know
what you're talking about.

391
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,000
Well, his shop
teacher, Jimmy Clarke,

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,300
called you, told you
Alex was in trouble.

393
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,000
We need to take you into interrogation ?
Jog your memory ?

394
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We have records,
show you visited

395
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,600
Alex at Havenhurst
the week he died.

396
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,700
I got out of this racket
for a reason.

397
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,500
So damn tragic all the time.

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,900
Jimmy said
Alex had blood on his shirt.

399
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
What was going on with him ?

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,500
Not what you think.

401
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,900
Jimmy thinks you're in trouble.

402
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,300
And he wouldn't go
through the hassle

403
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,100
of calling me unless
he thinks it's serious.

404
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,700
Alex, if the older boys
are bothering you,

405
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,200
we need to address that.

406
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,200
Have a conference.

407
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,200
Ain't no snitch.

408
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,400
It's not really snitching

409
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
if it's happening to you.

410
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,700
Why don't I get myself
a cup of coffee, hmm?

411
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,700
If someone's hurting you,
you've got to speak up.

412
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,500
Could be grounds
to get you out.

413
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Not me.

414
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,000
Someone else.

415
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,500
He's young like a runt.

416
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Getting beat every night.

417
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,800
Well, then he needs
to call his own lawyer.

418
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,100
His lawyer won't return
his calls.

419
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,400
He won't survive much longer.

420
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,300
Said you're here to help.

421
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm here to help you.

422
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,800
Then get him out of here.

423
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He's 11.

424
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,400
Lifted some comics,
got six months.

425
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,300
That sound right to you ?

426
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
Give me his name,
I'll look into it,

427
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
but no promises.

428
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,700
Michael. Michael Rodgers.

429
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,500
You'll like him.

430
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,400
I'll call his lawyer,
get into it.

431
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,900
- what's this mean, "juris..."
- "Jurisprudence"?

432
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,500
It's the legal system.

433
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,600
It ensures we get justice.

434
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,300
We all abide by it.

435
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,200
It's how I'm gonna help you.

436
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,800
Found Michael Rodgers's lawyer,

437
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,700
told him Michael
was having trouble,

438
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,500
made sure he petitioned
to have him transferred.

439
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,900
So, that's it ?

440
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,500
I was overwhelmed
with my own clients.

441
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
What was I supposed to do ?

442
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,600
Oh, maybe speak up when
Alex died three weeks later ?

443
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,900
Well, I didn't see you there,
either, Valens.

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,400
- Yeah.
- Or were you late again ?

445
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,000
Hey, I reached out to Alex.

446
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,100
Told him whatever he needed,
I'd be there.

447
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,300
But he pushed you away, right ?

448
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,000
Ever wonder why ?

449
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,500
Or does self-doubt cramp
your style ?

450
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,300
POLICE HEADQUARTERS

451
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Still on hold ?

452
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,800
Yeah. Trying to get
Michael out of J.D.C.

453
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,600
Court hasn't responded
to my request to move him, so...

454
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,700
Spoke to his lawyer
from back then.

455
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Petition to transfer Michael
from Havenhurst was denied.

456
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,100
Got to love the juvenile
justice system.

457
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,500
The weird thing is,
his lawyer says Michael

458
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,900
was transferred
a few days after Alex died.

459
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,400
Never knew why.

460
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,700
Well, maybe Michael
could fill in the blanks

461
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,500
if I can get ahold of him.

462
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
You know what that lawyer said ?

463
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,500
Marci ?

464
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
Hey, can't be everywhere
at once.

465
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Should have been there, though.

466
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,700
The system let him down,
not you.

467
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,000
All due respect, Lil.

468
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,300
It was me.

469
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,100
Look, you know,
go to your dinner.

470
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,300
I got this covered.

471
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,300
Yeah.

472
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,400
Yeah, I'm still here.

473
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,400
Wait. What-what do you mean,
he was processed ?

474
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,300
Michael's coming with me.

475
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:30,201
I can't let you
do that, Detective.

476
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
He's a key witness
in a homicide investigation.

477
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,900
You don't like it,

478
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,700
call the cops.

479
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Hey, um, yeah, bad news.

480
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,300
I-I got to work late again.

481
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,400
No. No, I'm fine, Dad.

482
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Okay.

483
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
All right, we'll do it
another time.

484
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,300
You, too.

485
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:03,601
********

486
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,900
Hi, it's Detective Rush
from Homicide.

487
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,100
Yeah, I'm going
to need help, um,
tracking a cell.

488
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,500
Lilly, one more step and
I'd have blown your head off.

489
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,600
Nice to see you, too, Saccardo.

490
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,800
You got nothing to eat?

491
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm in deep.

492
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,400
Don't usually entertain.

493
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,700
Well, I think for a stalker,

494
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,900
you could at least offer me
something to drink.

495
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,700
Well, it took you long enough
to trace those photos.

496
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,900
Well...

497
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,700
I'm a cop in my spare time.

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,300
I guess you missed me.

499
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
Not really.

500
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,100
But when I heard they let
Major Scumbag walk on bail...

501
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,100
I know.

502
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,400
I don't really
need you to...

503
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,700
Watch out for you ?

504
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,400
Just want to make sure I got
something to look forward to

505
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,700
when I surface.

506
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
We really gotta stop
meeting like this.

507
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Where is he now ?

508
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,000
Probably trying to get
the boot off his car.

509
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,600
Does that make you
feel better?

510
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
- It's a Band-Aid.
- So what're you going to do ?

511
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,800
What would you do ?

512
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,300
Situation like mine.

513
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,800
A guy like this ?

514
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,600
We'll figure
something out.

515
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,900
Seriously, though.

516
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm starving.

517
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,200
Well, let's go get some eggs.

518
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,800
Said I wanted a burger.

519
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,900
It's breakfast.

520
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,900
- What's it going to cost me ?
- I told you

521
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,000
I wouldn't let them take
you back to Havenhurst.

522
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,600
Kept my word, right ?
Do me a favor.

523
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,200
Eat the eggs.

524
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,200
After Alex died,
you got transferred out.

525
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,200
How'd that happen ?

526
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,100
See, you hustling me
this whole time.

527
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,900
You contacted me, remember ?
I'm seeing it through.

528
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,000
You gotta trust me.

529
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
- Alex trusted you.
- Yeah, you're right.

530
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,300
And I let him down.

531
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,300
Alex... deserved better.

532
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,800
Night Alex died...

533
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,800
he swore he was going to get me
out of Havenhurst.

534
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
He was trying to save me.

535
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
Save you, from what ?

536
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,300
They took me out of my room
after lights out.

537
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
I thought they was
going to kill me.

538
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,400
All right. Give me the names
of the kids.

539
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,000
Wasn't the kids I was afraid of.

540
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,000
Get off ! Now !

541
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Back to your room, Alex.
Ain't none of your concern.

542
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
I look out for him.
Supposed to be your job.

543
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,700
My job is keeping you in line.
Little punk's a thief.

544
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,200
- This about your damn keys?
- It's about something

545
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
he took from
the director's office.

546
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,700
A very expensive pen.

547
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,600
I-I didn't do it, Alex. I swear.

548
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,500
Gold. Fancy.

549
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,600
Says "Jurisprudence" on it.
I took it.

550
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,100
Get him down to
the infirmary!

551
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,600
I want to stay with you.

552
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
Get him out of here.

553
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,600
You're going to give me
that pen, Alex.

554
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,100
Or what, Ms. Myers ?

555
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
'Cause I'm done
giving in.

556
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,400
We'll see about that.

557
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,800
Laticia made every day hell
for me.

558
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,900
Then she turned on Alex.

559
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,600
Think she hurt Alex ?

560
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Alex gone, ain't he ?

561
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,500
Laticia's still there.

562
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,300
Still don't know why he stood up
for me like that.

563
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
Well, maybe...

564
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,500
he was doing for you what
no one ever did for him.

565
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,400
Thanks, Detective Valens.

566
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah, what for ?

567
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,800
The eggs.

568
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,700
I just got off the
phone with JDC.

569
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,500
One of your detectives kidnapped
a juvenile offender last night.

570
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Is that so ?

571
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,600
This ends now.

572
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,100
You're ordering me to back off
an open homicide investigation.

573
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,400
Maybe you're unaware,

574
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,200
since you've never worked
an active squad in your life,

575
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,900
but deputy commissioners don't
get personally involved in cases

576
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,700
unless there's something
to hide.

577
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,200
Budget cuts are a bitch, huh ?

578
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,500
Manpower shortages everywhere.

579
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Except here, John,
in Homicide.

580
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,562
There's an opening
on the midnight shift,

581
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,101
East Detectives.

582
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,300
Going to need you to sacrifice
one of your guys.

583
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,400
Not going to happen.

584
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
You pick.

585
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,700
Or I will.

586
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,200
I gotta tell ya,

587
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,000
Havenhurst employment
records are a mess.

588
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,100
Took us days find your file.

589
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,900
Sure glad we did.

590
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Looks like you applied
to the police academy

591
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,200
same time you applied
to Havenhurst.

592
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,300
Wanted to wear a badge ?

593
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,000
Carry a gun ?

594
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
I was looking to serve.

595
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,500
'Cause you're from Third
and Diamond, right ?

596
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,900
Tough street.

597
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,400
Whole neighborhood's tough.

598
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,900
Said you grew up with boys
like the ones at Havenhurst.

599
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Did you mean the Hernandez
brothers ?

600
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,100
Every cop in the 26th has
arrested one of those dirtbags

601
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,700
at some time or another.

602
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,900
Look back far enough
in their records,

603
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,100
your name comes up
as a complainant.

604
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,900
So ?

605
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,500
They attacked you, Laticia.

606
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,400
They dragged you
into their house.

607
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,900
Kept you there for hours.

608
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
You were 12.

609
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,600
I survived.

610
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,300
Must've affected you.

611
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,800
Being trapped.

612
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
Surrounded
by those animals.

613
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That's why you wanted
to be a cop.

614
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,800
But you got turned down.

615
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,800
Said I was unfit.

616
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,600
For psychological
reasons.

617
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,200
Didn't seem to be an issue
at Havenhurst.

618
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,300
You pitted those boys
against each other.

619
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,800
I didn't have a problem
with Alex.

620
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,700
It was Michael
who pissed you off.

621
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But Alex stood up to you,
the night he died.

622
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I told him to go back
to his room.

623
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,500
He cornered me, you understand ?

624
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,400
You weren't a counselor anymore.

625
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,100
You were that little girl
from Third and Diamond.

626
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,800
He wouldn't back down!

627
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Back off, Alex!

628
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,241
Or what ? Don't got
your posse now.

629
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:11,203
I'm warning you !

630
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,500
Nothing you could do to me
ain't already been done.

631
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
You hear me ?

632
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,000
Got one more chance.

633
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,200
Not going to hurt Michael
ever again !

634
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,000
What the hell you doing ?

635
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,200
She got those kids
beating Michael.

636
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,800
I don't care.

637
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
You don't put hands on
the staff, Alex.

638
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,500
Screw you.

639
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,900
Pretend to be one of us,
you're as bad as her.

640
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,700
You going back
to your room.

641
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,900
Man, you ain't my dad.

642
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,500
Can't even take care
of your own kid.

643
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,300
Should've seen Jimmy dragging
Alex back to his room.

644
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Last time
I saw the kid alive.

645
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,900
I thought Jimmy wasn't
authorized to be in the dorm.

646
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,600
He did handyman work
off the books.

647
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,800
Got him a key.

648
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,900
Didn't report any of this ?

649
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
Would've thanked him
if I had the chance.

650
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
What do mean ?

651
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Where'd he go ?

652
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
Disappeared after that night.

653
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,700
Out sick for a week.

654
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
There's no record of that.

655
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,000
Told you.

656
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,800
Those kids were animals.

657
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
Jimmy knew it.

658
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,200
Did us all a favor.

659
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,000
Think it's time
for a new profession, Laticia.

660
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,232
You are disappointing me, Jimmy.

661
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,896
The way you were talking
the other day, I started to believe.

662
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:29,107
Teaching those boys
self-respect through carpentry.

663
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:30,720
Just like Jesus.

664
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,036
Here's a fun fact
from your past.

665
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,528
Night you beat
that guy in A.C.,

666
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:37,652
your three-year-old
son was in the car.

667
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,880
Cops pull you over,
he's in the back.

668
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,904
They take your kid,
put him in the system.

669
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:44,599
Get out of lockup,
go straight to Havenhurst.

670
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,356
Just trying to make amends.

671
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:49,085
Be a positive influence
on all kind of kids.

672
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,995
As long as it wasn't your own.

673
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,240
When was the last time
you saw your kid, Jimmy ?

674
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,815
You don't know nothing
about it !

675
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,620
Record keeping at
Havenhurst is a mess.

676
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,262
Couldn't find your timecards.

677
00:31:00,462 --> 00:31:02,324
But your old boss at
the hardware store

678
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,050
keeps everything.

679
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,797
You were late
the night Alex died.

680
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,301
Got an eyeball witness
ready to testify

681
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,731
you got violent
with him.

682
00:31:10,731 --> 00:31:13,125
Puts you in his room
the night he was killed.

683
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,992
I know what Laticia think.

684
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,631
But I was trying to keep Alex
from flushing his future away.

685
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:21,571
He was way ahead of me, though.

686
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:25,449
You a damn fool !

687
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,270
Attacking counselors ?

688
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,229
That's a one-way
ticket upstate.

689
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,829
I'm the only one
willing to fight.

690
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:33,673
A fight you'll lose !

691
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:36,859
You afraid of them, ain't you ?

692
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,148
I'm not saying don't push.

693
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,605
I'm saying you gotta
handle it different.

694
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:44,124
Educate me, my man.

695
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,402
You're playing the game
with every disadvantage.

696
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,115
They outman you !

697
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,407
They outgun you !

698
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,820
You got one weapon.

699
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,950
You hear ? One !

700
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,510
Your mind.

701
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,000
<i>"Don't say nuthin' "
par The Roots.</i>

702
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:05,660
It's like what you said
about the...

703
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,607
the window to Ray-Ray.

704
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,936
You can't force it open.

705
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,929
You gotta finesse it.

706
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,400
"Jurisprudence" ?

707
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,339
What's that ?

708
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:31,814
System we all live under.

709
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,061
And it's broken.
I get it now.

710
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:35,646
That's why they keep
Michael here.

711
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,141
Nobody ever gets transferred out.
Ever notice that ?

712
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,605
Sick kids, psychos.

713
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:40,399
Nobody.

714
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,167
Every bed is full.

715
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,600
Always.

716
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,882
I don't know what
you're talking about.

717
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,205
Need you to do me a favor.

718
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,840
Get this to Detective
Scotty Valens.

719
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,747
A cop ?

720
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:50,434
Hey, whoa, whoa.
What's going on ?

721
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,224
Tell him to hold on to it,
please, Jimmy.

722
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:54,800
Trust me ?

723
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:57,472
All right.

724
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,964
Need one more favor.

725
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,401
Let me use the phone.

726
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,159
Main office was the only place
to make a call.

727
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,464
I left the door open
for him on my way out.

728
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,293
Know who
he was going to call ?

729
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,358
I didn't ask.

730
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,587
He said he needed me
to trust him.

731
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,332
I did.

732
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,553
What about the pen ?

733
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,893
You do anything with it ?

734
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:26,167
Alex was dead.

735
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,237
My prints was all over his room.

736
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,569
Waited in my place for a week
for the cops to come.

737
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,370
Never showed.

738
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,287
You still got that pen, Jimmy ?

739
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
I checked the Havenhurst
phone records

740
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,032
the night Alex died,

741
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,330
and a call was made
at half past midnight

742
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,105
to the private residence
of Harold Alvarez.

743
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,903
Judge "Hang 'em High Harry" ?

744
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,600
Just told the
boss, and he says

745
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,650
the judge and Deputy
Commissioner Doherty

746
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:01,671
are golf buddies.

747
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:05,572
Explains why Doherty's been
breathing down our necks.

748
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:07,045
He's protecting the judge.

749
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,211
So why did Alex need
to call the judge ?

750
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:14,000
Been searching the word
"jurisprudence"

751
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,800
and I still
can't figure out

752
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,122
what Alex was saying to me
with this pen.

753
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,300
Check out the judge, too.

754
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,336
Look, cross-checked

755
00:34:28,336 --> 00:34:30,296
the judge's name
with "jurisprudence."

756
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,039
Look what comes up.

757
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:39,739
Hey, Judge.

758
00:34:41,124 --> 00:34:43,421
I found this at Havenhurst

759
00:34:43,421 --> 00:34:44,546
a little while ago.

760
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:45,800
Figured you'd
want it back.

761
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,467
I've toured that facility
a few times.

762
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:48,405
I must have left it there.

763
00:34:48,405 --> 00:34:49,205
Thank you.

764
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,349
"Jurisprudence"...

765
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,256
it means "justice," right ?

766
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,510
It's also a luxury
ski cabin in Utah.

767
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,470
You own it with
your sister-in-law.

768
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,650
If you don't mind,
I'm running late.

769
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,606
Your sister-in-law's
an entrepreneur.

770
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:05,548
She owns nursing homes,
juvenile centers--

771
00:35:05,548 --> 00:35:07,080
Havenhurst, for one.

772
00:35:08,448 --> 00:35:12,228
So the state pays Havenhurst
for every kid sent there.

773
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,370
Havenhurst is owned
by your sister-in-law.

774
00:35:15,707 --> 00:35:16,307
She pays you...

775
00:35:16,307 --> 00:35:18,300
You will reconsider
what you're saying

776
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,101
if that badge means
anything at all to you.

777
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:21,468
It's incentive for
strict sentencing,

778
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:24,840
a reason to block transfers,
like Michael Rodgers.

779
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,993
Accusing me
of judicial misconduct ?

780
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,267
No... that's for the
Justice Department to sort out.

781
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:31,908
I'm accusing you of murder.

782
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,930
Alex Caceres.

783
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,502
I didn't kill that boy.

784
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,273
No, you're the type of guy,

785
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,304
has other people do the deed.

786
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,905
Give me a name.

787
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:46,790
I got records that put
you and Alex on the phone

788
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,062
the night he died.

789
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,212
I'll give you two minutes

790
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,848
to tell me who killed Alex.

791
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,703
The day of Alex's hearing,
I was late.

792
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,850
Should have been there.

793
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:08,415
But it didn't matter, did it ?

794
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,791
I could have been early, you
still would have sent Alex away

795
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,401
just to make a buck.

796
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,485
You know what ?
Screw it.

797
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:17,840
Turn around, Judge,
I'm locking you up.

798
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,684
Wait, wait.

799
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,661
The boy had my attention.

800
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,400
Hello.

801
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,303
<i>How do you sleep at night ?</i>

802
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,651
Who is this ?

803
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,573
<i>Sent me to Havenhurst
for a joyride.</i>

804
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:43,679
<i>Lot of other kids here
for less.</i>

805
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,360
Son, if you know
what's good for you,

806
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,630
you'll hang up this phone now.

807
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,434
<i>I know what "Jurisprudence" is.</i>

808
00:36:51,434 --> 00:36:53,240
<i>Even a delinquent can use
the Internet.</i>

809
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,290
<i>That's why you send us here...
for a fancy house ?</i>

810
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,065
Those are
some very serious accusations.

811
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:02,343
<i>Get away with it
'cause everyone listens to you.</i>

812
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:03,753
<i>But not us.</i>

813
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,783
What do you want from me, kid ?

814
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,463
<i>Get my friend Michael Rodgers
transferred tonight,</i>

815
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,329
<i>or I'll call the 11:00 news.</i>

816
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:18,514
<i>They'll listen to me.
Don't you ?</i>

817
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,200
<i>What are you doing, Alex ?</i>

818
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,600
<i>Hey, get off me.</i>
<i>Give me the phone now.</i>

819
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,333
It was supposed to be
a good facility.

820
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,174
Nobody should have gotten hurt.

821
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,613
Who took the phone from Alex ?

822
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,679
Who was it ?

823
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,697
You're the secret

824
00:37:42,154 --> 00:37:43,954
to Havenhurst's
success.

825
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,279
You come early,
stay late.

826
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,230
You're there weekends, holidays.

827
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,725
My work is my passion.

828
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:52,427
The problem is your passion

829
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:53,821
is a business.

830
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,900
We found this
in your apartment

831
00:37:57,701 --> 00:37:58,957
when we searched it.

832
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:01,800
You searched my apartment ?

833
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,908
Yeah, that's you
at Judge Alvarez's ski house.

834
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,009
You go every year.

835
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,753
Yeah, they're,
they're business trips.

836
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:09,748
That's not
how the judge put it.

837
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,918
He ain't going
to jail for you.

838
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:14,080
I mean, that's for sure.

839
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,971
You meant
well, Evan,

840
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:18,260
till you started hanging
with the big dogs,

841
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,071
seeing what money
could buy.

842
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,642
I'm not interested in money.

843
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,628
Yeah, if that was true,
you'd have put up a fight

844
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:30,172
every time the judge's family
cut your budget

845
00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:32,100
or stuck you with bad staff
or too many kids.

846
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,264
I tried.

847
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,746
Nobody would listen.

848
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:41,654
We... we searched your office,
too, Evan.

849
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,213
Yeah, thing
about Luminol--

850
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,102
no matter how long
the blood's been there,

851
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,013
no matter how hard
you try to scrub it out...

852
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,500
...we're going to find it.

853
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:57,380
You killed Alex there,

854
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,552
dragged him to his room.

855
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,899
I was trying to reason with him.

856
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,957
He wanted Michael transferred.

857
00:39:11,117 --> 00:39:12,188
I was going to do it.

858
00:39:13,094 --> 00:39:13,894
I did.

859
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:16,850
Afterwards, out of guilt.

860
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,940
Yeah, but that night
all you could see was

861
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,028
Havenhurst, your passion,
in jeopardy.

862
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,677
Please just...

863
00:39:36,982 --> 00:39:38,398
...let me tell you
what happened.

864
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,077
What is the matter
with you, Alex ?!

865
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,863
You got a problem ?

866
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,604
Come to me.

867
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:48,339
Your thug Laticia

868
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,529
tried to kill Michael tonight.

869
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:51,384
He shouldn't even be here;
he's a little kid.

870
00:39:51,384 --> 00:39:52,546
Okay, okay.

871
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,150
If Laticia did something wrong,
we'll talk to her about it.

872
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,220
If this isn't the right fit
for Michael, we'll address tt.

873
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,807
We can work
all of this out.

874
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:02,252
- Sit down.
- It's beyond circle time, man.

875
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,659
You want to work it out,
pick up that phone

876
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:05,254
and call the judge--
he's the boss.

877
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:06,566
I run Havenhurst.

878
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,800
If you're in charge, why
don't you fix the problems ?

879
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,134
Too many kids getting screwed over,
not just Michael.

880
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,100
Damn, why don't you do
something about it?!

881
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:15,940
Do you know how hard I work
to keep this place going ?

882
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,639
Enough to get you there, right ?

883
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,691
Jurisprudence, my ass.

884
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:22,872
You're just like the judge--
in it to get paid.

885
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:24,614
That is completely out of line.

886
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,211
We can talk about this, Alex.

887
00:40:27,211 --> 00:40:28,040
What are you doing ?

888
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,387
Give me the number
for Channel 2 news.

889
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,310
Damn it, Alex.

890
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,484
You put that phone down.
You want to talk?

891
00:40:32,484 --> 00:40:33,994
- Talk to the cameras.
- Put the phone down!

892
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:34,894
'Cause you're going down
with the rest of 'em.

893
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,795
I said listen to me !

894
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,936
Quiet !

895
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:44,276
Just be quiet !

896
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,763
Shut up.

897
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,369
Shut up.
Let me think.

898
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,444
Just let me think.

<i>"None of us are free"
by Solomon Burke.</i>

900
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,670
* Well, you'd better listen,
my sisters and brothers *

901
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,556
* 'Cause if you do,
you can hear *

902
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,008
* There are voices *

903
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:34,418
* Still callin'
across the years *

904
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,509
* And they're all cryin'
across the ocean *

905
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:42,680
* And they're cryin'
across the land *

906
00:41:42,907 --> 00:41:47,856
* And they will
till we all come to understand *

907
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:51,808
* None of us are free *

908
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:55,312
* None of us are free *

909
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,245
* None of us
are free *

910
00:41:57,245 --> 00:42:02,112
* One of us is chained,
none of us are free *

911
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:04,330
* And there are people *

912
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,116
* Still in darkness *

913
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,881
* And they just
can't see the light *

914
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,180
* If you don't say it's wrong *

915
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,517
* Then that says it's right *

916
00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:19,200
* We got to try to feel
for each other *

917
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:22,571
* Let our brothers know
that we care *

918
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:25,195
* Got to get the message *

919
00:42:25,195 --> 00:42:27,960
* Send it out loud and clear *

920
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,117
* None of us are free *

921
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,322
* None of us are free *

922
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,380
* None of us
are free *

923
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,200
* One of us is chained *

924
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,056
* None of us are free *

925
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,029
* It's a simple truth
we all need *

926
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,173
* Just to hear and to see *

927
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:50,700
* None of us are free *

928
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,560
<i>* One of us is chained *
* Oh, Lord *</i>

929
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,938
* None of us are free *

930
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:59,468
* Now, I swear your salvation *

931
00:43:00,342 --> 00:43:02,522
* Isn't too hard to find *

932
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,120
* None of us can find it *

933
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,040
* On our own *

934
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:09,810
<i>* On our own *</i>

935
00:43:09,945 --> 00:43:12,571

936

* In spirit, heart and mind *

937
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:20,806
* So that every soul
who's suffering will know *

938
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,311
* That we're not alone *

939
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:26,009

940
00:43:26,009 --> 00:43:29,451

942

* One of us is chained,
none of us are free. *
