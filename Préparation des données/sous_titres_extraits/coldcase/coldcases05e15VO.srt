00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,100
THE FOLLOWING STORY IS FICTIONAL AND DOES
NOT DEPICT ANY ACTUAL PERSON OR EVENT.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,900
HAPPY ENGAGEMENT BRENDA AND DAVID!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,400
Stole the woman
of my dreams, Dave.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,100
I ever tell you at, Brenda?

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,900
What? What's it matter now?
I said it. Anyway.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,900
Brenda and Dave-- giving
the rest of us idiots hope.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,400
Say something nice?

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,300
David turned
me down,

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,800
even after I took
my clothes off.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,800
But we've all grown up, right?

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,600
Bren, your turn.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,000
Say something to you and Dave
30 years from now,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
when you're old
and shriveled

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,600
and watching this

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,700
on your Craftmatic
Adjustable Bed.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,900
Hey, you and me,
um, 30 years from now.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
I guess...

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,700
maybe I'll think I'm crazy
for saying this,

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,300
but I can't wait
until we're old... and happy

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,500
and grandchildren
piled 'round us

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,200
on our Craftmatic
Adjustable Bed.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,600
Listen up!

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,200
Who's the Einstein
that left their lights on?

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,500
Volv G3D-7L3B

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Oh, that's me.

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,900
Uh, babe.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,300
Give me your keys.
I'll go.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,100
I forgot something
in the car anyway.

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,200
A surprise.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,800
Ugh, no more surprises,
please.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,100
No, this is
a good one,

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,700
so you don't have to tell
the proposal story all night.

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,800
Long as you're not
running out on me.

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,000
Prevailing wisdom
is that I don't deserve you.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,100
You don't.

36
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,200
Brenda.

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,300
Brenda!

38
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,000
There's no way
she'd just disappear.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
She probably went
to get something.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,700
If she went somewhere,
she would have taken her car.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Brenda!

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,400
What is that?

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,100
No.

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,700
I really don't remember,

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,100
but if you say I was there,
I guess I was.

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Her fiancé must be
real broken up.

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,800
Bet he misses her.

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,300
Ted Huffard, deputy sheriff

49
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,800
in Ripley, West Virginia,
sent it.

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
Pulled him over
for an illegal turn,

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
finds the plates in the trunk.

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Car is not only stolen,
it's in felony vehicle status.

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
What for?
Seen leaving
a restaurant

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,100
parking lot in Chestnut Hill

55
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,100
the night
Brenda MacDowell was abducted.

56
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,800
August 12, '07.

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,700
Car's a late-model
gold Honda Accord.

58
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,100
Driver's side dent.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,900
Reported stolen
in Grays Ferry

60
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,600
two days
before Brenda disappears.

61
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Hmm, the night of
her engagement party,

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,800
guy lures her
out of the restaurant

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
by turning
on her Volvo's headlights,

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,300
then calls the plates
into the restaurant.

65
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,600
Smart trick.

66
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,400
Presumed homicide--
investigation

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,700
never turned
up the body.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Looks like a happy girl.

69
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,200
There's a ribbon bouquet found
at the scene, lots of blood.

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,300
No matches,

71
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,500
not even hers.

72
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,600
Till now.
VERA:
DNA matched this guy's?

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,700
Huffard offered him
a cigarette,

74
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,200
got a match off his saliva.

75
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
RUSH:
His blood.

76
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,900
So she fought back.

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,500
Lot of good
it did her.

78
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,200
This nutjob got a name?

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
He calls himself John
Smith, but the number

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,900
on the Florida license
he was carrying

81
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,800
doesn't exist.
No match on the prints

82
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
and DNA's not in CODIS.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,900
More like a John Doe.
We need a body

84
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,300
and a confession before he gets
to Philly and lawyers up.

85
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,300
Tonight.

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
STILLMAN:
Who's going to take the ride?

87
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,800
Toni's making
casserole.

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
You gonna play the
casserole card again?

89
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,200
I'll go.

90
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Going to need you
on call, Nick,

91
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,800
in case we get anything.

92
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,700
Chasing a bag of bones, boss.

93
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,500
STILLMAN:
Tell that to her fiancé.

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,500
You found Brenda?

95
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,500
STILLMAN:
You know him?

96
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,600
No, if I did,
I'd kill him myself.

97
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Could be
the guy

98
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,200
who reads your meter or
the grocery store clerk.

99
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,200
Never seen him before
in my life.

100
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,400
Well, thanks for taking a look,
David.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
We'll keep you posted.

102
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,400
You know, everyone keeps telling
me I need to, uh, move on.

103
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,500
But how am I supposed
to do that?

104
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,700
I need you
to find her this time.

105
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,600
I need to bury her.

106
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,200
See what we can do.

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,000
STILLMAN:
I'll walk you out.

108
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,500
Take a ride?

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,900
West Virginia
is more than a ride.

110
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,400
You're talking
all night here.

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
You got something
else going on?

112
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,100
Was planning on washing my hair,
actually.

113
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,500
Still having trouble sleeping,
huh?

114
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,400
Look, you coming or not?

115
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,300
Yeah.

116
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,200
But I'm driving.
Then let's go.

117
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,200
John Smith's waiting.

118
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600

???

122
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,200
did you?

123
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
About four hours.

124
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,000
From Philly,
that's flying.

125
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,300
Well, my partner's got
a lead foot.

126
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,500
Judge took care of the
extradition papers.

127
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,000
Hope y'all have better luck
getting a body out of him.

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,400
Plan on taking our time
getting back.

129
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,900
Give us a chance
to talk.

130
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,800
He's polite, good manners.

131
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,300
Wouldn't have picked him
out of a crowd.

132
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,700
He was going nuts in his cell,
so I put him over here instead.

133
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,200
Get up now, John.

134
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,100
Detectives Rush and Valens
taking you back to Philly.

135
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,500
Man said get up.

136
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,800
??? Things make it hard to stand.

137
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,900
Not meant to be comfortable.

138
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,000
I never met a
female detective.

139
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,000
Certainly hope they appreciate
everything you've given up

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,500
to do what you do.

141
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,800
You got a real name

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,600
or we part of this
John Smith charade?

143
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,600
You want to talk to me.

144
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,300
Blood, DNA.

145
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
Already got enough
to put you away.

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Don't need you saying jack.

147
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,700
Then why are we taking
the scenic route,

148
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,800
unless you want
to find her body?

149
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,500
Give you a chance to
help yourself, cooperate.

150
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
We'll talk to the DA,
see what we can do.

151
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,200
You a Kenso?

152
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
You sound like you're
from Kensington.

153
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
Port Richmond maybe.

154
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,700
I'll ask the questions.

155
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,000
Kensington.

156
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,300
There's no place to stop
for food this way, bathroom.

157
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,100
Guess you'll have
to hold it.

158
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,200
Your perfume.

159
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,900
It's flowery.

160
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,200
Not what I'd expect
from someone in your position.

161
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,800
Don't wear it.

162
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,100
Cologne then.

163
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,200
It's aftershave.

164
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,500
There's nothing flowery
about it.

165
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,300
So how'd you do it, John?

166
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
Taking a child's one thing.

167
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Woman like Brenda
would have screamed.

168
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,300
You see the world
in a certain way,

169
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,700
the way you want it to work.

170
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,600
You don't know that.
Are you saying

171
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,900
you two had some kind of...
relationship?

172
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,400
I'm saying

173
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,700
sometimes the pieces
of the puzzle don't fit.

174
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,100
'Cause she fought back.

175
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,500
Your blood
at the scene.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You get your ass
handed to you

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,700
by a woman, Johnny boy?

178
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,100
I'm not the guy you look at
and think "rapist."

179
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm more like the guy you see
at the dentist's office.

180
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,100
No reason to fight me.

181
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,400
So you wanted

182
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
to be important,

183
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
stand out.

184
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,400
'Cause women

185
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
like Brenda don't notice losers
like you.

186
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
A well-mannered woman like that?

187
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,800
She notices.

188
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,500
All you got to do is ask.

189
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,300
Excuse me.

190
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,000
Sorry, over here.

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
I pick up take-out
for my wife--

192
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,200
she's six months along,
craving chili fries--

193
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,100
and my car won't start.

194
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Murphy's Law, right?

195
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
Uh, mind if I use

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,500
your cell phone to call AAA?

197
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,600
Mine just died.

198
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,100
You can use
the phone inside.

199
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,600
Hey,

200
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,100
Brenda MacDowell, right?

201
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm John Smith.

202
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,400
We ran the marathon
for Hart-Fitzgerald together.

203
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,700
You're at the firm?

204
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,900
Paralegal,
getting my degree at night.

205
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,600
Right.

206
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,500
John Smith.

207
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,200
Hey, don't worry about it.
I work in the basement.

208
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,900
You're in litigation,
right?

209
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,900
Didn't think that
WestTech case was winnable.

210
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,100
Thanks.

211
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,500
If you could, um,
you know, hurry.

212
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,300
That party in there
is for me.

213
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm getting married.

214
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,600
Oh, congratulations.

215
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,300
Best decision
I ever made.

216
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,700
Hi, John Smith again.

217
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,900
We got cut off.

218
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,300
Right, '96 Accord.

219
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,900
Do you mind giving it a try?

220
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,500
I might have done
the trick there.

221
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,800
Hey.

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
Hey, it worked.

223
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
Real stunt you pulled there
at the end of the marathon.

224
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,500
Never seen a girl
so pleased

225
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,100
with her damn self.

226
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,300
Just gave us abduction,
brain trust.

227
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,300
SMITH:
Well, don't say

228
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,700
I never gave you anything.

229
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,800
RUSH:
Oh, impressive, John.

230
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
Any ape can
hold a gun.

231
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,300
You talked to her, roped her in.

232
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,900
You got her
when she least expected it

233
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,800
in some parking lot
going to turn off her lights.

234
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,700
RUSH:
She saw the world
a certain way.

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,400
The way she wanted it to work.

236
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,500
SMITH:
Makes a person

237
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,100
weak, vulnerable.

238
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,500
And that's
how you work.

239
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,200
Finding their soft spot.

240
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,200
Kind of like you, Detective.

241
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,500
Well, read me well.

242
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,900
Just like
you read her.

243
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,600
You a runner, John?

244
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,400
No.
What were
you doing

245
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,600
at the marathon?

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Not a paralegal,

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
are you, John?

248
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,500
<i>JEFFRIES:
No John Smith</i>

249
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,700
at your fiancée's law firm,
nobody who matches

250
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,200
his description.

251
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,300
We think he was stalking her.

252
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,900
Following her routine,
knew where she worked.

253
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
We ran the marathon
together last year.

254
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,300
You see anyone suspicious?

255
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,400
Showing a real interest
in Brenda there?

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,300
No.

257
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,900
I just had eyes
for her.

258
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,400
<i>BRENDA (breathless):
Oh! We did it!</i>

259
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,400
DAVID:
We... did it.

260
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,400
What's our time?

261
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,700
Four hours, 23 minutes,
and 13 seconds.

262
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,400
BRENDA:
So, if I ever had any doubts

263
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,000
about what we're capable
of doing... together...

264
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,700
I mean, everything
in front of us...

265
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,800
DAVID WILL YOU MARRY ME?

266
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,200
Are you...? Bren!

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,300
Will you?

268
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,300
(Brenda panting):
Marry me?

269
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,600
DAVID:
I-I'm supposed to ask!

270
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,900
I was gonna ask you!

271
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,000
BRENDA:
So, is... is that...?

272
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,700
DAVID:
Yes! Yes!

273
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,300
Let's get married!

274
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,300
We'll have
to check that footage, David.

275
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,400
Give you a few minutes.

276
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,300
You meet a lot of people
like me, don't you?

277
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,200
Does it ever get any easier?

278
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,800
I'll be outside
when you're finished.

279
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,700
WOMAN:
You can do it,
Brenda.

280
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,100
That's it!

281
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,700
You okay, honey?
You all right?

282
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm okay.

283
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,800
You scraped
your knee.

284
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,100
BRENDA:
I can do it, Daddy.

285
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,500
I want to try again.

286
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,300
Go, sweetie!
Go, Brenda!

287
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,700
Never let go, do they?

288
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,100
Ones that don't get the bodies.

289
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,600
Vera found the owner
of that gold Honda.

290
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,200
<i>WOMAN:
Draggin' my ass</i>

291
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,400
out of bed in middle
of the night, and for what?

292
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,600
I reported that car stolen
eight months ago.

293
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,000
We need your help finding
the man who took it.

294
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,500
Have you seen this guy?

295
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,000
He the SOB
who got me my parking tickets?

296
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,200
Parking tickets?

297
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,100
Four of 'em since it's stolen.

298
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,100
Newark, all of 'em.

299
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,700
Parking guy got the VIN number
through the windshield.

300
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
Same cross street's on all four.

301
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,100
He's going back
to the same place,

302
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
staying long enough
to get ticketed.

303
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,800
His neighborhood?

304
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,100
Or where he dumped the body.

305
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,200
Thank you, Mrs. Phillips.

306
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,800
What about my damn car?

307
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,600
Don't know him.

308
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,600
Great idea, Miller:
knocking on doors

309
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,100
in the middle of the night.

310
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,100
None of these mopes
has seen the guy.

311
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,300
Memory serves, it was
your great idea, Mr. Casserole.

312
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,600
MILLER:
Philly PD.

313
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,800
You seen this guy?

314
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,000
Live over there, the brown door,

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,300
about a year back.

316
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,800
Only cracker on the block.

317
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,000
This cracker
got a name?

318
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,600
Keep to himself.

319
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Drove an old gold thing.

320
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,300
Honda?

321
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,600
Sound about right.

322
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,900
PPD! Open up!

323
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,700
Do you hear something inside?

324
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,300
I don't hear nothin'.

325
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,100
Neither do I.

326
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,200
What the hell?

327
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,400
I think we found her.

328
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,000
???

329
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,300
VERA:
What the hell?

330
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,100
The place belongs
to a John Smith.

331
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,300
Bought it with $6,000 cash.

332
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,400
John Smith? He buys
a house with an alias?

333
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,100
I find a buyer in
this neighborhood,

334
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
I ain't asking
questions,

335
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,700
either.

336
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, he's ready for us.

337
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,700
Couldn't hide her forever.

338
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,200
Toilet, sink.

339
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,000
You could keep someone
alive for however long

340
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,800
you wanted.

341
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,600
MILLER:
How long?

342
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,600
Long enough to do this.

343
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,100
This is like a POW camp.

344
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,600
Your mind on the wall,

345
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,900
all you got.

346
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,700
MILLER:
Must have taken her weeks.

347
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,600
Months.

348
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
She didn't just die
in this dungeon.

349
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,900
She lived here, too.

350
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,800
I AM ALIVE

351
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,700
We found her, John.

352
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,200
Game over.

353
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,800
You found Brenda?

354
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,200
Kept her in that

355
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,400
Newark dungeon for months

356
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,100
before you
killed her.
What the hell

357
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,900
you doing with her
all that time?

358
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
Newark?

359
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,900
You mind opening a window?

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, I do mind.

361
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,300
I can't breathe.

362
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,600
You didn't like

363
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,900
your cell
back in West Virginia.

364
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,500
Don't like
to feel crowded.

365
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
You spend time in lockup, John?

366
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,800
You showing her
what it feels like?
No.

367
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
'Cause that's
where you're headed.

368
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,800
Rest of your days
in a cage.

369
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,200
Yeah, pretty girl, Brenda.

370
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,900
Yes, she was.

371
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,500
Oh, so what?

372
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,600
You can't pitch a tent, Johnny?

373
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
That your problem?

374
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,800
You think it was about sex?

375
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,300
Power.
You can't
imagine

376
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,800
a man wants to keep a woman
around without hurting her,

377
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,700
can you?

378
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,600
Not locked
in his basement, homes.

379
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,200
If I wanted to have sex,
I could pay for women

380
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,000
off the streets,
in bars.

381
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,600
Common as road kill,
filth like that.

382
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
Nice tail on this one.

383
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,500
Sure you didn't get
a piece of that?

384
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,600
You get a piece of that?

385
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,700
Bet you think about it,
time to time?

386
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh, if you weren't having
your way with her,

387
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,700
why did you keep her
for so long?

388
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,400
Tell me something first.

389
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,500
What gets you out of bed

390
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
in the morning?

391
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,800
Everyone's
got something

392
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
they hold onto.

393
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,500
Keeps them tethered
to this world.

394
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,000
No wedding ring.

395
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,200
A boyfriend, perhaps?

396
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,300
So what was Brenda holding onto?

397
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,800
Love.

398
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,300
What are you doing?

399
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,600
Where am I?

400
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
You were sleeping.
You woke up.

401
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,300
You stay away from me!

402
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
David!

403
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
(shouting):
David!

404
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,700
David's not here.

405
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,800
Help!

406
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,500
Someone help me!

407
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Help!

408
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,500
No one can hear you.

409
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,500
Who are you?

410
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,100
What do you want?

411
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Nothing.

412
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,200
They'll find me.

413
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,200
They won't stop
until they find me!

414
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,100
They might be looking

415
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
for you,

416
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,100
but no one's looking for me.

417
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,200
How long
do you think it'll be

418
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,900
till there's a red Mustang
in his driveway?

419
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,200
Everyone's going
to tell him to move on.

420
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
That's a guarantee.

421
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,600
How do you know
about David's ex-girlfriend?

422
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,200
Who are you?

423
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,000
That look on your face.

424
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,600
It's just like
little Brenda on her bike.

425
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,000
Red lips.

426
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,600
Red knee.

427
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,900
Any other kid would have run
to Mommy.

428
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,100
Not you.

429
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,700
Determined.

430
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,800
Always.

431
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,800
You don't know me.

432
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,100
I know you.

433
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,100
I'm just waiting
for you to catch up.

434
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,900
VALENS:
That get you off, huh?

435
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,700
The mind games?

436
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
SMITH:
I told you once:
it wasn't about sex.

437
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,200
You wanted something.

438
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
Drive her nuts?

439
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
The chicken scrawl on the walls.

440
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,600
She tried to keep her sanity

441
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,100
for a while
by marking off the days,

442
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,800
but there was
no point to that.

443
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,400
Little Brenda.

444
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,000
You knew her when she was a kid?

445
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,100
You're the detective.

446
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,500
Figure it out.

447
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,400
He said she was
marking off the days.

448
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
No windows, no lights
coming into that room.

449
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,200
So how did she know
what day it was?

450
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,900
Will, it's Rush.

451
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,800
Brenda on her bike.

452
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,500
A fall, um,
skinned knee maybe?

453
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,000
That mean
something to you?

454
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
<i>JEFFRIES:
The part of the movie
where Brenda</i>

455
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,400
learned to ride her bike,
skinned her knee--

456
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,100
he must have
seen it.

457
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,100
Did you show it
to anyone else?

458
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,400
No.

459
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,300
Brenda was going to show it
at the engagement party.

460
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,600
Uh, it was still in her car
when she disappeared.

461
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,700
She make it herself?

462
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,800
Or give it to one
of those places

463
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,700
that edits your
home video for you?

464
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,200
She gave it to, uh,
some company.

465
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
She got the movies
from our families

466
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,200
and gave them to some place.

467
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,500
She mention the name?

468
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,700
Your Best Angle.

469
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Something like that?

470
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,100
It was, uh...
It was near her office.

471
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,500
John, just talked to
the owner of Best Angle.

472
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,700
Place Brenda brought
her home videos?

473
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,100
VERA:
Turns out John Smith
worked there.

474
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,600
Owner says
he was their best editor.

475
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,700
Worked there for a year,

476
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,900
paid in cash,
before quitting four days ago.

477
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Owner says he's on his way
to Marion, Illinois

478
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,000
for his next gig.
Till his bad turn in Ripley.

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,800
Four previous employers
since '02:

480
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,100
Life Videos in Newark,

481
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,500
Edit Right
in Detroit.

482
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,900
Two more in Atlanta and Queens.
All editing houses.

483
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,700
So?

484
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,600
One client
from each

485
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,700
of his jobs
matches a missing woman

486
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,900
from the same city,

487
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,500
same year.
Boss.

488
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,200
ME's preliminary report
is back.

489
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,300
Dental records
on the Newark body didn't match

490
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,500
Brenda MacDowell's.

491
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,000
Wasn't Brenda in that basement.
Newark?

492
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,900
Colleen Legarth.

493
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Missing since November '06.

494
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,100
They find a cause of death?

495
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,900
No strangulation, no ligatures,

496
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,000
no broken bones.
Tox report's clean.

497
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,400
How's he killing them?

498
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,500
Five women.

499
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,400
Five cities.

500
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,900
Five basements.

501
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,200
Let Lil and Scotty know.

502
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,000
This guy is not
just a serial killer.

503
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
He's a collector.

504
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,600
Notice

505
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,100
you never use your signal.

506
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,900
Cops drive however they want.

507
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,700
Gotta have
some perks

508
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,900
with the job.

509
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,200
Body in Newark wasn't Brenda.

510
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
You lied.

511
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,100
I never lied.

512
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,600
You made an assumption.

513
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,800
The way you wanted
to see it.

514
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,100
Four other women locked up
out there somewhere.

515
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,600
You wanted us to know about 'em.

516
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,300
Why?

517
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,900
How did you kill them?
Your fancy labs

518
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,700
can't tell you?

519
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,600
You watched their tapes,

520
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,900
picked them
for a reason.
Somethin' you liked

521
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,400
about 'em.

522
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,700
Or hated.
You still haven't

523
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,600
told me what gets you
out of bed, Detective.

524
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,700
Tell me where Brenda is

525
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,300
and I'll make sure
you don't get the needle.

526
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,900
Is it the rush you get
from seeing dead people?

527
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,800
Has to be a reason
you became a homicide cop.

528
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,300
That what happens to you?
When you kill 'em?

529
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Death's the
only thing

530
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
that's real.

531
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,300
It's the purest thing
you'll ever see.

532
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,600
You God now?

533
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,800
Question is,

534
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,100
what's that rush covering
for you?

535
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,100
You seem to know
a lot about it.

536
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,500
Why don't you tell us?

537
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,700
When there's one thing
you hold onto,

538
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,400
it takes on

539
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,100
a special significance.

540
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,900
And when that's
taken away,

541
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,300
you're left with nothing.

542
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,400
<i>Like that woman from Newark.</i>

543
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,500
<i>Colleen.</i>

544
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,000
COLLEEN (on video):
What'd you say?

545
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,200
What'd you say?

546
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,300
That's right.

547
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,100
I'm right here.

548
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,400
Look at that smile.

549
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,100
Honey!

550
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,700
She just smiled at me!

551
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,100
She smiled!

552
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,700
Look at you.

553
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
Beautiful as the sun.

554
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,500
Please.

555
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
Pretty little girl.

556
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,200
Maybe she'd like it here, too,
someday.

557
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,300
Such fragile things
they hold onto.

558
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
And when they're gone,
they just...

559
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,800
float away.

560
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,700
That's

561
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,800
how you kill them?
Kill them.

562
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,200
That's a funny way to put it,
really.

563
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
Talk about Brenda.

564
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,500
You got nothin'

565
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,900
to lose, right?
Where'd you put her body?

566
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,300
We've been talking
about that one all night.

567
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,300
Boring.

568
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,600
But not the end.

569
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,800
Not how you crushed her.

570
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
No, you don't talk
about that.

571
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Why not?

572
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,800
It takes

573
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,600
a lot of discipline keeping
a woman locked up for months.

574
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,200
No one hearing her screams.

575
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,500
Must be a reason
you got caught now.

576
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
And made that bad turn.

577
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,800
Meticulous guy

578
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,400
like you.
Something
rattled you.

579
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
No. You're wrong.

580
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,100
Got under your skin.
For you to make

581
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,000
a mistake
like that.

582
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't make mistakes!

583
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Brenda's still alive, isn't she?

584
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,600
You know, I think
I'm done talking.

585
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,500
<i>He left Philly</i>

586
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,600
four days ago.
If she's still alive,

587
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
we don't have
much time.

588
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,900
??? Newark's the only city
where you have

589
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,800
both the abduction site
and the dump site.

590
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,200
JEFFRIES:
The abduction
took place here.

591
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,100
Here's the basement.

592
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,300
Less than a 20-minute drive.

593
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,500
STILLMAN:
He gets them inside before
the chloroform wears off.

594
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,600
He's finding basements
in poor neighborhoods

595
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,100
where no one sees anything,
says anything.

596
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,900
Here's the restaurant

597
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,000
where Brenda
was abducted.

598
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,900
Searching a
20-minute radius,

599
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
three low-income

600
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,100
neighborhoods fall inside.

601
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,400
Our contact
at the recorder's office
is looking for properties

602
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,500
bought in cash
for less

603
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,000
than ten grand by John Smith.

604
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,700
??? How's Miller doing
on the videos?

605
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,400
Got Tech Support

606
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,200
out of bed,

607
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,400
downloaded the movies
John Smith made of his victims.

608
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
What's the common thread?

609
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,000
We know that, we find Brenda.

610
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,800
COLLEEN:
We dreamed about this day
for so long.

611
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
And here you are.

612
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,200
Different classes,
different ages.

613
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,200
Some had families;
some didn't.

614
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,500
Only thing

615
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,200
in common is...

616
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,100
they all had something
to live for.

617
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Fiancé,

618
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,500
kid, God.

619
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,000
Wide net there.

620
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,300
Maybe not so wide.

621
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,400
Monica had God.

622
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,500
Colleen had her baby.

623
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,400
And Brenda had David.

624
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Chose women with something
to live for.

625
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,900
Someone they loved.

626
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Not something
you'd know about.

627
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,700
Must have driven you crazy.

628
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,600
All the things they had.

629
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,500
Not you, though.

630
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,100
I edited their sloppy lives
into something beautiful.

631
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,900
I gave them a way
to believe the delusions

632
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,100
they were
hanging onto.

633
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,700
Delusions? Look who's talking.

634
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,600
What's on those videos
isn't who they are.

635
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,900
It's a charade.

636
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,800
To give their lives meaning.

637
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,300
Like the job gives your life

638
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,200
meaning.
I've had it
with your BS.

639
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,100
Where's Brenda?

640
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,600
Don't pretend you don't know
what I mean, Detective.

641
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,200
Where'd you put
her body, you freak?

642
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,500
No, I, I do.

643
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
I know what you mean.

644
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Who are you
when it's taken away?

645
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,500
The job.

646
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,800
No one.

647
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,200
Like them.

648
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,100
Even the one who had God.

649
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,500
VALENS:
Monica.

650
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,200
The singer.

651
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,900
She gave up
the easiest.

652
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,400
She couldn't
understand

653
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,100
how God could leave her
in that room so alone.

654
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,100
<i>I saw it in her eyes.</i>

655
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,200
<i>The moment she realized
there was no God.</i>

656
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,100
<i>That if God was anything,</i>

657
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,600
<i>he was the greatest
con man of all.</i>

658
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,700
Once hope is gone,

659
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
dying is just a formality.

660
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,200
You sealed her in there alive?

661
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,200
First, I took the door
off its hinges.

662
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,300
She was free
to go, run.

663
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,900
I wouldn't have stopped her.

664
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,200
But she wasn't looking
for a way out anymore.

665
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,900
Sounds like you're...

666
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,900
familiar, Detective.

667
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
Son of a...

668
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,700
Where's Brenda?

669
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,200
Hmm?

670
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Where is she?

671
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,600
Scotty!
Hmm?

672
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,700
Hey! Stop!

673
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,900
She's here.

674
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,600
In these woods.

675
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,200
A mile further,
there's a blinking yellow light.

676
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,700
Path to the right
heads into the woods.

677
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,900
A quarter mile in,
there's a clearing.

678
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,800
Put him in the car.

679
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,600
I'll drive.

680
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I'm going in.

681
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,600
The guy's got
an endgame, Lil.

682
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,000
Who knows what he's got
waiting in those woods?

683
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,100
We're running out of time.

684
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
But we know his pattern.

685
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,400
Houses, basements.

686
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,100
Not woods.
What if we're wrong

687
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
and she's in there right now?

688
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
No service.

689
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,600
We don't have time
to wait for backup.

690
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,100
We're armed. He's not.

691
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,000
You ready to pull the trigger?

692
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,900
Let's go.

693
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,100
Try anything,
I'll blow your head off.

694
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,200
You get Lil or Scotty
on the line yet?

695
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,900
Cell phone keeps
dumping to voice mail.

696
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,600
Last time they called
was Waynesburg.

697
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
Nothing between here
and there but lumber.

698
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,100
The hell are they doing?

699
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Going renegade.
With a psychopath in custody.

700
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Almost there.

701
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,000
VALENS:
Keep moving.

702
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,500
RUSH:
Know these woods
pretty good.

703
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,900
This where you're from,
you sick bastard?

704
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,400
RUSH:
What's that?

705
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,300
Got something.

706
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,300
SMITH:
If only you had

707
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,700
videos of your own.

708
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,000
Of course, there'd be
no one in them.

709
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
No one to show them to.
Shut up.

710
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,900
I'm taking a look.

711
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,700
Scotty...

712
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,800
I got it.

713
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,200
What do you got?
Nothing.

714
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,800
It's a dried-up well.

715
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,600
You said you wanted to know
what happened

716
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,400
to Brenda.
Well, Brenda's not in there.

717
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,900
No, but someone else is.

718
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,700
WOMAN:
So cold.

719
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,700
So cold...

720
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
So cold...

721
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,400
Please help me!

722
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,300
It was the most beautiful thing
I ever saw.

723
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,600
Watching a woman die?

724
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,300
Watching her give up.

725
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,900
The rest is just a formality.

726
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
We understand each other
finally.

727
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,500
Dungeons like this well.

728
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,000
You were trying
to recreate this, hmm?

729
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,900
Who was she?
Nobody.

730
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,400
I came here.

731
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,300
I listened to your story.

732
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,500
Now tell me where Brenda is.

733
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,800
You're just like them,

734
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,200
trying to hold on
to something make-believe.

735
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,200
Because there will
always be another

736
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Brenda out there, another me.

737
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,900
Maybe it's time you see,
detective,

738
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,400
how false your God is.

739
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,100
Tell me where she is.

740
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,400
Looks like
we've run out of time.

741
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,500
Where is she?!

742
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,300
She's dead.

743
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,400
No.

744
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Pull the trigger!

745
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
You son of a...

746
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,500
Lil, it's
what he wants.

747
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Can't spend his life

748
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,800
in a cell
like his victims did.

749
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,500
That's why he brought us
out here.

750
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,000
She was weak.

751
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,100
Like you.

752
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Brenda's alive.

753
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,400
I know she is.

754
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,400
She wasn't like that woman
in the well; she was strong.

755
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,500
You need to believe that,
but you're wrong.

756
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,200
No.

757
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,300
She broke in that dark, lonely,

758
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,300
little room.

759
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
Just like one day you will, too.

760
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,500
You can't tread water forever.

761
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,800
Eventually,
you'll get tired

762
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,000
just like Brenda.
No, that song.

763
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,400
She was humming that song.

764
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,500
"Chasing far all gloom
and terror,

765
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,800
"brightening
all the path

766
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
we tread."

767
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,000
The bells at Ascension Church
in Kensington

768
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
have been playing that song

769
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,700
every morning
since I was a kid.

770
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
That's how Brenda knew
what day it was.

771
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,300
That's how she held on.

772
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,200
I told you, she's dead.

773
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,200
Even in the ugliness
of Kensington,

774
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,700
she found something to cling to,
something beautiful.

775
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,700
She didn't break, did she, John?

776
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,600
She never gave up.

777
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,600
Because when it was all taken
away in the end,

778
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,200
she still had herself.

779
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,300
I know where that church is.
(sirens blaring in distance)

780
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,500
I know that neighborhood.

781
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,500
Find her, Lil.

782
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,000
Don't walk away from me!

783
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,300
Don't you leave!

784
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,800
