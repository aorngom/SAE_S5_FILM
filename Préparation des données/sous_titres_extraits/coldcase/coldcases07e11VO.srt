march 5 2005

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,400
<i>Violence continued overnight
in Iraq</i>

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,500
<i>with some of the fiercest
fighting to date..."</i>

<i>"I don't wanna be"

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>Come on. Push through.</i>

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,100
Push through. Don't give up
on me now. Come on.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,800
You got it. You got it.
Don't give up on me.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,100
Come on ! Come on !

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,700
All right.

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,200
What's bugging you, Bobby ?

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,900
Nothing.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,400
You remembered ?

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,300
You're 18 today.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,800
You haven't talked about anything else
for three whole months.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
How could I forget ?

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,800
My family did.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,700
I'm your family now.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,600
You know that.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,900
Go ahead.

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,100
It belonged to my buddy,
Johnny Hughes.

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,900
It's a compass.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,000
Carried it with him
on every single jump.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
He gave that to me...

25
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,301
to help me find my way.

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,900
Now it's yours.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,500
Doesn't matter
where you been.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,200
Only matters
where you go.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,500
Listen.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,100
I'm not talking to you
right now as your recruiter.

31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,200
Okay, I'm talking
to you as a brother,

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,900
'cause that's how I see you,
right ?

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, man.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,200
I am proud of you

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,300
no matter what you decide to do.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,200
I want to sign my contract...

37
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:43,201
today.

38
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,900
Yeah ?

39
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah !

40
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,900
Oh, you're not going to regret
this, Bobby. You're not.

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,700
The Army put me on
the right track, man.

42
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,500
It's going to do
the same for you.

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,400
Thank you.

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,900
Ah, it's so... beautiful.

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,900
<i>Homicide.</i>

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,500
Yeah.

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,800
Lil, Dad's on the line.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Mind taking a message ?

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm tied up.

50
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,600
At ease.

51
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,300
Bumper, huh ?

52
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,800
That's what they call me.

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,900
Name's Bobby, though.

54
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,600
Well, Bobby, I found
Mike Donley's murder file.

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Says here that he broke

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,400
into the Prestige Pawnshop
over on 6th Street.

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,800
Now, the body was found in
an alley a few hours later.

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
November 5, 2005.

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,900
Cops found some of the
stolen jewelry near his body.

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,300
Figured he was jacked
for the rest.

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,800
You got some new information ?

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Found the article
from the paper online.

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,300
It says the pawnshop alarm
got tripped at 11:00 p.m.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,400
- So ?
- Staff Sergeant Donley

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,800
was with me at 11:00.
Putting me on a bus to Fort Bragg.

66
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
A ticket...

67
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,701
from the night of the murder.

68
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,500
- He didn't rob that store, ma'am.
- It's been four years, Bobby.

69
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,100
What took you so long
to come forward ?

70
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,600
I'm Special Forces.

71
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,200
Green Berets.

72
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,000
Went from training at Fort Bragg

73
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,801
to two tours in Afghanistan.

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Just got home.

75
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,300
Well, bus ticket doesn't
prove he was with you.

76
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,100
Ma'am, Army thinks one of its
top soldiers is a criminal.

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
Gotta make it right.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,300
Staff Sergeant Donley
changed my life.

79
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,700
The least I can do is honor his.

80
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Cold Case
Season 7 Episode 11

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,400
Transcript VO : www.ragbear.com

82
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,300
The good soldier

83
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,500
Staff Sergeant Michael Donley,
now, 28 years old.

84
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,600
Served with the 82nd
Airborne in Afghanistan.

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Awarded a Bronze Star
with a "V" for valor

86
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,001
and a Purple Heart.

87
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
Moved back to Philly in 2004

88
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,700
when he got assigned
as an Army recruiter.

89
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,400
Long way from bleeding to death
in the alley at 6th and Oxford.

90
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Well, he'd just gotten orders
to go to Iraq.

91
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Due to deploy two days
after he was killed.

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,700
Mike had a few run-ins
with the cops before he enlisted.

93
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
B & E, petty theft.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,100
Old habits die hard.

95
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,800
Well, witness saw someone running
from the site of the pawnshop burglary,

96
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
wearing an Army ski cap,

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
found at the murder scene
half a mile from the pawnshop,

98
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
along with four
stolen necklaces.

99
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,900
The rest of the jewelry
was never recovered.

100
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
Circumstantial.

101
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,500
The investigation never tied him
to the burglary conclusively.

102
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,000
So if Mike was with Bobby
at the bus station

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,500
when the alarm went off,

104
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:15,501
how'd he end up
in that alley after ?

105
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,200
Catching detective
was Walter Gardner.

106
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Look at his interview notes.

107
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
Almost nothing here.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,100
Well, Walter was a Marine.

109
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,000
He wouldn't have
pushed too hard

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,900
if it was gonna
disgrace a war hero.

111
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,400
No. Questioned Mike's recruits,
other recruiters.

112
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,300
Got their phone numbers,
some alibis... not much else.

113
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,100
Then we re-interview 'em.

114
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,700
Where are we on
the murder weapon ?

115
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Pulled a.380 slug from the
body, casing from the scene.

116
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,800
No matches in '05.

117
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,900
I'll run it again,

118
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,800
see if it's surfaced since then.

119
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Test the hat
and jewelry for DNA.

120
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Well, Mike's supervisor,

121
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,500
First Sergeant Gomez,
is coming in.

122
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,900
Well, talk to the widow, too.

123
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,900
Dad.

124
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,200
I was... I was gonna
call you back.

125
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,700
I tried you three times.

126
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,100
I've... been busy.

127
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Not too busy to
be seeing Finn.

128
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,200
Well, I thought
that's what you wanted-

129
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,100
for me to meet your family.
At our house,

130
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,500
not behind my back.

131
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,900
Well, I can't get
into this right now.

132
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,200
He's gone.

133
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,600
I found your card
in his things.

134
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
We had an argument.
He stormed off.

135
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Well, teenagers do that.

136
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,300
Not Finn.
Not until recently.

137
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,200
- Oh, you're saying it's my fault.
- Of course not.

138
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,700
Here's the files you asked for.

139
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,000
He took some cash,

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
a thousand dollars-
the car, too.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,800
He's been gone since
yesterday morning.

142
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,400
I was hoping there was
something you could do as a cop.

143
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll get into it.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
Okay ?

145
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
Mike was hard-core.

146
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Up in the Afghan mountains,
there was an enemy ambush.

147
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,100
He held them off
for two days.

148
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,400
Took two rounds.

149
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,500
They medevac'd him out,

150
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,800
and he's back in rotation
less than two weeks later.

151
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,300
Doesn't answer my question

152
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,000
about his state of mind,
sergeant Gomez.

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's First Sergeant Gomez.

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
He struggled a
little bit at first.

155
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,800
It was hard going
from combat to recruiting,

156
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,300
till he realized
how vital the mission was.

157
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,200
- How do you mean ?
- As a volunteer Army,

158
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
it falls on the recruiter

159
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
to send support or troops
overseas.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,600
It wasn't easy in 2005.
Not a popular war.

161
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,500
How'd Mike do at it ?

162
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,100
He was our top recruiter.

163
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,400
DEPs really took to him.

164
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,100
DEPs ?

165
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,800
Delayed Entry Program.

166
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
That's what we call
prospective recruits.

167
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Well, 6th and Oxford's
a tough block.

168
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,400
A lot of drugs, gangs.

169
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,200
What do you think
he was doing there ?

170
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,700
Well, it's like I told the cops
back then,

171
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,600
most of his DEPs lived
in that area.

172
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,700
Well, dangerous neighborhood
to be making house calls.

173
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,200
Mike grew up there.

174
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
He had a lot in common
with those kids.

175
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,500
That's why he succeeded.

176
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,700
Shared experience.

177
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,400
We're going to need access
to Mike's recruiting files

178
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,300
and phone records.

179
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,400
You'll have to speak
to my officer in charge.

180
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Well, we'll do that,
First Sergeant Gomez.

181
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,600
Near the end...

182
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,600
Mike was distant.

183
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,200
I'm not going
to lie to you.

184
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,700
I was worried for him.

185
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,300
We'd just gotten back
from the Poconos.

186
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,200
A belated honeymoon.

187
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,800
It was supposed
to be relaxing, but he was

188
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,300
tense, distant.

189
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,900
You two have any money problems ?

190
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,100
You don't join the service
to get rich.

191
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,300
How'd Mike feel about
getting his orders for Iraq ?

192
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,800
I don't know.

193
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,000
I find out after he died.

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,300
He didn't tell you ?

195
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,600
Like I said, he was distant.

196
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,100
Your husband saw combat
in Afghanistan.

197
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,300
A lot of soldiers change

198
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,001
when they come back from war.

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,600
Look, those last few weeks,
Mike was troubled.

200
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,300
I was concerned for him.

201
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,600
I just assumed it was
because of these kids.

202
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,400
His recruits ?

203
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,700
They brought a lot of problems
with them.

204
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,000
Bottom line, it wasn't Iraq
I was afraid of.

205
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,499
Johnny Hughes was small.
Lousy at sports.

206
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,599
Came from a town
with no opportunities.

207
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,699
Ain't going to lie.

208
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,700
"Ain't"?

209
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,499
It's a turn of phrase.

210
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,900
It's bad grammar.

211
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,799
I'm trying to connect
with the kids.

212
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
Well, you can still connec
with proper English.

213
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,300
Oh... okay.

214
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,300
Uh, I'm not going to lie:
Johnny had a hard life.

215
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,699
Well, he didn't let
that keep him down.

216
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,399
He enlisted on his 18th
birthday, went Airborne,

217
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,300
and he made something
of himself.

218
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,400
It's after midnight, Mike.

219
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,499
What do you want me to tell her ?

220
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,400
To go someplace else.

221
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,700
Fine.

222
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,399
Sergeant Mike,
he's going to kill her.

223
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,799
What happened ?

224
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
They were throwing things
at each other.

225
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,699
He said he was going to go
get a gun. He means it.

226
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,499
- We need to call the police.
- What ?!

227
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,199
No ! Don't kick me out !

228
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Let me handle this,
all right ?

229
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm all she's got.

230
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,399
You can't go over there again.
The man is going to kill you.

231
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,600
I'll be fine.

232
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,100
Come on, Victoria.

233
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,700
Victoria Montero.

234
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,199
Our weekly dose of drama.

235
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,899
Her stepdad was
a violent alcoholic.

236
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,299
Mike always intervene ?

237
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,600
He was like the United Nations.

238
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,799
I was sure one day
he'd go over to Victoria's,

239
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
and he'd never come back.

240
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,599
Sergeant Donley saved my life.

241
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,599
No question about it.

242
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,199
He's the reason
I survived my teens.

243
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,299
Is that why you came back
to the same recruiting station ?

244
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,099
As soon as I served my time
in Iraq,

245
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,699
I requested recruiter duty.

246
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,699
Doing for the kids
what Mike did for me.

247
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,099
I understand Mike intervened

248
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,699
in some family trouble
you were having.

249
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,699
By family trouble,

250
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,600
you mean my mom and stepdad
trying to kill each other ?

251
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,499
Yeah.

252
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,199
I heard your stepfather
was a violent man.

253
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,399
How did he take to Mike
helping you out ?

254
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,699
He loved having Sergeant Donley
around.

255
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,099
Big hero in the house,
macho crap.

256
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,499
Any idea where he was
the night of the murder ?

257
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,000
No. I was working.

258
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,799
And your mom, how did she feel

259
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,799
about Mike trying
to send you off to war ?

260
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,899
She didn't care as long

261
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,999
as she got half of my
$20,000 signing bonus.

262
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,799
It's a lot of money.

263
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,999
No kidding.

264
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,899
I was working part-time
in a bodega, stocking shelves.

265
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,399
So, Mike was offering you
an opportunity of a lifetime.

266
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,499
Yeah. It was a lifeline
for a lot of us.

267
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,200
But not everyone
saw it the same way.

268
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,999
Does the Army teach you how
to shoot and jump out of planes ?

269
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,999
No doubt. But combat is such
a small part of what we do.

270
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,999
Victoria wants to learn
about computers, right ?

271
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,499
She can qualify
for advanced training

272
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,699
on the best technology
in the world.

273
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,999
Plus, they'll be taking care
of my rent, food, and medical.

274
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,099
Now, you guys, no community
college is going to do that.

275
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,799
Is there risk involved ?

276
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,699
Of course there is.

277
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,499
But if it weren't for the Army,
I wouldn't be standing here today.

278
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,399
And I'm not alone in that.

279
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,799
And it's not just about
what the Army has to offer you.

280
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,999
A chance to die ?

281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,699
Dad ?

282
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,899
- This the guy who's been stalking you ?
- Staff Sergeant Donley, sir.

283
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,599
You need to stay away from
my son. Stop pressuring him.

284
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,499
- Nobody's pressuring me.
- Army clothes and stickers.

285
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,199
Thinks this is all
some damn adventure movie.

286
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,799
Now, let's go.

287
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,899
No. No. I'm staying
with Sergeant Donley.

288
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,999
Damn it, Kevin. Let
me make this clear.

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,799
You are not enlisting !

290
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,700
Do you have a problem
with the military, sir ?

291
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,799
I served four years
in the Navy.

292
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,299
I have no problem with Kevin
signing up in college.

293
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,099
ROTC. But he is too smart
to be a part of your quota.

294
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,799
I agree, sir. Kevin
an outstanding kid.

295
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,799
Maybe if you would just take
the time to listen to him,

296
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,199
you'll understand
why he's interested.

297
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,599
I don't care why.

298
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,099
And this is the last time
I'm going to say it.

299
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,200
You stay away from him.

300
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,899
Guy didn't get it.

301
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,399
The more he fought, the more
he pushed his son to enlist.

302
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,599
That's how kids are.

303
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,899
That what happened ?
Kevin enlisted ?

304
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,899
He went infantry.
He was on patrol,

305
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,300
maybe a week into deployment
in Iraq.

306
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,000
Killed by a sniper.

307
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,999
Jerry Harkin went off the deep
end when his son got killed.

308
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,599
Arrested for D & D,

309
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,299
loitering...

310
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,599
And a DUI on the night
of Mike's murder.

311
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,699
Guy lives in Chestnut Hill.

312
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,799
So, what's he doing in
North Philly, at 2:00 a.m.

313
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,299
a mile from where Mike was killed ?

314
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,499
Looks like our grieving father

315
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,200
may have ??? his threat.

316
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,799
I keep my guns under lock
and key. They're all registered.

317
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,599
I don't see how one could
have been used in a crime.

318
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,099
You mind if we take a look ?

319
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,199
Don't you need a warrant ?

320
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Only if you got
something to hide.

321
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,899
I got it.

322
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,000
Remember a Sergeant Mike Donley ?

323
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,999
Died a few years ago, right ?

324
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,099
He was murdered.

325
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Are you suggesting I shot him,
and then brought the gun home ?

326
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,800
Wouldn't be the first.

327
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,699
"No," is the answer you're
looking for. I didn't kill him.

328
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,499
Well, you blamed him
for your son's death.

329
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,399
I blamed everyone
for Kevin's death.

330
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,099
I heard from Mike's
fellow recruiters

331
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,299
that you called the recruiting
station a few times a day.

332
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,399
Doesn't ring a bell.

333
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,199
Threatening you were
going to "make him pay."

334
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,500
That ring a bell ?

335
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,700
You know, the school
gives out our information.

336
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,000
Phone numbers.
Everything.

337
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,900
To the military.

338
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,900
So they can solicit
our children.

339
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,299
How can that possibly be right ?

340
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,999
Took out your frustration
on Mike.

341
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,299
It's unnatural to outlive
your child.

342
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,099
That's why you
started drinking heavy.

343
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,699
Caught a DUI blocks
from where Mike was shot.

344
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,599
I was at a bar
in the neighborhood.

345
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,300
Desperate to know
why your boy had to die.

346
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,699
No one would
have blamed you

347
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,099
for going after him.

348
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,100
I didn't have to go after him.
He came to me.

349
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,000
Ma'am.

350
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,600
I just want to tell you how
honored I was to know your son.

351
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,999
Kevin was an inspiration.

352
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,500
Thank you.

353
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,499
He want to make sure
the body's still cold ?

354
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,799
Just offering
his condolences.

355
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,899
- He has no right.
- Don't make a scene.

356
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,200
Jerry !

357
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,500
Ethan, right ?

358
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
Yeah.

359
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,500
Your brother talked
a lot about you.

360
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,100
I'm sure that
everybody's telling you

361
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,499
you got to be strong
for your pop

362
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
and that you got big shoes
to fill.

363
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,299
None of that answers any
of your questions, right ?

364
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,000
About why this all
had to happen ?

365
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,999
I wish I could
tell you.

366
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
I can't.

367
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,200
No one can.

368
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,500
But if you ever get sad
about your brother...

369
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,000
I want you to remember this.

370
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Sorry. Uh...

371
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,900
Take your time.

372
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
He, um...

373
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,300
He told my son Ethan that...

374
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,299
he shouldn't feel sad

375
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,600
about never seeing Kevin again.

376
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,299
Because every time
he saw a soldier

377
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,200
on TV, in the news,
on the street...

378
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,799
anywhere,

379
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,900
that...

380
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,800
that he was seeing
a piece of Kevin...

381
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,700
That Kevin was now a part
of something bigger.

382
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,800
You know...

383
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,199
I might not have agreed
with Mike that much,

384
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,199
but what he said

385
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
stays with me today.

386
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,700
It's how I get by.

387
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,899
Got ballistics on the guns

388
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,199
Rush and Valens
took from Jerry Harkin.

389
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,399
No match on the murder weapon.

390
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,599
What about DNA
from the crime scene ?

391
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,699
Inconclusive.

392
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,399
No traces found
on the Army ski cap

393
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,199
or on the pieces of jewelry
found by Mike's body.

394
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,299
The Army came through
on Mike's recruiting files

395
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,199
and cell records from 2005.

396
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,199
The night of his murder,
he received several calls

397
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,300
from a disposable
cell phone.

398
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,399
A burner phone like that
is sold over the counter.

399
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,699
No way to trace it unless
we get the serial number.

400
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,999
Well, contact
the manufacturer.

401
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,299
Find the store
that sold it.

402
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,399
Whatever you need to
convince them to help.

403
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,700
I'll get on it.

404
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,700
Hey, boss.

405
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,100
Mike took meticulous
notes on his recruits.

406
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Who needed money.

407
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,600
Which ones had trouble in school.

408
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,800
Any of these guys look good
for the pawnshop break-in ?

409
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,900
Took the names of recruits,

410
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,600
cross-checked with
criminal records.

411
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,200
Trey "Meathead" Newman.
One of Mike's prospects

412
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,300
before he got popped for the
first of many felony arrests.

413
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,800
Burglary. Assault.

414
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,700
Burglary again.

415
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,600
You know, Meathead had
a thing for smash-and-grabs.

416
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,700
Just like our pawnshop.

417
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,900
Serving eight to 12
up in Frackville.

418
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,000
Thought I'd drop by.

419
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
Send my regards.

420
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
You had options
as a teenager, Trey.

421
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,500
Career soldier on one hand.

422
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,400
Career criminal
on the other.

423
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,500
How the benefits compare ?

424
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,400
- Ain't no thing.
- You had a chance, though.

425
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,600
With Mike Donley's help,
you could have been something.

426
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,200
You want something from me ?

427
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,800
What do you know

428
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
about the pawnshop break-in
onon 6 Street?

429
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
I know pawnshops is small time.

430
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,300
And you just scream
"big time," Meathead.

431
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
That's why we're here.

432
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,100
Murder's as big as it gets.

433
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,900
Sergeant Mike was a pain
in my ass.

434
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,400
But I didn't kill him.

435
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
Maybe he pushed too hard.

436
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,800
Made you push back.

437
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Pushed ? No.

438
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,900
I was being pulled
another way.

439
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,000
Come on. You can do it, man.
Stay on my hip.

440
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,500
I can't.

441
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,800
Hey. Come on.
Look me in the eye, man.

442
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,600
Do not give up on me because
I will not give up on you.

443
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,700
You understand ?
Come on.

444
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,600
There you go. There you go.
You're doing it.

445
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,700
Oh, look at you.

446
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Hey, come on, man.

447
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
You got something
belonging to us.

448
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,900
Trey ain't not going
to be needing no Army.

449
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,301
He already got one.

450
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,200
6th Street Mafia.
In for life.

451
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I don't think so.

452
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,500
It's your funeral.

453
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,300
Go for it.

454
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,100
Sergeant Mike, chill !

455
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm serious, man.

456
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,500
You're hurting him.

457
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,200
Stop it !

458
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,100
You okay ?

459
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,000
Bumper ?

460
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,000
You and me going to be
having a reckoning.

461
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,200
Come find me.

462
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,800
I ain't running.
Army will shape you up.

463
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,200
That look
in Sergeant Mike's eyes

464
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,800
when he was squeezing
Bumper's throat...

465
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
The guy had some demons.

466
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,800
Bumper ?

467
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,300
You mean Bobby Kerns ?

468
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,800
Yeah, that's right.

469
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Sergeant Mike made life hard
for me

470
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,700
with all that karate crap.

471
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,200
They would have made me pay for
it if I didn't quit training.

472
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,300
What about Bumper ?

473
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
I got busted
a couple weeks later.

474
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Lost track of him.

475
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,000
He the type to go looking
for payback ?

476
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,400
Getting punked like that ?

477
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,800
On 6th Street ?

478
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,500
Would have been a necessity.

479
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,400
I thought Bobby Kerns
had a clean record

480
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,100
until we got the DA
to open his juvie file.

481
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,800
A dozen arrests
before his 17th birthday.

482
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,900
Something he neglected
to tell us.

483
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,600
Past isn't the only thing
he lied about.

484
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,300
Spoke to Army CID.

485
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,000
Bobby's alibi for Mike
and himself fell through.

486
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,300
He wasn't on the 11:00 p.m. bus
to Fort Bragg.

487
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,700
Took the 5:00 a.m. instead.

488
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,100
Means he had plenty of time
to rob the pawnshop.

489
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,200
Kill Mike.

490
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,500
Why would Bobby bring us
the case if he was involved?

491
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,000
Sometimes people need to confess.

492
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,800
They just don't know
how to do it.

493
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,000
Hello ?

494
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,300
I'm on my way.

495
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,300
Everything okay, Lil ?

496
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,100
Yeah. Um...

497
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I just got to take care
of something.

498
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,800
Dad !

499
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,000
Atlantic City.

500
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,900
Nothing happened.

501
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,000
My car gotowed.

502
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,400
Well, it's not my fault

503
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,700
that the impound lot
doesn't open until the morning.

504
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,000
You're up at 6:00 a.m.
with me to go pick it up.

505
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And pay for it.

506
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,100
Fine. I won, like,
500 bucks anyway.

507
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,700
With money
you stole from me.

508
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,800
Maybe this is a conversation
you two can have in the morning.

509
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Easy for you to say.

510
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,400
You don't have to think
about his future.

511
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,300
Then maybe just not
inside my car at 2:00 a.m.

512
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,500
If Cornell admissions
finds out

513
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,900
about your
little adventure,

514
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,500
they'll rescind
your acceptance like this.

515
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,800
So what ?
I'm not going there anyway.

516
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,000
I want to be a cop.

517
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,600
What ?
Don't be ridiculous.

518
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,400
What's ridiculous
about being a cop ?

519
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,200
- I meant for him.
- Oh, but it's okay for me ?

520
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,500
Don't be defensive, Lilly.
I'm not attacking you.

521
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,700
No, it's just my job.

522
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,000
Which, by the way,
is how we found him.

523
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Oh, I should have guessed that
you'd be the one to narc me out.

524
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,200
We waited two hours
outside that casino for you.

525
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,000
If it wasn't for us,
you'd be taking the bus home.

526
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,100
Gee, thanks a lot.

527
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,900
- Watch your tone.
- Or what, Dad ?

528
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,400
You'll walk out on me, too ?

529
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,600
Inside !

530
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,500
What are you waiting for ?

531
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,800
You stood me up four times
for dinner.

532
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
The least you can do is
try my lemon chicken.

533
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,200
Come on let's go.

534
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,800
Please, help yourself.

535
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,000
There you go.

536
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,200
Thank you.

537
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,600
My pleasure.

538
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,000
Well, now...

539
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
don't we make quite the tableau ?

540
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,300
I'm sorry that it took such a dramatic
act of stupidity on my son's part

541
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,900
to finally get you here.

542
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,600
Mom !

543
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,900
Napkin.

544
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,600
It does gives me an opportunity
to clear the air.

545
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
For the last few months,
I sat back while you and Paul

546
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,300
participated in this
excruciating ritual

547
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,500
of secret meetings,
intrigue, angst.

548
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Four perfectly ruined
pot roasts later, here we are.

549
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,200
- Celeste.
- No, I'm not done.

550
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,800
I know you've had
some hard times.

551
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,200
Your mother, God rest her soul,

552
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,600
your work.

553
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,100
But honestly,
we all have something, right?

554
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,800
It's really no excuse.

555
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,900
I'm thrilled that you've been
spending time with Finn.

556
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,900
And despite my husband's
unfathomable recent behavior,

557
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:26,401
he is, too.

558
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,100
But the drama stops tonight,

559
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,300
We're family.

560
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,000
Full stop.

561
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,800
That means birthdays,
holidays,

562
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,600
hospital visits,

563
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,300
God forbid, funerals.
The whole thing.

564
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:43,301
Like it or not,

565
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,100
Lilly Rush,
you are tied to us for good.

566
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,400
Are we clear ?

567
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,100
Okay.

568
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,700
Hey, Bumper...
nice to see you again.

569
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,100
Unfortunately, you left
some key information

570
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,300
out of your story
last time we talked.

571
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,900
Juvie record for one.

572
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,100
Assault, robbery,
weapons possession.

573
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,200
What does that have
to do with anything?

574
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,300
Where were you
when the Prestige Pawnshop

575
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
- was broken into ?
- The bus station, like I told you.

576
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,600
See, now that's a lie, Bobby.

577
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
You missed
the 11:00 p.m. bus.

578
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,900
I'm going to ask again.

579
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,600
WhWhe e we you
when the burglary went down?

580
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
At the bus station.

581
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,300
Yeah, 5:00 A.M.

582
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
That gives you plenty of time
out there on the street.

583
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,600
We got witnesses
remember you that night

584
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,800
looking for Mike.

585
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,900
Went to the gym,
neighborhood diner,

586
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,400
but what happened ?

587
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,700
I had a look at Mike's files.

588
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,500
You were his favorite recruit.
Thought of you like family.

589
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
So the question is

590
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,200
what went down
between you and your brother ?

591
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,700
I brought this to you.

592
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Why would I do that
if I was involved ?

593
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,800
Guilt, Bobby,
plain and simple.

594
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,800
I didn't make the 11:00 p.m. bus

595
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,300
because Mike was supposed
to take me,

596
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,800
but he never showed.

597
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,500
- Why ?
- He changed.

598
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,200
Started missing appointments,

599
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,600
losing his temper.

600
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,300
He wasn't the same guy I knew.

601
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,000
Did you do something about it ?

602
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,200
I tried.

603
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,300
Staff Sergeant Donley ?

604
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,000
Bobby !

605
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
You okay ?

606
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,900
Just having a drink.

607
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,500
You want one ?

608
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,100
You missed our morning workout.

609
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,400
Sorry.

610
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,200
I was, um...

611
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,600
I went to the barber today.

612
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,900
Um... Old friend of mine.

613
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,000
He gave me this letter

614
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,100
from his son Roberto.

615
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
I ever tell you about Roberto ?

616
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,000
First recruit I ever signed.

617
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,400
Roberto is with the Corps
of Engineers.

618
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,600
Doing water purification
in Iraq.

619
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,900
An IED embedded
in some scrap metal went off.

620
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,600
Roberto was caught in the blast.

621
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,600
Lost his legs.

622
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,900
So Roberto writes this letter...

623
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,501
to his dad

624
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,300
telling him to thank me

625
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,900
for giving him
the opportunity to serve.

626
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
His dad's...

627
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:19,101
broke up.

628
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,700
And I just don't got the words.

629
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,800
Like you say, there's always
casualties in war.

630
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,200
Bobby...

631
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,000
I do not want to have
to go to your funeral.

632
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,900
I'll be fine,
Staff Sergeant,

633
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,000
but you need some coffee.

634
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,200
I'll make a pot.

635
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,100
He said he'd sober up
and go home,

636
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,000
but I could tell...

637
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,300
He was living there.

638
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,900
When was this ?

639
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Day before he died.

640
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,300
- Why didn't you tell us ?
- If I'd told you

641
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,700
about it, you wouldn't
have looked into the case.

642
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,200
You don't know that.

643
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,100
People'd think he was
some kind of statistic,

644
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
coateral damage
for the war at home.

645
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,400
Staff Sergeant Donley's
a better man

646
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:08,801
than I'll ever be.

647
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,500
If he's some kind of statistic,

648
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:14,901
what'll I become ?

649
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,000
So Mike's living out of the recruiting station

650
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,100
the week before he was killed,
how come his wife Kristen claims

651
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,500
they were up in the Poconos
on a belated honeymoon ?

652
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,000
- Bad memory ?
- More like selective.

653
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,300
Took a road trip to the cabin
where she was staying.

654
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,400
Manager remembers her.

655
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,800
She came up alone.

656
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,000
Fits Bobby's story.

657
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,800
But it didn't stay that way.

658
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,500
A man joined her
the last night.

659
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Showed the manager
a photo of Mike.

660
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,000
Let me guess.

661
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,500
Wasn't him.

662
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,600
I admire you, Kristen.

663
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,600
Choosing to marry Mike,

664
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
being a soldier's wife.

665
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
It wasn't a choice.
I loved him.

666
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Even though you knew

667
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
that with him,
the Army always came first.

668
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,700
He believed in something.

669
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,800
I believed in him.

670
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,400
Sure.

671
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,500
But all those months
with Mike gone...

672
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,200
you didn't stray once ?

673
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,300
No.

674
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,200
How about after he got back ?

675
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,900
Excuse me.
I was loyal to my husband.

676
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,600
Not up in the Poconos.

677
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,000
Spent your honeymoon
with another man.

678
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,400
Look, Mike moves you
to a strange city,

679
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,500
no friends, no money,

680
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,200
and he was never around.

681
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,600
You're only human.

682
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
You're wrong.

683
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,900
Mike must have found out what you were doing.

684
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,700
You were scared.

685
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
Hell, Mike was Airborne, right ?

686
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,500
A professional killer.
Would have been ugly

687
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,400
- if he caught you.
- Mike wasn't like that.

688
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,300
You said yourself
he had changed.

689
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,500
He was tense, distant.

690
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Could have been afraid
for your life.

691
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,800
Maybe your boyfriend

692
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,000
decided to do something to him;
self-defense.

693
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
I never would have hurt Mike.

694
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,600
The only reason he found out
is because I told him.

695
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,100
We'd just talk, you know ?
We'd have lunch.

696
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,200
It was nothing physical...

697
00:28:58,401 --> 00:28:59,901
until...

698
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
I stayed true to you

699
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,800
through two deployments
to Afghanistan, Mike !

700
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,500
Through every other thing
the Army's thrown at us.

701
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,300
Listen to me !

702
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,900
I've asked for nothing !

703
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,000
Except for three lousy days
up in the Poconos

704
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,300
for a honeymoon that we should
have had five years ago.

705
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,500
You couldn't even give me that.

706
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
So this is my fault ?

707
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,200
That's not what I'm saying.

708
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,300
When you got back
from Afghanistan,

709
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,200
I thought that we'd be able
to spend time.

710
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,400
It's like you're still gone.

711
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,800
That's crap.

712
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,400
That is crap, and you know it.

713
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,200
You're in a constant state
of mourning, Mike,

714
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,100
for Johnny.

715
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,500
You write these speeches
about him.

716
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,800
And you give away his things

717
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,600
like they're relics.

718
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,200
I honor him !

719
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,900
You didn't even like the guy !

720
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,500
He drove you crazy !

721
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,000
But you feel responsible.

722
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,700
I am responsible.

723
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,800
You are a hero, Mike.

724
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,000
Nobody gives
more than you do.

725
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,900
Every day you're
sending support over there

726
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,200
so that Johnny won't have
died for nothing.

727
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,600
That's, that's what I thought.

728
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,200
Yeah, but come on.
Be honest.

729
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,600
I used him to meet quotas,

730
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,800
to put...

731
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:16,301
fresh bodies in the foxholes.

732
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,300
If that's how you feel,

733
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,800
then quit.

734
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,000
Not an option.

735
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,700
Then don't.

736
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,100
But please, do something
because I want my husband back.

737
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,000
Come on. You remember
when we got married ?

738
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,200
That first deployment,
it was nine months, remember ?

739
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,900
And we agreed
if we could survive that,

740
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,600
we could survive anything,

741
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,700
no matter what.

742
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,500
Do you still believe that ?

743
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,000
Answer one question :

744
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,800
Who was it ?

745
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,200
I told him, and he walked
right out the door.

746
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,500
Last time I ever saw him.

747
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,000
Night he died ?

748
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,500
My entire life comes down
to one stupid decision.

749
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,500
I'd give anything
to take it back.

750
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,300
Who was it, Kristen ?

751
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,800
The man you were seeing ?

752
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,800
Mike' boss, sergent Gomez.

753
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,700
You familiar
with the term "Jody,"

754
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,400
First Sergeant Gomez ?

755
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,900
It's what we call a man or woman
who's cheating with a spouse

756
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,500
of a soldier who's overseas.

757
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,800
It can't get much lower
than that, right ?

758
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,300
But you didn't even have

759
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,400
the decency
to wait for Mike to deploy

760
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,200
before going after his wife.

761
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,100
Where's the honor in that ?

762
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,300
There is none.

763
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,400
I made a mistake.

764
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,200
About the affair.

765
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,600
What about the murder ?

766
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,400
You and Kristen got
your stories straight.

767
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,500
Said the same thing about Mike
when he died.

768
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,800
He was distant, tense,

769
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,500
not himself.

770
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,400
I didn't lie about that.
Mike... Mike

771
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,600
was suffering.

772
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,200
And your answer was to get him
out of the way

773
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,400
so you could have his wife
to yourself.

774
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,800
You recognize this ?

775
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,600
Orders for deployment to Iraq.

776
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,100
For Mike Donley.

777
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,100
Who processed them ?

778
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,500
- It's right there at the bottom
of the page. / - I did.

779
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,400
See, if Mike reported you
for the affair,

780
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,500
you would have lost your job
at the recruiting station.

781
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,600
You don't get it.

782
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,000
Mike requested Iraq.

783
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,800
He wanted to go ?

784
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,700
He was tired of seeing his kids
getting hurt and killed.

785
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,900
Couldn't take it anymore.

786
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
I didn't want to lose
my best recruiter,

787
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,700
but it was
what he needed.

788
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,300
I was trying to help.

789
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm sure you're the last person

790
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,100
he wanted help from.

791
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,800
At first, I thought
he was going to kill me.

792
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,900
Do it, Mike ! I deserve it !

793
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,899
I'm sorry, man. I messed up.

794
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,300
I'll get a transfer.
I'll make it scarce.

795
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,699
You and Kristen can work it out.

796
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,600
How am I supposed
to work it out ?

797
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,699
I don't know, man.

798
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,199
I've been divorced
three times.

799
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,900
All I know is soldiering.

800
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,900
She expects me to come back home
and be okay.

801
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,800
They gave me a medal.

802
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,100
Called me a hero.

803
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,199
Still don't know why.

804
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,899
You held off an enemy ambush
for two days.

805
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,700
Or maybe I walked us into it.

806
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,399
Trying to rewrite history ?

807
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,600
I read the after-action report.

808
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,500
You and Johnny were wounded,
pinned down.

809
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,999
Johnny didn't want to move.

810
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,300
I ordered him.

811
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,100
You made a call.

812
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,300
I dragged him down that mountain
inch by inch,

813
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,500
both of us losing blood.

814
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,900
After a while,
he got real quiet.

815
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,500
Started staring off
at nothing.

816
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,100
You know the last thing
he said before he died ?

817
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,100
"It's so beautiful."

818
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,400
What do you think he saw ?

819
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,400
All I saw
were those damn mountains.

820
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,299
You didn't kill him.

821
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,299
They shot me twice.
I should have died.

822
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,299
But you didn't. He did.

823
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,399
You're just
one soldier, Mike.

824
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,899
You got to learn your place
in this thing.

825
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,500
My place is over there
with those kids I sent.

826
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,300
I know.

827
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,800
Your orders to Iraq.
You deploy in 48 hours.

828
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,800
Whatever it is you're looking for,
I hope you find it.

829
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,900
Staff Sergeant Donley.

830
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,900
Stay there.

831
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,800
Gotta go.

832
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,400
That was the last I saw him.

833
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,999
I never spoke to Kristen again,
either,

834
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,299
not even at the funeral.

835
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,499
So why didn't you report yourself
to your officer in charge ?

836
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,299
Take your punishment ?

837
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,500
Finding more kids
to send over there

838
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,900
instead of going over
to fight myself,

839
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,100
that's my punishment.

840
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,500
Who was on the phone ?

841
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,500
Always assumed it was Kristen.

842
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,799
So Mike wasn't putting Bobby
on the bus to Fort Bragg

843
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,699
the night of his murder.

844
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,799
The guy was confronting
First Sergeant Gomez.

845
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,999
When he was supposedly breaking
into the pawnshop.

846
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,699
11:30, he gets the call.
Leaves the recruiting station.

847
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,599
Never seen alive again.

848
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,899
The phone records say
that call came

849
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,099
from the same disposable phone
called Mike's cell

850
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,099
five times that night.

851
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,999
Someone desperate to reach him.

852
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,499
I tracked the
cell's serial number.

853
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,799
It was purchased a few days
before Mike's death

854
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,199
at a convenience store
on 6th and Girard.

855
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,499
That's close
to where Mike was killed.

856
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,200
Yeah. Guess who used to work
there part-time after school.

857
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,499
You had a tough childhood,
didn't you, Victoria ?

858
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,900
Family who didn't give a crap,

859
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
a dead-end job at the bodega,

860
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,199
no hope of a futur.

861
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,800
Doesn't matter where you been,
only matters where you're going.

862
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,000
I like that.

863
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,299
Learn it from Mike ?

864
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,499
I guess so.

865
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,199
The Army was your way out.

866
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,499
Education, benefits, bonus.

867
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,399
How much was it again ?

868
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,599
$20,000.

869
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,100
You just had to wait
till your 18th birthday.

870
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,700
Your life was going to change.

871
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,100
Recognize this ?

872
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,599
- No.
- You barely looked.

873
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,000
Take your time.

874
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,800
It's a pretty piece.
Tasteful.

875
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,399
Not cheap either.

876
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,200
You could never afford it
on minimum wage.

877
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,699
When this is done, I could do you a solid.
Make it disappear.

878
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,899
Look, what's your point ?

879
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,599
Remember the Prestige Pawnshop ?

880
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,599
You'd go in there all the time
and try this necklace on.

881
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,599
The owner recognized
your photo.

882
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,599
If you say so.

883
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,699
Minute you got that bonus,
you were going to buy it.

884
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,499
Only problem, you didn't pass
that Army entrance exam.

885
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,599
Wasn't a big deal.
I retook the test.

886
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,599
Passed the second time.

887
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,199
After they lowered
their requirements.

888
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,399
Army was hungry for recruits,
no matter how unqualified.

889
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,799
Ma'am, I am
an outstanding soldier.

890
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,299
Now.

891
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,999
But four years ago, you were an
angry girl looking to lash out.

892
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,299
You saw this necklace
that you could never afford.

893
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,800
You decided
to just take it.

894
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,199
Neighborhood's dangerous.

895
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,899
Stores are always
getting robbed.

896
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,999
Is that why your boss
at the bodega kept a gun

897
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,300
behind the counter ?

898
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,699
Ran it through
ballistics.

899
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,500
It's the same gun
that killed Mike.

900
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,199
If you respect
that uniform at all,

901
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,000
you're going to tell me
what happened.

902
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,499
Don't you see
that I'm taking on his work,

903
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,999
helping kids change their lives ?

904
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,399
It's got to count for something.

905
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,299
Sure, it does.

906
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,399
So be a good soldier, Victoria.

907
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,300
Tell me the truth !

908
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,400
I got the gun.

909
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,400
I smashed the window
in the store.

910
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,200
I knew right away
I messed up.

911
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,400
That's why I called Mike.

912
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,500
'Cause you had
no one else to call.

913
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,000
'Cause I was trying
to make it right.

914
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,700
And he was going to turn you in.

915
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,900
Worse.

916
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,500
He was going to abandon me.

917
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,400
Victoria !

918
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,000
Victoria !

919
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:18,401
Hey, you okay ?

920
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,300
I ruined everything, Mike.

921
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,800
They're going to lock me up.

922
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,000
What happened ?

923
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,100
I broke into the pawnshop.

924
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,500
I wanted this so bad.

925
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,700
I just...

926
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:30,201
What am I going to do ?
Cops are everywhere.

927
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
How am I supposed to get home ?

928
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,800
You're going to come clean.

929
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,500
We're going to go
to the cops.

930
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,400
You're going to give
the jewelry back.

931
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,300
It's what soldiers do.

932
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,200
But I'm not a soldier, Mike.

933
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,500
Didn't they tell you ?

934
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,600
I failed the exam.

935
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,800
You're going to pass
the next time.

936
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,500
Not if I'm a felon.

937
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,200
I will talk to whoever
I have to,

938
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,100
smooth it over.
My word of honor, Victoria.

939
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,500
I will clear this up
for you.

940
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,000
Come on.

941
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,900
You're going to study
for the test again

942
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,600
and you're gonna
ace it.

943
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,500
I'll even get some of the guys
at the recruiting station to tutor you.

944
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,100
You can tutor me.

945
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,500
Got my orders.

946
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,600
I deploy Iraq in two days.

947
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,900
What ?

948
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,800
You can't leave.

949
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,900
I have to, Victoria.

950
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,600
I got to serve with the kids
I sent there.

951
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,800
Who'll be with me ?

952
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,000
Victoria...

953
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,800
My mom's kicking me out

954
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,900
if I don't get
that bonus money.

955
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Where am I going to go ?!

956
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,400
Put the gun down, okay?
I will help you.

957
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,200
How are you going to help me
if you're not here ?

958
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,300
You don't care
about what happens!

959
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,900
You're just trying
to get rid of me !

960
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,000
Stop it. That is not true.

961
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,600
I thought you believed in me,

962
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,900
but you're a liar

963
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,400
- like everyone else !
- No, I...

964
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,700
that's so beautiful

965
00:41:35,501 --> 00:41:39,501
