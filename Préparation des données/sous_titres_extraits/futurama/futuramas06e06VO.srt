3
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:26,776
I fear I may not survive
this war reenactment.

4
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,946
I can't believe we're only 12 feet
from the parking lot.

5
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,633
This is every bit as fun
as the real Civil War.

6
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,243
Not the Civil War, private.

7
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,518
We're reenacting the Sith-al War.

8
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:38,454
Sith?

9
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:39,881
What the hoth?

10
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,625
Enemy invaders up in yonder sky!

11
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,274
I am Darth Stroyer.

12
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:00,934
Darth Stroyer?

13
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,405
That's the stupidest name
I've ever heard.

14
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,864
Let's hear the rest.

15
00:01:05,504 --> 00:01:06,754
Darth Trocious.

16
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:08,693
Darth Sploder.

17
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:10,987
Darth Urderer.

18
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:13,470
Darth It-head.

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,220
Company, attack!

20
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:26,002
Don't fire till you see
the greens of their eyes.

21
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,587
It saves on bullets.

22
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:46,062
I shall rip out your heart
and show it to you.

23
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:48,644
It is done.

24
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:51,170
The candle
that burns twice as bright

25
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:52,743
burns half as long.

26
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:02,219
- You're dead.
- No, I'm just very old.

27
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,337
That's good acting.

28
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,296
It's payback time, Sploder.

29
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,769
Tell my mother...

30
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:21,281
To pick me up outside Quizno's.

31
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,306
That's three dead.

32
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,498
Let's pick up the pace, people.

33
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:30,200
At this point in the actual War,
the death toll was 98 million.

34
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,986
You humans and your fragile organs.

35
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,134
One little stab to the goo, and...

36
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:39,795
You're dead, Earth man.

37
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,995
Cruel fate, I'm dead.

38
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:45,276
They're putting me in my Sunday suit

39
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:47,416
and shoving me in a wooden box.

40
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,214
Now they're lowering me
into the cold, cold ground.

41
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,373
Hello, here come the worms.

42
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:59,011
If you were really dead,
you wouldn't be laughing so hard.

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,230
Death's a big deal
to you flesh bags,

44
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:06,185
but in case you didn't notice,
I'm a robot.

45
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:09,364
So? What if something heavy
fell on you, like a church?

46
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,860
You could still die.

47
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:15,025
My wireless backup unit
saves a copy of me every day,

48
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:17,772
If my body gets killed, big whoop,

49
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,994
I just download into another body.

50
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:22,097
- I'm immortal, baby.
- What?

51
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:25,037
Then how come you always scream
when you're in danger?

52
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,790
I never said I wasn't a drama queen.

53
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,335
And the winner of the war is...

54
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:34,130
Let me just cross-check
my tabulation here.

55
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:36,507
Factor in the corsages
for the widows...

56
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,408
Hurry up,
you number-crunching crumbnuncher.

57
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,721
Everybody but me
is dying of old age.

58
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:45,533
The winners, at a net cost

59
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,762
of only $12 per life
cut tragically short,

60
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,813
our Sith Overlords.

61
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:53,799
Hot diggity.

62
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,064
I mean...

63
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,875
Supreme diggity.

64
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,980
- Good war...
- Good war...

65
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:13,419
It may have been a fake war,
but my scuffed knee is all too real.

66
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,151
I've got pains in joints
I had removed a century ago.

67
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,843
Bender, bring me my soft chair
with the wheels on it.

68
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,488
- Your wheelchair?
- I don't need a wheelchair!

69
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:25,348
The one with the wheels.

70
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:27,609
Poor flimsy humans.

71
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,273
Don't you wish
you were flawless like me?

72
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,772
A towering inferno
of physical perfection?

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,400
I hate to pop your blimp-like ego,
but you are not perfect.

74
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,111
- Am so.
- Are not.

75
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,779
- Is too.
- Says who?

76
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,676
Says the only human whose opinion
I even remotely respect.

77
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:47,795
Inspector five,

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,540
the best inspector a kid could want.

79
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,204
The day I was built,
he looked me over,

80
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,327
probably with tears of pride
in his eyes,

81
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:57,452
and proclaimed to all the world,

82
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,631
by means of this scrap of paper,

83
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:00,967
that I was perfect

84
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:03,710
and infallible in every way.

85
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:05,555
Mr. Perfect,

86
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,223
you wet the chair.

87
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:09,374
Wasn't me.

88
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:11,978
Must be some of that urine
you're all so proud of.

89
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,440
That's not urine. It's oil.

90
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:16,592
Impossible.

91
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,735
I'm triple-sealed
to prevent any chance of...

92
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:23,239
You call that an ink defense?

93
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:28,077
Good-bye, friends.

94
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,664
What could have caused that?

95
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,958
Excessive heat,
on account of I'm so hot?

96
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,070
Alas, no.

97
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:40,423
I'm afraid it's a symptom
of a fatal defect.

98
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,116
Fatal, shmatal.

99
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,743
If I die,
I can download my backup copy

100
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:47,430
into a new, equally fabulous body.

101
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,689
That's just it. You can't.

102
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:52,602
You were built
without a backup unit.

103
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,772
There's no backup copy of me?

104
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:58,441
That's what I just said,
you mortal coil.

105
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:00,276
So, if I die...

106
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,344
You die, or as you put it...

107
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,301
Excuse me for a moment.

108
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,506
I can't believe it!
I'm gonna die!

109
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,966
How much time
does he have left, Professor?

110
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,552
Between a minute
and a billion years.

111
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,991
At least you can plan accordingly.

112
00:06:29,116 --> 00:06:30,568
Dying sucks butt!

113
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,809
How do you living beings cope
with mortality?

114
00:06:33,124 --> 00:06:35,596
- Violent outbursts.
- General sluttiness.

115
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:37,772
Thanks to denial, I'm immortal.

116
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,899
Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect!

117
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,568
Inspector five gave me his blessing!

118
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,196
How could he bring me into this world,
knowing I would die?

119
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:47,657
So you wish you
were never born, maybe?

120
00:06:48,477 --> 00:06:51,869
Anything less than immortality
is a complete waste of time.

121
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,554
Then suicide it is.

122
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,056
Step into my office.

123
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll give you a nice kevorking.

124
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,468
Not until I hunt down inspector five

125
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,254
and beat an explanation out of him.

126
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,048
I'm all for a good beating,
but you'll never find him.

127
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:06,293
Product inspectors are bureaucrats,

128
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,886
faceless bean-counters
who blend into the woodwork.

129
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,596
I beg to differ.

130
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:12,924
Stinkin' bureaucrats... I hate 'em!

131
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:16,659
Then again,
you might be able to find inspector five

132
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,604
with the help of another
seasoned bureaucrat.

133
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:21,692
- Hermes, old pal.
- Old pal?

134
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,386
8.5 seconds ago,
you said you hated me.

135
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,216
Time heals all wounds.

136
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,658
You know what? I will help you,

137
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,743
but only to prove
I'm not a paper-pushing file jockey.

138
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,995
Will you be taking
your portable filing cabinet?

139
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,621
None of your beeswax.

140
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:40,195
I'll only be away an hour,
but I'm counting on you

141
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,503
to do the all-critical filing
in my absence.

142
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,758
Shall we review alphabetical order?

143
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,550
- <i>A, B, C, D</i>...
- Get out of my office.

144
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,786
I'd like to request
a death certificate.

145
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,567
<i>Sorry, that's Building C.</i>

146
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,357
The Central Bureaucracy
maintains records on all bureaucrats.

147
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,692
We should be able
to look up inspector five.

148
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:11,199
Application for ingress approved.

149
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,460
And the other potential entrant?

150
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,496
- He's my pencil sharpener.
- You betcha!

151
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:21,523
Proceed.

152
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:39,227
I maintain a cubicle here
for weekend getaways.

153
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,290
Until now, I thought
giant cubes were exciting.

154
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,169
I did like the part
where they screamed.

155
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:10,416
This is mine,
right next to the Center Square.

156
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,316
Sorry, Hermes,
I drank all your white-out.

157
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:16,780
Once I log in,

158
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:19,250
I can access
inspector five's profile.

159
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,944
Damn it, it won't go on!

160
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:26,559
That's because you're not me.

161
00:09:26,684 --> 00:09:28,569
Hooray, it won't go on!

162
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,301
The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone

163
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,155
but the assigned bureaucrat log in.

164
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:36,119
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

165
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:39,162
<i>Also, you have a rectangular mass
in your colon.</i>

166
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:42,081
That's a calculator.
I ate it to gain its power.

167
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,912
You locate inspector five

168
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:46,312
while I slip
into my ass-kicking feet.

169
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:50,648
Sweet file-not-found
of Puegot sound.

170
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:52,342
His record's been blanked.

171
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,553
How am I gonna find
some anonymous guy

172
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,305
I don't know anything about?

173
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,515
I recommend the men's room
at the T.W.A. Terminal.

174
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:13,844
Okay, just file it alphabetically...

175
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:15,949
<i>A-B-C-D...</i>

176
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,452
This requires
a little extra thought.

177
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:23,815
I'm a natural.

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,211
The information we need will be here,
in the physical files.

179
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,798
Those bastards won't know
what leafed through them.

180
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,685
It's on.

181
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:49,857
No! This is impossible!

182
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,776
Quit blacking out and look at this.

183
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:53,295
Inspector One,

184
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,338
Two, Three, Four,

185
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:56,391
Six!

186
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:58,791
There's no trace of inspector five!

187
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,618
But five's the one we want!

188
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,389
Maybe if I kicked the asses
of inspector Two,

189
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:06,875
- plus inspector Three...
- Addition never solved anything, mon.

190
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:09,081
Let's cut our losses and go home.

191
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,312
So I'm doomed to die,

192
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:17,302
and I'll never even get
to punch whoever's responsible?

193
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:19,387
What's the point?

194
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:23,141
Suicide isn't necessarily
the answer.

195
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,663
It's not a suicide booth,
you lard ass.

196
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,414
It's a phone booth.

197
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,599
They have phones in booths now?

198
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:32,192
Finally, I don't have to lug
this cell phone around.

199
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,574
Who the hell is this?
How did you get this number?

200
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,228
Is this the robot company?

201
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:45,823
'Cause I have a complaint about
a defective robot.

202
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:47,207
His name is me!

203
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:50,021
A defective robot, you say?

204
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:53,416
Stay right there, dearie.

205
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,270
I'll have tech support
take care of you.

206
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:01,095
- Things are starting to look up.
- Look up!

207
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,813
Who did you call, dial-a-bomb?

208
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:11,981
No, I just told the robot company
I was defective.

209
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:14,350
You dumb cocktail shaker!

210
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:17,299
Mom won't allow a defective product
to tarnish her good name!

211
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:18,404
She'll kill you!

212
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,137
Big whoop.
I'll just download into a new...

213
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:22,437
Oh, right.

214
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:24,077
If I die, I die.

215
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,705
Speaking of which...

216
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,247
You're right. You're right.

217
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,472
That's what you get
for calling tech support.

218
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,451
I can't run anymore.
I'll have to skip.

219
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,088
Just a few more feet.

220
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:56,025
We have to get
to that pile of dead bears by 7:38.

221
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,873
A pile of dead bears
can only mean one thing.

222
00:12:59,112 --> 00:12:59,988
But what?

223
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,201
It's the 7:38!

224
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:06,674
Jump!

225
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,774
- Shoot!
- Someone said shoot.

226
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:33,271
- Well, we're boned.
- No, we're not!

227
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:34,764
We just got to limbo.

228
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,858
But I'm not designed
to bend that low.

229
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,596
Not without limbo music.

230
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:41,849
That'll do it!

231
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:48,912
- We're gonna get fired.
- Someone said fire.

232
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,042
- We did it!
- 12 straight hours of limbo.

233
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,031
I haven't done
that since my honeymoon.

234
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:07,474
Hermes, Hermes,
remember that flock of bats?

235
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,712
- I sure do.
- That was fun.

236
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,935
Where are we?

237
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:13,436
I have no idea.

238
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,240
We're just a stone's throw
from Tijuana.

239
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,550
See?

240
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,553
<i>Dios mio!</i>

241
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:31,672
A rock has fallen here

242
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:34,504
in the outskirts of Tijuana.

243
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:36,591
Is it within the city limit?

244
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:37,899
I think, yes.

245
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:39,045
Told you.

246
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,136
You want to celebrate our escape?

247
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:44,050
Maybe grab a shot of Tequila
and take in a big-league cockfight?

248
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,377
Sure. No, wait.

249
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:47,010
I was built in Tijuana.

250
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,556
Maybe inspector five
still works there.

251
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:53,193
He better do some splainin'
before I mash up some face

252
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:54,561
guacamole.

253
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,100
He's Mexican, I'm Mexican.

254
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,483
Let me handle this.

255
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,944
<i>Sus papeles, por favor.</i>

256
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:13,088
Here are our passports, visas,
and Homeland Security permission slips.

257
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,831
Notarized and starched.

258
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:19,629
I also would have accepted a bribe.

259
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,779
Nice work, butterball.

260
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,393
I was in Italy last week.

261
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,766
My birthplace. It's closed!

262
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:35,465
There's not even a shrine to me
with a gift shop,

263
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,270
selling piñatas of me!

264
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,754
End of the line, mon.

265
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,798
Come on, we can still catch
a twi-night double-cockfight.

266
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,361
No, wait!
What's that in the Mexican garbage?

267
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:48,031
- Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper.
- No, next to that.

268
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:52,427
A half-eaten employee directory.

269
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:56,122
Inspector five's home address!

270
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,818
His ass-ias is <i>gracias</i>!

271
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,104
Where are you hiding, you coward?

272
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:14,224
Get out here
and get murdered like a man!

273
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,532
Bender,
I'm afraid our search is at an end.

274
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:19,386
He's obviously long gone.

275
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:23,191
Well, maybe this is him
in a costume!

276
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:27,170
I'm gonna squeeze you out of there
like Tijuana toothpaste!

277
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,180
Okay, Bender, you're mortal.

278
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:38,748
And okay, inspector five screwed up.

279
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:42,043
But that just makes the time
you have left all the more precious.

280
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:45,118
Do you really to waste
the rest of your life in a bitter,

281
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:46,415
homicidal rage?

282
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,193
I don't know!

283
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,833
Why?

284
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,011
Why did he do this to me?

285
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:06,067
All I wanted was
a little quality control.

286
00:17:06,363 --> 00:17:09,325
But he didn't care enough,
and now I'm gonna die!

287
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,458
I deserved better!

288
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,048
I'm Bender, damn it!

289
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:15,157
I'm Bender!

290
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:20,606
There, there, mon.
It's gonna be okay.

291
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:22,092
You are Bender,

292
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:24,961
which is something inspector five
will never be.

293
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:28,468
You know what? You're right.

294
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:30,760
He was just a stupid bureaucrat.

295
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,976
A stupid, paper-pushing bureaucrat.

296
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:35,388
A stupid I-dotting,
chair-squashing...

297
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,717
No offense, Hermes.
You're not like that.

298
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:42,581
I mean, you're exactly like that,
but you're okay.

299
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,399
In fact, I'm putting you
on the do-not-kill list.

300
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:50,487
Come on, fellow mortal.
We're in Tijuana.

301
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:52,322
I want to live a little.

302
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:55,992
I'm gonna die!
That's the opposite of what I want!

303
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:03,041
Quick, run out the back!

304
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,756
I'll hack into inspector five's terminal
and fake your death,

305
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:07,295
they'll call off the kill-bots.

306
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:09,339
You know
that terminal is unhackable!

307
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:11,777
I'm not leaving you,
and that's final!

308
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:13,259
Good luck, buddy.

309
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:26,106
<i>Bender terminated.</i>

310
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:27,565
Bender's saved.

311
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:30,930
Cease fire.

312
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,696
Mom called off the attack,

313
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:35,434
- although I don't see how it's her.
- Someone said Howitzer!

314
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:55,469
He did it!

315
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:58,888
And he's not looking back
at that cool explosion.

316
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:00,693
He's a hero!

317
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,855
What's happening?

318
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:10,066
The phone's been disconnected,
the ship's repossessed

319
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,095
and Zoidberg's getting overcooked!

320
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,990
This place never changes.

321
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:19,492
What in the name of Jah happened?

322
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,163
Too much papers!
Not enough hiding plants!

323
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:24,435
It's all right.

324
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,983
This place just needs
a one-hour bureaucratizing.

325
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,784
You make it look so easy.

326
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:36,384
I've smoked a lot a paperwork
in my day.

327
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,596
Bender, did you ever find
that inspector guy you were looking for?

328
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,374
But thanks to this knucklehead,

329
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:44,392
I did find a new outlook on life.

330
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,161
It's precious and sacred,

331
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:49,075
and you only get so many millions
of years on this Earth.

332
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,774
So let's get brick-faced!
