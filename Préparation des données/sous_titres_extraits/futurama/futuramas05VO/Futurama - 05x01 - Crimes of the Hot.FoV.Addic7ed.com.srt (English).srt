00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,409
Futurama [5x01] - Crimes Of The Hot - CiWaN

2
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:37,525
Hurry up with the water.
I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am.

3
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:39,012
It's that hot, it is.

4
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:49,652
Man, it's hot. How hot is it?

5
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:52,850
It's so hot, I poured McDonald's
coffee in my lap to cool off.

6
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:55,892
Johnny Carson said it.

7
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:01,681
No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water!
It's full of chlorine.

8
00:01:12,693 --> 00:01:15,207
Lightweights.
Oh, wait, chlorine.

9
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:27,370
Perhaps this movie will help
take our minds off the heat.

10
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,291
Focus!

11
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:38,803
Global Warming
or: None Like It Hot!

12
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,805
You're probably wondering
why your ice cream went away.

13
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:54,683
Well, Suzie, the culprit isn't foreigners.
It's global warming.

14
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:57,970
Gwobal wap-Po?
Yeah.

15
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:04,008
Meet Mr. Sunbeam. He comes all the
way from the sun to visit Earth.

16
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:07,927
Hello, Earth.
Just popping in to brighten your day.

17
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,004
La-La-La-La-La-La-La.

18
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,482
And now I'll be on my way.

19
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:16,202
Not so fast, sunbeam.
We're greenhouse gases.

20
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:19,092
You ain't going nowhere.

21
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:24,731
Oh, God, it hurts!

22
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,726
Pretty soon, Earth is
chock-Full of sunbeams...

23
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:30,453
Their rotting corpses
heating our atmosphere.

24
00:02:32,813 --> 00:02:35,964
How do we get rid of
the greenhouse gases?

25
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:39,682
Fortunately, our handsomest
politicians came up with a cheap...

26
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:42,242
Last-Minute way to
combat global warming.

27
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:46,725
Ever since 2063,
we simply drop a giant ice cube...

28
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:49,930
Into the ocean every now and then.

29
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:53,805
Just like Daddy puts in
his drink every morning.

30
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,770
And then he gets mad.

31
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:59,522
Of course, since the greenhouse
gases are still building up...

32
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:03,242
It takes more and more ice each time.

33
00:03:03,413 --> 00:03:06,132
Thus, solving the
problem once and for all.

34
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:07,851
But--
Once and for all!

35
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:13,452
Well, we just need one
of those big ice cubes.

36
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:15,683
Call the losers who were
supposed to deliver it.

37
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,203
Hello?
President Nixon here.

38
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,089
I'm hiring you losers to
deliver the ice. And hurry up.

39
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:28,087
I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover
trying to squeeze into a new girdle.

40
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:34,046
You heard the good news, everyone.
Save the Earth, et cetera, et cetera. Bye.

41
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,046
Wait. Where do we get the ice?
The what?

42
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:39,363
Oh, Halley's comet, of course.

43
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:43,492
The only sufficient source of ice
cubes that don't have bugs in them.

44
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:46,292
Wow. Mining a comet.
That sounds fun.

45
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:49,604
Yes. There's no safer
occupation than mining.

46
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:52,082
Especially when you're
perched on a snowball...

47
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:55,131
Whipping through space at
a million miles an hour.

48
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:58,524
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

49
00:03:58,693 --> 00:03:59,967
Safe.

50
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,651
Deploying ice drill.

51
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:32,369
Wow. That ice dispenser's
so big the ice crushes you.

52
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,282
Yakov Smirnoff said it.
No, he didn't.

53
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:38,250
Activating ice drill.

54
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:53,089
Oh, my God! It's out of ice!
Like some outer-Space Motel 6.

55
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:54,971
Completely out of ice?

56
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:59,445
This could mean the end of the
banana daiquiri as we know it.

57
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:02,571
Also life.

58
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:12,331
With Halley's comet out of ice...

59
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:17,283
Earth is experiencing the devastating
effects of intense global warming.

60
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:19,842
Morbo is pleased but sticky.

61
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:22,686
The scorching heat has
melted the polar icecaps...

62
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:26,004
Causing floods of biblical proportion.

63
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,448
They called me crazy
for building this ark.

64
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:32,162
You are crazy. You filled it
with same-Sex animal couples.

65
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,121
Hey! There are parts of the Bible
I like and parts I don't like.

66
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:39,171
Direct your pity now to
the African turtles...

67
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:43,042
Seen here migrating to
cooler homes in Holland.

68
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,607
That poor turtle.

69
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:52,809
No. Never.

70
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:59,929
Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads
peace amongst the Dutch tulips.

71
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,448
I'm sure those windmills
will keep them cool.

72
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,081
Windmills do not work that way!
Good night!

73
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,612
Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle.
What have you done with your lives?

74
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,446
You went all the way to Holland already?

75
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,764
Bender, a turtle isn't yourself.
Why do you care about it?

76
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:26,892
Because I also care deeply about
things that remind me of myself.

77
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,408
Like poor little Shelly here.

78
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:34,090
What could you possibly have in
common with this walking soup mix?

79
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:37,848
For one thing, we both
have a tough outer shell.

80
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:41,244
But lead a rich, inner life.
And also...

81
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:42,687
Well, you know.

82
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:46,289
You're both alcoholic, whore-Mongering,
chain-Smoking gamblers?

83
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:48,330
No. It's just...

84
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:52,004
Neither of us can get up when
we get knocked on our back.

85
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:55,165
What? I've seen you get up
off your back tons of times.

86
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,848
Those times I was slightly on my side.
Interesting.

87
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:01,925
Maybe we should test this erectile
dysfunction of yours, Bender.

88
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:07,326
No, that's not necessary, really.
I think I hear my factory recalling me.

89
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:15,042
That's what I get for sharing
my vulnerability with you.

90
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:17,488
Calling all scientists.

91
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:22,443
There will be a worldwide conference
on global warming in Kyoto, Japan.

92
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,649
I've got a degree in
homeopathic medicine.

93
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:26,644
You've got a degree in baloney.

94
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:32,165
Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist.
Forget it. I'm not going.

95
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,801
I have my reasons.
Shut up, all of you!

96
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,492
Strange.

97
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:40,805
You haven't acted this suspicious since
I found the "ape bones" in the basement.

98
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:43,692
My hip hurts. I'm in the
middle of cooking a turkey.

99
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:47,846
I have warranty cards to fill out.
I am not just making excuses.

100
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:50,083
All right, I'll go!

101
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,883
I can't believe it!
I love you!

102
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,566
It's Professor Hubert Farnsworth!

103
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:12,408
He's looking sharp in a standard
white lab coat and dark slacks.

104
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,450
His wristwatch is a Casio.

105
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,162
Thank you all for coming.

106
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,962
It is my pleasure to introduce the host
of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention.

107
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:27,412
The inventor of the environment and
first emperor of the moon, AI Gore.

108
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,772
I have ridden the mighty moon worm.

109
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,242
Good for him.

110
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:38,645
My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss
in my book, Earth in the Balance...

111
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:42,647
And the much more popular Harry
Potter and the Balance of Earth...

112
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:47,489
We need to defend our planet against
pollution, as well as dark wizards.

113
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:52,127
Sure, blame the wizards.

114
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:55,012
That's why I'm offering
a bag of moon sapphires...

115
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:59,007
To the first scientist who can
solve this problem once and for all.

116
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,851
Ah... . Ooh... .

117
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:04,051
Lovely, aren't they?
Sapphires?

118
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:07,810
With those, I could
open the gate of Girash.

119
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:10,692
First up is Professor Ogden Wornstrum.

120
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,925
Wornstrum!

121
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:19,886
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have placed in orbit a giant mirror...

122
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:25,173
That will reflect 40 percent of the
sun's rays, thus cooling Earth. Observe.

123
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,886
Problem solved.

124
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:54,164
That's a little bright.

125
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,883
All right. What else we got?

126
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,692
Professor, you're a professor.
You must have some ideas.

127
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:15,244
Absolutely not! I won't speak.
I've got nothing to hide.

128
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:18,883
Our next speaker is Professor--
I demand the floor!

129
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:24,923
Yes, it's your turn to speak.
Well, nuts to me. I'm taking the stage.

130
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:29,131
I know the source of
the greenhouse gases...

131
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:34,128
But in my shame, I've kept
it secret for 75 long years.

132
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:39,003
Oh, it haunts my memory still.

133
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,923
Professor, no! Don't do it!
Don't do what?

134
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:46,644
Don't use this memory ray so I can
remember what happened back then?

135
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:53,409
It was October 17 at 1:54 p.M.
And 14 birds were flying by the window.

136
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:56,690
I was working at Mom's
Friendly Robot Company.

137
00:10:56,853 --> 00:11:02,610
Back then, robots were slow-Moving,
stiff and a little on the uptight side.

138
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:07,483
Oh, dear, might I favor master
with a tender kiss on the forehead?

139
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:11,009
Oh, I've failed again.

140
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:14,891
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

141
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:19,090
The company's owner pressured
me to create a sportier robot.

142
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:22,926
Stop!

143
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:29,049
It wasn 't easy. But by sacrificing
fuel efficiency, I succeeded.

144
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,449
What was that?
A flaming burp.

145
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:36,764
Does it always do that?
It's not always a burp.

146
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:39,083
We still have one problem, though.

147
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,972
This robot would never
meet emission standards.

148
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,452
Crap spackle!

149
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:47,572
We'll just call it a sport utility
robot and classify it as a light truck.

150
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,086
Well...

151
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:52,962
I suppose the environment can
take one more for the team.

152
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:54,885
What a fool I was!

153
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:59,092
If only I had made the effort to
develop a cleaner-Burning robot...

154
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,687
But I was tired and in love.

155
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:04,162
Take me now, you stud.

156
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:13,282
Oh, this is all my fault!

157
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:16,445
That's awful, professor.
Especially the making-Out part.

158
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:18,843
Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.

159
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:23,848
All modern robots descend from my
original smog-Blasting designs...

160
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:27,005
And that's the cause
of global warming today.

161
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:31,689
So the robots are to blame,
as I suspected.

162
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:37,052
We are left with only one possible
course of action, grim though it be.

163
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:39,010
I got a good feeling about this.

164
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:41,892
We must immediately and permanently...

165
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:46,649
Shut down, dismantle
and destroy all robots!

166
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:51,445
Wait! Surely there's a better--
The conference is over.

167
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:54,730
I must go now to help
collect cans on Jupiter.

168
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:56,246
Peace out, y'all.

169
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:03,531
Destroy all robots!
Destroy all robots!

170
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:08,289
Poor Bender.
Be brave, my friend.

171
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:19,490
Come on. You've got to come
out of your chest sometime.

172
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:22,087
Would you do it for a Bender snack?

173
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,361
Ah-Ha!
Gotcha!

174
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:28,889
Let me go!
I don't even want the stupid beer.

175
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:34,810
Yes! You tried to trick me
into coming out of my chest.

176
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,964
But who has the beer now?

177
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,851
I've got mail.

178
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,564
It's a party, apparently.

179
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:52,245
Do you like to party?
To boogie down?

180
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:56,372
Well, I'm throwing an all-Night
beach rager for my robot pals.

181
00:13:56,533 --> 00:14:00,242
It all goes down this Saturday on
the isolated Galápagos lslands...

182
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,369
Where there will be no escape...

183
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:05,684
From the fun.
All robots must attend!

184
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,525
Strange.

185
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:11,766
Why would Nixon, an awkward,
uncomfortable man, throw a party?

186
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:14,288
One of the most social
events imaginable?

187
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:18,090
It's a trap is why! They're going
to deactivate all the robots.

188
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:22,925
I don't hear any gasping.
We all figured that out.

189
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:25,887
Oh... .
Well, I'm off.

190
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:29,250
We can hide you. We'll pile fruit
on you and claim you're a bowl.

191
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:32,769
No. I'm going to the party.
I won't let you!

192
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:36,972
Fry, as you know, there are lots
of things I'm willing to kill for.

193
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:41,092
Jewels, vengeance,
Father O'Malley's weed whacker.

194
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:45,087
But at long last, I've found
something I'm willing to die for.

195
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:47,562
This mindless turtle.

196
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:50,167
Bender, this world isn't
good enough for you.

197
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,244
Not even close.

198
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:56,042
Goodbye, everybody.
Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead.

199
00:14:57,293 --> 00:14:59,090
It's booby-Trapped!

200
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,612
Oh, yeah, baby!
Come on. Come on, baby.

201
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:35,163
Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel
better if I had a drink.

202
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:39,008
Crummy keg, it's completely tapped--

203
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:41,323
Oh, you're a robot.
Don't stop.

204
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:43,927
Ew!
Attention, happening robots.

205
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,971
Who's got what it takes
to party with Nixon?

206
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:53,330
You fellas enjoy yourselves
for the next two hours...

207
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:57,008
And be sure not to leave the
island for at least two hours.

208
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,164
I'm going out to pick up some smokes.

209
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,971
Really good smokes.

210
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,452
Two hours.

211
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:08,403
Okay, headless body of Agnew,
let's blow this joint.

212
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:22,201
Do you want to dance?
No, I'm not really in the--

213
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,091
You know you want to.

214
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,167
Per your orders, I modified my mirror...

215
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,166
To fire a colossal electromagnetic
pulse at the Galápagos.

216
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,848
Every robot will be instantly
and painfully terminated.

217
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:39,208
Now, for your part of the bargain.

218
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,685
Very well.
Agnew, you belong to Wornstrum now.

219
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,890
I'll say goodbye now.

220
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:51,011
There ain't no turtles
where Daddy's going.

221
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:54,927
Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's
about to shut all the robots off and--

222
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,128
What?

223
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:01,971
We're gonna die!
We're going to the great beyond.

224
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,408
Nixon's not bringing the smokes.

225
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,651
Shut up and pay attention to me.
Bender.

226
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:18,602
Look, I love life and its
pleasures as much as anyone here.

227
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,570
Except perhaps you, Hedonism Bot.

228
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:26,812
But we need to be shut off!
Especially you, Hedonism Bot.

229
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:30,522
I apologize for nothing.
We pollute too much!

230
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:33,685
We're destroying the world
and killing the turtles!

231
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,845
To hell with the turtles!
No one insults the turtles!

232
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,125
Come on, you!

233
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,330
Let the games begin.

234
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:57,646
Everyone listen!

235
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:02,009
Ah! Damn!

236
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:07,327
I've devised a way to save you and
stop global warming at the same time.

237
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:10,530
Granted, you're all blasting
out greenhouse gases.

238
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:12,445
You're one to talk.

239
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:17,682
But we can use those very
gases to save the planet.

240
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:21,641
If you all vent your exhausts
directly upward in one burst...

241
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:25,647
It should thrust the Earth further
from the sun, thus cooling it.

242
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:31,565
By my calculations, we'll need
the full force of every last robot.

243
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:36,648
So quickly, everyone point your
exhaust vents straight upward.

244
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:48,371
Now vent.
Vent like the wind!

245
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,846
Harder! Harder!

246
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:01,087
Why isn't this working?

247
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:03,721
Some lazy or polite
robot is holding it in.

248
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:08,408
Help! Help!

249
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:18,369
A billion robot lives are
about to be extinguished.

250
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,366
Oh, the Jedis are
going to feel this one.

251
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,171
I'm sorry, buddy.

252
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,928
At least we'll die on
our backs, helpless.

253
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:30,169
What the hell are you doing?

254
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,809
Hey, are you trying to make me look bad?

255
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:44,445
Ah-Ha! I'm even greater
than I thought I was.

256
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:46,922
And now to fulfill my destiny!

257
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,006
Fire!

258
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:57,801
What the--?
We missed!

259
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:09,765
Professor, for saving the
Earth and foiling me...

260
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:14,643
I proudly, yet angrily, present
you with Earth's new highest honor:

261
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,281
The Polluting Medal of Pollution.

262
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,042
Thank you. I deserve this.

263
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:27,643
Hey, professor?
Now that the Earth's orbit...

264
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:30,611
Is further from the sun,
won't that make the year longer?

265
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,492
Why, yes.
One week longer to be exact.

266
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:38,283
In that case, I hereby
declare it Robot Party Week!

267
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:39,886
All right, baby!
