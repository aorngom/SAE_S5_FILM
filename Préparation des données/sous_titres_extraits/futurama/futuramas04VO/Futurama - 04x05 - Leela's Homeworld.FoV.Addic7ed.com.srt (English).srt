00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Futurama [4x05] - Leela's Homeworld - CiWaN

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Good news, everyone!

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You all know the orphanarium
where Leela grew up?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Sure, we talk about it
all the time.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Really?
No. Burn!

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well done, fellows!

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Anyway, said orphanarium has
named Leela "Orphan of the Year!"

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Your parents must be so proud! Sorry.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the good news keeps on coming.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Behold my latest invention!

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Whoa.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's a glow-In-The-Dark nose you can
wear over your regular non-Glowing nose.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Observe.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Whoa! Cool!

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now I can punch you in
the nose in the dark.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Where'd it go?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hey, professor, what's all this
scroop blurking out of the machine?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That? It's nothing. Yes, nothing.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If you think it's anything,
you're a suspicious moron.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It looks like toxic waste.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And it smells like toxic waste!

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What does it taste like?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Delicious fig pudding! That's good.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But a distinct
aftertaste of toxic waste.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All right, all right. So the machine
produces a few toxic byproducts.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You don't have to make
a federal case of it.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm afraid I do.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I order you to dispose of
that toxic waste or bribe me.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Either way, it'll cost $500.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Five hundred real dollars?
That's an outrage!

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Professor, I'll take care of
that waste for $499 and 100 cents.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I know That's a rip,
but I'll pay for the convenience.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you take credit cards?
Let's find out.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All right, environment,
you've met your match.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hey, get back in the sewer, weirdie.
No mutants on the surface.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But he ruined my wedding dress!

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Honey, that thing was ruined
the minute it went on you.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's what I'm talking about.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's not easy being an orphan.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Not if I have anything to do with it.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, God.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But today's honoree, Turanga Leela,
has really made something of herself.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll never forget the night that cute
alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep...

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Because I have a photographic
memory, and I remember every night.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What the--?

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
An alien language?
I guess you're an alien.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What a beautiful,
gigantic eye you have--

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, come on in.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
From those humble beginnings...

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Leela went on to become
a county-Certified starship captain.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And so it is my pleasure today...

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To nail her picture alongside those
of our most distinguished alumni.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you very much.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Like many of you,
I never knew my parents.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know if they were
mighty alien overlords...

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Or simply underpaid alien janitors
who fought crime on the side.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Picture's up.
It's crooked!

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In the end, though, it doesn't
matter who my parents were.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
All that matters is what I learned here,
within these unscalable walls...

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That I had the strength
to make it on my own.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Just like all of you kids here today.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Leela! Leela! Leela!

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Look at me! I'm Leela!

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No! Because I'm double Leela! Whee!

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's it, Albert.
No more espresso for you!

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Mind if we get a picture
of you with your picture?

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes! I mean, no!

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Just make sure you
get my nonchalant side.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Whoo!

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If those aren't tears of
happiness, please stop crying.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's okay, Fry. I'm fine.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I won an award today.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is it this room that's making you sad?
It's probably the room.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Come on, let's go for a walk.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry you saw that, Fry.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I usually try to keep my
sadness pent up inside...

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Where it can fester
quietly as a mental illness.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I told a whole crowd today that
being an orphan made me strong.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But all I really wanted
was a mom and dad...

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
To hold me and stroke my
hair and tell me they love me.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then today's your lucky day...

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Because I happen to be a
holding, stroking, loving machine.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Also spanking.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's not even close
to what I had in mind.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, anyway, just remember
that people care about you.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I know.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sometimes, when I'm lonely...

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I look up at the sky,
and I get this feeling that somewhere...

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
On some unknown planet
circling a distant star...

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
My parents are up there
looking down on me.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yo, yo, Bazender! What up?

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My dumping business is booming.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I just got hired to clean
up the set of Free Willy 3!

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Bender, cut it out!

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
First of all, the sewer
mutants will be mad.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Second, everything else that's
horribly wrong with what you're doing.

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Those stupid mutants can't do anything.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You seem to be forgetting
one simple fact.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Namely, I'm up here,
and they are safely down--

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What did I do to deserve this?

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Behold! Our once beautiful
mutagenic sewage lake.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The radioactive waste
you dumped in it...

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Has made it bright enough to
see how ugly we really are!

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, man.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
As if our lives weren't
miserable enough already.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Tell me about it.
Let the punishment commence!

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Punishment?
 No fair.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Bender's innocent!

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The instant you touch
these mutateous waters...

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Your DNA will be forever altered...

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Turning you into
horrible mutants like us!

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Especially him.
Oh.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Allow me to demonstrate.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's like that time I peeked in
the kitchen at imperial Hunan.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Submerge the prisoners!

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Wait. I don't even have DNA.
Why am I screaming?

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We're gonna beat you afterwards.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Mutate! Mutate! Mutate!

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Turanga Leela!

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Who said that?
How do you know my real name?

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Whee!

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What are you doing?
Stop them!

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What happened?
I don't know.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I think I saved us somehow.

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Go after them!
The waters can't mutate us mutants!

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
They went this way.

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Quick, in there!

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Kill! Kill! Kill!

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Kill! Kill! Kill!

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Great Cheech's ghost!

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What's this junk?

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It looks like a timeline
of my whole life.

134
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's when we saved Earth
from an asteroid of garbage.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Here's when I dropped out and
bummed around India for a while.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And this is just last
year at Space Mardi gras.

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's like some kind
of weird Leela Museum.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And I'm the Leela!
Dude, over here!

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's all the best stuff
I ever flushed down the toilet!

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Those are some of my diary pages!

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And my screenplay!

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And also, for some reason, the letter I
wrote you full of my personal feelings.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, I'm scared.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
My whole life has just been a
show for some perverted mutant!

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In here!
Capture them!

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And then Bender ran.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Leela, freak out later.
We're not done escaping yet.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Got you.
Take this!

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ow!

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This time, I'm calling
for the death penalty.

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Not just because I'm running
for reelection as supreme mutant.

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Four more years! Four more years!

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Very well.

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Your attention!
Instead of being tortured to death...

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The prisoners shall hereby
be expelled from the sewers...

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And never allowed to return!

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, cruel fate!

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Can we really never return
to this dank pit of sewage?

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wait a minute.
Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah! What are you, chicken?

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Shut up, you two. We can kill
ourselves when we get home.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They'll need transportation
to the surface.

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Bring in the airship!

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ew!

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We constructed it from the remnants of
old discarded Macy's parade balloons.

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's
left ear and right shin...

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Garfield's owner John's forehead.

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Fire up the sewer gas!

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Move it, you ugly normals!

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Whoa!

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm getting dizzy!
I can't walk straight!

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Come on, Leela. You can do it!

173
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Hurry! We're missing our bus!

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey, what are you doing?

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm getting on the bus!

176
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't worry! I'll be fine!

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They know something about me,
and I’ve got to find out what.

178
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The lake didn't mutate me.
What is going on here?

179
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It worked for me. I used to be a
little blond girl named Virginia.

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Ew!

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Who the hell are you?

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No one.
And watch your language, young lady!

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Stop right there!
I don't wanna hurt you.

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I didn't want you to hurt me either.

185
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Leela's nuts. I can't save her
unless I learn more about her past.

186
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Isn't there anything
else you can tell me?

187
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Nothing that wouldn't
be a waste of your time.

188
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's impossible,
because my time is worthless!

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, then there is one thing.

190
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's the note I found with
Leela the day she was abandoned.

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But it's written in Alienese,
so no one on Earth can translate it.

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Not even Brainzilla.

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Hand it over!
Sure.

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I just wish I could be more helpful.

195
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Would you like some dirt
on any other orphans?

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm trying to save someone here.
I'll have to come back for those later.

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can you translate it?
Of course.

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But only into Beta-Crypt three...

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
A language so complex, there's even
less chance of understanding it.

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I didn't ask for a completely reasonable
excuse. I asked you to get busy.

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Very well.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Doesn't that machine make noses?
Lt can do other things. Why shouldn't it?

203
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Of course, even if it is
possible to analyze the message...

204
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There's no way of knowing
how long it will take.

205
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It could take an hour,
or it could take 100 million years.

206
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Is it done?
Certainly not.

207
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Two dings means it's done.

208
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But not like that.
Slightly more rapid.

209
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Where did they go?

210
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Good news, Leela! I landed the contract
to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy.

211
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Ew!

212
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's it! It's done!

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can't believe it! My mind is boggling!

214
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The analysis of the
note is printing out now.

215
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's a girl.
My God! She's beautiful!

216
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
No extra anythings.

217
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What people skills!

218
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
She's completely perfect.

219
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
In my professional opinion, as an ear,
ear, ear, nose and throat doctor...

220
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
She is the least
mutated mutant ever born.

221
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And yet, she's cursed to live the
horrible degrading life of a mutant...

222
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Like all of us! Especially him!

223
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's true.

224
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Maybe we can do better for her.

225
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I made this bracelet so that in some
small way, we'll always be with you...

226
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Even when it doesn't seem like it.

227
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
During your entire life, for example.

228
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You won't pass for human, cutie.

229
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But if my PhD. in exolinguistics
is worth diddlypoop...

230
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This note should convince
them you're an alien.

231
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And that'll be enough
to give you a real life.

232
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
She'll never know we're her parents.

233
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's our gift to her.

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Better we should die than have her
learn the shameful truth of her origin.

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm with you.

236
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I guess you're an alien.

237
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What a beautiful,
gigantic eye you have--

238
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, come on in.

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us.

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What's to talk about?
Shh!

241
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Hands up!

242
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Tentacles too!
Don't say anything stupid, Morris.

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What is all this?

244
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Am I a game to you?

245
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Or some kind of even
more boring Truman show?

246
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Do you believe I'm your messiah?
The mutant Dalai Lama?

247
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Stop me if I guess it!

248
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Well, actually--
Morris!

249
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And what about this?

250
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Where'd you get this bracelet?

251
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Did you steal it from me when I was
a baby? Or from my parents?

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You robbed my parents, didn't you?

253
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I bet you sick mutants killed them!

254
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
My parents were confused aliens
lost on Earth, and you killed them!

255
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Is that it? Admit it!

256
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes. We killed them.

257
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You guessed the truth.

258
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because of you,
I'll never know my parents!

259
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll kill you!

260
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That would be best.

261
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Stop!

262
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Thanks, Bender!
Don't do it, Leela!

263
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
They killed my parents!
Close.

264
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
They are my parents.
Yes.

265
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I had the professor analyze the
Alienese letter that was found with you.

266
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What does it say?
I don't know.

267
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But the analysis showed it was
printed on recycled toilet paper.

268
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
A squeezably soft paper
used mainly in the sewers.

269
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It says, "Your parents
love you very much."

270
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We still do.

271
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant?

272
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We never wanted you to know.

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You deserved a better life.

274
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You must despise us.

275
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You're my parents.

276
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
All I’ve ever wanted is to know you.

277
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
This is the happiest moment of my life.

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Ah.
