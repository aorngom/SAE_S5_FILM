1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,501
<i>Previously on ABC's Flashforward...</i>

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,671
<i>Everyone on the planet blacked out
at exactly the same time.</i>

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:10,051
I didn't just lose consciousness.
It felt more like I was having a memory,

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,575
- only it was of the future.
- Same thing happened to me.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,431
In my flash-forward,
I saw someone drowning me.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,808
I was getting a prenatal sonogram.

7
00:00:18,337 --> 00:00:21,187
I was with another man.
I've never seen him before.

8
00:00:22,328 --> 00:00:24,649
In my flash-forward, I was investigating
what caused all this.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,652
- You have to see this. Right there.
- No way.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,906
Who the hell is that?
And why are they awake?

11
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:32,156
This was taken about
midway through the blackout.

12
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,450
We're calling him suspect zero.

13
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:37,036
Dr. Benford, I'm Lloyd Simcoe.

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,081
But it doesn't matter what I saw.

15
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,645
This man means nothing to me.

16
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:43,228
His son's your patient.

17
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,587
Our experiment killed
20 million people, Simon.

18
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,297
We were the cause.

19
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,301
I do not believe
we caused the blackout.

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,178
- Who's the woman?
- I have no idea.

21
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,139
But I am gonna meet her.

22
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,226
I didn't have a flash-forward,
because I'm gonna be dead.

23
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,894
You will be shot three times.

24
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:04,073
You, agent Benford,

25
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,648
you will kill agent Noh.

26
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:07,794
You're coming with us.

27
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,946
- Lower that gun.
- You two are disobeying a direct order!

28
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:12,954
Here.

29
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,573
Wedeck's orders.

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,451
Thank you and good-bye.

31
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,913
- No, please don't hurt her.
- Get in the van, Mr. Simcoe.

32
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,138
- I'll come with you, please.
- Get in the van!

33
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:33,996
I want to tell you a story
about a man I know,

34
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,753
<i>a window washer in Los Angeles.</i>

35
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:42,150
<i>Nothing special about him,</i>

36
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:43,840
<i>just going about his life,</i>

37
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:46,211
- <i>living from day to day.</i>
- Hook me up.

38
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:48,774
<i>Vague plans. Few dreams.</i>

39
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:53,975
<i>And if he had any aspirations,
he never spoke of them.</i>

40
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:57,540
<i>Like most of us,</i>

41
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,337
<i>he was already unconscious
when the blackout hit.</i>

42
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:16,875
<i>Before the blackout,</i>

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,721
<i>the window washer lived his life</i>

44
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,000
<i>ignoring the questions
of the future.</i>

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,434
<i>They just weren't
that important to him,</i>

46
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,486
<i>so he believed nothing.</i>

47
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,184
<i>But the blackout came...</i>

48
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:32,720
<i>and this man faced certain death.</i>

49
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:50,708
<i>Many of us think that
when divine intervention happens,</i>

50
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:52,413
<i>it's something big.</i>

51
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,326
<i>But it can also be a small thing...</i>

52
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,969
<i>that seems so inconsequential
in the moment,</i>

53
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,431
<i>that turns out to be...</i>

54
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:05,017
<i>the turning point
for your entire life.</i>

55
00:03:19,577 --> 00:03:20,967
<i>Big or small,</i>

56
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,832
<i>what if that moment
affected everyone, everywhere</i>

57
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:26,909
<i>at the exact same time?</i>

58
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:30,138
<i>What would that mean to you?</i>

59
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,479
<i>Where would you look for answers?</i>

60
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:39,506
<i>The answer is never
about just one person.</i>

61
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:44,141
<i>Every single person's life
was touched by the blackout.</i>

62
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:47,890
<i>None of us are in this alone.</i>

63
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,368
Help!

64
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:25,151
<i>Each one of us is unique,</i>

65
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:28,851
<i>but we are being stitched
together to form a tapestry,</i>

66
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,687
<i>something larger
that can't be understood</i>

67
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,827
<i>until we step back
to see the whole thing...</i>

68
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:41,146
<i>At some point, we all wake up,</i>

69
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:44,171
<i>and then we have to choose.</i>

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,690
<i>Do we walk in hope,</i>

71
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:50,456
<i>believing that what God
is doing is good,</i>

72
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,415
<i>or do we stumble around,</i>

73
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,720
<i>resigning ourselves to chaos?</i>

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,872
<i>The window washer saw
a path through the chaos,</i>

75
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:02,301
And he saw the good
in what he was shown.

76
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,107
That window washer...

77
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,002
was me.

78
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:12,052
1x11 - Revelation Zero

79
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:20,819
<i>These are the questions people
have always struggled with.</i>

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,075
<i>Only now,</i>

81
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,907
<i>they are more powerful than ever.</i>

82
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,467
Take me through something here.

83
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:38,437
You're in a foreign country
against my expressed wishes,

84
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:41,799
and you decide to pull
a gun in a public place.

85
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:47,137
Just out of curiosity,
what were you thinking?

86
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:49,306
<i>Back off! Back off now!</i>

87
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:53,901
Can I go see my wife?
She was just nearly kidnapped.

88
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:57,373
What... Were... you thinking?

89
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:59,583
I asked you a question.

90
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,756
Can you try to tell us what you saw?

91
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:05,072
I was saying good-bye.

92
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,700
Dylan Simcoe's been
a patient of mine for a while.

93
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:10,244
The paramedics were loading him in.

94
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:12,204
And that's when I noticed...

95
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,832
- <i>No ambo!</i>
- Something was wrong.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,606
- <i>We don't have time for this.</i>
- Well, they weren't paramedics.</i>

97
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:21,213
- They didn't know what they were doing.
- <i>Bill, can you get down here?</i>

98
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,590
- Who's Bill?
- The security guard.

99
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:26,886
They shot him.

100
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,851
They shot him. They just did it.

101
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:33,434
- And then they turned the gun at me.
- <i>No, please don't hurt her.</i>

102
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,968
And that's when Mark jumped in
and got in the middle of it.

103
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:37,479
Mark?

104
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:40,177
Lloyd.

105
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,818
Sorry. Tired.

106
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:43,902
Lloyd Simcoe.

107
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:48,073
He told them not to hurt me
and that he'd go with them.

108
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,482
He saved my life.

109
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:56,123
Some stranger tells me I'm gonna
put three bullets in my friend.

110
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,204
I'm not gonna invite her
to a tea party.

111
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,835
- Are you trying to be cute?
- At least I'm not sitting on my hands.

112
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,726
We still haven't gone to somalia.

113
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,213
We can't find D. Gibbons,

114
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:08,013
And for some reason, we're not using
every resource available

115
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:10,959
to us to find out
who the hell suspect zero is.

116
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:14,892
Somalia is a war zone,
and I'm working to get us in.

117
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:19,003
The Detroit bureau is canvassing
Michigan looking for suspect zero,

118
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:22,211
and we've got Gibbons
on the ten most wanted list,

119
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:24,598
which is more than
a miracle to pull off.

120
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:28,716
So don't you imply
that I'm not working with you here.

121
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:31,492
Are you gonna find Lloyd?

122
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:33,439
This only happened 'cause...

123
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:36,289
he came forward,
did the right thing.

124
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,530
Please find him.

125
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,547
Your bureau mandated therapist.

126
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,051
You see her three times a week,
and when she thinks you're up to it,

127
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:52,048
we'll talk about a reinstatement.

128
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:40,388
Excuse me!

129
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,358
I know america was a country
founded by puritans,

130
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,112
but is there really not a single beer
in this entire place?

131
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,793
I think you got us
confused with the ATF,

132
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:54,151
Dr. Campos.

133
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,199
What is it you're doing here?

134
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,395
I'm advising the office
on all things scientific

135
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,305
related to the investigation.

136
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:07,990
Very scientific.

137
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:10,382
That is classified.

138
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,441
Not to me.

139
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:23,716
Mark?

140
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,111
I can see working for the FBI

141
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:56,929
is gonna be much more
interesting than academia.

142
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:01,024
- Mark, it's not what it looks like.
- Not now. You've been through enough.

143
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,615
This can wait till later.

144
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:06,236
Let's go home.

145
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,213
Bye-bye.

146
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:17,533
It's been eight hours
since Simcoe was kidnapped.

147
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,687
Where are we?

148
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:21,745
We know it was a pro job, but there
hasn't been any kind of ransom demand.

149
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,786
We can only theorize
as to why he's been taken,

150
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:25,813
but considering
how many people want him dead...

151
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:27,098
Could be anyone.

152
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:32,756
What's he doing here?

153
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,383
Nice to see you too, agent Noh.

154
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:38,328
Agent Vogel has officially
joined the mosaic task force.

155
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,138
Embrace it, Demetri.

156
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,058
This is now
an interagency investigation.

157
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,645
I've asked Dr. Campos to be here.

158
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,235
His close association
to Simcoe should be able

159
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,357
to shed some light
on our kidnappers.

160
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:53,147
I suggest we cast a wider net...

161
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:56,822
Terrorists, anyone interested
in future focasting.

162
00:10:57,364 --> 00:10:59,825
If someone were able to master
the flasforwards,

163
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,119
they would be effectively
printing their own money.

164
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:05,295
I think we can all agree
that the mind of Lloyd Simcoe

165
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,999
is a priceless resource.

166
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:15,860
Help!

167
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:17,708
Help!

168
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,527
Can anybody hear me?

169
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:28,753
No one can hear you.

170
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,747
You're dehydrated.
You should replenish your electrolytes.

171
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,085
You tell me what I need to know,
and you can walk out of here right now.

172
00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:58,467
Who are you?

173
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,918
You actually don't want to know
the answer to that question.

174
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:02,945
Go to hell.

175
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:05,015
You have no idea what hell is.

176
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,693
But I guess you're gonna find out.

177
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,530
From the outside,

178
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:18,695
I looked the same
after the blackout.

179
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,913
But inside,

180
00:12:20,662 --> 00:12:21,990
I was different.

181
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:27,989
<i>We've lived believing not knowing
the future made life difficult.</i>

182
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,598
<i>The truth is</i>

183
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:32,000
<i>that it's vastly more difficult</i>

184
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,503
<i>knowing what lies before us.</i>

185
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,742
"But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, you shall not eat,

186
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:45,080
for in the day that you eat of it,

187
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:48,386
you shall surely die."

188
00:12:57,706 --> 00:12:58,512
Mom?

189
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:00,394
Mom?

190
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:03,497
Mom!

191
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,496
Why would you do
something like that?

192
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:11,929
You could have burned
the whole house down!

193
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,994
What's gotten into you?

194
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,223
Sorry.

195
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,359
- Whatever. She's had breakfast.
- The nanny was late.

196
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:33,648
When you say you're gonna be here,
I need you to be here.

197
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:34,813
It's not my fault.

198
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,732
She burned the bible this morning.

199
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,685
What?

200
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,113
Might want to search the house
again for matches or a lighter.

201
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,654
- Whatever.
- The family bible?

202
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:45,469
Mom!

203
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:50,294
<i>The challenge for us is to find
the gift in what we saw.</i>

204
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:55,083
<i>We may not recognize it at first,
but if we pay attention,</i>

205
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:57,584
<i>It will reveal itself.</i>

206
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:07,137
What else am I gonna do?

207
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:10,807
Charlie's at school,
and it's not like I play any golf.

208
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:16,591
We didn't get to talk last night,

209
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:19,171
and I don't want to not talk.

210
00:14:21,146 --> 00:14:23,269
I was saying good-bye to Lloyd.

211
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,865
But whatou saw in that videotape,
that was supposed to be an ending.

212
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,201
I swear to God, it made me happy
to think it was over.

213
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,827
I'm just glad you're okay.

214
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,672
That the thing. I'm not.

215
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,113
I haven't been for a while.

216
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:46,301
At work I'm cold and I'm distant,
And then I come home, and you and I...

217
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,912
*** easy this guy
to come home to.

218
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:49,966
I know.

219
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:52,807
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:59,731
What if we just ran?
What if we just upped and moved away?

221
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,693
No, I mean it. I mean, everything bad
we saw was here in L.A.

222
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,377
You're serious about this?

223
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,250
Al Gough jumped off a building
to save a woman's life,

224
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,796
a woman he didn't even know.

225
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,183
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to save our marriage.

226
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:17,117
Come here.

227
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:26,647
<i>9-1-1.</i>

228
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:28,754
<i>There's a homeless man.
He's vomiting.</i>

229
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,866
<i>He looks like he needs help.
838 bauchet street, by the train yards.</i>

230
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,558
<i>Are you with the victim now, Sir?</i>

231
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,163
The call's a hoax.

232
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:38,937
Real EMTs responded,
bad guys swapped themselves in.

233
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,143
The ambulance company
supplied us with this,

234
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:44,693
and aside from the videotape, it's the
only lead we have on the kidnapping.

235
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,465
Have you found the missing EMTs?

236
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,922
We sent LAPD detectives
to that location.

237
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:51,366
Dead end. It's just an empty rail yard
south of downtown.

238
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,452
And we haven't located
the ambulance, either.

239
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,581
You outsourced this to the Los Angeles
Police department?

240
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,211
- It's a local crime...
- That involves our investigation.

241
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,002
What about Lloyd's laptop?

242
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,295
What about it?

243
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,922
I might be able to break
Through the encryption software,

244
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,489
see who he was in contact with
before he was taken.

245
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:09,592
Could help.

246
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:15,307
Janis, take a security team
escort Dr. Campos to the Simcoe house.

247
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:19,019
I want to talk to the detectives
who canvassed that crime scene.

248
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,187
Thank you.

249
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:27,652
Is this... suite 520?

250
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,280
And you're my 3:00.

251
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,525
Why does it look
like you're leaving?

252
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,160
'cause it's 3:00,
and if I don't get an iced latte stat,

253
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,169
I'm gonna need therapy.

254
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:41,864
Agent Benford, for the past 12 years,
my job has been To help people cope

255
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:44,815
by helping them Explore their past.

256
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,686
But since the blackout,
That's all changed.

257
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:50,454
The majority of people
who are coming to see me

258
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:53,136
are dealing with traumas
from their future.

259
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:55,175
Tell me what you saw.

260
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:58,477
I saw myself off the wagon
With guns pointed at me.

261
00:16:58,602 --> 00:16:59,954
What else do you remember?

262
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,270
That's not enough trauma for you?

263
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,647
I've seen your files.

264
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,274
You've got a God complex.

265
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,569
I believe that you saw
something in your flash-forward,

266
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:12,531
something that you might
not even be conscious of,

267
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,300
that's making you believe
that you're the center of the universe,

268
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:18,536
and I'm not signing anything
until we find out what that is.

269
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,288
Next thing I knew,
I was upside down,

270
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:46,606
staring at a broken windshield
and a bunch of oranges on the 110.

271
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:48,706
By my math,

272
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:52,609
that doesn't exactly add up
to 2 minutes and 17 seconds.

273
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:55,490
You're not the first person
To point that out.

274
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:57,742
You were drinking?

275
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,746
Can't even remember half of it.

276
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:03,140
Do you want to?

277
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:08,013
'cause there has been some success
using a modified Calcineurin inhibitor

278
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:10,473
to enhance people's memories
of their flash-forwards.

279
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:12,761
Using a drug to enhance memories.

280
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:15,692
I don't know. I don't think

281
00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:18,096
magical mystery tour
is the best way to go for someone

282
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,153
- in recovery.
- What are you afraid of?

283
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:22,201
Not much.
In case you forgot,

284
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:24,686
I chase down very bad people
for a living.

285
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:25,937
Not anymore.

286
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:32,055
Call me when you want to continue
treatment. I'd be happy to see you.

287
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,406
You go to the alley.

288
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:55,782
Guard the back door.

289
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,326
Could you

290
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,681
get me a beer

291
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,629
from the refrigerator, please?

292
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,114
We're here as your security,
Mr. Campos,

293
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,674
not your servants.

294
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:10,954
I'm trying to brute force
an encryption here.

295
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,484
I don't have time to get up.

296
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,611
I have even less time
for explicating

297
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,784
why said request should be obvious.

298
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:18,323
Why don't you toddle off,

299
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:19,825
get me a beer?

300
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,442
It'll help me cogitate.

301
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:23,703
That means "think."

302
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:28,287
That's a big word
for such a little man.

303
00:19:29,695 --> 00:19:30,744
I'm wounded.

304
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,922
But I still want my beer.

305
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,279
Get her on her side.

306
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:02,033
You're all right. You're okay.

307
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:04,104
Take it easy.

308
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,705
- Where's Simon?
- He's gone. You're the only one here.

309
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:10,166
- What happened?
- There were two guys

310
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,668
wearing masks...

311
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,462
Just like the ones on Mark's board.

312
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:44,307
Good.

313
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:46,302
I found you.

314
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,448
But his father's been kidnapped.

315
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:53,376
He's not gonna live on the street.
Social services will take care of him.

316
00:20:53,682 --> 00:20:55,579
This is my patient.
You can't release him.

317
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:58,715
You signed The forms yesterday.
We kept him overnight as a courtesy,

318
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,593
- come on. We needs the beds.
- But he's developed a complication.

319
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,178
His clot got worse.

320
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,289
I didn't realize
you had X-Ray vision.

321
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,851
- Guess we can close down radiology.
- Dylan, come here a second...

322
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:14,473
Hey, babe?

323
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,446
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Dylan?

324
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:21,529
Dylan, sweetie?

325
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,136
Yeah, elevated heart rate,

326
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:03,931
shortness of breath

327
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,950
and... warm forehead.
Could be sepsis.

328
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,735
Are they gonna find my daddy,
Olivia?

329
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,077
Of course they are.

330
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:31,849
Like we're gonna find an ambulance
out here that the LAPD couldn't find.

331
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:35,113
Good call. This was definitely
Not a waste of time.

332
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,563
You know what? I got a better idea.
Why don't we...

333
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,775
take out our guns and wave 'em around?
See what happens.

334
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,111
- What happened in Hong Kong...
- Should stay in there?

335
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,331
I was following a lead
on my own murder.

336
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:46,186
I know,

337
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,305
but the thing you and Benford
screwed up over there is so much bigger

338
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:52,412
than who might
put 3 bullets in you on march 15th.

339
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,705
- For you, maybe.
- You think you're the only one

340
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,332
who didn't have a flash-forward,
saw something... They wish they hadn't?

341
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:01,421
Take some advice. You can cry.
You can...

342
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:03,381
lie to your fiancée. Whatever.

343
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:07,010
But sooner or later you better get it
together, or else she's gonna be...

344
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,137
walkin' along that beach

345
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,221
getting ready to marry
somebody else.

346
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:21,107
There are people around you
Who know things you don't.

347
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,236
If you want to avoid Being killed,
you're gonna need a better partner...

348
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:27,113
better than Mark Benford.

349
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,488
What was that about a waste of time?

350
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:54,891
- I am so glad to see your shining face.
- Really?

351
00:23:56,154 --> 00:23:58,644
Mr. Michalski
just woke up from surgery,

352
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,677
and we need someone to check on him.

353
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:03,553
- Happy to.
- Thanks.

354
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:21,361
Wait!

355
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:23,542
Excuse me. Hey!

356
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:28,508
I'm sorry. I thought...
thought you were someone else.

357
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:30,136
Sorry.

358
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:50,496
In my flash-forward I only saw him
for a second, but i'm sure it was him.

359
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,323
I gave his description to security.

360
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:55,201
I really want you to call
that Detective friend of Mark's.

361
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,841
Detective Liefeld. I gave him
a description two months ago.

362
00:24:57,966 --> 00:25:00,248
- This won't be anything new.
- You never know what can help.

363
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,728
- You should call him.
- Okay.

364
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:07,797
E.R. Okay.
I'll see you later.

365
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,575
It's gonna be all right. Okay?

366
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:19,137
I keep trying to convince
myself that this is a mistake.

367
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,394
It's something that
I don't understand.

368
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:25,055
I can't keep walking around wondering If
this guy gonna be behind every corner.

369
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:27,483
Have you heard about sanctuary ?

370
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,820
Let me show you.

371
00:25:31,282 --> 00:25:33,054
I put these up everywhere.

372
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:36,602
Here.

373
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:38,286
Yeah, I've seen these.

374
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,850
The guy who leads
it sees things In aeally positive way.

375
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:43,487
You should check it out.
He might be able to help.

376
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:47,281
It doesn't matter to
me whether you were

377
00:25:47,406 --> 00:25:49,630
frightened
by what you saw or excited.

378
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:51,427
I'll be the first to admit

379
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,469
I was totally confused
by my flash-forward.

380
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,559
I wasn't a religious person

381
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,560
at all.

382
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,354
I didn't know what to do.
But a voice said,

383
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:07,982
"just keep moving forward."

384
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:11,091
So I created sanctuary...

385
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,863
a place where we can be safe,

386
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,407
were there is no threat,

387
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:17,873
no danger.

388
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:22,413
What do you think they're after ?

389
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,875
It's the experiment at NLAP.

390
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:26,876
It's gotta be.

391
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:28,684
And clearly,

392
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:31,714
I didn't consider the repercussions
of our announcement.

393
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:33,709
Your announcement, Lloyd.

394
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,886
I shouldn't have implicated you
and the rest of the staff.

395
00:26:37,224 --> 00:26:39,430
Spare me your whinging, Lloyd.

396
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,546
I was co-director of the project.

397
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:45,580
I was on the hook the moment you opened
your mouth, and as I've said repeatedly,

398
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,606
I do not think we were responsible
for the blackout.

399
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,053
Yeah, it would seem
our captors would beg to differ.

400
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,487
We do beg to differ.

401
00:27:06,145 --> 00:27:07,434
Sit, please.

402
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,136
I have emphysema.

403
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:20,663
I contracted it through
years of habitual smoking.

404
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,861
Disgusting proclivity, isn't it ?

405
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,696
Only villains smoke.
we know this, right ?

406
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:29,177
I'm sorry.

407
00:27:29,552 --> 00:27:30,523
You are ?

408
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:37,822
You may call me Flosso.

409
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:42,455
And I'm a villain.

410
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:50,676
Imagine...

411
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:51,977
a basket

412
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,688
the size of Montana.

413
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,424
Now imagine said basket

414
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,009
is filled with money.

415
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,011
That is what my employers
are paying me

416
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:02,524
To ask you these questions.


417
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,973
At 11:00 A.M, on october 6th,

418
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:08,811
you conducted a proton-driven
plasma-wakefield experiment.

419
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,613
It is my understanding

420
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:14,147
that you were searching
for tachyonic dark matter.

421
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,110
In the resulting particle collision,

422
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,340
how much collision energy
was geneted ?

423
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:19,477
I don't know.

424
00:28:19,602 --> 00:28:21,699
Are we talking about
a billion electron volts ?

425
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,534
- I don't know.
- How many

426
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,995
electron volts Were generated ?

427
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:27,907
Perhaps I can

428
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,993
help you with your inquir.

429
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:34,587
On october 6th,

430
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,282
You were in Toronto
burying your father, I believe.

431
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,153
I'm asking the man who actually
pushed the button.

432
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,391
You're here for a differente reason.

433
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,057
How many electron volts
were generated ?

434
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,018
I'd rather die than tell you how
to manufacture another blackout.

435
00:28:49,578 --> 00:28:51,769
- You think you caused it ?
- I did.

436
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:53,035
No, Dr. Simcoe.

437
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:55,066
All the two of you did was
amplify it.

438
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,120
So again,

439
00:28:58,776 --> 00:29:01,191
how many electron volts ?

440
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,456
What you got ?

441
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,541
No wounds, no ligature marks,

442
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,760
so I'm going
with a poison of some kind.

443
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:18,005
But I won't know more
until the toxology comes back.

444
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,342
We found this.

445
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,955
Might belong to one of the EMTS.
A leather case ?

446
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,431
Fits a palm pre,
but we didn't find a phone.

447
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,559
If the phone still In the ambulance,
we can triangulate its position.

448
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,270
- Find the phone, find the ambulance.
- Find the ambulance,

449
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,899
maybe find the guys who stole it.
Find them,

450
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,067
and they'll get us
to Simon and Lloyd.

451
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:40,090
Just relax.

452
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,571
You ever sit in a chair before ?

453
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,047
Not like this one, no.

454
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:48,984
Some people who've had difficulty
recalling their flash-forwards

455
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:51,645
hve had real breakthroughs
with this treatment.

456
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,484
So how about you tell
me what changed your mind ?

457
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,324
I'm driving everyone around me.
Everyone I care about.

458
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:01,398
Away...

459
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,996
because I can't dealwWith
what my future might be.

460
00:30:08,895 --> 00:30:10,433
Was that really so hard to say ?

461
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:13,073
You got no idea.

462
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:18,381
Therapy

463
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,109
is a lot like A.A.

464
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:22,903
The first step in recovery...

465
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,781
is admitting you have a problem.

466
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:29,531
- This gonna hurt ?
- Truth always does A little.

467
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:38,591
The man in my flash-forward
had a neck like an ox,

468
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,338
smelled like a meat locker.

469
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:44,550
Don't know where I was or

470
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:46,010
who the man was.

471
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,680
I felt my thumbs on his trachea.

472
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:53,642
I pushed down as hard
as I could until I felt something snap.

473
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:56,729
Then I let go.

474
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:01,646
I can't believe you'd be capable
of something like that.

475
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:04,206
I guess mine's
a little bit more violent than yours.

476
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,614
I'm confused.
In my flash-forward, I...

477
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,160
I got a text message from you.
Sorry, I have to make a call.

478
00:31:12,156 --> 00:31:13,370
I can't remember that.

479
00:31:14,228 --> 00:31:17,249
Obviously I couldn't have sent you a
text in the middle of what I was doing.

480
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:20,294
Maybe I sent you a text earlier,
and you just retrieved it.

481
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:23,940
I don't understand.

482
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,771
- Why don't our futures match ?
- Because It's a possible future.

483
00:31:29,594 --> 00:31:30,971
Clearly, you weren't paying

484
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,743
any attention to the story
about the FBI Agent

485
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:35,500
who committed suicide.

486
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:39,534
Anything's possible...

487
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:41,899
vision or no vision.

488
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:43,096
Lloyd,

489
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:45,528
that's pointless.
They're wire windows.

490
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,653
They've probably nailed them shut.

491
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:53,702
Touché.

492
00:31:55,986 --> 00:31:58,707
I just need one person to walk by

493
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,834
and look down.

494
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,306
No. Wait.
No, Wait !

495
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,174
Help !

496
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:10,295
Help !

497
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:18,342
You should start to feel a tingling
sensation in your extremities.

498
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:21,335
This is completely normal.
Just relax.

499
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:24,233
Until the memories come.

500
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:02,799
<i>What?</i>

501
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,642
<i>I wish you were standing
behind the eight ball</i>

502
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:09,653
<i>when I came crashing through.</i>

503
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:12,654
<i>Go to hell, Lloyd.</i>

504
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:19,383
What did you see?

505
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:21,630
I was on the phone.

506
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,898
Do you know who you were talking to?

507
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:32,984
Lloyd Simcoe.

508
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:54,211
You dropped something.

509
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:57,345
Let's start again.

510
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,240
You were conducting an experiment
in plasma-wakefield acceleration.

511
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:03,233
Am I correct in that assumption?

512
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:08,379
I thought I made it clear,
I can't tell you.

513
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:13,425
Get the...
Lloyd!

514
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,427
Were you successful, Dr. Simcoe?

515
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:18,013
All right.

516
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,241
Did your facility detect
anything superluminal?

517
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:22,368
This has nothing to do with simon.
Why?

518
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,450
Was there any Cherenkov radiation?

519
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:31,814
I can't.

520
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,239
Lloyd! Help!

521
00:34:37,904 --> 00:34:39,076
Very well then.

522
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:42,577
Let the wild rumpus begin.

523
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:53,090
Hey, kdo.

524
00:34:53,906 --> 00:34:56,083
Go back to sleep, babe.
I was checking in on you.

525
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,142
I can't.

526
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,096
Will you sing some more?

527
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,808
I think I exhausted my repertoire.

528
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,336
I have to go home.

529
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:07,697
I saved you this from my dinner.

530
00:35:09,636 --> 00:35:11,485
A cookie? You did?

531
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
Thank you.

532
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:26,885
Hey, Aaron. It's Mark.

533
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,010
I think I could use some help.

534
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,645
Talk to me, man.

535
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:24,776
What's happened, Mark?

536
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:27,507
Why are you sitting here in your car
in front of a bar?

537
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:29,478
It's what's gonna happen.

538
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:33,394
My therapist...

539
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,133
gave me this drug...

540
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:41,558
to unlock the parts of my flash-forward
I couldn't remember

541
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:42,908
because I was drinking.

542
00:36:46,153 --> 00:36:48,056
<i>It's me.
I need to talk to you.</i>

543
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,508
<i>This isn't a good time.</i>

544
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,053
I was on the phone,

545
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,919
with Lloyd Simcoe.

546
00:36:55,953 --> 00:36:58,423
<i>- Have you been drinking?
- Go to hell, Lloyd.</i>

547
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,485
I told him
I didn't want to talk to him.

548
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,137
<i>- You have right to hate me, but...
- I don't hate you.</i>

549
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,473
I wish you were behind the eight ball
when I came crashing through.

550
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,517
<i>Fine, but we need to talk
about the Q.E.D.</i>

551
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,965
<i>Sounded like
we were working together.</i>

552
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:14,356
<i>I'm not sure. It's highly theoretical
but I'm close to cracking it.</i>

553
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,398
<i>Listen to me.
Close is not good enough.</i>

554
00:37:16,523 --> 00:37:19,653
<i>- D. Gibbons told me about...
- D. Gibbons lied to you.</i>

555
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,575
<i>We're running out of time
unless we can stop this...</i>

556
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:26,910
And then I told him...

557
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:32,541
<i>There's gonna be another blackout.</i>

558
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:43,093
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

559
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:45,679
There's gonna be another blackout.

560
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,890
If Simcoe saw the same thing
you did,

561
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,999
Why's he been sitting
on this Information?

562
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:52,352
- Why hasn't he come forward?
- I don't know.

563
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,060
Let's find him and ask him.

564
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:55,798
Let me back in,

565
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:57,192
and I can track him.

566
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,598
Look, go home.

567
00:37:58,894 --> 00:38:01,606
I'm doing my best to get you reinstated.
I promise.

568
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,938
- What am I supposed to do till then?
- You said you saw more clues,

569
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:06,199
from your vision.

570
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:08,335
Work them...

571
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,502
- But be quiet about it.
- All right.

572
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,146
This business
about another blackout...

573
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:14,946
Keep it to yourself.

574
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:18,295
If we can't tell the world
when it's going to happen,

575
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,363
That's beyond irresponsible.

576
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,554
This is the number
for one of our missing E.M.T.S.

577
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:27,346
We're hoping the phone might
still be in the ambulance.

578
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:28,602
Can you track it?

579
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:30,958
If the battery's got juice,
I can capture the signal

580
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,893
and triangulate its position.

581
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,104
- How close can you get us?
- To within 50 m, if it's in the city.

582
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,272
Let's do it.

583
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,535
I made it for you, daddy,
To cheer you up.

584
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:52,769
It worked.

585
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,352
Thank you, it's beautiful.

586
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:56,777
What's all this?

587
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,956
It's a giant puzzle,

588
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:02,128
Something I still haven't
figured out yet.

589
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:04,591
When I do jigsaw puzzles
at Nana's house,

590
00:39:05,461 --> 00:39:09,040
I always feel that way when she dumps
the pieces out on the table.

591
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:13,704
But we always start
with the corners and work in.

592
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:16,507
At least you know what they are.

593
00:39:16,714 --> 00:39:18,364
Start with the corners.

594
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:20,571
Come here.

595
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,971
Sometimes we feel God's hand
on the back of our neck,

596
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:29,074
pushing us towards something.</i>

597
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:31,254
And sometimes,

598
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,286
we feel totally abandoned.

599
00:39:34,477 --> 00:39:35,677
That's normal.

600
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:38,208
But just because
you don't feel something,

601
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,276
doesn't mean it's not there.

602
00:39:43,723 --> 00:39:46,894
How many people here
have gotten sunburned on a cloudy day?

603
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,220
You didn't think
it was working on you,

604
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:51,847
but it was.

605
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,398
God's love is just like that...

606
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,643
Working for your good,

607
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,188
whether you are aware of it or not.

608
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,066
Here you go.

609
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,234
Thank you.

610
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:07,195
Sorry.

611
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,513
- I just had a question.
- Sure.

612
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,075
What about our responsibility
before God?

613
00:40:12,936 --> 00:40:14,995
- Don't we owe him something?
- Like what?

614
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:16,344
Obedience?

615
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:20,167
We need to follow the rules
that he sets out.

616
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,475
And if we don't?

617
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:24,434
We get punished.

618
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:29,259
I just don't see how you can say
that the blackout was good.

619
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:32,637
And look at all the people that died.
Look at all the trouble it's causing.

620
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:35,419
- Clearly, I've upset you.
- Don't you think...

621
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,847
In the very least,

622
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:40,082
the flash-forwards
were a wake-up call for us

623
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:43,459
to get our act together
before it's too late?

624
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:45,609
- I didn't catch your name.
- Nicole.

625
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:47,319
My name is Timothy.

626
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:49,279
I'd really like to keep talking,

627
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,282
but if I don't get out of here
before my hour's up, I get charged.

628
00:40:52,957 --> 00:40:56,036
- We, thanks.
- There's a coffee shop I like nearby.

629
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,904
If you want to talk
about it again later...

630
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:16,043
Red Panda provides humanitarian aid
all around the world.

631
00:41:16,168 --> 00:41:18,825
Everything from micro-investments
to education.

632
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:22,604
We've been busy since the blackout.
I'm sure you can imagine.

633
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,973
You said you do work
all over the world.

634
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,985
We grew out of D.H.S. in the '90s,

635
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,432
Demographic and health services.

636
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:32,531
We're in South America,
the Middle East,

637
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,800
The African subcontinent...

638
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:35,992
Somalia?

639
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:38,742
Was Red Panda there in '91?

640
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,130
There was no Red Panda In 1991.

641
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,375
We weren't chartered Until '98.

642
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:44,868
And you send in,

643
00:41:45,225 --> 00:41:47,879
- Teams of people?
- With clean water supplies, mostly.

644
00:41:48,497 --> 00:41:52,259
The warlords keep most everyone out,
But, humanitarian groups can get in.

645
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,672
Is there anyone
I could talk to about, maybe...

646
00:41:57,396 --> 00:41:59,946
Piggybacking
on one of red panda's trips?

647
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:02,024
Doubt it.

648
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,812
Not to be disrespectful,

649
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,022
but most of the people working here

650
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,068
probably have police records
as thick as the bible.

651
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,801
We're not like that anymore.

652
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:13,697
Have a nice day, agent Benford.

653
00:42:16,606 --> 00:42:19,877
- You have to let me pay your coffee.
- It's okay.

654
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:22,319
I didn't have any plans anyway.

655
00:42:25,394 --> 00:42:27,120
It's not like
he's scary or anything.

656
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:30,226
- I feel better if you're here.
- I'll be right here if you need me.

657
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:31,797
Great.

658
00:42:32,387 --> 00:42:34,750
Can you see
if you can get the change in pennies?

659
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:44,227
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

660
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,139
That's all right.
I'm getting one to go.

661
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:52,152
Why don't you tell me
what upset you earlier?

662
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,550
In my flash-forward,

663
00:42:58,269 --> 00:42:59,493
I was underwater.

664
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:03,371
Someone was drowning me.

665
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,430
And in the end,

666
00:43:07,158 --> 00:43:08,208
I was dead.

667
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:13,366
People ask me all the time
to interpret what they saw,

668
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:15,425
And i can't.

669
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,554
Ultimately,
interpretation is your responsibility.

670
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,930
How could my drowning be good?

671
00:43:22,055 --> 00:43:23,850
What if you were being baptized?

672
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:27,062
- Wouldn't that be a good thing?
- But then why was I struggling?

673
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,391
I'm sorry to say
I've dropped more than one person

674
00:43:29,516 --> 00:43:31,149
in a full-immersion baptism...

675
00:43:31,613 --> 00:43:32,919
Water gets up their nose.

676
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:35,278
- They freak out, slip away.
- But i died.

677
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,321
Or fainted.

678
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:40,806
My point here is that these visions
are just a snapshotted.

679
00:43:40,931 --> 00:43:42,609
You only see a small portion.

680
00:43:42,734 --> 00:43:45,131
Think of Jesus and his sacrifice.

681
00:43:45,544 --> 00:43:46,824
To his disciples,

682
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:49,793
it was a tragedy because they couldn't
see the bigger picture.

683
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:53,593
It's a new reality
for everyone who came after.

684
00:43:54,494 --> 00:43:56,484
Is that what you think
is happening now?

685
00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:59,901
It's not fate versus freewill.

686
00:44:00,185 --> 00:44:01,185
It's fate,

687
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:02,976
and freewill.

688
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:07,561
But I'm just a super religious
weirdo dude.

689
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,845
You don't have to believe
anything I say.

690
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:13,189
But every day,

691
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:16,946
God puts something good
in your life.

692
00:44:19,216 --> 00:44:21,324
Embrace it.
And let all the other stuff,

693
00:44:22,436 --> 00:44:23,436
fall away.

694
00:44:27,275 --> 00:44:29,332
The challenge we face is recognizing

695
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,966
that the answers
to our most burning questions

696
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:34,452
may be right in front of us.

697
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:53,274
You sure you don't want to try
our tofurky soy cheesesteak?

698
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,600
It's on special.

699
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:55,730
I'm positive.

700
00:44:55,855 --> 00:44:59,130
I wish I could have been more help, but
I don't know what you're looking for...

701
00:44:59,255 --> 00:45:00,864
Me neither. Thanks anyway.

702
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,215
No problem.

703
00:45:07,555 --> 00:45:09,331
When did you guys change locations?

704
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,958
About a month ago.
We had a fire during the blackout.

705
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:15,400
Luckily, I got my money
before the insurance company went broke.

706
00:45:16,234 --> 00:45:18,006
Where was your old location?

707
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:24,721
How many electron volts
were generated?

708
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:27,733
It's a number, Dr. Simcoe.

709
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:29,413
An abstract object.

710
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,294
I can't sacrifice any more lives.

711
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:34,641
"Sacrifice" is an interesting word.

712
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:36,274
I appreciate its duality.

713
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:39,235
It can be used
as either a noun or a verb.

714
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,781
One can take action, surrender,

715
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,076
or give something up
for something else.

716
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,224
- What are you doing?
- I prefer the greek noun form thusia,

717
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:52,290
to indicate the object itself
that is sacrificed...

718
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,917
Meaning one's family...

719
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:56,336
or the proverbial pound of flesh.

720
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:08,515
Tell them what they want, Lloyd!

721
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,669


722
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:18,317
I'm not saying he's bad.

723
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,149
I just think most religion
is a kind of club

724
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:24,424
designed to keep some people in
and some people out.

725
00:46:25,678 --> 00:46:28,470
If it makes you feel better ,
what difference does it make?

726
00:46:28,595 --> 00:46:31,162
I'm glad you're feeling better.
I just want you to be careful.

727
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,789
You know what?

728
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,927
Maybe this wasn't the best idea.
Even when her medicine's working,

729
00:46:36,052 --> 00:46:37,847
She's... odd,

730
00:46:37,972 --> 00:46:39,713
And it's unpredictable.

731
00:46:41,169 --> 00:46:42,619
I want to hang out.

732
00:46:42,744 --> 00:46:44,994
So there's nothing to be afraid of.

733
00:46:46,467 --> 00:46:49,467
All right, but if you want to bell,
I totally understand.

734
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:05,681
Mom, this is my friend Bryce.
We work together at the hospital.

735
00:47:06,154 --> 00:47:08,950
Don't touch my hair.
You'll scare the butterflies away.

736
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,203
So this is the reason
for all the pennies?

737
00:47:15,185 --> 00:47:16,332
You brought pennies?

738
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,834
I got a bunch today.

739
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:25,048
You're a doctor?

740
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,927
I've been struck by lightning
six times.

741
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:35,935
Can I help with the wall?

742
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,399
Only use the ones marked 1989.

743
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:42,493
That's the year
that Nicole was born.

744
00:47:44,183 --> 00:47:45,069
Nice.

745
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:47,731
This whole thing
is a tribute to her.

746
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,525
You never told me that.

747
00:47:53,794 --> 00:47:55,094
You never asked.

748
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:56,164
Actually,

749
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:59,199
we were just discussing a question
that's been bothering us.

750
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:02,729
Do you think God
caused the flash-forward?

751
00:48:03,203 --> 00:48:04,506
Flash-forward?

752
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:08,312
So what? People are crying about it.
It's not the end of the world.

753
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:12,138
I have a hallucination every day.
Nobody gives a damn.

754
00:48:12,978 --> 00:48:14,597
And if you want to know about God,

755
00:48:14,722 --> 00:48:16,922
what some people call coincidence,

756
00:48:18,927 --> 00:48:20,527
is really God at work.

757
00:48:22,918 --> 00:48:24,776
- That makes perfect sense.
- Found one.

758
00:48:26,197 --> 00:48:27,469
Glue's right there.

759
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:30,994
And start the music, will you?

760
00:48:33,253 --> 00:48:34,118
Sure.

761
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:48,508
Come on, girl.

762
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:50,593
Show him how it's done.

763
00:49:09,134 --> 00:49:10,684
I come bearing gifts.

764
00:49:14,427 --> 00:49:16,410
Your son wears a size 4 shoe.

765
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,830
His physical therapist's name
is Joanie.

766
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:20,748
And finally...

767
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,793
These were taken
before the blackout.

768
00:49:24,725 --> 00:49:27,839
We've had your family under surveillance
for quite some time.

769
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:33,714
We got a lead
on our missing quantum physicist.

770
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,734
- LAPD and SWAT are backing us up.
- <i>- Where'd you find 'em?</i>

771
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:40,034
We tracked the ambulance to a restaurant
abandoned since the blackout.

772
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:43,006
Infrared's catching four guys inside.
<i>You want in on the takedown?</i>

773
00:49:43,131 --> 00:49:44,418
Text me the address.

774
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,822
If you care about your son,
you will want to

775
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,971
consider your next response
very carefully.

776
00:49:56,779 --> 00:49:58,910
How... Many...

777
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,789
Electron volts were generated ?

778
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,008
C.E.R.N. can generate
up to 500 teraelectron volts.

779
00:50:12,902 --> 00:50:14,344
Am i in the ballpark ?

780
00:50:14,896 --> 00:50:17,221
You're... You're thinking too small.

781
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,892
We cracked
the peta-electron volt barrier.

782
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,145
You generated more than
a quadrillion electron volts ?

783
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,076


784
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:40,119
And what about
tachyonic dark matter ?

785
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,205
- Did you find it ?
- We came close.

786
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,460
We found charge conjugation...

787
00:50:47,804 --> 00:50:50,463
A certain breakdown
in time symmetry.

788
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:54,978
Now take your sides.

789
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,469
What have we got ?

790
00:50:56,716 --> 00:50:57,815
Clear here !

791
00:50:59,627 --> 00:51:01,487
Clean this up. Get rid of him.

792
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,434
Take the stairs !

793
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:12,916
Bomb !

794
00:51:27,883 --> 00:51:30,336
The bomb was keyed
to 842.3 megahertz.

795
00:51:31,648 --> 00:51:33,005
That's a bureau frequency.

796
00:51:33,275 --> 00:51:36,134
When we came rolling in here,
our radios triggered the explosive.

797
00:51:36,484 --> 00:51:38,886
- That's not your everyday kidnappers.
- No.

798
00:51:39,274 --> 00:51:42,473
They're sending a clear message...
Don't go where you aren't invited.

799
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,121
Don't go to Pigeon, Utah.
Don't go to Washington D.C.

800
00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:48,666
But it occurs to me
that if mark saw them

801
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:50,303
in his vision,

802
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:52,233
they saw him, too.

803
00:51:53,908 --> 00:51:55,570
Beginning on october 6th,

804
00:51:55,763 --> 00:51:58,551
they knew that you and mark were
at the center of this thing.

805
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,609
How they plan
on using that knowledge,

806
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:03,036
we need to be thinking about it.

807
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:15,506
You're...

808
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,228
Nicole's friend from this afternoon.

809
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:20,739
- We work together at the hospital.
- Right.

810
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:23,034
- Is she feeling better ?
- She's better.

811
00:52:23,257 --> 00:52:25,828
That's the reason that i'm here
to talk to you tonight.

812
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:27,393
She's a great girl,

813
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,438
and this whole thing...
This religion thing...

814
00:52:30,622 --> 00:52:33,304
I'm not quite sure
what you're selling here, but...

815
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,552
I want to make sure
she doesn't get hurt.

816
00:52:35,677 --> 00:52:37,918
I'm not sure
if you'll believe me, but

817
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,031
I'm not selling anything.

818
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,158
I'm just receiving a gift from god

819
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,202
of a vision of myself on april 29th.

820
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,371
What i saw opened me up to
the idea that everyone's purpose

821
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:49,415
is to give and receive love.

822
00:52:49,698 --> 00:52:50,833
Simple as that.

823
00:52:51,391 --> 00:52:52,252
My job

824
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,421
is to give that message
to as many people as possible.

825
00:52:57,584 --> 00:52:58,758
No one ever got hurt

826
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:01,336
getting a little more love
into their life.

827
00:53:01,669 --> 00:53:03,179
What are you afraid of ?

828
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:59,318
<i>God has put us in this place,</i>

829
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:02,695
<i>at this time, to do something !</i>

830
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,450
<i>God is breaking into human history
in a way that's</i>

831
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:08,316
<i>never happened before.</i>

832
00:54:09,431 --> 00:54:11,873
<i>And you, you are right</i>

833
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,699
<i>at the center of everything !</i>

834
00:54:23,112 --> 00:54:23,968
Go to hell.

835
00:54:24,564 --> 00:54:26,970
<i>You have every right to hate me,
but i don't hate you.</i>

836
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,337
<i>I just wish you were standing
behind the eight ball</i>

837
00:54:29,462 --> 00:54:31,309
<i>when i came crashing through.</i>

838
00:56:02,229 --> 00:56:02,942
Wait.

839
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,654
Word of advice... Next time,
take the trigger finger.

840
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,293
Let's go ! Bring it back !

841
00:56:16,241 --> 00:56:17,732
Check the v.T.L.,

842
00:56:17,857 --> 00:56:19,667
see what we got on this guy anyway.

843
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,538
Hold it up right there.

844
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:26,132
Yeah, right there.

845
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:38,102
I was afraid this was
my only chance.

846
00:56:48,707 --> 00:56:50,614
How the hell did you find us ?

847
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:52,116
You called me.

848
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:56,620
We were talking on the phone
together in our flash-forwards.

849
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:01,876
Now it's time for you
to tell me everything.

850
00:57:07,283 --> 00:57:09,550
The painkiller i gave you
should be taking effect.

851
00:57:09,675 --> 00:57:11,386
How are you feeling ?

852
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,983
I've been better.

853
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,771
That didn't go quite
as well as planned.

854
00:57:22,937 --> 00:57:26,317
I'd give you the finger, but i'm
running out of ones to spare.

855
00:57:27,271 --> 00:57:29,008
I improvised. I had to.

856
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:31,530
We weren't getting any results,
and we needed

857
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,783
to direct suspicion away from you.

858
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,287
I think we've accomplished that
for tonight, if nothing else.

859
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:40,104
Forget it.

860
00:57:40,398 --> 00:57:41,749
I'm done being your bitch.

861
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,276
Really ?

862
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,297
Then i suppose you won't
mind if i have a talk

863
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,591
with the authorities about
the man in this video.

864
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:56,119
As of this moment, the world
thinks you and simcoe

865
00:57:56,244 --> 00:57:57,890
accidentally caused this blackout.

866
00:57:58,257 --> 00:58:01,913
What happens if they find out
you were awake while it happened ?

867
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,329
<i>So we'll go no more a-roving,</i>

868
00:58:17,726 --> 00:58:19,169
<i>So late into the night,</i>

869
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:22,099
<i>Though the heart be still as loving</i>

870
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,433
<i>And the moon be still as bright.</i>

871
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,439
<i>For the sword outwears its sheath,</i>

872
00:58:28,752 --> 00:58:30,534
And the soul wears out the breast,

873
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:33,661
And the heart must
pause to breathe...

874
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:35,324
She'll be okay.


875
00:58:36,456 --> 00:58:37,437
We all will.

876
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:40,514
I can't believe dad is gone.

877
00:58:41,774 --> 00:58:43,442
<i>We'll go no more a-roving</i>

878
00:58:44,262 --> 00:58:45,618
<i>By the light of the moon.</i>

879
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:49,268
Well, I have to take care
of the funeral home,

880
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:51,639
But I'll meet you back
at the house. I won't be long.

881
00:58:56,587 --> 00:58:57,581
It's all right.

882
00:58:59,784 --> 00:59:00,769
It's all right.

883
00:59:10,433 --> 00:59:13,549
- This isn't the way to the funeralhome.
- You won't be going there, Mr. Campos.

884
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,256
- What are you talking about?
- I have instructions to deliver

885
00:59:16,381 --> 00:59:17,819
you to the lakeside heliport.

886
00:59:17,944 --> 00:59:20,664
From there you will be airlifted
to your final destination.

887
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:23,225
I'm in the middle
of my father's funeral.

888
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:27,354
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know. I just drive.

889
00:59:28,225 --> 00:59:30,858
This ticket is yours.
My boss will be contacting you.

890
00:59:31,552 --> 00:59:32,398
Go, team.

891
00:59:32,994 --> 00:59:33,940
<i>For Detroit,</i>

892
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,476
<i>second baseman, number 17</i>

893
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:37,953
<i>Richie...</i>

894
00:59:45,733 --> 00:59:48,100
I've just about had enough.
Who the hell is this?

895
00:59:48,225 --> 00:59:50,994
<i>You don't get to ask questions here.</i>

896
00:59:51,331 --> 00:59:53,588
<i>You've been part of this
since you were 13.</i>

897
00:59:54,401 --> 00:59:56,091
<i>We've given you a lot of leeway.</i>

898
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,783
<i>In fact, we haven't asked
much of you over the years.</i>

899
01:00:00,823 --> 01:00:02,973
<i>Truth be told,
You've had it kind of easy.</i>

900
01:00:03,303 --> 01:00:06,060
So now we want you to do
exactly what we say.

901
01:00:06,543 --> 01:00:09,480
Get to your seat.
We're running out of time.

902
01:00:10,347 --> 01:00:11,219


903
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:19,410
Sit down.

904
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:22,284
<i>There's a tub of popcorn
in front of you.</i>

905
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,685
Start eating.

906
01:00:36,245 --> 01:00:38,051
There's a ring inside the box.

907
01:00:38,975 --> 01:00:39,823
Put it on.

908
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,976
<i>Put it on now.
We're running out of time.</i>

909
01:00:58,903 --> 01:01:00,026
<i>Attention, please.</i>

910
01:01:00,432 --> 01:01:02,541
<i>Now batting for Daniels, number 9...</i>

911
01:01:39,368 --> 01:01:40,159
Yeah?

912
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:43,636
Now listen to my instructions.
Walk into the nearest tunnel.

913
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:13,354
Hello, son.

914
01:02:14,158 --> 01:02:16,648
- What the hell is going on?
- Give me the ring back.

915
01:02:24,314 --> 01:02:25,290
Follow me.

916
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:44,974
<i>Mr. Campos?
I need you in bed, please.</i>

917
01:02:45,501 --> 01:02:46,235
<i>Now.</i>

918
01:02:54,663 --> 01:02:56,477
Do you know how often I hear that?

919
01:02:57,194 --> 01:02:57,937
Sit.

920
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:01,318
What's taking so long? I was
ready to leave six hours ago.

921
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,112
You came in with a concussion,

922
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,331
So we needed to keep you in
for observation.

923
01:03:05,456 --> 01:03:07,741
Oh, Betty.
I never knew you cared.

924
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,066
My pediatrician growing up.

925
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:13,243
You remind me of her.

926
01:03:13,368 --> 01:03:14,194
I had...

927
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:15,749
such a crush.

928
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:17,167
Ready, sport?

929
01:03:17,725 --> 01:03:19,712
Got your prescription filled
at the pharmacy.

930
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,452
Make sure you take all the doses.
I do not need you as a bounce back.

931
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:25,592
Yes, Betty.

932
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:27,383
He is all yours.

933
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:29,802
Hallelujah.

934
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:33,475
The sheets are scratchy.
The food is vile.

935
01:03:33,888 --> 01:03:35,867
I don't like people
watching me sleep.

936
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:39,359
- Is all this really necessary?
- You were kidnapped and tortured.

937
01:03:39,484 --> 01:03:40,983
It's for your own protection.

938
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,269
With all due respect,
I can protect myself.

939
01:03:44,394 --> 01:03:46,799
With all due respect, You can't.

940
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,451
You are officially
and indefinitely detained

941
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,102
under investigation by
the W.M.D. Directorate

942
01:03:52,227 --> 01:03:54,737
within the FBI's
National security branch.

943
01:03:55,143 --> 01:03:57,886
- I volunteered my services.
- And we appreciate that,

944
01:03:58,011 --> 01:04:00,119
but from now on, we own you.

945
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:03,964
Am I under arrest?

946
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,933
I don't know.
Have you broken any laws?

947
01:04:06,058 --> 01:04:08,689
Not unless it's illegal to be kidnapped
in front of your own son,

948
01:04:08,814 --> 01:04:10,970
beaten half to death and held captive.
No.

949
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,096
<i>Well, I gotta hand it to him too</i>

950
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:14,558
He found them.

951
01:04:16,011 --> 01:04:17,470
The guy's a loose cannon.</i>

952
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,913
Loose cannon or not, Mark managed to do
what the rest of us couldn't.

953
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:22,049
On his own.

954
01:04:22,396 --> 01:04:24,638
Janis is bringing Campos
back here from the hospital.

955
01:04:24,763 --> 01:04:27,554
When she does, we need to start
double-teaming these two, then compare

956
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:28,802
their stories.


957
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:31,847
But considering the
circumstances, and excuse me

958
01:04:31,972 --> 01:04:35,065
if I don't. You've known all this time
there was gonna be an other blackout.

959
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:36,814
Why didn't you step forward?

960
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:39,333
I don't know what you want me
to tell you, agent benford.

961
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,043
Let's start with the truth.

962
01:04:43,418 --> 01:04:45,548
How about this,
20 million people died,

963
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,674
Possibly precipitated
by something I did.

964
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,053
I have a vision in which
a drunk man tells me

965
01:04:51,411 --> 01:04:52,931
an other blackout is coming.

966
01:04:54,155 --> 01:04:57,323
No further information,
no context, no substantiation.

967
01:04:57,448 --> 01:04:59,611
Now you tell me
under the circumstances,

968
01:04:59,736 --> 01:05:02,447
- What do you expect me to do?
- How about contact the authorities,

969
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:03,950
Give 'em a little heads-up?

970
01:05:04,075 --> 01:05:05,419
What, like you did?

971
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:07,999
Why didn't you come in here
and tell your colleagues

972
01:05:08,124 --> 01:05:09,850
there was gonna be
an other blackout?

973
01:05:09,975 --> 01:05:11,827
We're talking about you here.

974
01:05:11,952 --> 01:05:12,682
Fine.

975
01:05:14,772 --> 01:05:16,889
April 29th the day of our visions...

976
01:05:18,271 --> 01:05:20,656
You called me, and considering
where you were,

977
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:23,832
You had to have had
a damn good reason.

978
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:26,781
I need to know your side of things, and
right now you're not telling me

979
01:05:26,906 --> 01:05:29,389
everything. In fact, you're not
telling me anything.

980
01:05:31,549 --> 01:05:34,137
And now, technically you're
not under arrest right now.

981
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,892
Oh, good. Can I go then?

982
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:37,391
The day's not over yet.

983
01:05:40,034 --> 01:05:42,783
When can I see Lloyd?
I need to talk to him alone.

984
01:05:43,379 --> 01:05:46,822
Are you just not listening to me?
You're not doing anything alone.

985
01:05:47,507 --> 01:05:49,220
He'll be in debriefings all day.

986
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,446
Well, can I go home first, at least?

987
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,254
Dude, you live in a hotel.

988
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:57,018
It's got this amazing shower, and it
sprays water on you in all directions.

989
01:05:57,143 --> 01:05:59,037
- You have got...
- And the towels

990
01:05:59,682 --> 01:06:00,706
white, fluffy,

991
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:01,997
warm.

992
01:06:03,487 --> 01:06:04,697
Are you serious?

993
01:06:05,552 --> 01:06:07,337
Does that crap
actually work on women?

994
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:10,260
My attempt is not
to seduce but to disarm,

995
01:06:10,564 --> 01:06:11,850
In the physic sense.

996
01:06:12,273 --> 01:06:14,810
An unstable element... transforms.

997
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:19,331
I find that people are a little bit more
honest when you...

998
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:21,543
Disarm them.

999
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:24,826
What's going on?

1000
01:06:24,951 --> 01:06:27,107
I don't know.
Something's weird...

1001
01:06:27,962 --> 01:06:30,191
- Something weird.
- Want some water or something?

1002
01:06:30,316 --> 01:06:31,401
No, i'm okay.

1003
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,657
- I'm okay.
- You're definitely not okay.

1004
01:06:37,304 --> 01:06:39,093
- Penicillin.
- You're allergic?

1005
01:06:39,218 --> 01:06:41,288
- Okay. Help!
- Anaphylactic...

1006
01:06:41,572 --> 01:06:42,372
Help!

1007
01:06:44,103 --> 01:06:45,391
Hold on. Hold on.

1008
01:07:07,953 --> 01:07:10,525
<i>Royal Toronto Flight 67 from London</i>

1009
01:07:10,813 --> 01:07:13,646
<i>is now arriving at gate 122.</i>

1010
01:07:17,554 --> 01:07:18,283
Really?

1011
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,663
Did you really think you could
leave the country without being noticed?

1012
01:07:23,204 --> 01:07:25,666
"Country" is such a loose term.
It's Canada.

1013
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:27,051
Let's go.

1014
01:07:28,024 --> 01:07:29,962
- Where are we going?
- Gate D-12.

1015
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,804
They're holding a flight back to LA.

1016
01:07:31,929 --> 01:07:34,626
I'm tried of being told what to do,
when to do it, being...

1017
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,917
being treated like a criminal?
Get used to it.

1018
01:07:37,954 --> 01:07:39,429
You can't make me go with you.

1019
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,136
Yeah, you're right. I can't.

1020
01:07:41,648 --> 01:07:42,640
But they can.

1021
01:07:49,261 --> 01:07:51,858
24 hours in Toronto.
That's all I ask.

1022
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:55,913
I'm sorry about earlier. Really I am,
but it's important that I'm here.

1023
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,352
More important than The global blackout?
Game over.

1024
01:07:58,477 --> 01:08:01,061
There's some
personal stuff going on with my family.

1025
01:08:01,186 --> 01:08:02,911
It's... it's important.

1026
01:08:03,234 --> 01:08:06,159
- There's some things going on.
- I'm really sorry your sister ran away.

1027
01:08:06,284 --> 01:08:09,000
- But we can't Just let you leave.
- How do you know about her?

1028
01:08:09,241 --> 01:08:10,311
Police reports.

1029
01:08:10,902 --> 01:08:13,760
Your mom's been writing to her in
the section of "the globe and mail."

1030
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,300
- You're not the only one who's good.
- I said I'd be here

1031
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:18,767
to help find her.

1032
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:25,158
Please.

1033
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:26,866
It's important.

1034
01:08:34,813 --> 01:08:36,570
<i>It's Janis,</i> sir. I've got him.
<i>Good.</i>

1035
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,350
Now you get that squirrelly S.O.B.
back here asap.

1036
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,554
I'd like to take a beat on that.

1037
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:43,794
<i>- I'm listening.</i>
- He says he's here

1038
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:46,788
because of his sister, but...
I think there's more to it than that.

1039
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:48,665
<i>This is just a hunch, but...</i>

1040
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,876
Can I take 24 hours to play it out?

1041
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:52,332
I'll give you the night,

1042
01:08:53,581 --> 01:08:56,965
but you make damn sure <i>you put
a leash on that dog. Do you hear me?</i>

1043
01:08:57,805 --> 01:08:58,514
Good.

1044
01:09:02,047 --> 01:09:03,053
It's too tight.

1045
01:09:03,912 --> 01:09:05,026
It's uncomfortable.

1046
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:08,018
Go further than 100 feet from me,
and I'll show you uncomfortable.

1047
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,564
Okay, hurry up. Put your clothes on
before I change my mind.

1048
01:09:12,812 --> 01:09:15,742
You police types...
All about power and intimidation.

1049
01:09:15,867 --> 01:09:18,069
I could have done this with
my trousers on.

1050
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,486
My intent was to destabilize...

1051
01:09:20,843 --> 01:09:22,441
in the physics sense.

1052
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:25,608
Hurry up.

1053
01:09:29,985 --> 01:09:31,746
- Baby! My god!
- Hey.

1054
01:09:31,871 --> 01:09:33,335
- I'm okay.
- What's new?

1055
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:36,296
- You look awful.
- I'm all right. This's my friend Janis.

1056
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:39,341
These are my brothers...
Graham, Adam.

1057
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,205
- What's happening?
- You all right?

1058
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,512
- All right, movie star.
- You'd see the other guy.

1059
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,889
I was so proud to learn

1060
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,724
that Simon had joined the FBI.

1061
01:09:48,022 --> 01:09:51,853
I expect he's been very helpful.
Yeah, he's been very helpful.

1062
01:09:55,343 --> 01:09:56,375
Not now.

1063
01:09:57,072 --> 01:09:59,518
Reporters...
Still calling every day.

1064
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,848
They camped on the lawn
after the conference.

1065
01:10:01,973 --> 01:10:04,059
My Simon... such a celebrity?

1066
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:06,368
So... Are you a secretary?

1067
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:11,248
More of... an associate.

1068
01:10:12,511 --> 01:10:15,339
After their father died,
Annabelle was in shock.

1069
01:10:15,464 --> 01:10:17,668
A few days later, The blackout hit.

1070
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,206
She left a note:

1071
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:21,216
"Too much sadness at home."

1072
01:10:21,869 --> 01:10:23,052
Drove her away...

1073
01:10:23,742 --> 01:10:24,994
I drove her away.

1074
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:27,088
That's not true.

1075
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:29,204
Don't be so magniloquent.

1076
01:10:29,955 --> 01:10:32,435
I don't understand half of what he says,
but he is a love...

1077
01:10:32,714 --> 01:10:34,662
Always looked out
for his baby sister,

1078
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:37,023
comes home every month
to help us look for her.

1079
01:10:37,973 --> 01:10:39,192
Were you close?

1080
01:10:42,402 --> 01:10:43,363
She's only 15.

1081
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:46,530
I'm gonna have a quick shower
before we head out.

1082
01:11:03,137 --> 01:11:04,329
Cool rocks.

1083
01:11:04,528 --> 01:11:05,983
There's a story behind them.

1084
01:11:06,865 --> 01:11:09,346
He had a hard time
when we first moved here.

1085
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:12,100
He was small for his age,
and the neighborhood boys

1086
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,183
used to pick on him
because of his accent.

1087
01:11:14,308 --> 01:11:15,896
He was older.
He never lost it.

1088
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:17,620
And one day,

1089
01:11:17,745 --> 01:11:20,066
they cornered him in the alley
and beat him up bad.

1090
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:22,903
The head Bully went to Sunday school
'round the corner.

1091
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:24,988
Simon marched right into the church

1092
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,865
smashed the back of the kid's head

1093
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:30,076
with a superman lunch box.
He'd filled it with them rocks,

1094
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:33,714
knocked the bully out cold.
Those boys never bothered him again.

1095
01:11:33,839 --> 01:11:35,081
I'll bet they didn't.

1096
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,792
Simon's always been a bit
of an alien in this family...

1097
01:11:38,444 --> 01:11:40,253
Smarter than all of us, different.

1098
01:11:41,108 --> 01:11:42,998
But there's one thing
he gets from me,

1099
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:46,171
bone trait that tells me
he's definitely my son...

1100
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,589
Damn it.

1101
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,770
That boy never lets anyone
push him around.

1102
01:11:57,053 --> 01:11:58,629
He always gets even.

1103
01:12:20,386 --> 01:12:22,570
It's me, Simon.
I know you're there.

1104
01:12:25,146 --> 01:12:28,570
I brought some sardines for Samantha
from that fish market she likes.

1105
01:12:31,526 --> 01:12:34,015
I also have a first-press 78

1106
01:12:34,366 --> 01:12:36,459
of "Dark was the night,
cold was the ground."

1107
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,794
It's blind Willie Johnson, Phillip.

1108
01:12:48,992 --> 01:12:50,190
Simon Campos.

1109
01:12:50,924 --> 01:12:53,157
Where the hell did you find
a first-press 78?

1110
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:07,031
You know, this song was...

1111
01:13:07,156 --> 01:13:09,350
sent into space
on the "voyager" spacecraft?

1112
01:13:09,915 --> 01:13:12,867
If extraterrestrials have actually
listened to it, they're gonna

1113
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,634
think we're a lot cooler
than we really are.

1114
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,979
Why are you here?

1115
01:13:24,743 --> 01:13:26,026
I see the welsh

1116
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:28,662
archers have moved
into their flanking position.

1117
01:13:28,787 --> 01:13:30,309
Has Henry made his speech yet?

1118
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:37,037
"This story the good man
shall teach his son,

1119
01:13:37,862 --> 01:13:40,915
"and crispin crispian
shall ne'er go by

1120
01:13:41,193 --> 01:13:42,239
"from this day

1121
01:13:42,632 --> 01:13:45,003
"to the ending of the world.
But we in it...

1122
01:13:45,335 --> 01:13:46,192
"We few,

1123
01:13:46,317 --> 01:13:47,513
"we happy few...

1124
01:13:47,768 --> 01:13:49,712
"we band of brothers."

1125
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:55,347
What? I like Shakespeare.

1126
01:13:58,649 --> 01:13:59,601
Seriously?

1127
01:14:00,015 --> 01:14:03,223
You honestly think the FBI wasn't
gonna check your cellphone records?

1128
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,611
What's it been like ten calls
he's made

1129
01:14:05,736 --> 01:14:07,567
- in the past two weeks?
- Give or take.

1130
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:09,110
Whatever, you have to say,

1131
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,946
it's gotta be important enough
for you to lie, manipulate

1132
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,407
and evade the FBI, so please...

1133
01:14:16,324 --> 01:14:17,160
Continue.

1134
01:14:17,555 --> 01:14:19,329
That was quite
a press conference...?

1135
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:23,066
Might have set particle physics
research back a hundred years.

1136
01:14:23,191 --> 01:14:25,003
Phillip, you are the only professor

1137
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:28,458
I have ever had who I know
is smarter than I am.

1138
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:32,008
Do you think a particle accelerator
could have generated some sort of...

1139
01:14:33,393 --> 01:14:34,803
Decoherence wave?

1140
01:14:35,327 --> 01:14:37,052
If your experiments at NLAP.

1141
01:14:37,177 --> 01:14:39,675
Unleashed a tachyon burst, Then yes,

1142
01:14:40,395 --> 01:14:43,269
without a doubt, it could have
caused human consciousness to flash

1143
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:44,207
forward

1144
01:14:44,332 --> 01:14:46,529
in time as the wave moved through.

1145
01:14:46,654 --> 01:14:48,650
Tell me,
how would we build something

1146
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,383
to keep us in the here and now?

1147
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,153
It's impossible.

1148
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,863
No, it's got to be possible.

1149
01:14:54,273 --> 01:14:56,794
We have to anchor consciousness
if another wave happens.

1150
01:14:56,919 --> 01:14:58,618
It's simply a matter
of finding a way.

1151
01:14:59,327 --> 01:15:02,377
We have to protect ourselves
from the effects of another blackout.

1152
01:15:02,954 --> 01:15:05,356
Now there is nothing I can do
about the 20 million

1153
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:07,026
who died on October 6th.

1154
01:15:07,492 --> 01:15:08,319
Please,

1155
01:15:08,788 --> 01:15:11,052
help me save
The millions who will die

1156
01:15:11,531 --> 01:15:12,882
if this happens again.

1157
01:15:16,968 --> 01:15:20,023
In plain English, what exactly
were you two talking about?

1158
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,726
The design that I created
that showed up in Somalia,

1159
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,692
Phillip was my advisor on it.

1160
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:28,857
He mentored me all through my PhD.
The man's a genius.

1161
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,693
I need answers.
Let's just say the FBI

1162
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,605
doesn't work at the speed
I'm accustomed to.

1163
01:15:34,843 --> 01:15:37,566
Some might say that speaks
to control issues.

1164
01:15:38,483 --> 01:15:39,492
Some might.

1165
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,454
My therapist says control issues
are rooted in fear.

1166
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,625
Your therapist is right.

1167
01:15:48,606 --> 01:15:49,836
This is a gray area.

1168
01:15:50,773 --> 01:15:52,273
And it terrifies me.

1169
01:15:57,477 --> 01:15:58,627
This is nice.

1170
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,423
I eat a lot of takeout,

1171
01:16:01,548 --> 01:16:03,564
at my desk, alone.

1172
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:06,346
That's sad, love.
Pretty girl like you.

1173
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:09,128
- No boyfriend, no kids?
- I'll get it, mom.

1174
01:16:09,253 --> 01:16:11,566
- Thanks, love.
- Gotta watch that back.

1175
01:16:14,504 --> 01:16:16,354
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1176
01:16:20,734 --> 01:16:22,827
I don't care
about any big science job

1177
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,788
or the fact
that he's all over the TV.

1178
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,409
He's still my baby, you know?

1179
01:16:27,622 --> 01:16:31,016
I remember kissing his scraped knees
like it were yesterday.

1180
01:16:33,242 --> 01:16:34,839
Motherhood's crazy like that.

1181
01:16:37,053 --> 01:16:38,718
Simon, be a dear and get that?

1182
01:16:39,618 --> 01:16:41,713
It's a surprise, their uncle Teddy.

1183
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:49,229
Uncle Teddy.

1184
01:16:53,856 --> 01:16:56,194
When I heard you were kidnapped,
I was so worried.

1185
01:16:58,885 --> 01:17:00,156
Thank god, you're okay.

1186
01:17:05,574 --> 01:17:08,164
It's a wonderful Côtes du Rhône
from Saint-Gervais.

1187
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,599
Teddy's always bringing us exotic wines
back from his travels.

1188
01:17:12,814 --> 01:17:15,630
Easy now. There are only
15 more bottles on the planet.

1189
01:17:16,807 --> 01:17:18,424
I'm self-medicatin'.

1190
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,137
Are you two brother and sister?

1191
01:17:24,448 --> 01:17:26,359
Technically,
I'm a very distant cousin.

1192
01:17:26,484 --> 01:17:28,768
- Teddy's the reason we moved to Canada.
- Really?

1193
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:30,954
Actually, Simon's the reason.

1194
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,263
The kid's IQ scores
were off the charts.

1195
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:35,519
Yet, he was failing
all his classes...

1196
01:17:35,644 --> 01:17:37,005
bored, obviously.

1197
01:17:37,981 --> 01:17:40,863
I wanna make sure
his exceptional potential

1198
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,481
didn't go to waste.

1199
01:17:43,038 --> 01:17:46,173
He started at university of Toronto
when he was only 13.

1200
01:17:46,472 --> 01:17:49,488
And that was followed
by the youth physics fellowship,

1201
01:17:49,613 --> 01:17:52,621
the PhD, the post-op at NLAP...

1202
01:17:52,746 --> 01:17:54,931
Post-doc, not post-op.

1203
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,672
Can we dispense with
the "this is your life" episode, please?

1204
01:17:57,841 --> 01:18:00,947
You know, never took time out
to have kids of my own.

1205
01:18:01,529 --> 01:18:04,178
- They're such blessings.
- Do you regret it?

1206
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,222
No, I've got these guys.

1207
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,953
I could never repay
what they've given me, school plays...

1208
01:18:11,078 --> 01:18:13,479
- hockey games, birthday parties...
- Shut up.

1209
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,221
Everything I've learned about family,
I've learned at this table.

1210
01:18:20,346 --> 01:18:23,489
- Pay no attention. This all a charade.
- What is your problem?

1211
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,031
It's all right.
Red wine makes him mean.

1212
01:18:26,156 --> 01:18:28,661
- His father was like that, too.
- How dare you bring him up?

1213
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,439
You have no right.

1214
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:37,641
You were brought here to witness
an experiment that will change humanity

1215
01:18:37,766 --> 01:18:38,766
for all time.

1216
01:18:40,177 --> 01:18:43,048
An experiment that could not
have been conducted without you.

1217
01:18:43,934 --> 01:18:46,054
The only thing I've worked on
in the past year...

1218
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,317
Has at NLAP.
The experiment that occurred

1219
01:18:48,442 --> 01:18:51,976
exactly 1 minute and 47 seconds ago.

1220
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,229
- What have you done?
- Probably killed millions of people.

1221
01:18:56,525 --> 01:19:00,175
We expect backlash against those
ultimately found responsible.

1222
01:19:00,874 --> 01:19:03,905
What a coincidence that your father
passed away just when we...

1223
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,366
needed to create an alibi for you.

1224
01:19:07,111 --> 01:19:09,369
Some kind of hunting accident,
wasn't it?

1225
01:19:11,692 --> 01:19:14,082
A private plane will take you back
to Toronto now.

1226
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,751
The FAA will not have
a record of the flight.

1227
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:21,265
One more thing. When people ask you
what you saw In your flash-forward,

1228
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,171
make up a story and stick to it.

1229
01:19:24,979 --> 01:19:25,979
Hear that?

1230
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:32,336
That is the sound
of the whole world waking up.

1231
01:19:37,212 --> 01:19:40,619
Mr. Flosso has a plan
for every thought you're thinking.

1232
01:19:41,054 --> 01:19:42,468
A hunting accident.

1233
01:19:42,593 --> 01:19:44,531
You gotta be careful
with those shotguns.

1234
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:46,801
- Handle them wrong and kaboom.
- You killed him.

1235
01:19:48,398 --> 01:19:49,617
You killed my father.

1236
01:20:16,382 --> 01:20:17,729
Now I got my killer story.

1237
01:20:26,672 --> 01:20:29,362
My god. Come quick!
It's your sister Annabelle!

1238
01:20:29,487 --> 01:20:31,049
No way. Where is she?

1239
01:20:33,828 --> 01:20:36,998
- That call, it's not for you.
- This is FBI agent Janis Hawk,

1240
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:39,625
badge 3-0-9-8-1-7.
I need to trace a call.

1241
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:41,753
<i>Everyone, hi, I'm okay.</i>

1242
01:20:42,049 --> 01:20:45,381
- Where are you, baby?
- <i>I'm in New York at port authority.</i>

1243
01:20:50,594 --> 01:20:52,006
<i>I have a bus ticket.</i>

1244
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,545
<i>I want to come home.</i>

1245
01:20:59,952 --> 01:21:01,385
<i>I want to come home.</i>

1246
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:05,020
<i>I love you.</i>

1247
01:21:06,456 --> 01:21:07,737
Why are you doing this?

1248
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:10,091
You've been accept our help
for 20 years.

1249
01:21:10,216 --> 01:21:12,617
Surely, you didn't think
that it came without a price.

1250
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,745
You asked me to give you data,

1251
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,450
to tell you when we were running
the experiment. That's all.

1252
01:21:17,575 --> 01:21:21,165
Killing my father, taking Annabelle,
that was never part of the deal.

1253
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,238
The deal is whatever we say it is.

1254
01:21:23,363 --> 01:21:25,852
And right now
we need you to cooperate.

1255
01:21:26,301 --> 01:21:28,216
Annabelle is just insurance.

1256
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,593
Let's go for a little walk,
shall we?

1257
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,354
It was the ring
that kept me awake, wasn't it?

1258
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:39,977
Some sort of
quantum entanglement device.

1259
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,098
What do I know?
I'm just a middleman.

1260
01:21:42,223 --> 01:21:43,723
I think you do know.

1261
01:21:44,152 --> 01:21:47,026
I'm trying to work out why you'd cause
a blackout in the first place.

1262
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:48,689
It doesn't matter.

1263
01:21:48,814 --> 01:21:51,322
What does is that you continue
doing what you're told.

1264
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,991
And don't think
your professor can help.

1265
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:08,714
You killed him.

1266
01:22:09,408 --> 01:22:11,136
This is your last warning.

1267
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:14,276
Cross us again and we'll start
shipping Annabelle back to you,

1268
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:15,663
piece by piece.

1269
01:22:22,852 --> 01:22:24,105
I'm calling your bluff.

1270
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:25,879
You need me.

1271
01:22:27,514 --> 01:22:30,064
Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive
right now.

1272
01:22:34,904 --> 01:22:37,326
I want to talk to the people
pulling the strings.

1273
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:40,204
- That's not gonna happen.
- See, I think it will,

1274
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:42,831
'cause I'm sending them a message.
And the message...

1275
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:45,334
is you.

1276
01:22:46,966 --> 01:22:49,630
You have no idea what you're doing!

1277
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,426
Sure I do.
I'm cutting out the middleman.

1278
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:58,055
Too bad about your emphysema.
It's gonna make this...

1279
01:22:59,802 --> 01:23:01,309
so easy.

1280
01:23:01,818 --> 01:23:04,163
Your cardiac output is starving

1281
01:23:04,935 --> 01:23:07,271
Your heart and brain...

1282
01:23:08,152 --> 01:23:09,567
of valuable oxygen.

1283
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:11,527
Finally...

1284
01:23:13,476 --> 01:23:14,864
cardiac arrest.

1285
01:23:17,615 --> 01:23:19,285
The bruises on your chest.

1286
01:23:19,454 --> 01:23:20,454
Just my...

1287
01:23:21,344 --> 01:23:23,205
futile attempt at CPR.

1288
01:23:31,582 --> 01:23:33,182
This is for my father.

1289
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,301
You pathetic son of a bitch.

1290
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:40,831
I never get pushed around...

1291
01:23:43,024 --> 01:23:44,552
and i always get even.
