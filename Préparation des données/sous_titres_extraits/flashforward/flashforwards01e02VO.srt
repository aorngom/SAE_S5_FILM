1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,869
<i>All we know for certain
is that everyone on the planet</i>

2
00:00:02,994 --> 00:00:05,667
<i>seemed to have blacked out
at exactly the same time.</i>

3
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:09,053
You shut off the consciousness
of the entire human race

4
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:10,968
for 2 minutes, 17 seconds.

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,055
I didn't just lose consciousness.
It felt more like I was having a memory,

6
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,682
- only it was in the future.
- The same thing happened to me.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,892
You're saying everyone's consciousness
just jumped forward six months?

8
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:22,039
- Crazy as that sounds, yeah.
- Priority number one,

9
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:23,564
Finding out what caused this.

10
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,734
In my flash-forward, I seemed to have
an idea why all of this was happening.

11
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,362
I was getting a prenatal sonogram.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,156
- I'm obviously not pregnant.
- I was with another man.

13
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,718
I've never seen him before.

14
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:36,224
I didn't see a damn thing.
What if I didn't see anything

15
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:38,411
because six months from now,
I'm gonna be dead?

16
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:40,656
- What have you got?
- Something I made for you.

17
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,083
- What do you got?
- A boy.

18
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,041
Car plowed straight through a fence.


19
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,364
- You're gonna be okay, honey.
- I know, Olivia.

20
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:47,797
How did you know my name?

21
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,715
- Right there. Look right there.
- No way.

22
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,095
Who the hell is that?
And why are they awake?

23
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,970
- I'm sorry. You are?
- His father, Lloyd Simcoe.

24
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:06,396
Time's up!

25
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:10,323
What did you see?

26
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:12,414
Me and my family were at Disneyland.

27
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,675
- What did you see?
- I saw a pony.

28
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,218
I was eating ice cream.

29
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:17,762
What did you see?

30
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,595
None of your business.

31
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,349
It's Blackout.
Everyone has to play.

32
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,603
- I don't want to.
- You have to tell. That's the rule.

33
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:28,689
- Give him back!
- Not until you tell!

34
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,277
Charlie!

35
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:38,032
You know we don't hit at school. You're
coming with me right now, young lady.

36
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,367
Get back here!

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,821
1x02 - "White To Play"

38
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,923
I've been struggling
ever since I had the visions.

39
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,662
They say we're supposed to live
our lives one day at a time.

40
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,075
But how am I supposed to do that...

41
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,168
with the future
breathing down my neck?

42
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,088
Every day just brings me
closer to what I saw,

43
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,958
and it seems like...

44
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:39,181
I can't avoid it,
and, there you are...

45
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,194
staring back at me.

46
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,848
- Not one has any answers, do you?
- The guy's hammered.

47
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,725
No, you don't,
because there are no answers

48
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,812
- because this program's a joke.
- I got an answer for you.

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,471
You need to take a walk,

50
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,162
cool down a little.
Spare us the rest of your bender.

51
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:00,787
Look, I hated seeing that
as much as you did,

52
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:02,935
but you never interrupt
another person's share.

53
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,135
I'm sorry, but loaded and sharing?
The guy was pushing my buttons.

54
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,789
- I've been dealing with some stuff.
- So is he.

55
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,344
You're worried about Olivia.

56
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:13,823
You're worried you're gonna fall
off the wagon in the future.

57
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,430
He's gone and done it now.

58
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,180
What's the difference?

59
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,855
You're both struggling.

60
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:22,187
Look at all these people.

61
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:24,693
Every one of them's dealing
with the same thing we are.

62
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,648
The future.

63
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,613
Only difference is, most of them
don't have a support group

64
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,464
to help them cope
with what they saw.

65
00:04:34,368 --> 00:04:35,603
Maybe it was good.

66
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:38,460
Maybe it was bad.
Maybe it was inexplicable.

67
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,863
The point is,

68
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,898
it happened to everyone,

69
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:46,062
every single human being
on the planet.

70
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,706
I saw my daughter alive.

71
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:52,676
Explain that.

72
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,383
You can walk up to any one
of these strangers

73
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,053
and ask them, "What did you see?"

74
00:04:57,178 --> 00:04:59,298
And they'd know exactly
what you were talking about.

75
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,892
When in the history of the world
has that ever happened?

76
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,431
We're all prophets now.

77
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,977
Six agents resigned this morning.

78
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:15,047
That's a grand total of 18
in the past 3 days.

79
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,520
Now I know we're all more than
a little freaked out right now.

80
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,861
Everybody in this building
is scared or hopeful

81
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:23,609
or confused about what they saw.

82
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,000
But unlike everybody
outside this building,

83
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,578
we have a responsibility
to put all that aside

84
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,747
because we're the ones
people look to

85
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:34,249
when their world goes to pieces.

86
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:42,841
It was worth taking military transport
from Washington for that little speech.

87
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,765
Deputy secretary Anastasia Markham,

88
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:47,507
Homeland Security.

89
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,210
I heard there was
an FBI field office

90
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:53,188
which appointed themselves
solely responsible

91
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,044
for investigating the blackout.

92
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:56,897
If there's another office or agency

93
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,994
that had a vision
of this investigation

94
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,305
and has more information
than we do, let me know...

95
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:04,422
And I'll send 'em our case file.

96
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:05,547
Excuse me.

97
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:07,092
Problem at my daughter's school.

98
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,606
So what were
they doing when it happened?

99
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:15,132
They were playing Blackout.

100
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:18,276
It's the same kind of role-playing
that we saw after 9/11

101
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:19,420
and Katrina.

102
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:23,001
Sorry, I can't believe she's all that
different from the other children.

103
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:24,485
The other children...

104
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,227
they're talking about what they saw,
just like the rest of us.

105
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:30,332
But the fact that Charlie hasn't,
it suggests...

106
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:31,971
something deeper.

107
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,684
So is everything okay at home?

108
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,203
I was with another man.

109
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,192
We're fine.

110
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,821
Has she discussed anything
that she might have seen?

111
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:47,447
We're taking the...

112
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,534
"she'll tell us when she's ready to"
approach.

113
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:53,755
You might consider rethinking that
and asking her.

114
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:01,652
Look, obviously,

115
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:04,214
neither of us want
to talk about this.

116
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:05,141
But?

117
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:08,802
Charlie wasn't in my flash-forward.

118
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:13,468
I'm assuming she was
at home with you.

119
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:14,683
Just say it, Mark.

120
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:17,961
You saw another man.

121
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:20,824
- Somebody who...
- I've never even met.

122
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,888
Someone, who even if I did meet,

123
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:26,653
I'd turn around and walk the other way.
You have to believe that.

124
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,613
But in your...

125
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:30,802
vision,

126
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:32,517
you were involved with him.

127
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:34,244
You said you had feelings for him,

128
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:36,275
and he was in our house.

129
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:39,666
What if Charlie
saw the same guy, too?

130
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,319
- We don't know what Charlie saw.
- It was 10:00 at night.

131
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:43,866
She had to have been home.

132
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:47,287
Come on. It's the most likely scenario,
and we both know it.

133
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,553
She's upset 'cause...

134
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:53,514
she thinks her family's
gonna fall apart.

135
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:55,510
I'm not gonna let that happen.

136
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:58,569
I'm not gonna let some man
I've never even met come in

137
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:01,360
and threaten what we have,
what we've built together.

138
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:03,783
- It's not gonna happen.
- Of course not.

139
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:07,503
But...

140
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:10,288
it doesn't change the fact
that we gotta show Charlie

141
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,157
that Mom and Dad are still good.

142
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:17,246
Are we good, Olivia?

143
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,544
I met with a divorce attorney
this morning.

144
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,421
That's funny.
I met with mine last night.

145
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,840
Yeah, so we're a disaster.

146
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,383
DEFCON 1, at least.

147
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,176
Or like DEFCON plus one.

148
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,220
Yeah, if it exists.

149
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,605
It's gonna take a hell of a lot more
than fate if you want to get rid of me.

150
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,050
We're gonna beat this, Olivia.

151
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,198
Now let me get this right.
You took it on yourself

152
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,997
to use bureau funds
to make a web site?

153
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:59,037
We've been calling it
the Mosaic collective,

154
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,829
and what the web site does

155
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,766
is it asks people to post
what they saw during their visions.

156
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:06,663
Now in the 17 hours
since the site has gone live,

157
00:09:06,788 --> 00:09:09,585
we've gotten over 600,000 responses.

158
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,258
So far it confirms the theory

159
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,090
that if you put the descriptions
of peoples' visions together,

160
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:16,394
you do start to get
a definitive picture,

161
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,974
a mosaic of April 29th.

162
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,093
Now we're using N.S.A.'s
echelon network algorithm

163
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:25,308
to intercept any suspicious words
and to look for patterns.

164
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,733
Now the hope is those patterns
will eventually lead to an explanation

165
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:31,668
of what caused the blackout
so we can at least prevent another one.

166
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:34,571
You're spending millions
of dollars on a hope?

167
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:36,750
Comforting.

168
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:39,244
But how can you be sure?

169
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,831
What makes you think that
this was a scheduled event?

170
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,627
Well, the blackout happened at exactly
11:00 A.M. Pacific daylight time.

171
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,755
There's 60 minutes in an hour,
60 seconds in a minute.

172
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,897
So the chances of something happening
at exactly the top of any hour

173
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,349
are 1 in 3,600.

174
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,961
In other words, the odds of this
happening by chance

175
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:01,141
are vanishingly remote.

176
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,855
I could give you a list as long as
my arm of unscheduled events

177
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,865
happening to coincide
with the top of an hour.

178
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,239
Exactly.
Right now, this is all supposition.

179
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,347
Some people are saying that...

180
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:13,034
that aliens did this. Other people
are saying it's the rapture.

181
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,240
But the United States government
is not going to contribute to it

182
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:20,404
with unsupported accusations, theories
and hypothetical flights of fancy.

183
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,207
- All right, what's this?
- Our "hypothetical flight of fancy."

184
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:28,052
This was taken
at Detroit's oxide super-stadium

185
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:29,657
about midway through the blackout.

186
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:32,391
As far as we know, this was the only
person on the planet that was

187
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:33,788
awake at that time.

188
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,259
Awake?

189
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:39,751
We don't know how he
or she is immune or why, but...

190
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,598
obviously,
it's gotten our attention,

191
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,049
and now it's gotten yours as well.

192
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:49,694
What's all that, Mommy?

193
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:53,485
Babe, these are pictures of people
that other people are looking for.

194
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,807
'Cause they're lost?

195
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:56,674
Well...

196
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:59,032
everybody's still cleaning up.

197
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:01,498
But when they're done,
everybody will be found.

198
00:11:01,623 --> 00:11:03,036
Really?
Are you sure?

199
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,197
Yeah, super-special sure.

200
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:06,123
Let's go.

201
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,127
I know it's in here somewhere.

202
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:13,585
Okay, sweetie, let's go.

203
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,553
Just like we said in the car.
You're gonna be super good...

204
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,451
- Yes, Mommy.
- And I'm gonna find Debbie,

205
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:23,200
and she's gonna help
take care of you.

206
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:26,729
- What are you doing here?
- A little incident at school,

207
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,732
and the babysitter's gone AWOL.
What do we got?

208
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:32,363
Admits are leveling off, we're running
out of hallways to put beds in.

209
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,352
How about that truck driver?


210
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,819
His sats are holding.

211
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,856
Also Mr. Simcoe, father of the MVA Boy,
he's been asking for you.

212
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:42,117
I've got to try and get there. It's all
I can do to get out of the OR and work.

213
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,202
What about Squirrlio? He's hurt.

214
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:46,997
Intensive care?

215
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,628
- You're hurting him, Mom.
- I'm making him better.

216
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,547
You know what would help
his recovery

217
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,951
is 10 CCs of milk and cookies, stat.

218
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:00,626
Do you can do that for me, doctor?
Nice. Go find Debbie.

219
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,281
Dr. Benford,

220
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:05,701
I presume?

221
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,476
I'm Lloyd Simcoe.

222
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:22,084
- This is awkward.
- Well, it doesn't have to be.

223
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:24,505
A simple apology for avoiding
my son's bedside,

224
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,938
and we can move right along.

225
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,080
I'm sorry. You and I have never met?

226
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,708
Yeah, that's the general objection
I was trying to convey.

227
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:35,796
Sorry, I have to make a call.

228
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:41,233
I've been camped out at my son's
bedside for three days...

229
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,856
waiting to meet this mysterious surgeon
who apparently saved his life.

230
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,391
I am so sorry.
It's just ever since the blackout,

231
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,774
I'm completely slammed with work,
so that's why.

232
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:51,949
I can tell.

233
00:12:53,297 --> 00:12:54,898
I'm sure your son
has a favorite toy.

234
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,544
I really don't know, honestly.

235
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:01,068
His condition makes him
a little hard to read. He's autistic.

236
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:02,614
Where is he on the spectrum?

237
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,633
I'm not all that familiar
with the terminology.

238
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:09,245
Dylan's mother and I separated
soon after he was diagnosed.

239
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:13,351
To make matters worse,
his mother, my wife...

240
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,858
She died during the blackout.

241
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,637
I heard that. I'm so sorry.

242
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,052
Thank you.

243
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,574
Actually, I still haven't worked up
the courage to give Dylan the news.

244
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:25,803
So sorry.

245
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:29,561
I still have a fair number
of questions regarding his condition.

246
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:33,562
Sure. You are in excellent hands
with Dr Varley.

247
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,798
He can really answer
most of your questions.

248
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:39,916
Right.

249
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,405
Very best of luck
with the procedure.

250
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:02,277
Everything okay with Charlie?

251
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:03,420
Yeah, it's fine.

252
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,953
Where'd you get that?

253
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:08,221
Charlie made it for me.

254
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,444
Was that the same one
from your vision?

255
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,395
You're wearing it?

256
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,981
You don't have kids.
Charlie's in free fall right now.

257
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,109
The last thing I need is her freaking
out because I wouldn't accept her gift.

258
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,521
Then do something
that doesn't involve wearing it.

259
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:28,138
- What's your problem, Dem?
- You putting on that bracelet...

260
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:31,495
It's like saying you want
the future to happen.

261
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:34,237
Believe me,

262
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,832
I don't.

263
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:40,715
But let's be honest about
why you're so worked up here.

264
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:43,609
It's not my future
you're worried about.

265
00:14:45,497 --> 00:14:46,547
It's yours.

266
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,680
What if I didn't see anything because
six months from now, I'm gonna be dead?

267
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,564
You're panicked over
what might happen.

268
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:55,497
But if these flash-forwards really
are a window into the future,

269
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:58,097
then we've gotta do
everything we possibly can

270
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:00,065
to use them to our advantage.

271
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,627
What about D. Gibbons? Have we
made any headway with the name?

272
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:10,116
There's about 15,000
D. Gibbons worldwide...

273
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:14,371
4,000 in the US, and of those,
about a thousand have criminal records.

274
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,387
Bureau's working with some local PDs
to knock on doors, but...

275
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:19,626
- it's gonna take time.
- We don't have time.

276
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,007
We don't even know
if D. Gibbons is important. 

277
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:24,923
That name was on my office wall
six months from now.

278
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,051
This person is important.

279
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,601
You guys ready to have
your world rocked?

280
00:15:31,726 --> 00:15:33,987
You know our person of interest,
D. Gibbons?

281
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:36,933
Well, she just strolled
into our office

282
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:39,227
asking for an Agent Demetri Noh.

283
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,988
Let's just start from the beginning.

284
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:51,345
My name is Didi Gibbons,

285
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,870
short for Deirdre.

286
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:54,818
I'm 45 years old.

287
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:57,706
I live in Anaheim,
and I own a cupcake store.

288
00:15:58,073 --> 00:15:59,686
Didelicious cupcakes.

289
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,127
I brought some.

290
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,772
Peanut butter chip, carrot cake,

291
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,368
and red velvet.

292
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,260
They're quite good.

293
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:11,867
Well,

294
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,638
I've never been arrested.

295
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,051
I've never had so much
as a speeding ticket

296
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,016
or anything like that, and...

297
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:20,264
But I'm nervous.

298
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,685
You're already investigating me,

299
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,702
and I haven't done anything yet,

300
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:26,026
or I won't.

301
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:28,526
Did you see something
in your flash-forward?

302
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,305
It was so strange.

303
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:36,047
I was in my store, and I was arguing
on the phone with someone.

304
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:38,330
I don't know anything about
any cockadoody pigeons.

305
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,082
I was getting angry.
I was so snippy.

306
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,669
You need to talk
to Agents Benford and Noh.

307
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,922
They're with the FBI.
Criminy, it is Noh!

308
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,838
N-O-H. It's his last name.

309
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:53,227
Chinese or Mongolese
or one of the -ese. Asian.

310
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:55,489
I don't know! Just leave me alone!

311
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:57,390
That's good.

312
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:02,436
In my church, we've been talking about
these visions, what they might mean,

313
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,196
and my pastor
suggested I contact you.

314
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:09,113
I called FBI offices
until I found an Agent Noh.

315
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,446
It's Korean, by the way.

316
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:13,864
I'm a good person.

317
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:16,076
She could be lying.

318
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,745
We can't take people at their word
when they talk about what they saw.

319
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,534
Did she look like she was lying?

320
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:23,247
No, but it's pretty convenient,
her walking in here like this

321
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:26,205
with the cupcakes and the snippy
and the pigeons.

322
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:28,535
Could be nothing.

323
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:31,174
Could be the key
that unlocks everything.

324
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:34,772
According to your years of investigating
global blackouts, right?

325
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:38,297
Mark's right. At this point,
any detail could be significant.

326
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:40,529
Run a background check.

327
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:42,883
I'm gonna log these in to evidence.

328
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,233
Since we're running down details, why
don't we circle back on what you saw?

329
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:48,890
I was in a meeting.

330
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:51,246
But like Demetri said,
I can't take your word for it.

331
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,227
In my flash-forward,
gunmen were coming into the office.

332
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:57,050
If you were in a meeting, you were here,
you might have seen something.

333
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:58,422
But I didn't see anything.

334
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:00,183
How can you be sure?

335
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:01,840
What?

336
00:18:16,518 --> 00:18:18,110
All right, I wasn't in a meeting.

337
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,265
I was having a bowel movement.

338
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:24,601
Sorry I asked.

339
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,120
No. You wanted it.
Now you gonna get the blow-by-blow.

340
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,902
Just wait. It gets better,

341
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:31,233
'cause I was also
on the can when the blackout happened.

342
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,483
I didn't know what happened.

343
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:37,427
I banged my head against the side
of the stall. I was a little out of it.

344
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,077
Rafalski was in the John as well.

345
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:42,669
What?

346
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,749
Son of a bitch was drowning.

347
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,295
- What'd you do?
- What do you think I did?

348
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,423
I gave the poor bastard
mouth-to-mouth.

349
00:18:57,956 --> 00:18:59,865
You speak about this,

350
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,293
e-mail, text, fax, Twitter,
whatever, to anyone,

351
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:06,164
I will transfer you to the ass end
of the cornfield so fast,

352
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,372
your head will spin.
You understand what I'm saying?

353
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:09,497
Yes, sir.

354
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,405
- Get out.
- Mouth-to-mouth?

355
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,584
Get out.

356
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:15,266
There we go. Full recovery.

357
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:18,398
Squirrlio! Squirrlio!
You're okay.

358
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,325
He's still a little tender
from his sutures.

359
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,806
It's my recommendation
that he remain ambulatory.

360
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:24,954
- Do you know what that means?
- Like an ambulance?

361
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,098
Kind of.
It means moving around.

362
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:29,466
So do you want to take a walk?
Let's do it.

363
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:33,162
I'm gonna take extra special
care of you from now on.

364
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,448
I'm making super-special sure
you're always going to be okay.

365
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:39,873
You saw another man
in our living room.

366
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,729
What if Charlie saw
the same guy, too?

367
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:46,433
Hey, honey.

368
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,221
Sweetie, just wait up.

369
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:55,944
Baby, see that man there?

370
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,018
Have you ever seen him before?

371
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:00,493
Who is he, Mommy?

372
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:02,982
He's nobody, baby.

373
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:04,674
He's nobody.

374
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,761
Dylan! What happened to Dylan?
Who hurt Dylan?

375
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,779
- Who hurt him?
- Babe, he's fine.

376
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:28,725
Mommy operated on him. He's fine.
Dear heart, how do you know Dylan?

377
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:30,801
I saw him in my dream.

378
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:34,649
You did? Where were you?
Were you at our house?

379
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:38,518
- What did you see?
- How did he get hurt?

380
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,015
It's okay.

381
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:44,491
How'd he get hurt?

382
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,613


383
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,124
What did you find out
about Didi Gibbons?

384
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,874
Well, NCIC gives her
a clean bill of health.

385
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,881
And aside from a few parking violations,
the woman is a saint.

386
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,516
The only thing even remotely
resembling any kind of hiccup

387
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:02,927
are a couple of credit card
charges made last week.

388
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,430
It was two purchases on the same
account at nearly the same time...

389
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,293
One for a manicure in Newport Beach

390
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:13,187
and the other at a gas station in Utah,
like, two minutes later.

391
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,272
It's a cloned card.
It's gotta be a cloned card.

392
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,860
Didi said she was having an argument
with her credit card company, maybe.

393
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,153
Sick to death of you people
harassing me.

394
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,197
- Argument about pigeons?
- Cockadoody pigeons!

395
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,992
Maybe the pigeon's a person...

396
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,667
the name of whoever stole
her credit card and charged it in Utah.

397
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:31,288
14 people with the last name
Pigeon in Utah.

398
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,392
- Any criminal records?
- Not unless you include jaywalking

399
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:36,399
and indecent exposure.

400
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:40,500
Didi said in her flash-forward
she was arguing about pigeons.

401
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:42,951
Is there someplace in Utah where,

402
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,005
I don't know,
there's a lot of pigeons?

403
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,977
That's good. No, as theories go,

404
00:21:48,102 --> 00:21:50,660
that one's really thin, actually.

405
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:53,393
- Tell us again why you're the boss?
- Because he's a genius.

406
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:57,064
There's not "a lot of pigeons"
in Utah, but there is one.

407
00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:01,443
- Pigeon isn't the name of a person.
- It's a place... Pigeon, Utah.

408
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:05,055
Contact the Bureau Field Office
in Salt Lake City

409
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,569
and get them running this down.

410
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:09,348
In the meantime, let's see if there's
anything else for us to go on.

411
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:11,328
- Excuse me.
- I understand. Go ahead.

412
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,354
- I'm sorry. Do you have a minute?
- Sure.

413
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,936
So I took Charlie
with me to the hospital,

414
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:19,921
and she saw a boy
she recognized from her vision.

415
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:24,132
- Did she tell you what she saw?
- No, she just imploded.

416
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,012
Come to see daddy work,
Charlie bear?

417
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:29,358
- How are you?
- Good.

418
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,624
She seemed to really care about him.

419
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:37,188
Seeing him in his hospital bed,
she was worried for him.

420
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,133
'cause he was in the hospital.
That's probably where she met him

421
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,953
sometime in the next six months.

422
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:43,165
Maybe.

423
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,513
What?
What's the matter? What's up?

424
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:51,662
His father...

425
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,247
The boy...

426
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,082
His father is the man I saw.

427
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:59,529
His name is Lloyd Simcoe.

428
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:02,279
- His son is...
- His son's your patient.

429
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:04,471
But Lloyd didn't recognize me.
I'm positive.

430
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:05,674
You don't think?

431
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,386
No, I've thought about it,
and I realize that I saw him.

432
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,872
But before he turned around,
the flash-forward ended.

433
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:12,374
So I don't think he saw me.

434
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,809
But it doesn't matter what I saw.

435
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,393
This man means nothing to me.

436
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,437
- For now.
- Come on. That's not fair.

437
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,786
You can't punish me
for something I haven't done...

438
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:25,283
I'm not punishing you, Livy.

439
00:23:26,377 --> 00:23:28,530
It's just, what was that man
doing in our home?

440
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:31,743
I seem to remember you,
you told me you had feelings for him.

441
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,119
You said you were okay.
Obviously, you're not.

442
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:37,238
Until three days ago, you'd never
met this guy. Now you have.

443
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:42,377
The future's happening.

444
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,048
What if we just saw a possible
future, like a warning?

445
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,884
I am never gonna be
unfaithful to you, Mark.

446
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,761
We don't know what "never"
means anymore.

447
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:53,096
Excuse me. We checked
with the field office near Pigeon.

448
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,768
Didi Gibbons' cloned card just got run.
Our unsub bought a bus ticket.

449
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,659
Makes sense.
Planes are still grounded.

450
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,913
Ticket's for tonight.
D. Gibbons is blowing out of town.

451
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:02,257
We got a chopper waiting.

452
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:03,795
I gotta go.

453
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:40,105
Welcome to Pigeon.
I'm Sheriff Keegan.

454
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,836
Mark Benford.
This is Agent Noh.

455
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:42,943
How are you?

456
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,733
Why is this man so important?

457
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,212
Did he have anything to do
with the blackout?

458
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:50,191
He's a person of interest.

459
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:52,998
We've set up a stakeout across
from the bus station

460
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:54,404
in case he does show.

461
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:55,880
It's like an invasion.

462
00:24:56,187 --> 00:24:58,910
Your Salt Lake City Field Office
practically sent an army.

463
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:01,128
We're not looking
to horn in on your turf.

464
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:02,083
Too bad.

465
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:05,607
We could use someone
to tell us what to do.

466
00:25:05,732 --> 00:25:08,923
Everyone in town is fixated on
these visions they experienced.

467
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:10,466
Does that include you?

468
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:12,465
Not exactly.

469
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,178
It's a little boring,
but I didn't see anything.

470
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,849
Really?
Nothing?

471
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,144
I'd rather not be any other way.

472
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,205
The people I know,

473
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,405
the ones who say
they saw their futures,

474
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,439
they're torturing themselves
over it.

475
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:32,573
Let's go.

476
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:39,351
I wanna know everything we're doing
to identify this person in the stadium.

477
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:42,361
What would be the point?
I thought you didn't think this was...

478
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:45,191
What was the term you used?
"Scheduled event"?

479
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:48,087
Are you going to brief me
or crow about this some more?

480
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,590
I don't see why I can't do both
for a little while.

481
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,757
We're calling him "Suspect Zero."

482
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,177
How do we know
this is a "him" we're looking at?

483
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,912
Video forensics.

484
00:25:57,227 --> 00:26:00,433
Do you see how his head is the exact
height of the bleacher right there?

485
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,876
Well, that is a 6-foot wall,

486
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,582
and using that as a reference point

487
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:06,676
and accounting
for camera angle and distance,

488
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:10,650
we can estimate
that this person is 5'8" and 150 pounds,

489
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,740
which makes the odds
of this being a female

490
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,189
less than 1 in 40.

491
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,032
Can the image be enhanced further?

492
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:18,355
Data services has already
blown up the pixels,

493
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,013
but we're sending it to the N.S.A.
to see if the Fort Meade supercomputers

494
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:23,664
can do anything else with it.

495
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,790
Look at him.

496
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,358
Walking around, not a care in the world,
not the least bit surprised.

497
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:29,953
Which means

498
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,006
he knew the blackout
was gonna happen,

499
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:33,758
which means he was involved.

500
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:37,502
Conspiracy theory is comforting.
It presents you with an enemy,

501
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:39,889
gives you someone to arrest,
put on trial.

502
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,904
This is not a visual effect
we're looking at.

503
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:45,435
This man is real.

504
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:48,189
I hope we can find him
before he does something worse.

505
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,095
What's worse than causing
worldwide devastation?

506
00:26:51,928 --> 00:26:52,985
Causing it twice.

507
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,744
Dr. Varley.

508
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:06,277
My son's asking for some kind
of nonhospital hamburger.

509
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,445
Wrapped in paper with a toy.

510
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:13,714
Is that sanctioned
given his condition?

511
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,803
Actually, it's good
that he's getting his appetite back.

512
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:18,662
His vitals are looking good.

513
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:20,559
Your son's a fighter.

514
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:23,765
He's gonna need to be.

515
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,512
Everything is gonna be okay,
Mr. Simcoe.

516
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:32,400
How can you be so sure?

517
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,237
I've seen the future.

518
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:42,829
I know everyone
saw something different.

519
00:27:43,421 --> 00:27:45,456
For me, it was something positive.

520
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:47,050
For others...

521
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,171
Maybe it was something bad.

522
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:52,229
But either way,
I've gotta believe...

523
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:55,630
I do believe that...

524
00:27:57,284 --> 00:27:58,758
there's a gift in the knowing.

525
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,782
The test of who we are now is

526
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,250
what we choose to do
with what we've seen.

527
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:07,268
That's an amazing thing.

528
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:32,000
- Go for Benford.
- <i>It's Keegan.</i>

529
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,003
<i>Gibbons never even picked up
his ticket.</i>

530
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:39,133
But you have
the exits out of town roadblocked?

531
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:41,603
<i>But he could still
make it out of here on foot.</i>

532
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:43,669
We don't even know if it's a "he."

533
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,792
We don't know who we're looking for.

534
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,182
Damn it.
I knew it.

535
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:52,229
That was a good shot.
But maybe these future clues of yours

536
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,653
- are just...
- Bogus?

537
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:57,777
I wasn't gonna be that harsh, but,
it's been a little bit of a goose chase.

538
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,486
Tell that to Didi Gibbons.

539
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:02,073
And what about this?
I saw it in my vision,

540
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,485
and it came true.

541
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,724
Has Charlie ever made you
one of those before?

542
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:08,160
Then it's not that amazing.

543
00:29:08,426 --> 00:29:11,707
Coincidences happen all the time.
That's why they're called coincidences.

544
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:14,394
People see patterns
in tea leaves and clouds.

545
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:18,135
Come on.

546
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:20,189
Let's go home.

547
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:25,638
Sorry about the circus.

548
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,819
Sorry it didn't pan out.

549
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,092
Sheriff, what is that place there?

550
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:32,930
Divine Doll,
a mom-and-pop operation.

551
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:36,033
They went bankrupt a few months ago,
along with most of the town.

552
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,308
It's vacant now.

553
00:29:42,465 --> 00:29:44,579
In my vision,
there was a photo of a doll.

554
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:48,363
- Next to a card with the name...
- D. Gibbons.

555
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:53,037
You telling me
that's a coincidence, too?

556
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,909
You think this qualifies
for probable cause?

557
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,854
The county judge will.
He's my father-in-law.

558
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,058
I thought you said
this place was vacant.

559
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,396
It's supposed to be.

560
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:29,113
FBI! Open up!

561
00:31:30,983 --> 00:31:32,598
- D. Gibbons, get down!
- Freeze!

562
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,201
Don't move! On your knees!

563
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,185
Are you alone here?
On your knees!

564
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,236
- Get down!
- Don't move! On your knees!

565
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:44,777
"He who foresees calamities

566
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,487
"suffers them twice over."

567
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,738
What'd you say?

568
00:31:57,254 --> 00:31:58,426
Officer down!

569
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:15,492
All right, take her away.

570
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,658
Excuse me. Could I take a look
at the photo you just took?

571
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:50,050
- Shooter's in the wind.
- I'm sorry about Keegan.

572
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:53,136
- I know what you must be thinking...
- We talk about that later?

573
00:32:57,065 --> 00:32:59,872
What we got now is
cell phone and white queen.

574
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,189
So who's he playing chess with?

575
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,314
Exactly.

576
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,877
Chess pieces, dolls.
What the hell was he doing here?

577
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:10,112
E.R.T. guy's best guess is he was doing
some heavy duty computer hacking.

578
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,453
According to data forensics, our guy's
been superbusy since the blackout.

579
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:16,345
He's been hacking all over the world.
V.L.A. in New Mexico,

580
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,477
Particle Collider at C.E.R.N.,
G.P.S. network.

581
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,819
He even tried to hack
into Mosaic through the n.S.A.

582
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,363
Why?

583
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:25,376
I think he was ruling out
possible causes.

584
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,841
I don't think we're the only ones
investigating why the blackout happened.

585
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:39,850
Dr. Benford.

586
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:42,769
Your patient pulled through.

587
00:33:44,327 --> 00:33:47,384
I'm sorry I didn't get to see your son,
today. I was really busy.

588
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:48,983
All human patients, I swear.

589
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:52,237
I should get her home.

590
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:55,532
I've been sitting here,
thinking of a way to tell my son

591
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:58,077
that his mother is dead.

592
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,667
Well...

593
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:08,087
However you tell him,
just be sure to tell him you love him.

594
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,007
Is parenting really that simple?

595
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,009
It's the only simple part.

596
00:34:17,815 --> 00:34:19,280
Take care, Mr. Simcoe.

597
00:35:00,492 --> 00:35:01,734
I'm back, Dylan.

598
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:09,606
Now there's something I've...

599
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:12,152
been putting off telling you,

600
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,971
because I wanted you
to get better first.

601
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,491
And you know what?

602
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:21,856
You really are getting better.

603
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:25,593
I guess you're...

604
00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:30,043
you're wondering why your mother
hasn't come to see you yet.

605
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:32,206
She...

606
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:34,129
She's not here.

607
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:40,468
That's right.

608
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:45,259
You see, Dylan,

609
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,017
when the blackout happened,

610
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:53,645
and when everyone fell asleep...

611
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
your...

612
00:35:59,146 --> 00:36:00,907
your mother never woke up again.

613
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:06,196
She was in an accident, and she...

614
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:08,113
She died?

615
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:27,745
It's just you and me now, kiddo.

616
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:32,194
But we're gonna be okay.

617
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:39,779
I love you.

618
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:43,116
I wanna see Olivia.

619
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,739
3:00 A.M., guys.

620
00:36:51,618 --> 00:36:53,584
I was about to fall asleep.
What's going on?

621
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,628
What's going on
is that I'm eating crow.

622
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:57,299
Tell him.

623
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,675
I managed to pull
the I.M.E.I. number

624
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:02,677
off the cell you and Mark
recovered from Utah.

625
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:06,723
And as it turns out, D. Gibbons
made a series of six calls.

626
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,056
Five right before the blackout
to another disposable cell.

627
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:12,258
A lot of people made calls
before the blackout.

628
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:13,981
Mark was on the phone with you.

629
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:17,912
I know, but the sixth call was placed
30 seconds into the blackout.

630
00:37:18,037 --> 00:37:19,027
I traced it...

631
00:37:19,912 --> 00:37:21,904
To...
Another cell.

632
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:25,993
He was on the phone with somebody else
during the blackout.

633
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:28,536
Yes, but not just any somebody.

634
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,206
The 2nd call was placed
to someone within range

635
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,818
of 3 cell phone towers,

636
00:37:32,943 --> 00:37:34,772
allowing me
to triangulate a position.

637
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:35,993
Let me ask you.

638
00:37:36,118 --> 00:37:38,922
What kind of a place
has multiple towers

639
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,173
to handle increased cell traffic?

640
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,843
A baseball stadium.

641
00:37:44,872 --> 00:37:46,722
D. Gibbons was talking...

642
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:48,648
to Suspect Zero.

643
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,950
And then there were two.

644
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:02,454
- How many postings so far?
- 900,000 and counting.

645
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,262
This site's taken on
a life of its own.

646
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,549
Everybody's got a story.

647
00:38:07,674 --> 00:38:09,759
Just trying to corroborate
what they saw.

648
00:38:11,654 --> 00:38:13,123
I feel like an idiot.

649
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:16,260
I've been ragging on Mark
about all this future stuff, but,

650
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:20,315
I gotta admit,
these clues on his board.

651
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,049
It seems like they're panning out.

652
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,176
Look who's up late.

653
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:27,719
Or early,
depending on your perspective.

654
00:38:30,353 --> 00:38:31,603
Ginger coconut.

655
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:33,143
Blue Hawaiian.

656
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:36,562
Nothing says gratitude
like tropical flavoring.

657
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:38,915
Thank you.
We didn't really do anything.

658
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,239
You don't think that saving
my credit score

659
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:43,963
and my peace of mind isn't anything?

660
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:47,227
- Well, thank you.
- Enjoy your sugar rush.

661
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:48,991
But get back to work.

662
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:57,175
Flash-forward to my ass
ballooning two sizes.

663
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,185
But you saw yourself pregnant,

664
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:01,421
so your fat ass gets a pass.

665
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:06,375
It's so funny.

666
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:11,305
I've never had
that "ticking clock" feeling.

667
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:14,642
I've never even
had the urge to have a baby.

668
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,521
There I was...

669
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:21,241
Some blonde woman

670
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:24,403
giving me an ultrasound.

671
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,113
This sonographer...

672
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:29,157
Maybe she saw you, too.

673
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:31,367
Maybe she's out there somewhere,

674
00:39:32,379 --> 00:39:34,037
waiting for you to post something.

675
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,749
Why not?

676
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,175
I wanna know.

677
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,468
It's a girl.

678
00:39:58,999 --> 00:39:59,999
There.

679
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,524
Your turn.

680
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:04,745
I didn't see anything, Janis.

681
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:08,030
Some people just think
that means you'll be asleep.

682
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,997
Or it means I'll be dead.

683
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:18,697
I met a woman today
who didn't have a vision.

684
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:24,003
Five minutes after she told me,
she was shot and killed.

685
00:40:27,878 --> 00:40:29,929
Have you talked to Zoey about this?

686
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,026
In my experience,

687
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:35,029
fiances aren't really big
on their grooms

688
00:40:35,154 --> 00:40:36,558
dying before the wedding.

689
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,249
Ruins the first dance.

690
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,986
Heavy corpse.

691
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,284
It's bad wedding etiquette
or something.

692
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:48,403
If you're gonna be dead,

693
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,363
and that's a big "if".

694
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,410
Don't you kinda wanna know
how it happens?

695
00:40:58,242 --> 00:40:59,388
I don't know.

696
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:03,665
I don't think so.

697
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:08,964
But if you know,
maybe you can prevent it.

698
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:13,461
And maybe there's somebody out there

699
00:41:13,586 --> 00:41:15,797
that has information
that can help you.

700
00:41:19,424 --> 00:41:20,513
What the hell.

701
00:41:41,013 --> 00:41:42,956
Hey, it's 3:00 in the morning.

702
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:45,416
Didn't want to wake you.

703
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,713
Got back late.

704
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:49,298
Ginger ale?

705
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:58,721
How was Nevada?

706
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:01,902
Utah.

707
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,605
Dead end.

708
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:07,940
You all right?

709
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,213
At work, I'm making moves,

710
00:42:13,494 --> 00:42:16,239
betting the future
is gonna happen as I saw it.

711
00:42:16,364 --> 00:42:17,613
But here at home,

712
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,900
with you.

713
00:42:19,902 --> 00:42:20,969
Us, me.

714
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,659
I'm praying it doesn't.

715
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:32,857
Did I do the right thing,

716
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:34,634
telling you about Lloyd?

717
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,239
You did.

718
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:42,309
We shouldn't keep secrets
from each other.

719
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,840
Why'd you make a fire?

720
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:55,206
No reason.

721
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:09,743
This is Demetri.

722
00:43:09,868 --> 00:43:12,140
<i>Mr. Noh, I'm sorry to disturb you,</i>

723
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:15,502
<i>but I'm calling in response
to your Mosaic board posting.</i>

724
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,016
My post?
Already?

725
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:19,248
Who is this?
How'd you get this number?

726
00:43:19,373 --> 00:43:22,599
I can't divulge that, but I can tell you
my vision involved you.

727
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:25,558
Go on.

728
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:27,606
In my flash-forward,

729
00:43:28,478 --> 00:43:30,556
I was reading
an intelligence briefing,

730
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:33,000
and, I am sorry.

731
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:35,644
There is
no delicate way to say this,

732
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:39,178
but on March 15th, 2010,

733
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:42,744
You are going to be murdered.

734
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:15,473
You're home, Daddy.

735
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:17,751
Sorry, sweetie.
I didn't mean to wake you.

736
00:44:17,876 --> 00:44:19,016
Go back to sleep.

737
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:27,774
The reason I was bad at school...

738
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,315
It's 'cause the other kids
were saying,

739
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:33,827
the flash-forwards
are gonna come true.

740
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,437
Only the good ones, honey.
I promise.

741
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:41,469
So if the bad ones
aren't gonna come true,

742
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:43,116
why did people have them?

743
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:46,996
Think of them like a warning.

744
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:49,373
You know, like when mommy's driving

745
00:44:49,498 --> 00:44:51,546
and the traffic light turns yellow.

746
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:54,557
It means there's a stop sign
coming ahead.

747
00:44:54,971 --> 00:44:56,151
So we don't crash.

748
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,310
Exactly.

749
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:01,071
I don't understand my warning.

750
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:05,744
What do you mean?
Did you see something scary?

751
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:09,550
"D. Gibbons is a bad man."

752
