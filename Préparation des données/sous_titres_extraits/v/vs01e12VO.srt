1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:01,751
<i>Previously on</i> V....

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,004
- Are there others like you?
- They're called 5th Column.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,366
Crush them
before they become a greater threat.

4
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:10,066
If you're 5th Column, things are
about to get very bad for you.

5
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,428
A human female
is carrying a Visitor baby.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,473
Find them.

7
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:17,178
You've been looking for me.
I found what you're really looking for.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,332
Joshua said you passed
the empathy test.

9
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:20,853
- Why?
- Because one day

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,272
I'll ask a favor from you.

11
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,315
If my mother's eggs
are allowed to hatch,

12
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,117
those soldiers will destroy
the 5th Column, won't they?

13
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:28,235
Yes, they will.

14
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:53,498
You're doing great, Val.

15
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:55,888
Keep breathing.
You're at 2 centimeters.

16
00:00:56,397 --> 00:00:58,391
This baby's coming.
Can I get you anything?

17
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,352
Yeah, glass of water?
Thirsty.

18
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:27,044
You have a look.
What's up?

19
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,631
I want to talk to you
about "Live Aboard."

20
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,802
I get that you're not crazy about
that idea, but it's important to me.

21
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,597
I understand your concern about me
moving up there, and so does Anna.

22
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:40,808
Really?

23
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,560
She even invited us up for dinner.

24
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,229
Just me, you, Lisa and Anna.

25
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:51,527
What?

26
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:02,315
Take your food.

27
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:06,533
I love you.

28
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,937
Jack, it's Erica.

29
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,264
Get everyone to the church.
I have a plan.

30
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,030
Where's Ryan?

31
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,856
- I'm not sure.
- Why'd you call us here?

32
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,985
Tyler's joining
the "Live Aboard" program.

33
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:33,569
I can't stop him,
but I can stop Anna.

34
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:35,097
I don't understand.

35
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,945
Ryan told us Anna's V soldier eggs
are about to hatch.

36
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,639
If she has thousands of V soldiers
at her disposal...

37
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:43,496
- We're dead.
- We are out of time. This is it.

38
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,956
What do you suggest?
We storm the ship and kill the eggs?

39
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,167
That is exactly what I'm suggesting.

40
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:50,132
My kind of plan.
I like your spunk.

41
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,630
None have ever been there.
We don't know where they are.

42
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,749
No, we don't.
Joshua does.

43
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,896
It's never gonna happen.

44
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:59,958
We had a plan to take out the eggs,
but since the shuttle was shot down,

45
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,802
Anna's practically
locked down the ship.

46
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,724
There has to be something we can do.

47
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,968
There's two ways into
the incubation chamber.

48
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,945
A guarded corridor and an entrance
in Anna's private quarters.

49
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,767
Not even I can get in there anymore.

50
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:11,607
<i>I can.</i>

51
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:15,277
Anna invited Tyler and me
onto her ship for dinner.

52
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,446
- Too dangerous.
- Create a diversion

53
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,491
to get Anna out of her quarters so that
Erica's got time to get to the eggs.

54
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,742
Dinner's at 7:00.

55
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:24,542
You'll need an explosive
to destroy the eggs.

56
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,413
Now we're talking. What kind?

57
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:29,994
I have to go.

58
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,179
Contact me when everything's set up.

59
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:35,297
We need to know you'll be here
if we risk everything on our end.

60
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:36,674
We will.

61
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:44,905
Marcus released another wave
of guards through the ship.

62
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,498
They're searching everyone.

63
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:48,195
Get rid of the comms device.

64
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,604
If they find it on you,
we'll all be exposed.

65
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,802
You haven't returned our calls.
You okay?

66
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,335
I needed my line to be free.

67
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:02,243
- My baby's being born.
- What?

68
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,245
I've been waiting for Dr. Pearlman
to give me a call if they need my help. 

69
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:07,663
What's going on?

70
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,500
Erica's been invited up to the ship.
She'll destroy Anna's soldier eggs.

71
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,502
Are you serious?

72
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,963
I'm going with you.
You're gonna need my help with this.

73
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:19,675
No. Ryan, I think you should stay here,
in case Val or the baby need you.

74
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:21,523
Once you get up there, then what?

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,733
Anna's never gonna let you
out of her sight.

76
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,652
Joshua's planning a diversion.

77
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:28,723
Anna will be pulled away for safety,
and then she'll make a move.

78
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:31,937
And Marcus? He's her watchdog.
You can't pull this off under his nose.

79
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,648
I can get Marcus off the ship.

80
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm on top of the Vs most wanted list.
Makes me excellent bait.

81
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,139
To do this, Erica's gonna
need a layout of the ship.

82
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,451
Every detail you can remember,
everything.

83
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:51,094
The armada of ships
from our home planet

84
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:53,042
have arrived ahead of schedule.

85
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,990
They're within striking
range of Earth.

86
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:58,648
Keep them cloaked and at bay.

87
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,882
We don't want them revealed
until we're ready for the next stage.

88
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:05,181
Tyler's mother is joining you
tonight for dinner, as planned?

89
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,114
With Agent Evans
as my ally on the ground

90
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:10,353
and my newborn army,

91
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,372
the humans won't know what hit them.

92
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:16,751
We got a problem.

93
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,734
- The comms device isn't working.
- What?

94
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,561
We're supposed to confirm
with Joshua we're go.

95
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,385
If we can't reach him,
you're not going up there.

96
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,033
We can try skywriting.

97
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,537
I could go to Chad Decker.

98
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,905
Anna's lapdog?

99
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,324
I prefer the skywriting idea.

100
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,280
Unless someone has a better idea,
I don't see we have another choice.

101
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,877
Chad is the one who went to Anna
with our plans to blow up the shuttle.

102
00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:43,709
Chad is the one who went on air
to convince people

103
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,970
to follow her, to keep her here.

104
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:48,722
- You think you can trust him?
- I don't.

105
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:51,067
That's why we'll have him
deliver a message

106
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,018
that he and she won't understand.

107
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,479
We're covered either way.

108
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,440
If he doesn't go to Anna with it, then
he'll deliver the message, we're a go.

109
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,177
And if he takes it right to her?

110
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:02,690
Then Anna gets her hands
on a message she won't understand.

111
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:09,368
<i>Ryan, they've got Val.</i>

112
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,853
<i>It all happened so fast.
You've gotta find her.</i>

113
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,036
Anna has my baby.
Tell her Ryan Nichols is here.

114
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,398
You don't have clearance.

115
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:31,662
Get off me!

116
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:36,269
Let him aboard.

117
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:38,005
I want to talk to him.

118
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:39,758
He's dangerous.

119
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:42,283
Why don't we destroy him
like any other traitor?

120
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,809
He was able to resist my bliss.

121
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:47,709
He fell in love with a human
and turned 5th Column.

122
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:49,908
You don't understand
what we have in him.

123
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:51,326
An enemy.

124
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,829
Insight into our enemy,

125
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:56,843
the very thing that fuels humans...

126
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:57,848
love.

127
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:01,480
That's exactly
why we have to study him,

128
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:02,963
up close.

129
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:05,340
If we can turn him back to us,

130
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,216
we can turn anyone.

131
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,762
Father?

132
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:18,687
Your call sounded urgent.
What can I do for you?

133
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:22,270
Yes, I was, given this message
from one of my parishioners.

134
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:25,088
It needs to be delivered to the mother
ship. I know that you have access.

135
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:26,850
Delivered to who, exactly?

136
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:28,299
I don't know.

137
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:30,792
If you agree to help, you're to leave it
in the medical bay.

138
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:34,161
So you're saying that there are Visitors
who are part of the 5th Column?

139
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:36,897
Yes, Chad.

140
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:39,416
Even her own kind are
turning on Anna now.

141
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:43,220
And this message...

142
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,881
I'm guessing
it isn't a hallmark card.

143
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,133
I wouldn't know.
I'm just the messenger.

144
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,089
I'm tired of playing games
with you, father.

145
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:53,430
The 5th Column blew up a shuttle full
of innocent human beings.

146
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:56,089
All I've seen the 5th Column do
is hurt people.

147
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,601
They're lies, Chad.

148
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,645
The shuttle shoot down was a setup.

149
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,131
Anna wants to paint the 5th Column
as a terrorist group,

150
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:05,567
gather public support against them,
and thanks to you, she succeeded.

151
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:12,277
Please, Chad.

152
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:21,843
What is it?

153
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,127
That favor you owe me?
It's time to repay it.

154
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,289
At 7:00, we're gonna
create a diversion

155
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,834
so your mother's eggs can be
destroyed before they hatch.

156
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:30,150
What?

157
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:33,095
Those soldiers are bred
for destruction, Lisa...

158
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:34,871
To kill humans.

159
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:39,872
Here, take this.

160
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,539
Joshua, you're asking me
to betray my mother,

161
00:08:47,623 --> 00:08:49,223
to murder my own kind.

162
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:51,822
Sorry.

163
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:53,435
I can't.

164
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:56,827
You know she has a plan for Tyler...

165
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,258
The humans.

166
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:02,719
It's time for you to decide
which side you're really on.

167
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:25,261
Get off me!

168
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:27,900
Where is she?

169
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:33,261
Val's here.

170
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,568
She's safe for now.

171
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,603
I just wish you would've
come to me sooner.

172
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,391
Valerie's pregnancy
is exceedingly risky.

173
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:43,627
- It's a miracle.
- So you kidnapped her?

174
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:44,852
To save her.

175
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:47,922
If we'd have asked,
would you have let me?

176
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,189
- She could've died down there.
- You're lying.

177
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:53,300
You don't care about saving her.

178
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:55,636
All you wanna do is run tests,

179
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,137
like she's a lab rat.

180
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,972
You can fight us

181
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,434
or you can help us
fight to save her life.

182
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:04,774
It's your choice.

183
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:08,343
Team <i>Lézards</i>

184
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:10,268
Cable, John117, MiniBen314

185
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,093
Strex, Némone, tactactac

186
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:13,933
<i>- Red Sky -</i>

187
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,316
I'm so glad you're here.

188
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,551
- We have to get out of here.
- You don't have to be afraid.

189
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:40,097
- But you warned me about the Vs.
- We don't have a choice right now.

190
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:44,101
Because your pregnancy is just
really complicated. It's dangerous.

191
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,353
We need their technology
to deliver the baby.

192
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:51,108
It's coming, Ryan.

193
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:52,943
I'm scared.

194
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:55,946
Val, I'm so sorry for
what I put you through.

195
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:58,036
I'm sorry I left.

196
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:01,285
I love you.

197
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,414
I don't want to do this alone,
any of it.

198
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,748
You don't have to.

199
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:08,250
I'm here now.

200
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,433
Everything is gonna be okay.

201
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:17,384
Her vitals are dropping.
The baby's crowning. Wait outside.

202
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:19,678
It's okay.

203
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,179
It's okay.

204
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,890
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Please,

205
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,376
let them save the baby.

206
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,707
I'll be right outside.

207
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:49,166
You ask me, we need to send you up
to that UFO more often.

208
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:52,587
Is that the explosive?

209
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:56,002
The bomb you're gonna use
to scramble the bitch's eggs

210
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:58,225
is a next gen gel explosive.

211
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,652
Unlike nitrates and peroxide,
it gives off no signature.

212
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:04,450
Even alien technology
won't pick this puppy up.

213
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:05,766
What's with the handbag?

214
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:08,749
Just gonna hide it
in the lining here.

215
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:11,506
And it's a clutch, not a handbag.

216
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,984
- What's the initiator?
- You got your cell phone?

217
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,829
You slip it in here like so.

218
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:25,881
You set the timer...

219
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:27,540
And boom.

220
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:32,837
Marcus will be off the ship by 1900.

221
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:35,548
He's second in command.
How you gonna get him off the ship?

222
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:38,673
I'm gonna grab a gecko
by the peace ambassador center,

223
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:42,014
have him get a message up to the ship
to set a meeting with Marcus,

224
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,053
and then...

225
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:47,140
- I'll ambush their ambush.
- That sounds dangerous.

226
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,934
I've walked away from much worse.

227
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,936
Good.

228
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:53,980
Erica, you...

229
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,131
Be careful.

230
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:56,900
Like you said,
Anna has an agenda, too.

231
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,438
- Where did you get this?
- From an intermediary.

232
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,937
The same source who gave me
the information about the shuttle.

233
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:19,155
I've been keeping an eye on him.
I believe I'm close to finding out

234
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,713
who's behind the message.

235
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:22,919
5th Column?

236
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:28,709
My instructions were to leave
this envelope in the medical lab.

237
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:32,477
Does that mean there are Visitors
who are working with the 5th Column?

238
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:36,714
My people are loyal and of peace.

239
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,471
This message must have been intended
for the "Live Aboard" humans.

240
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,798
It seems we've been infiltrated,
even up here.

241
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:47,284
Deliver this as instructed.

242
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,205
I don't want to see
anyone else get hurt.

243
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,534
Don't worry, Chad.

244
00:13:57,645 --> 00:13:59,540
As soon as we stop the 5th Column,

245
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,609
nobody else will.

246
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:26,034
Put the gun down, Mr. Hobbes.

247
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,951
We have a lot to talk about.

248
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:35,415
I believe you have something for me
as well. Parker's research.

249
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,706
Half of Parker's research.

250
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,757
I kept the other half
in a safe place.

251
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,927
You like to play games, Mr. Hobbes?

252
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,888
You really think I'd show up here
without a insurance policy?

253
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:52,939
You want the other half?

254
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:54,517
I want answers.

255
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,481
Why did you frame me?

256
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,855
Because I'd like to hire you.

257
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:03,151
And what makes you think
I'd ever work for you?

258
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,900
Because you already have been...

259
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:09,779
For years.

260
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:18,753
Shall we talk, Mr. Hobbes?

261
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:27,050
- You ready for dinner?
- Yeah. I'm ready.

262
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:28,510
Don't embarrass me.

263
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:57,247
Welcome aboard, Agent Evans.

264
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:59,488
There are no firearms or
any personal items allowed

265
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:01,626
in Anna's private quarters.

266
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:12,396
Your bag.

267
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:15,417
You don't trust me with my purse?

268
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:18,981
Mom, they're just trying to be safe.

269
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:21,390
What if I get a call from work?

270
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,713
You can keep your phone.
I'm sorry, ma'am, It's our policy.

271
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:37,556
Welcome to the ship.

272
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:41,333
Thank you for invitings
to your home.

273
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:43,478
I'm thrilled you could make it.

274
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,513
- Hello, Mrs. Evans.
- Hello, Lisa.

275
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,047
It's lovely to see you.

276
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,262
Please. I'll join you in a moment.

277
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:52,396
I have a matter I need to attend to.

278
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:08,003
How can I help you?

279
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:11,163
I was told to deliver
something here,

280
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:13,326
from a friend of yours
on the ground.

281
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:17,123
I don't have any friends
on the ground.

282
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,246
I think you must have
the wrong person.

283
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,294
My mistake.

284
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:29,162
Must be for someone else.

285
00:17:37,604 --> 00:17:40,100
What if it was a message from Erica?
Why didn't you take it?

286
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:43,228
Chad Decker's Anna's willing pawn.
He can't be trusted.

287
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:46,356
We have to warn the others not
to engage with Mr. Decker.

288
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:49,010
- Anna may be using him.
- There isn't time.

289
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,498
I can send out a message
to everyone.

290
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:53,663
I'll erase it quickly
so it can't be tracked.

291
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,914
What choice do we have?

292
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:57,534
Do it.

293
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,593
Why did you use me?

294
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,393
You're a man with a history
of serving your loyalty

295
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:08,795
to the highest bidder.

296
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,496
We want to continue to
retain your services.

297
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:14,999
- To do what?
- Infiltrate a terrorist group

298
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:16,761
known as the 5th Column.

299
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:19,821
And if I say no?

300
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:22,851
You won't.

301
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:27,246
I've got the research
you so desperately want.

302
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:29,232
I've got the leverage here, chief.
Not you.

303
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,783
We play by my rules,
or I walk out of here,

304
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:34,612
and you'll never find me.

305
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:37,440
Well, we may not be able
to find you,

306
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:40,222
but we found her.

307
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:45,799
Now...

308
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,044
Let's talk 5th Column, shall we?

309
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,058
Track down everyone
that message was sent to.

310
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:11,021
Put him with the others
when you find them.

311
00:19:11,146 --> 00:19:12,762
Anna will deal with you.

312
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:44,015
This was for you.

313
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,266
You set us up.

314
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:47,977
They'll all be caught.

315
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,313
And?

316
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,831
And they'll be skinned alive!

317
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:54,484
You're lying.

318
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,868
Anna would never do that.

319
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:02,075
You've been fooled like
the rest of the humans.

320
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,278
The 5th Column's
trying to save humanity.

321
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:07,622
She lied to you.

322
00:20:08,922 --> 00:20:11,292
Anna didn't cure your aneurysm.
She gave you one.

323
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:13,637
I don't believe you.

324
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:15,804
There's a door

325
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:18,231
to a restricted corridor

326
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,247
50 feet from Anna's executive suite,

327
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,930
where they take the "Live Aboards."

328
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,816
What you see there
will answer all your questions.

329
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,201
This is your homily
for tonight, is it?

330
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:48,218
The Visitors as false prophets.

331
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,073
Do you think that's wise,
speaking out against them

332
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:53,626
after they have done?

333
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:57,106
I've been quiet about my feelings
about the Vs for too long, father.

334
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:58,676
They're dangerous.

335
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,092
Dangerous?

336
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,185
People are worshiping them
instead of God,

337
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,638
growing dependent on them.

338
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:08,927
This is my opportunity
to speak my mind from my pulpit.

339
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,581
It's more than an opportunity.
It's an obligation.

340
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,064
The Visitors are a miracle.

341
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:16,777
How can you be sure

342
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,152
that Anna isn't sent by our lord?

343
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:21,791
That the Visitors
aren't his handiwork?

344
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:24,279
You told me I lost touch
with my parishioners

345
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:26,446
because I haven't spoken
to them from my heart.

346
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:28,753
This is what's in my heart.

347
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,142
I want you to speak to them,

348
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,550
but not like that.

349
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:36,716
I will not allow a message of hate

350
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,741
to be preached fr my pulpit.

351
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,402
Write a different homily.

352
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:47,138
And if I don't?

353
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:52,553
This istill my church, Jack.

354
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:55,108
Speak out against the Visitors,

355
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,415
and you are no longer welcome here.

356
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:10,453
One more push.

357
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,499
My baby.

358
00:22:24,818 --> 00:22:26,318
I wanna see my baby.

359
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:42,532
Both the baby and mother are stable.

360
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,156
I'm pleased the baby survived.

361
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,090
The mother, however, did not.

362
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:33,779
It must be challenging
being a single mother, isn't it?

363
00:23:33,904 --> 00:23:36,574
It can be difficult at times, but...

364
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,414
It's worth every minute.

365
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,034
Head of the task force,
a teenage son...

366
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,295
how do you do it all?

367
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,013
Same as you, I guess.

368
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:45,715
Lots of worrying.

369
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,603
now I am sure that the Visitors

370
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,427
have overprotective mothers. Right?

371
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:50,919
We do.

372
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,459
We just show our
feelings differently.

373
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,606
Erica, I want you to know
that you don't have to worry about.

374
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:00,757
We're gonna take care of Tyler
when he comes to "Live Aboard."

375
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:03,408
Do you think it's safe
with the 5th Column?

376
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:05,353
- Mom, come on.
- I'm sorry.

377
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:07,303
Between the two of us,

378
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:09,751
I'm sure we'll make certain
he's safe.

379
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:13,767
But this is a social occasion.

380
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:17,338
- May I pour you some more?
- I would love that. Thank you.

381
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,488
I'm sorry.

382
00:24:21,564 --> 00:24:23,238
It's work. Please excuse me.

383
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:24,796
- Of course.
- Yes?

384
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:47,819
- I was just looking for my purse.
- No, you weren't.

385
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,638
I know why you're here.

386
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:57,245
It's that way.

387
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,456
And you'll need this.

388
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,687
It's a blue energy grenade.

389
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:08,512
It will freeze the eggs.

390
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:12,121
Twist the top to activate,
place it in the center of the pool

391
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,292
and get out as fast as you can.

392
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:17,263
There was supposed to be a diversion.
What happened?

393
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:19,225
I don't know.

394
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,204
You'll be gone too long.

395
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,941
It will cast suspicion.

396
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,692
Go back inside.

397
00:25:28,254 --> 00:25:29,813
I'll figure something out.

398
00:25:31,977 --> 00:25:32,977
Good luck.

399
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,626
What happened?

400
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:47,951
We were set up by Chad Decker.

401
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:50,315
Everyone's been rounded up.
If you can get me out,

402
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,646
- I can still cause a diversion.
- You were right.

403
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,389
I had to choose which side I'm on,

404
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,514
and I did.

405
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,424
I gave Erica
the blue energy grenade.

406
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:03,227
How do I get you out of here?

407
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,314
I placed a bug in the med lab
security system in case I ever needed

408
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,759
to disable it.
The code is "John May lives".

409
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:18,732
- What are you going to do?
- Whatever I have to.

410
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,187
Go back to dinner.

411
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,208
I'll wait 15 minutes to cause
the diversion so you're not suspected.

412
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:30,922
You're very brave.

413
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:34,724
Thank you...

414
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:37,585
My queen.

415
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,433
Your ship is beautiful,

416
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:22,890
but you must get homesick.
I know I would.

417
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:24,820
It's been difficult, yes.

418
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:27,019
High commander.
We need to move you

419
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,090
- to a secure location.
- What happened?

420
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:30,967
5th Column. We're being attacked.

421
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:33,150
Tell Marcus to return
to the ship immediately.

422
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,111
I can help. I need my gun.

423
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,238
- It's okay. She's an ally.
- Follow me.

424
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,722
Here's to your
children's future, Anna.

425
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,208
Stop.
It's done.

426
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,585
Now how do I get you out of here?

427
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,503
There can be no suspicion
you're 5th Column.

428
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:19,729
You have to kill me.

429
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,217
I won't. Come on.

430
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,219
I'm dead anyway, Erica.

431
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:26,013
You have to do this,

432
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:27,889
for all of us.

433
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:30,098
We both know that.

434
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,564
Don't.

435
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:36,936
Come on.

436
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,780
Thank you.

437
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:13,082
Shooting that terrorist
saved many lives.

438
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:15,563
To protect the Visitors...
That's my job now, Anna.

439
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:17,710
Did you get a good
look at the shooter?

440
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:20,158
The pillars were in the way.
I saw he had a V uniform.

441
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:22,445
He wasn't a V. He was a human.

442
00:30:23,044 --> 00:30:24,530
- What?
- My security team

443
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,015
reported that a human
infiltrated the ship

444
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,244
and stole a V uniform.
They're still gathering the details.

445
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:32,747
Anna, I'm sorry.

446
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,166
If there's anything I can do...

447
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:39,115
Excuse me.

448
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:46,523
Thank you for
delivering that message.

449
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:49,346
We're hoping it'll help us
expose more 5th Column.

450
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:52,212
I would hate to see them
drive you away.

451
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:54,227
They won't.

452
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:57,043
And thank you for your loyalty.

453
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,248
You've trusted us with your career
and your health.

454
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:02,926
Without us,

455
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:04,978
you'd lose everything.

456
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,003
- Thank you for an enventful evening.
- I hope we can do it again sometime.

457
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,255
You can count on it.

458
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:01,991
You killed her, didn't you?

459
00:32:05,455 --> 00:32:07,905
You said yourself,
I have use for her.

460
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:10,151
Why would I kill her?

461
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:15,474
We did everything we could
to keep her alive.

462
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:17,893
If you'd come to me earlier,

463
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,791
we could have used our technology
to save her life.

464
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,526
This is what I was trying
to protect your from.

465
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:27,762
Human emotion.

466
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:31,666
I'm so sorry you lost her.

467
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,077
But now...

468
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:40,519
Now you have me.

469
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,682
You made it back in one piece.

470
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,430
Good on ya.

471
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:03,577
I couldn't have done
it if Marcus was there.

472
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:06,650
I didn't think you'd come through.

473
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:09,635
Guess I was wrong.

474
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:13,048
You wouldn't be the first.

475
00:33:14,712 --> 00:33:17,661
There's a story in the Bible
about a man who loses his way,

476
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,142
only to find it again.

477
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:24,479
I'm here today to tell you...

478
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:26,795
That I am that man.

479
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:28,545
I was lost,

480
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:30,414
but now...

481
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:33,441
Now I am found.

482
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:36,722
I lost the courage
to tell you the truth,

483
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:40,100
that you need to choose
who you are going to follow...

484
00:33:40,358 --> 00:33:41,358
the Vs...

485
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:43,466
or God...

486
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,522
because you can't serve two masters.

487
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:50,486
I know some of you are confused.

488
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:53,222
But we must stand
for what we believe.

489
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:55,717
We must reaffirm our devotion to God

490
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:58,160
and renounce the Vs
as false prophets.

491
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,871
Even a single Judas in our midst

492
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:02,787
can defeat us.

493
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:07,539
There is a war upon us.

494
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:10,957
<i>A war for our souls.</i>

495
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,426
You are not alone.

496
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,964
You will never be alone.

497
00:34:23,383 --> 00:34:24,528
No pain.

498
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:27,045
No heartache.

499
00:34:30,497 --> 00:34:32,272
No human emotion.

500
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:36,588
Just peace.

501
00:34:38,764 --> 00:34:39,764
My peace.

502
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,370
With love,

503
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
hope

504
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,207
and faith, we can overcome

505
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,542
anything.

506
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:49,944
Who among you

507
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,219
will join me?

508
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:04,143
Let "V" no longer
stand for "Visitor."

509
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:06,604
Let "V" stand for "victory."

510
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:25,962
I told you not to preach
that message in my church.

511
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:29,668
I'll speak my heart.

512
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,448
If you don't let me do it here,
I'll do it somewhere else.

513
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:37,199
This will end badly.

514
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:06,455
Now there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

515
00:36:38,686 --> 00:36:39,836
Welcome home.

516
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:52,281
I just found out.

517
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:55,457
We believe it was Joshua.

518
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:58,516
As your chief medical officer,

519
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:00,092
he must have gained access

520
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,511
to your private chambers
and planted a bomb.

521
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:05,438
We had everything
completely locked down.

522
00:37:05,563 --> 00:37:07,135
He couldn't have done this alone.

523
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,977
Find out who else is responsible,
at whatever cost.

524
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,009
Are they all...

525
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:18,442
dead?

526
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:21,596
Only 12 soldiers survived.

527
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:26,006
Their core temperatures
were severely affected.

528
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:28,537
We don't know how many will make it.

529
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:47,006
What is happening to me?

530
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:52,198
I believe you are experiencing
your first human emotion.

531
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:16,335
This is terrible, to be sure,
but we must not act rashly.

532
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:17,836
They must pay.

533
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:19,608
This is too soon.

534
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,256
If we initiate this sequence now...

535
00:38:26,308 --> 00:38:28,180
Do you know what you've done?

536
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:32,007
Vengeance.

537
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,870
Welcome back.
