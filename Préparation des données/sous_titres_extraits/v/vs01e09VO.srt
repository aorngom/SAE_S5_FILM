1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:01,542
<i>Previously</i>...

2
00:00:01,822 --> 00:00:04,754
<i>It is with great pleasure that
I announce our 'Live Aboard' program.</i>

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,228
<i>Each of our 29 ships</i>

4
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:08,674
<i>have selected participants
from every city in the world.</i>

5
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,927
Three members of a 5th Column cell
were murdered.

6
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,114
The next blood that spills
is gonna be theirs.

7
00:00:13,273 --> 00:00:15,389
- You think I'm gonna die?
- We can heal you.

8
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:18,059
My girlfriend doesn't know the truth
about who I really am.

9
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,619
She's human and pregnant.

10
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:21,979
- I think I should go.
- I can't let you do that.

11
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:22,949
Let's go.

12
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,316
Everything that we have done
to protect people,

13
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,363
and a human betrays us.
Why did you do it?

14
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:28,569
'Cause we can't win.

15
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:31,969
What do you mean, we can't win?

16
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,897
The Visitors are too powerful...

17
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,591
and they will do whatever they can
to get what they want.

18
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:41,957
You killed four men yesterday.
What do the Vs have to do with that?

19
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:44,251
They threatened my family.

20
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,170
They said they would kill my wife

21
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,589
and my little girl if I didn't do
what they told me to do.

22
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:51,467
Why would I kill those guys?
I had nothing against them.

23
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:54,845
Please. Please.
You gotta believe me.

24
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:56,751
He's lying.

25
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,807
I'm not lying. I'm not. I swear.
I swear, father, I'm not lying.

26
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:04,939
What would you do?

27
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,222
If it was your kid,
what would you do?

28
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:09,610
Who else is on your hit list?

29
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,246
Nobody.

30
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:12,571
Nobody.

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,088
There was a computer at that place.
The hard drive was missing.

32
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:19,120
It has names and addresses
of other 5th Column people on it.

33
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,288
I need it,

34
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,374
and I need to know
who knows about it.

35
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,418
I never saw a computer. I swear.

36
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:28,921
Lying son of a bitch.

37
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:31,932
I'm not lying.

38
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,803
Please, father.
Please make him stop. Please.

39
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:41,350
It's okay.
That's enough.

40
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,060
What's going on?

41
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:57,075
What did you do
to that doctor back there?

42
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:01,454
Ryan! Stop it.
What's going on?

43
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,124
I'm a Visitor.

44
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,085
- What? No, you're not.
- Yes.

45
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,212
This isn't how I wanted to tell you,
but yes.

46
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,299
No. We've known each other ten years.
The ships just got here.

47
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,510
Some of us were sent here
ahead of them.

48
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:19,305
- No, you grew up in Pittsburgh.
- That's not who I am.

49
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,806
That's just a cover.

50
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,725
I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

51
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:23,943
Oh, my God.

52
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,878
What does this mean?

53
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:27,855
I'm pregnant.

54
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,766
- What about the baby?
- I know.

55
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:30,909
Don't touch me!

56
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,960
I need you to get into the car.

57
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:35,525
The Visitors know about us now.
They'll be looking for us.

58
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,530
Why?

59
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:37,906
They want our baby.

60
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,283
Good morning.

61
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:48,185
It's a special day for the Visitors.

62
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:50,995
Today we welcome you,

63
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,103
the first group of humans
selected to participate

64
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:55,674
in our "Live Aboard" program.

65
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,340
As you get oriented
here on the ship,

66
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,389
you'll find yourselves becoming more
and more immersed in our culture.

67
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:05,446
You'll experience our education

68
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,312
and be introduced
to our spiritual philosophies.

69
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,233
Our medical staff
will tend to each of you

70
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:15,375
to ensure that you remain
in optimal health.

71
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,392
A situation has arisen.

72
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:24,390
A human female came into the
healing center late last night.

73
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:27,213
The doctor's holo-scan showed
she was carrying a baby...

74
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,709
half human, half V.

75
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,105
I hope your stay is filled
with much enlightenment.

76
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:41,512
And now...

77
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,854
enjoy your grand tour
of the New York mother ship.

78
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,071
Is the woman in our custody?

79
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:53,964
A man arrived
shortly after she did...

80
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:55,416
We presume the father.

81
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,110
He immolated the doctor
and escaped with the pregnant human.

82
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,943
We dispatched two guards from
the healing center to apprehend them.

83
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,117
I need them alive.

84
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,206
Have Joshua gather the top physicians
from each of our 29 ships.

85
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:08,580
This is your top priority.

86
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:09,540
Find them.

87
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:24,847
Only take what you need.

88
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:26,181
No.

89
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,889
- Where are you going?
- Call the police.

90
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:32,200
You can't call them.
Now you can't call anybody.

91
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:34,982
The Vs are everywhere.
They've infiltrated the police,

92
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,219
the government,
every aspect of human life.

93
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,857
We don't know who we can trust.

94
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,696
How do I know I can trust you?

95
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,699
I'm not going anywhere.

96
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:45,732
They know about us and the baby.

97
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:47,870
If they find us, they'll kill us.
Understand?

98
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,142
You're gonna be okay.
All right? It's okay.

99
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,843
Is that what you...

100
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:19,018
I don't want you looking.
Don't look.

101
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:22,495
- What's the baby gonna look like?
- No, don't look.

102
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,202
- We have to go.
- Where are we gonna go?

103
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:27,885
Somewhere where the Vs
won't find us.

104
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:44,290
You told me it wasn't possible yet,

105
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:46,595
but it is.

106
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,349
A human female is carrying
a Visitor baby.

107
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:55,187
The existence of this baby
puts our entire species at risk.

108
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:58,350
A hybrid can be born
with human emotions,

109
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:00,636
love.

110
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:04,720
The 5th Column could breed
an entire generation of hybrids

111
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:06,198
to fight against us.

112
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:08,213
It is a mongrel,

113
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,739
a threat to our survival.

114
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:13,170
Therefore,

115
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:16,453
we must accelerate all initiatives
of our "Live Aboard" program.

116
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,603
I want your ships to commence
extraction procedures

117
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,635
on your human residents immediately.

118
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,850
Once you recover the parents,
bring them to Joshua.

119
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:33,784
Dissect them.

120
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,814
Find out how this pregnancy
came to be

121
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,730
and how we can stop it
from happening again.

122
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:39,815
And the baby?

123
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,340
Destroy it.

124
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:45,151
We've come too far to let it
interfere with our plans.

125
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:53,453
I want it out of me.

126
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,706
That's not an option.
You're too far along.

127
00:06:58,354 --> 00:06:59,603
I don't believe you.

128
00:07:03,063 --> 00:07:04,704
You're a Visitor, too, aren't you?

129
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,385
I am sorry.

130
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,974
How could you do this to me?

131
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:17,561
How could you not say something?

132
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,355
What were you thinking?

133
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,358
Sorry, but I did it to protect you,
and that's still our baby.

134
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,818
No, it's not our baby.

135
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:26,487
It's a lie.

136
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,611
I don't even know what it is.

137
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,254
I know you're scared,
but we're running out of time.

138
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,870
When you were at the center,
did they give you anything?

139
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,929
A vitamin shot.

140
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:41,782
They said it would be good
for the baby.

141
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,378
They...

142
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,303
They said it would be good
for the baby.

143
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,472
What?

144
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:56,706
They injected you with R-6.
It allows them to track you.

145
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:59,121
But don't worry.
It won't harm you or the baby.

146
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,448
R-6 masks itself in humans
as saline.

147
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,318
Now I've been working on a way to try
and block its ability to transmit.

148
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:15,052
This shot raises the pH levels
in the body.

149
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,371
The acidity
neutralizes the tracking function.

150
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,286
But it could take up
to 24 hours to take effect.

151
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,418
Do it.
Then we gotta go.

152
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:44,167
You're gonna need a doctor
to monitor the baby...

153
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:45,895
a V doctor.

154
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,527
You jump into this now...

155
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:51,697
you give up everything.

156
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,723
There's nothing
more important than this baby.

157
00:08:54,729 --> 00:08:55,742
Not anymore.

158
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:03,915
<i>Erica, it's Ryan.</i>

159
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:06,533
Did you find Val?
Is she okay?

160
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,923
She's with me, but the Vs are on to us.
I gotta get her out of town.

161
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:10,930
Where?

162
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,813
There's a couple
from the old resistance.

163
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:15,345
The Thompsons. Back in the day,
they helped 5th Column disappear.

164
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:18,098
When will you be back?

165
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,084
I won't.

166
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,519
I can't win this without you, Ryan.

167
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,381
I need to stay
with Val and the baby.

168
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,899
Okay, I lose them,
I've got nothing to fight for.

169
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,609
I know I told you to keep Tyler

170
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,819
<i>in the dark about this thing,
but maybe I was wrong.</i>

171
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,655
I should have told Val the truth
from the beginning.

172
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:35,828
<i>You can do this without me, Erica.</i>

173
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:38,535
<i>Jack has the comms device.
He knows how it works.</i>

174
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:40,954
You need help on the mother ship,
you talk to Joshua.

175
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,570
He's your guy now, okay?

176
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:47,436
Get Val somewhere safe, okay?

177
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:48,969
<i>Good luck.</i>

178
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:50,157
You, too.

179
00:09:56,954 --> 00:10:00,632
This is Chad Decker. Welcome to
a "Prime Focus" special report.

180
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:04,268
A few days ago, I told you
that the Visitors had diagnosed me

181
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:06,395
with a life-threatening
brain aneurysm.

182
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,458
So today,

183
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,526
I head up to the mother ship
for the surgery

184
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,610
that will not only change my life,

185
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:12,697
but save it.

186
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:15,781
And you, my audience,
are coming with me.

187
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:19,796
Through our cameras, you will experience
my healing firsthand,

188
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:24,030
from prep to surgery,
to post-op procedures and beyond.

189
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,401
You will witness the miracle
of V medicine.

190
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:29,412
And maybe, just maybe,

191
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:32,436
if you or someone you love
is in need of medical care,

192
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:35,142
the Visitors will save
your life, too.

193
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,910
And we're clear.
That was great, Chad.

194
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:48,616
Ty? You home?

195
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:53,737
Turn that off, please.
I came home from work to talk to you.

196
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,033
<i>Some crazy V news
out of Eugene, Oregon.</i>

197
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,657
<i>A group of V enthusiasts
have banded together</i>

198
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:01,144
<i>to try and raise funds to purchase
an abandoned church.</i>

199
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,953
I'm sorry that I lied to you,

200
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:04,856
but I love you.

201
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,708
I'm really trying here, Ty.

202
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,687
<i>They want to open the Church of V,</i>

203
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,518
<i>hailing Anna the Almighty.</i>

204
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:16,932
The Church of V?

205
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:18,260
- Mom...
- Seriously?

206
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,293
People are looking for answers.

207
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:23,276
How is that weird?

208
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,684
Anna is not a God, Tyler.

209
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:27,054
But...

210
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:29,730
name one bad thing the Vs have done
since they got here.

211
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,649
You can't, can you?

212
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,318
It's more complicated than that.

213
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:37,404
- How is helping people complicated?
- Listen.

214
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,704
- I really need to talk to you.
- I don't have time for this now, mom.

215
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:44,620
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting Lisa.

216
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,546
Well...

217
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,064
I would really like
to meet Lisa sometime,

218
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,659
besides a brief encounter
in her underwear.

219
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:54,535
Ty...

220
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:57,279
Give me another chance.

221
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,842
Okay?

222
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,029
We'll see.

223
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,136
Due to unforeseen circumstances,

224
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:15,684
it's critical that we advance
our plans for you and Tyler.

225
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:17,778
I'm gonna ask him to join
the program.

226
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:20,572
I expect him to accept
my invitation.

227
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:23,995
Of course.
I won't let you down.

228
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,398
It's good Tyler trusts you.

229
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,873
He'll remain on the ship
until he's no longer needed.

230
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:32,265
And then what?

231
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:46,848
We've accelerated

232
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,809
our plans for the residents
on the program as you requested.

233
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:51,853
How long
until we can realize our goals?

234
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,623
Our physicians are experimenting
on the humans as we speak.

235
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:56,525
They're moving
as quickly as possible.

236
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,787
The two guards I dispatched
to retrieve the hybrid's parents

237
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:07,012
were killed.

238
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:12,752
Release a soldier.

239
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,586
No soldier has ever
touched foot on earth.

240
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,671
If the humans were to become aware
of the level of destruction

241
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:21,029
- they are capable of...
- They won't.

242
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:25,637
You'll follow him every step of the way
and clean up his mess.

243
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,263
Nasty piece of business, this.

244
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:47,742
It's called a Heretic's Fork.

245
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,672
You ever heard of it, Barnes?

246
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:52,791
It's straps onto your chin, just so.

247
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:57,136
And the inquisition found it
a very effective tool

248
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:59,609
in getting people to tell them
what they wanted to know.

249
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,381
What do you want to know?

250
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,755
My name's Kyle Hobbes.

251
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:05,761
You ever heard of me?

252
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,604
Well, they have...

253
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,140
Your alien mates up there.

254
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,234
They set me up.

255
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,089
Why?

256
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:15,478
How could I know that?!

257
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,965
I think you know
lots of things, mate,

258
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:21,400
and I plan to learn all of them.

259
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:35,455
Until we know for a fact
he's not who he says he is,

260
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,833
we treat him with decency.

261
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:41,379
Human decency's a privilege, father.
He's lost his.

262
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,799
And when we prove to you he's lying,

263
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:47,260
you're gonna lose yours, too.

264
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:52,495
It's a call from the mother ship.
It's Joshua.

265
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,170
Tyler's shuttle has just arrived.

266
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,989
I thought you'd like to share
the good news with him.

267
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,683
So what's the news?

268
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:19,626
Your application for the program
has been accepted.

269
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,460
Congratulations.

270
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:24,128
That's amazing.

271
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:26,174
Thank you.

272
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,978
What is it?

273
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:31,680
My mom.

274
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,932
She's not exactly going to...

275
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,241
embrace the idea.

276
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,672
Of course.
She's worried about you.

277
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,859
Maybe Lisa can help ease
her fears...

278
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,606
Explain the "Live Aboard" to her,

279
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:49,854
tell her how wonderful it is
to live on the ship.

280
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:52,783
I'll stop by later.

281
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,715
Joshua contacted us from the ship.

282
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,171
He said the V's sent
soldier after Ryan and Val.

283
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,090
- What kind?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

284
00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:09,509
But it sounds bad.
They want the baby, Erica.

285
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,932
<i>We need to warn Ryan.</i>

286
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:14,524
He took Val to old friends, help him.
There's no way to contact him.

287
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:18,199
- We need to find him before.
- The prints came back on the sniper.

288
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,270
Hobbes was right.
He's ex-military,

289
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,786
trained killer.

290
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,525
I'm gonna go talk to his wife.

291
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:27,180
What good is that gonna do?

292
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,922
I think he took the hard drive
if I can find it,

293
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,782
maybe there's a 5th Column contact
that will help us find Ryan.

294
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,952
And if there isn't?

295
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,372
There's not another option, Jack.

296
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:56,097
Good to see you.

297
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:58,469
Been a long time.

298
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,455
Hate to drag you both in like this.

299
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,024
We need your help.

300
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,691
This is my girlfriend.

301
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:12,989
Don't worry, Val.
We'll get you somewhere safe.

302
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:15,746
We have a cabin in the Adirondacks.

303
00:17:15,871 --> 00:17:17,619
It's fully stocked, all you need.

304
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:19,739
Food, water...

305
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:20,997
weapons.

306
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:24,876
Your old life will be gone,
you and the baby will be safe now.

307
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:28,204
Now let's go.

308
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:38,319
Where do we stand
with finding the hybrid?

309
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:40,119
Something is interfering
with the signal

310
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:41,886
from the human mother's body.

311
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,156
We've had trouble finding it.

312
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,870
But the soldier
has finally found them.

313
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:52,445
Good.

314
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,453
Welcome back, Chad.

315
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:04,828
Your surgery was a success.

316
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:08,304
The aneurysm has been repaired.

317
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:13,485
- How long have you been here?
- I didn't want you to wake up alone.

318
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:16,297
Is there no family,
nobody you're close to?

319
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,074
My mom is passed.

320
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:22,987
My dad and I are like oil and water.

321
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:25,747
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:27,874
No one should be alone.


323
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:31,277
I'll check in on you later.

324
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:39,502
Thank you...

325
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:42,138
Not just the healing...

326
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,168
for everything.

327
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,451
You're welcome.

328
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,500
I wish others
perceived our intentions as you do.

329
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,066
Did something happen
during my surgery?

330
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,391
There are humans
who wish to harm us.

331
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:03,617
If we can't stop them,
I'm afraid for my people.

332
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:05,517
Or I can help you, Anna.

333
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,912
I could run a story on them,

334
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:09,791
make people aware.

335
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:13,193
This group has proven difficult
to locate, Chad.

336
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:16,381
It's part of the reason
they're so effective.

337
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:18,860
Just point me
in the right direction.

338
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:23,072
They're called the 5th Column.

339
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,502
- Can I help you?
- Agent Evans, FBI.

340
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:42,444
I'm looking for your husband.

341
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:44,551
He's not home.

342
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,018
Why?
Is everything okay?

343
00:20:49,523 --> 00:20:52,125
We're investigating the murders
of four men yesterday.

344
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,586
Your husband's name came up
in the investigation.

345
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,686
- What?
- We believe that the murders

346
00:20:57,811 --> 00:21:00,049
may have been related
to anti-Visitor activity.

347
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,564
Have you or your husband
been threatened by the Visitors?

348
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,724
Not at all.
In fact, it's quite the opposite.

349
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:11,598
Our daughter was paralyzed
in an accident

350
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:12,937
from the neck down.

351
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:14,119
Mommy?

352
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:17,241
What is it, Summer?
Mommy's busy.

353
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,526
Can I have a cookie?

354
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:20,779
Just one.

355
00:21:23,737 --> 00:21:25,217
Don't spoil your appetite.

356
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:30,585
That was your daughter?

357
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:33,911
Can you believe it?
I mean, it's a miracle.

358
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,961
One month ago,
that child was suffering.

359
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:39,235
We were destroyed.

360
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:41,383
And then they came,

361
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,747
and the Visitors healed her.

362
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,137
You have no idea
how much we owe them.

363
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:49,743
I think I do.

364
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:53,089
That's it.
I don't have any more questions.

365
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:55,355
Would you mind
if I used your bathroom?

366
00:21:56,154 --> 00:21:58,521
- Sure. It's right through there.
- Thanks.

367
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:07,672
- Mommy, can you help me?
- What is it, honey?

368
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:01,144
Bloody thing's been wiped.

369
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,149
I pulled a few names,
a couple of partial addresses off it.

370
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:06,134
That's it?
That's all that's on it?

371
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,723
Ryan said something about taking Val
to the Thompsons.

372
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,404
Our friend is being hunted
by the V's.

373
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:17,462
I want the names and the addresses
on that hard drive now.

374
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,075
I will not cooperate
with terrorists.

375
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,444
Are you out of your mind?
We're not the terrorists.

376
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:26,256
You're Fifth Column.

377
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:28,323
You want to hurt the V,
I won't let you.

378
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:31,492
We are not the dangerous ones here,
they are.

379
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:34,412
I went to your home.

380
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,572
I met your daughter.
I know what you went through.

381
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:39,459
My heart goes out to you.

382
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:42,235
Is that why you did it?

383
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,391
In exchange for saving her life,

384
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:46,790
did the Visitors ask you
to kill for them?

385
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,299
They didn't have to ask.

386
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,439
Do you have any idea what it's like

387
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:57,185
to see your daughter crippled.

388
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:00,160
Because some jackass on a cell phone

389
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:03,311
was too busy dialing a number
to see her crossing the street?

390
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:05,114
Do you have any idea?

391
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:10,281
Do you know what it's like
to hear your own child cry?

392
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:12,968
I mean really cry.

393
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:16,461
Every human being that I know

394
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:18,804
turned their back on me,

395
00:24:20,478 --> 00:24:21,568
but not them.

396
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:25,421
They saved my family,
and they gave...

397
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,731
my little girl's life back to me.

398
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:33,191
I can't begin to understand

399
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,833
what you went through and I am...

400
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:37,708
I'm sorry for that.

401
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:41,742
You have innocent blood
on your hands

402
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:43,398
because you are wrong.

403
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,124
I'm not wrong.

404
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:48,069
You name one bad thing
that they've done.

405
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:49,528
Do it.

406
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:51,996
Do it.
You can't, can you?

407
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:53,394
You can't!

408
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:55,576
You still don't trust them.

409
00:24:58,092 --> 00:24:59,508
And people like you...

410
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:03,394
you're gonna scare them away.
You're gonna force them to leave.

411
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:06,610
That's why you did it.

412
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:09,715
That's why you did it.

413
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:13,883
The V don't believe in fighting,

414
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:17,330
so people like me
have to do it for them.

415
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:25,268
Tell me where the Thompsons live.

416
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,927
Either tell me...

417
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:33,554
now...

418
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,621
or you're gonna tell him.

419
00:25:56,236 --> 00:25:59,236
Time for all decent people
to leave the room now.

420
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:32,931
The Thompsons live on a
farm just outside Nyack.

421
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,077
We need to get on the road.
It's a long drive.

422
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:03,882
Here.

423
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:11,942
Take this, Val.
You stay here till I get back.

424
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:08,431
Come with me and do
everything I say.

425
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:06,046
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good. Where's Val?

426
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,806
- She's fine. She's in the truck.
- What the hell was that thing?

427
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:10,711
It's a V soldier.

428
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,520
- Where's Hobbes?
- I don't know. Go.

429
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,642
Come on.

430
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,206
Hobbes, come on!

431
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:02,657
So that soldier
was different than you.

432
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:04,060
I'm not a soldier.

433
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:07,656
Visitor soldiers are bred for fighting.
I was bred for work.

434
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:12,657
When I was up there, Joshua said Anna
laid thousands of soldier eggs.

435
00:31:13,424 --> 00:31:14,826
Once she unleashes them...

436
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:16,916
How much time do we have?


437
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,332
Not long enough.

438
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:22,131
Listen, we're in a dogfight,
but we can win this.

439
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,117
Yeah.

440
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,159
Take care, Ryan.

441
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,738
What are we gonna do with Barnes?

442
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:51,408
I know some people.
They'll take him off our hands.

443
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:55,204
And do what with him?

444
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,414
Disappear him
into a secret prison overseas.

445
00:31:58,189 --> 00:31:59,545
He won't be a bother.

446
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,836
Unless somebody's
got a better idea...

447
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:20,854
- Let's go.
- No.

448
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:25,360
- Val, you have to go.
- I know, and I will.

449
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:29,613
- But you're not coming with us.
- What?

450
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:33,724
No. I'm not just gonna leave
you and leave you to go alone.

451
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:35,286
Who's gonna protect you?

452
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,728
The R-6 is blocked. The Visitors
can't find us. We'll be safe.

453
00:32:40,044 --> 00:32:41,375
Please don't do this.

454
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:43,026
Please.

455
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:47,481
I don't want to see you again, Ryan,

456
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,801
because I don't forgive you.

457
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,194
I know you thought you were
protecting me and the baby.

458
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:58,951
But you were really
protecting yourself.

459
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:04,578
It always was for you.

460
00:33:06,268 --> 00:33:07,736
Everything I ever did...

461
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:10,304
- was for you.
- Board.

462
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:14,575
Good-bye.

463
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:06,835
Hello, Father.

464
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:10,846
I saw on television
you'd been healed.

465
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:12,278
How are you feeling?

466
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,497
No different, really.

467
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:18,122
Sometimes I wonder
if I was ever gonna

468
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,848
develop that aneurysm.

469
00:34:20,741 --> 00:34:22,606
You think the Visitors lied to you?

470
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:25,757
I think Anna's keeping
secrets from us,

471
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:28,446
and I need your help.

472
00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:31,538
I can offer you spiritual guidance.

473
00:34:31,663 --> 00:34:33,771
- Outside of that...
- That's not enough.

474
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:39,424
Anna's worried about a group
of resistance fighters

475
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:41,300
called the Fifth Column.

476
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:43,072
You heard of them?

477
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,274
Maybe one of your parishioners has.

478
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,925
I'm worried about the Visitors,
Father.

479
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:55,342
I need to know I'm not alone.

480
00:34:58,423 --> 00:35:00,347
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

481
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:03,517
I'd appreciate it.

482
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,293
What's the status with our soldier?

483
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,437
Why hasn't he returned
with the hybrid?

484
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:25,308
We've completely
lost the R-6 signal.

485
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:26,954
We can't locate them.

486
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,873
Keep looking.

487
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:31,278
Don't stop until they've been found.

488
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:34,304
Mr. Decker is here to see you.

489
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,046
Send him in.

490
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:46,560
Hello, Chad.

491
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:47,940
Hello.

492
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:50,218
How's the piece on your
healing coming along?

493
00:35:50,343 --> 00:35:52,232
Great.
We're just finishing it up now.

494
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:54,201
Whatever you need.

495
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:57,970
I've started looking into
the group you told me about,

496
00:35:58,297 --> 00:35:59,624
the Fifth Column.

497
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:01,884
I might have something for you.

498
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,710
I'll let you know as
soon as I find out more.

499
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:06,747
I look forward to it.

500
00:36:43,506 --> 00:36:46,829
Hi, Mrs. Evans.
Is Tyler home?

501
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:50,499
His bike wasn't out front.
I figured he was with you.

502
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:54,336
Can I come in and wait for him?

503
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:56,297
- Please.
- Sorry.

504
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:03,162
Thanks.

505
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:04,221
Sure.

506
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:08,171
You and Tyler have been
spending a lot of time together.

507
00:37:11,914 --> 00:37:14,330
Tyler's like no one I've ever met.

508
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:17,149
The way he sees things...

509
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:20,852
he really wants to make
the most of his life.

510
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:24,668
Well, it wasn't always that way.

511
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:30,129
I think the V's showed
him something new.

512
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,110
Being peace ambassadors...
it's given us both direction.

513
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,491
Like the "Live Aboard" program...

514
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:40,056
Tyler's really interested in it.

515
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,691
He wants to live aboard the ship?

516
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:50,632
I didn't know he was considering it.

517
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:56,350
What's wrong?

518
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,904
I'm sorry. I'm hearing this
for the first time,

519
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:01,265
and it's from my son's
girlfriend, and I'm...

520
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:11,282
I feel like he's slipping away from me,
and he doesn't know it, and...

521
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:13,823
I want him to be happy.

522
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:18,408
I'm sorry, Mrs. Evans.

523
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:21,090
It's not your fault.

524
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,277
It is.

525
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:29,700
Sorry I'm late.

526
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:39,584
Brought you flowers.

527
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,416
Thanks.

528
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,221
Tyler, can I talk
to you for a minute?

529
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:48,353
Yeah. What's up?

530
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,506
I've been thinking.

531
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,166
I don't know if it's the best idea
for you to join the program.

532
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:05,592
What?

533
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:07,004
Why?

534
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,094
I've been talking to your mom.

535
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:15,060
She really needs you, Ty.

536
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:17,442
That's nice, but...

537
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,565
I don't want to stay here.

538
00:39:20,504 --> 00:39:22,067
I want to be with you.

539
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:25,779
I thought you wanted that, too.

540
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:28,490
I should go.

541
00:39:36,846 --> 00:39:38,390
What did you say to her?

542
00:39:40,026 --> 00:39:40,877
Nothing.

543
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,056
I'm moving up on that ship, mom.

544
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:53,390
There's nothing
you can do about it, okay?

545
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:12,673
I thought I made it very clear
how important it is

546
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:14,525
to have Tyler living on the ship.

547
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:17,879
It's not the best move for us
to make at this point.

548
00:40:19,164 --> 00:40:20,912
His mother isn't ready
to let him go.

549
00:40:22,105 --> 00:40:26,048
I feel I can be more effective with him
if I have her cooperation.

550
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:34,171
I trust your judgment.

551
00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:39,653
Thank you, mother.

552
00:40:55,076 --> 00:40:56,244
That's far enough.

553
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:02,051
Is this it?

554
00:41:04,096 --> 00:41:07,005
First you're gonna tell me
everything you know about the V's,

555
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:09,508
and then...

556
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:13,178
you're gonna beg me to kill you.

557
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:17,784
