1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:03,882
They're calling themselves
"visitors."

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:07,170
The visitors didn't just get here.
They've been here for years.

3
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:11,640
My partner dale was one of them.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,391
Anyone could be a visitor.

5
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:14,829
At least we have this.

6
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:17,706
Everyone who's ever contacted
the FBI about aliens or visitors.

7
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:19,453
We can find other people to fight.

8
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:22,067
Whatever they're gonna do to the humans,
it's nothing compared to

9
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:23,902
what they'll do to traitors
like us .

10
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:26,029
That's weird. Picture's upside down.

11
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:27,238
Who's cyrus?

12
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:28,782
A guy i used to know.

13
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:30,741
Your girlfriend always
do the talkin'?

14
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:34,412
The counsel wants to kick you out of
the ambassador program.

15
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:38,142
- I can and do influence public opinion.
- You really believe that.

16
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:41,086
Dale is a traitor. I don't think
he'll show his face again.

17
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,614
It's a bright new day In america,

18
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:54,516
a day of high emotions as we open

19
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:57,873
our doors to a nation
not just from beyond our borders,

20
00:00:58,138 --> 00:00:59,813
but from beyond our imaginations.

21
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:01,856
After weeks of heated debate
and speculation

22
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:03,577
about the government's decision,

23
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,820
today the US granted the V's
diplomatic relations.

24
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,607
Though the day
is not without controversy.

25
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,783
Demonstrators have gathered outside
the peace ambassador center,

26
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:16,871
protesting the decision to grant visas
the the visitors.

27
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:24,254
But nothing can take away
from the excitement here as anna

28
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:26,339
becomes the first
visitor to step through

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,164
the New York gate beside me,

30
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:30,298
leading the way for many more
to follow her

31
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:32,260
onto american soil
in the days to come.

32
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:36,792
This is Chad Decker reporting live from
the New York peace ambassador center.

33
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:39,935
That's good.

34
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:47,781
You know that you helped
make this day happen.

35
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:52,574
I guess I did.

36
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:11,920
Bless me, father, for i have sinned.

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,263
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

38
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:17,724
I've been doubting God.

39
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:21,317
Are the V's demons or angels?

40
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:24,132
Is everything i believed a lie?

41
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:26,691
If only God gave us a sign?

42
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:29,192
My little baby sister has cancer.

43
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:31,425
The V's cured her.

44
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:33,329
Who am i to question the pope?

45
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,533
I never believed in miracles before.

46
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:37,200
But now i do.

47
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,881
- What are we supposed to do?
- I'm just so scared.

48
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:42,287
- Does God even really exist?
- Must i feel so weak?

49
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:43,875
Forgive these impure thoughts.

50
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:45,993
I feel...

51
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,179
lost.

52
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:57,514
<i>The government plans to expand
its welcome to the V's</i>

53
00:02:57,674 --> 00:02:59,489
<i>in the weeks to come.</i>

54
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,476
<i>This is just the first wave</i>

55
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:03,853
<i>of diplomat issued to them.
Once on the ground,</i>

56
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,546
<i>they will be afforded
all america has to offer</i>

57
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:10,128
<i>In return for what everyone hopes
will be a prosperous exchange...</i>

58
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:13,039
There is no way that we had time to do
a proper threat assessment.

59
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,065
It's like 9/11 never happened.

60
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:18,760
Must be hard
thinking everyone's a terrorist.

61
00:03:19,596 --> 00:03:21,737
I don't want you
going into the city today.

62
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:23,079
I'll be fine.

63
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,318
It's gonna be crazy
with all the V stuff.

64
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,186
But i was just gonna
give brandon a lift.

65
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:31,673
Come home right after.

66
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,930
Mom, there's a priest at the door.

67
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:43,435
- I'm Jack.
- We work together.

68
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,136
- That's cute.
- Go.

69
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,820
What are you doing here, jack?
You okay?

70
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,253
I want to be useful, to be able

71
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:59,451
to look people in the eye and say,
"God loves you and it's gonna be fine."

72
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,370
 I don't even know
what to tell myself anymore.

73
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:05,293
- I know how you feel.
- Why are the v's doing it like this?

74
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,738
Why the infiltration?
Why the sleeper cells?

75
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:10,505
Why don't they just annihilate
us and get it over with?

76
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,667
Because they're smart and patient.

77
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,113
And whatever their plan is,

78
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:20,171
they need us for something.
And until we figure out what that is,

79
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,266
we have to fight them the same way
they're fighting us. One step at a time.

80
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,352
I haven't been able to sleep,

81
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:28,688
so i was up most of the night
going through this list,

82
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:31,691
trying to find anyone
who was at the warehouse with us.

83
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:35,570
Whenever i find anything{\ that might be
V-related, }
I plug it into the FBI database.

84
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,156
- Any luck?
- I've narrowed it down.

85
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,458
Good.

86
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:47,248
No, i'll be right there.

87
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:53,336
I have to go to
the peace ambassador center.

88
00:04:53,663 --> 00:04:55,757
There's been a death threat
against the V's.

89
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:58,264
You're going to protect the V's?

90
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:03,598
If a human kills a visitor,
that makes us the bad guys.

91
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,638
And they'll be the good guys.
That's all we need.

92
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:09,813
If i have to be on their side,
maybe there's something i can find.

93
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:12,471
You know what?

94
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:15,527
If you don't mind, I can stay here.
I can keep going through the list.

95
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:19,019
- Maybe I'll find a match. Yeah.
- Okay. That would be great.

96
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,747
You can cross-reference
with the files.

97
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,481
- I'll call you later.
- Be careful.

98
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,159
You be careful today.

99
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,083
You all right? You look worried.

100
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:32,794
- I can't walk you to work?
- When have you ever walked me to work?

101
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,678
It's just
that everything's crazy now.

102
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:37,764
Visitors walking around the city,

103
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,544
Angry protesters are pissed off.

104
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:44,854
Whatever the reason, it's nice.

105
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,433
Don't worry.

106
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:49,477
People fear change. It's normal.

107
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:53,940
The V's are friendly. And the protesters
are gonna realize that eventually.

108
00:05:58,888 --> 00:05:59,888
What?

109
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:01,656
This look,

110
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,159
like you're keeping a secret.

111
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:07,120
Sweetheart, i would never wanna
keep any secrets from you.

112
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:17,964
- I love you.
- I love you.

113
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:38,275
Georgie, thanks for meeting me.

114
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:41,613
You saved my life at the warehouse.
It's the least i can do.

115
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:44,783
How many others survived
at that warehouse besides us?

116
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:48,495
I don't know. I haven't tried to
contact them since the ambush.

117
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:53,625
I'm scared.
We don't know who to trust anymore.

118
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:57,059
With the v's being granted those visas,
it's oy gonna get worse.

119
00:06:57,648 --> 00:06:59,839
We need to mount a resistance

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,551
- Before they infiltrate any further.
- How?

121
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:06,471
We don't have access to cash,
bodies.

122
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:08,804
I've got access to both.

123
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,197
- You ever heard of john may?
- Guy's a myth.

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,343
He's not a myth. He's real.

125
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:17,413
John May is the leader
of the Fifth Column.

126
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:20,902
First group of Visitors to ever turn
against the leadership. He started it.

127
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:23,780
The visitors have
sleeper cells everywhere.

128
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,990
And so do we.

129
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:27,587
The Fifth Column is down,
but it's not out.

130
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:30,245
We can win this.

131
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,872
And if john may gets into this...

132
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:34,964
He'll bring an army.

133
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:41,101
He's regained consciousness?

134
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:43,673
Yes, but there was a lot of damage.

135
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:46,442
We're still unsure if
he's going to remember anything.

136
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:48,044
He has to.

137
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:51,314
He was a highly placed sleeper
for almost 20 years.

138
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:55,568
We have to know if he was compromised,
and if so, by whom.

139
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,522
I understand.

140
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:15,123
You're awake.

141
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:17,671
I'm joshua.

142
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:19,419
You gave us quite a scare.

143
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:24,347
- What?
- you're on the new york mother ship.

144
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,616
We don't usually get
guys like you up here.

145
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:29,613
It's kind of a big deal,
actually. You're a real hero.

146
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:38,647
- What'd i do?
- You were stabbed.

147
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,192
Whoever did it
was going for your heart.

148
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:46,369
If you were human,
they would've killed you.

149
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:47,989
Joke's on them, right?

150
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:50,538
You were left for dead.

151
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,968
Posttraumatic amnesia.

152
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:55,580
It might take a while
before it all comes back.

153
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:59,267
I need you to help
me remember who did this to me.

157
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,170

outside our building.

169
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,933
I heard. It's planned
for later today.

170
00:09:57,326 --> 00:10:01,206
She's becoming the face
of the protest movement.

171
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,708
Give me as much information
on Mary Falkner as you can.

172
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:09,446
I wanna know everything about her.
Her dead husband, her child,

173
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:10,851
her family.

174
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,181
We have to stop this now.

175
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:19,201
V's, go home!

176
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:25,061
I feel like this is
all my fault, man.

177
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,340
If you hadn't punched that dude, you'd
be going in there right now.

178
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,255
I know I screwed up this whole
peace ambassador thing,

179
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:34,095
- I'll find a way to fix it.
- Maybe Lisa could talk to somebody.

180
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,856
I don't want to get her
in any more trouble.

181
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,768
We've had multiple calls
from this guy.

182
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:12,453
Profiled as mid to late 20s,
white male, mentally unstable.

183
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:14,830
- Ex-military?
- He knows his weapons.

184
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,388
Based on those last calls,

185
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,974
he's not just blowin' off steam.
This guy's got a plan.

186
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:30,986
This is a volatile situation.
Last thing we need is a panicked mob

187
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:33,863
or anything that might provoke
that shooter to open fire,

188
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:36,697
which is we'll be
coordinating with V security.

189
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:40,074
We'll have to keep a low profile
and work together.

190
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:42,985
Each FBI agent
will be partnered with a V.

191
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:46,831
- I don't need a partner.
- It's not up to you, Evans.

192
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:49,847
Agent Evans,
I have been assigned to you.

193
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:55,175
- I hope that won't be a problem.
- No, it's fine.

194
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,751
I understand your reluctance.

195
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:00,720
Your species is
naturally mistrusting.

196
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:06,016
First thing i'm going to need
is access to your surveillance center.

197
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:08,191
- That's in our restricted zone.
- I know.

198
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,495
This is your surveillance
for the whole center?

199
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:20,952
Your government gave us this building .
We didn't have time to change anything.

200
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:26,329
We need to adjust these two cameras
in the north courtyard.

201
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,261
There's a blind spot between them.
Our shooter is not gonna stand out.

202
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:32,849
He'll try to appear casual, look for
baseball hats, hands in pockets...

203
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:35,352
Anyone whose agenda
does not fit their surroundings.

204
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:36,923
There is one thing.

205
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,985
If there are injuries,
we'd like assurances

206
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,124
that our people will be treated
by our own medical staff.

207
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:46,062
- No offense intended.
- No, I completely understand.

208
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,289
You ready to go?

209
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,339
Let's go.

210
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,292
<i>It's Erica. Leave a message.</i>

211
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:31,941
It's me. I think
we just got our first break.

212
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,480
You know the guy
who led the warehouse meeting?

213
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,441
I think I found him.

214
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,786
So what do you want from me?

215
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:41,904
We gotta find others who will help.

216
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,157
- Who's Cyrus?
- An old friend.

217
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,574
A Fifth Column member.
We fought together before I met you.

218
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:51,455
- I'm on my way to see him now.
- You think he's gonna help?

219
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,750
He was my right hand.
The way he used to fight those V's...

220
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,383
- We'd say he had a death wish.
- Still, that's one guy.

221
00:13:58,508 --> 00:14:00,454
We're gonna need
a lot more than that.

222
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:03,697
Nobody had better contacts
in the Column than he did.

223
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:05,432
Why don't you come with me?

224
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:07,551
No.

225
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:10,729
No, it's gonna be a while
before i recruit again.

226
00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:15,108
I gotta do this.

227
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:19,211
Someone's gotta
put the Column back together.

228
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:20,991
Strength in numbers.

229
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,333
We're closed for remodeling!

230
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,290
Can't you read the sign?

231
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:42,093
You always were
a rude bastard, Cyrus.

232
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:46,260
Ryan.

233
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:49,597
What are you doing here, man?

234
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:54,163
I'll give you 29 guesses.

235
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,005
Let the record show
that the captains of all 29 ships

236
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,098
are present for the briefing.

237
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:06,533
Today is a historic day.

238
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,683
Though we continue to gain
ground in diplomatic areas,

239
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:15,251
we must not underestimate the importance
of popular opinion

240
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:16,877
among humanity.

241
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,418
Opinions can easily change.

242
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:23,345
Monitor them, and if necessary,

243
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,319
shape those opinions
within your territories.

244
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:28,160
By doing so,

245
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:31,931
we can stop any resistance
before it starts.

246
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:33,625
Go forward.

247
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,101
What do you know
about what happened?

248
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:43,109
You were taking out
a human resistance group.

249
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:45,666
You sent out a distress signal.

250
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:47,765
Recovery team
picked you up at a warehouse.

251
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,828
You were the only V that survived.

252
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:51,852
How bad was this?

253
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,789
When they brought you in,
you were wide-open.

254
00:15:57,721 --> 00:16:00,659
So whoever did this
saw my true face.

255
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,076


256
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:15,141
I've uploaded a complete dossier
on Mary Falkner to your console.

257
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,892
Thank you.

258
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,885
You're wondering why
i'm so focused on a single woman

259
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,818
when we have
so many global concerns.

260
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:28,491
That had crossed my mind, yes.

261
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:31,953
Mary Falkner's life is in ruins,
and she blames us.

262
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,103
That kind of hatred is contagious.

263
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:38,936
We have to make an example of her
so that she doesn't infect others.

264
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:04,632
Hello?

265
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,139
George? Mr. Sutton?

266
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,840
What are you doing in here?

267
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,665
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:34,095
I didn't think anyone was...

269
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:37,098
i'm looking for George Sutton.

270
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:40,434
He doesn't live here anymore.
No one does.

271
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:42,812
Do you know how to contact him?

272
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:46,274
Is this because of the murders?

273
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:48,739
Are you counseling him or something?

274
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:50,549
Sorry, the what?

275
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:53,072
His family... they were all killed.

276
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,443
<i>They've been implementing a plan
that will result in the extermination</i>

277
00:17:57,568 --> 00:18:00,997
<i>of every man, woman and child
on the face of this earth.</i>

278
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,161
He went a little crazy after that.

279
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:05,826
He said aliens did it.

280
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,027
It's really important
that i speak with him.

281
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:13,175
If you have any way of contacting him,
would you, please?

282
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:17,758
- Priests got cards now?
- Yeah.

283
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,891
You can tell him
i was at the warehouse.

284
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:24,214
He'll know what that means.

285
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:28,819
It's not like it was.

286
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:31,854
Most everybody's
scattered to the wind.

287
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:34,534
But you're still in touch
with some of the best ?

288
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:37,618
We had a hell of a crew.

289
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,499
You did the hard part,

290
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:45,514
I'm kinda hoping
you'd be the first to enlist.

291
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,717
We gotta get
the Column back together.

292
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:52,037
I got some names and numbers
in the back.

293
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,216
Best I can do right now.

294
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:02,043
Grab my glasses off that table,
would you?

295
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:19,037
What the hell you doin' ?

296
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:22,037
You don't know what it's been like.

297
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:32,171
I gotta turn you over to them now.
They're on their way.

298
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:33,965
What'd they promise you?

299
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:38,807
To reconnect me...

300
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,032
- If I turned in enough Fifth Column.
- How many did you turn in?

301
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:47,937
Does it matter?
All i need is one more.

302
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:50,432
They're not gonna
reconnect you, Cyrus!

303
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:53,280
They're gonna get as many Fifth Column
out of you as they can,

304
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,907
- and then skin you alive.
- No, they're gonna help me.

305
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,974
They have to help me.

306
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,110
Don't you miss it?

307
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,431
Everything Anna gave to us...
Don't you miss the bliss?

308
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:05,625
The bliss?

309
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,296
The bliss is how
she controlled us, Cyrus.

310
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:11,020
Just like junkies, man.

311
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,316
And that's what you are.

312
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,969
You're nothing but a junkie,

313
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:17,971
- just like the rest of 'em.
- They promised me.

314
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:21,163
I'll be reconnected.

315
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:23,389
They promised me!

316
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:32,592
You gotta be alive
to be reconnected.

317
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:38,544


318
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:45,155
This is the best vantage point
on the property?

319
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:46,781
You tell me.

320
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,955
There's a guard missing,
corner of the building.

321
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:17,280
He stole a V jacket.

322
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:21,131
- The shooter is wearing a V jacket.
- Get medical assistance now!

323
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:24,218
Our shooter is wearing a V uniform.

324
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:26,247
Our shooter is wearing a V uniform.

325
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:00,991
That's him.

326
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:03,759
- I just spotted our shooter.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

327
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:06,663
- He's headed into the building.
- What's your 20 on him?

328
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:08,581
Suspect's white male brown hair.

329
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:12,127
Cover the room.

330
00:22:33,878 --> 00:22:35,692
Gun! Everybody down!

331
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,280
Stay down!

332
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:46,870
The V's are a plague?
Don't you get it?

333
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:50,178
I get it.

334
00:22:56,731 --> 00:22:57,839
Get up.

335
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,801
We have a holding room this way.

336
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:11,517
<i>From the little we know
about the incident,</i>

337
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:14,267
<i>there were no casualties
as a result of the attack.</i>

338
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:17,364
<i>We're trying to get word on whether
the shooting was directly connected</i>

339
00:23:17,484 --> 00:23:19,872
<i>to the visitors
receiving their visas today.</i>

340
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:22,805
<i>We'll update you with
more information as we get it.</i>

341
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:24,943
<i>Reporting live from
the peace ambassador center,</i>

342
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:26,890
<i>i'm Chad Decker for WNT news.</i>

343
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,096
Dude, did you set this up?

344
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:34,501
Catch you later.

345
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:45,072
Got your visa today?

346
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:48,944
So what do you think of New York?

347
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:51,291
Still getting the hang of this
whole earth thing.

348
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:53,520
Yeah, me, too.

349
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:56,982
I spoke to the counsel today.

350
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,514
You're back
in the ambassador program.

351
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:01,531
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

352
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:03,203
That's...

353
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:06,366
And you came all the way here
to tell me?

354
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:10,703
Actually, somebody told me
that the pizza here is amazing.

355
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:21,785
Thank you, agent Evans.

356
00:24:23,303 --> 00:24:25,885
I may have misjudged you.
We'll take him now.

357
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,805
- Excuse me?
- It's complicated.

358
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,177
They'll take it from here.

359
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,606
I'll meet you
in front of the building.

360
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:41,776
Sure. I'll be outside.

361
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:49,844
<i>You should consider joining. We have
peace ambassadors all over the world.</i>

362
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:21,645


363
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:31,564
To lose someone so close...

364
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:35,992
It's devastating.

365
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:38,161
Our families are
our greatest treasure.

366
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:40,830
Our families are our greatest gift.

367
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:42,655
Your son...

368
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:45,173
Your son...

369
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:46,336
Is devastated.

370
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,922
I am so sorry for your loss.

371
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:50,882
I am so sorry for your loss.

372
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:53,885
I am so sorry for your loss.

373
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:57,222
Together, we will help
each other heal.

374
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:00,016
Only together
can we hope for the future.

375
00:28:00,274 --> 00:28:04,114
Only together
can we help each other heal.

376
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:06,941
Together.

377
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:11,064
It's time.

378
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,461
I'm so sorry
to surprise you like this.

379
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:45,020
I would be honored if you'd grant me
a few moments of your time.

380
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:48,231
Why should i listen to anything
that you have to say?

381
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,570
I'd like to offer my heartfelt
condolences for your loss.

382
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:03,622
This was the only way we could meet
without causing a scene.

383
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:06,521
Please.

384
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,011
Thank you.

385
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:20,463
There's someone
who'd like to meet you.

386
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,423
Agent Evans,

387
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:27,551
I just wanted
to thank you in person.

388
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:29,522
Your quick action saved my life.

389
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:31,942
I blame instinct and training.

390
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:38,740
Nonetheless,
it's deeply appreciated.

391
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:44,621
Anything else i can ever do,
please don't hesitate.

392
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:47,290
And vice versa.

393
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,192
Where are we?

394
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:00,951
I made this construct
based on your neural scans.

395
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:04,099
Sometimes familiar places
can bring up memories.

396
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,653
Do you recognize anything?

397
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:10,212
I worked here.

398
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,754
My desk was right over...

399
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,230
I can't believe you lived with
another species all those years.

400
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,659
That must've been amazing.

401
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,612
If by "amazing" you mean smelly,
crowded and disgusting?

402
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:28,957
And dangerous...

403
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:31,501
All that undercover work you did?

404
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,053
It wasn't like i was
the only V at the bureau.

405
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,926
- I just remembered that.
- Good.

406
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,137
That's a good sign.

407
00:30:42,453 --> 00:30:46,224
If you can remember that what happened
on that night will come back to you.

408
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:52,441
You have no idea how disgusting it was
to wake up next to a human

409
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:53,655
every morning.

410
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:57,235
My wife Erica used to brush
her hair in the kitchen. Who does that?

411
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:00,340
I believe your wife's name
was Joselyn.

412
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:03,573
Erica was your partner
here at the FBI.

413
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:15,280
Erica cracked my head open.

414
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:19,008
She saw my true face. She knows.

415
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:20,759
We gotta go.

416
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:24,064
- Where are we going?
- You gotta send me back down.

417
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,391
I'm going to kill her.

418
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:42,447
Heard you were looking for me.

419
00:31:49,297 --> 00:31:51,455
You were at the warehouse.

420
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,482
Turn around.

421
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:58,380
I brought the photos.

422
00:31:58,665 --> 00:32:01,390
- You were with the mouthy blonde.
- Her name's Erica, and...

423
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:03,635
She's an FBI agent.

424
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:05,976
What the hell
were you two doing there?

425
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:09,808
And how do i know you didn't
bring the V's down on our heads?

426
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:12,909
Because i know who did.
It was Erica's partner Dale.

427
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:15,939
He was a V. She killed him.

428
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:18,525
What do you want from me?

429
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,430
We're trying to find anyone
who survived.

430
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,789
We need to stick together.

431
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,210
Every time we try to come together,

432
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,825
they crush us.

433
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:32,706
FYI, leaving your card with people
will get you killed.

434
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,376
I saw the pictures at your house.

435
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,069
Your family...

436
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:40,513
The V's were
responsible for their deaths.

437
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:43,520
- That's none of your business.
- I don't know you,

438
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,586
and i don't know what you've been
through, but if you're anything like me,

439
00:32:48,188 --> 00:32:50,566
This whole thing
has made you feel alone.

440
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:52,812
Lost.

441
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:58,218
There's strength in numbers.

442
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:01,693
We need to stick together, George.

443
00:33:06,882 --> 00:33:08,366
It's Georgie.

444
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:14,904
You're sure Erica was
the only one who saw you?

445
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:15,968
Sure.

446
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:18,508
And she was meeting with
other human resistance members.

447
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:20,447
She's not even gonna know
what hit her.

448
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,256
You're right, because i'm not
letting you go back down.

449
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:27,317
Come again?

450
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:31,056
If half the things that you say
about Erica are true,

451
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:33,808
she's going to make
an excellent ally.

452
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:36,102
Ally?

453
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:54,695
You son of a bitch.
You're a traitor.

454
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,212
The Fifth Column says hello.

455
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,943
This is Chad Decker reporting live

456
00:34:25,103 --> 00:34:27,031
from the New York
peace ambassador center

457
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:30,299
where M. Falkner,
the voice of the anti-V movement,

458
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:32,080
is approaching the podium.

459
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:45,714
I began this day as i have every day
since i lost my husband...

460
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,983
The same way that every family
member who lost a loved one

461
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:50,719
on the day the visitors arrived...

462
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:53,526
With an unbearable emptiness.

463
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,605
And, like most of you, with

464
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:00,353
an anger towards
those responsible for our loss.

465
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:04,608
But something changed for me...

466
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:07,259
Something I never expected.

467
00:35:08,824 --> 00:35:11,289
I had a quiet conversation
with someone

468
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:14,557
who not only
eased my suffering, but...

469
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,745
Who helped me understand that...

470
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,582
My husband did not die in vain,

471
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,376
someone that reminded me

472
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:26,477
that only hope and trust
can heal us,

473
00:35:27,097 --> 00:35:30,005
and that what we share
with those we feared

474
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,427
is far greater
that anything that divides us...

475
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:45,117
Today,

476
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:47,913
a man possessed by hate

477
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,012
tried to kill one of my people.

478
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:54,864
But this real target... was peace.

479
00:35:56,183 --> 00:35:59,849
The same peace
Lieutenant Falkner gave his life

480
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:01,482
to defend.

481
00:36:04,258 --> 00:36:07,254
We will not diminish
this brave soldier's sacrifice

482
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,909
by answering in kind.

483
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:13,877
We remain of peace.

484
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:16,400
Always.

485
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,225
Show me.

486
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:25,105
Cyrus activated a distress signal.

487
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:30,826
By the time we got here,
it was too late.

488
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:41,788
There will be no peace.

489
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:43,832


490
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,218
This is my room.

491
00:36:57,845 --> 00:36:59,306
It's nice.

492
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:03,727
You don't really care much
about my room, do ya?

493
00:37:37,337 --> 00:37:38,088
Crap.

494
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,554
I'm so sorry.

495
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:41,655
My mom doesn't like the V's.

496
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:44,559
Stay here.

497
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,645
I'll be... i'll be right back.
God, i hate her.

498
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,276
You are here.

499
00:37:53,766 --> 00:37:55,820
- What's up?
- You okay?

500
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:01,701
Do you have company?

501
00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:03,999
No.

502
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,163
No. Why?

503
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:23,139
You should... put your clothes on.

504
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:34,157
Take her home.

505
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,611
We'll talk later.

506
00:38:44,112 --> 00:38:48,290
I thought this would be better
than your mom seeing me in my uniform.

507
00:38:52,216 --> 00:38:53,894
<i>The anti-V protest movement</i>

520
00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:30,582
<i>and she's giving it to me.</i>

521
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:34,497
<i>My exclusive interview</i>
<i>with M. Falkner next.</i>

522
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:45,722
There were hundreds of images,
all of this surveillance footage

523
00:39:45,935 --> 00:39:48,308
being captured by the damn jackets.

524
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,603
We have to be careful.
What we do, who we talk to.

525
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:53,961
What were you thinking,

526
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:56,566
going to find this guy today?
You could've been killed.

527
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:02,285
- I just wanted to be useful.
- You were.

528
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,578
You are.

529
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:11,041
It's okay.

530
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:13,540
I'm glad you came.

531
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,835
Georgie, this is... This is Erica.

532
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:17,796
You wanna put that away?

533
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,468
I brought a friend.

534
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:27,931
We gotta build the ranks, right?

535
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,795
Tyler's the one. We should use him.

536
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,842
You're doing excellent job.

537
00:41:09,156 --> 00:41:10,635
I'm proud of you.

538
00:41:12,254 --> 00:41:13,784
Thank you mother.
