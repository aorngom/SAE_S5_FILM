1
00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:02,543
<i>Previously on</i> V...

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,444
Dad asked if I could stay with him.

3
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:06,631
It's time that we told him
about who he really is.

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,052
I think Tyler's ready.

5
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:10,599
But he's still not here
on the ship with you. Get him.

6
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:12,092
I missed you.

7
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:13,346
I'm pregnant.

8
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,659
You need to tell her the truth
before she finds out.

9
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:17,350
John May started the 5th Column.

10
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,769
The first group to ever turn
against the leadership.

11
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,979
- Anna's birthing soldiers.
- You need to stop 'em.

12
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,524
The visitors took everything I had.
I don't want that to happen to you.

13
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,778
Long live the 5th Column!

14
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,847
Dad, I heard something outside,

15
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:46,789
and I think I saw a UFO.

16
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,328
There's no such thing as UFOs, buddy.
Go back to bed.

17
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,585
That's okay. Go on.
I love you, James.

18
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:07,517
They're here for me.
Tell the others I'm going dark.

19
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:41,350
Did you really think Anna wouldn't
find out you turned against us?

20
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:05,340
How could you do this
to your own kind,

21
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:09,015
- start a resistance?
- These people are worth saving.

22
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,899
It's your human skin.

23
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:14,884
You've been wearing it too long.
You got confused.

24
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,737
- You're sick.
- Bliss is a sickness.

25
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:19,680
It's mind control.

26
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,228
Human emotion, it's not sickness.
It's beautiful.

27
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:23,392
Human emotion?

28
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:26,562
You betrayed us for human emotion?

29
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:29,398
You may as well kill me now.

30
00:02:30,364 --> 00:02:32,443
Cause I will never stop hunting you.

31
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:37,948
One day you'll understand.

32
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:43,380
You can't escape, John May!

33
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:46,415
You can't escape!

34
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,002
Can someone please lay out
for me who the hell that guy is?

35
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,588
John May was the first V
to turn against Anna.

36
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,048
He started the resistance.

37
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,260
I was with him
just before he disappeared.

38
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,837
- You knew him. Why didn't you say?
- No one needed to know until now.

39
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,933
The bottom line is we are not
leaving Georgie up there to die.

40
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,980
The only reason he's on that ship is
because he tried to save me.

41
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:09,982
- I gotta get back on the ship.
- But how? It'll be impossible now.

42
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,881
We'll do it.
We'll figure it out.

43
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:14,986
How much does he know...
about who you are, where you are?

44
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,854
Who your loved ones are?

45
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:19,356
I'm not saying he'll talk
cause he's a coward.

46
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,784
I'm saying,
everyone has a breaking point.

47
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,244
Everyone talks.

48
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,372
Not Georgie.
He'll hold on till we get him.

49
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,527
Which as you compadre here
just spelled out, is impossible.

50
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,671
We may not get back on that ship, but
there may be another way to save him.

51
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,566
How?

52
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,733
The one who helped me embed the message.
He's 5th Column.

53
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:42,004
Said there's a way to contact them,
some sort of comms device.

54
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:45,850
It's encrypted and the tech's outdated,
so the Vs don't monitor for it anymore.

55
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,201
- If we can get...
- We can coordinate a rescue plan

56
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:49,923
with the 5h Column aboard the ship.

57
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:52,663
First sensible thing anyone's said,
and it's the blonde.

58
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,861
- Where's the device?
- Upstate. Town called Reedsville.

59
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,989
Belonged to John May.
But there's someone else.

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,040
His stepson.

61
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,619
He might be able to lead us
to that device.

62
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:06,144
Great.

63
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,275
Let's go.

64
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,990
The human managed to fight off
the effects of the memory chamber.

65
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:46,369
We've been unable to retrieve
any information

66
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,966
about who helped him embed
the message in our broadcast.

67
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,206
He won't give names.

68
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:54,683
Impress upon him more strongly
that he has no choice in the matter.

69
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:58,127
I've already sent for the human
pain expert from the Tokyo ship.

70
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:01,509
Your pregnancy...

71
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:03,515
You should be resting.

72
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:05,712
There's no time for that.

73
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,432
I need to make sure the "Live Aboard"
program stays on track.

74
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:10,890
There are whispers
of an anti-V terrorist group.

75
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,397
Polls show people have grown apprehensive
about coming to live on the ship,

76
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,534
which will affect the success
of our "Live Aboard" program.

77
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:18,959
Get Chad Decker.

78
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:21,695
I'll address the people directly.

79
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:26,909
I want those bodies on this ship.

80
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:36,137
Hi.

81
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:37,945
Hello.

82
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:39,837
You are?

83
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:41,730
Lisa, Tyler's friend.

84
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,622
- It's nice to meet you, Mr. Evans.
- Hi.

85
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:49,266
Tyler's mom didn't mention
anything about you coming.

86
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,600
Did Tyler invite you?

87
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:53,685
Actually no. I just thought
I'd check in on him.

88
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:56,230
Why does he need you to check in?

89
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:59,025
He didn't. I thought
he could use the support.

90
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:05,679
It's just this situation's been
a little hard, right?

91
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:08,326
Since you left?

92
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:13,281
Have you had breakfast yet?

93
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:15,708
I'm sorry. Wait a minute.

94
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,878
What did he say, exactly?

95
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,131
He hasn't said anything bad
about you, Mr. Evans.

96
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:35,504
So you guys met.

97
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:38,731
Don't worry, dad.
I slept on the couch.

98
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:41,020
I swear.

99
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,417
Lisa showed up late last night,

100
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,029
And kind of surprised me.

101
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,324
Surprised me, too.

102
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:52,078
Could you...

103
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,330
come here, please?

104
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:00,670
Listen, I know you wanted
to spend some time with me.

105
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,464
But is it okay if she hangs with us?

106
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:06,603
Dad...

107
00:07:07,732 --> 00:07:09,132
I really like her.

108
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:12,704
Of course.

109
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:14,875
Thanks.

110
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,352
This is Chad Decker for WNT,

111
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:24,360
bringing you an exclusive interview

112
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,741
with the V high commander Anna.

113
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:29,904
- It's good to see you again.
- Thank you, Chad.

114
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,813
There have been rumors
about the messages sent from our ships

115
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:34,614
during my announcement last night.

116
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:37,101
Yes. "John May lives"...

117
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:40,818
- Can you tell us what that means?
- I wish I could, Chad.

118
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,504
It appears it was merely
a glitch in our system,

119
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,397
an overlay of old code
from our language training program

120
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:48,215
used to learn the English language.

121
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:50,512
What's of greater interest to me

122
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,388
are the things that are going right.

123
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:55,244
People are so excited about
the "Live Aboard" program.

124
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,725
It will give us a chance,
before we leave,

125
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,229
to reciprocate the hospitality
you have shown us.

126
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:03,708
Later today,
you will join me as I sit down

127
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,494
with some of the invitees
to answer their questions.

128
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,280
I can assure you,

129
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,884
those joining us will be treated
with the utmost care and respect.

130
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,136
This is the last time
we're going to ask.

131
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,664
What are the names
of your co-conspirators?

132
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,854
You want names?

133
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,974
Evelyn, my wife.
There's a name.

134
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,600
We were 2 months shy
of our 12th anniversary.

135
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:30,713
Here's two more...
Brian and Evan.

136
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:34,247
My 2 boys, 6 and 8.

137
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,523
You freaks killed them, too.

138
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,937
Our doctors will assure
that you will receive

139
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,396
the best medical attention
we can provide.

140
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,764
I'm Dr. Maita.

141
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,829
Let me explain to you
how the scours operate.

142
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:50,891
It's a curious little creature.

143
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,889
It likes to explore every inch
of the human body,

144
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:55,314
from the inside.

145
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:59,402
Its preference is to travel
along the nerve lines.

146
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:02,877
The scour enters near the face,

147
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:05,169
and exits via the soft tissue,

148
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,003
usually through
the reproductive organs.

149
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:11,717
And remember,
we are of peace, always.

150
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,426
After the John May message,

151
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:51,611
we anticipate resistance members
will come out of hiding.

152
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:54,719
As sleeper agents embedded
in key positions,

153
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,762
you need to be ready.

154
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:59,184
Each of you has one of these
in your possession.

155
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,642
If you notice
any suspicious activity,

156
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,149
an assistance will be deployed
to your location.

157
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,607
Dismissed.

158
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:17,641
Stop.

159
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:20,014
Please.

160
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:24,233
I'll give you the names you want.

161
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:31,457
Pull over here.
This is John May's place.

162
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:38,431
Does he know his stepfather was a V?

163
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,245
No, May wanted
to protect his family.

164
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:42,742
Told 'em nothing.

165
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:44,891
Just a second, guys.

166
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:50,441
You could have told me that
the girlfriend was part of the package.

167
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:52,388
What are you talking about?

168
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:54,445
- She's there? Lisa?
- <i>Yes.</i>

169
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,645
She showed up last night.
What is the deal with her?

170
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,826
- She seems to know our dirty laundry.
- <i>She's a peace ambassador with Tyler.</i>

171
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,621
Joe, I'm sorry.
I can't get into this right now.

172
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,498
I'm having
a real hard time with this.

173
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:08,000
<i>All these years,
he's been blaming himself,</i>

174
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,040
thinking that he's the reason
that we broke up,

175
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:11,965
because he went off
and crashed his bike.

176
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,165
<i>He needs to know the truth.</i>

177
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,168
Move it.
Godzilla's getting nervous.

178
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:19,549
Can we please not do this right now?
I have to go.

179
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,681
I will you call you
the minute I get a chance.

180
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:25,059
The lies catch up to people,
Erica, sooner or later.

181
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,417
Tyler needs to know

182
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,339
that I'm not his father.

183
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:47,858
You okay?

184
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:56,841
I've never told anyone this.
When Tyler was 14,

185
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:59,704
he wrecked his bike,
ruptured his spleen.

186
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,088
Joe and I went in
to donate blood, and...

187
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:06,844
There's supposed to be
certain matchups in blood work

188
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,394
between parents and their kids.

189
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:10,119
Ours didn't line up.

190
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:12,018
I'm not following.

191
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:16,145
They told us
that Joe wasn't Tyler's father.

192
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,661
The tests aren't
100% accurate, but...

193
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:22,583
Doctors don't know everything.

194
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,419
Joe never believed me.

195
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,649
If you don't have trust in relationship,
you don't have anything.

196
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:31,250
What does Tyler know?

197
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:34,041
Sometimes you have to lie
to people to protect them.

198
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:36,882
Am I talking to the FBI Agent
or the mother?

199
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:45,668
You're not supposed to be
kicking yet, are you?

200
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:54,736
Hey, honey.
Sorry to bother you at work, but...

201
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:57,980
I was wondering if you knew
where you put Dr. Pearlman's card.

202
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:00,071
I felt the baby kicking.

203
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,231
Give me a call if you get a sec.

204
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:03,637
Thank you.

205
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,799
James May?

206
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:38,150
I'm Ryan Nichols.
I was a friend of your stepfather.

207
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:40,486
Is it okay if we come in?
We need to talk about him.

208
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,072
- A friend of ours is in trouble.
- James, who is it?

209
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,157
Some people that want to talk to me.

210
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:48,411
Well, honey, invite them in.

211
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:01,882
Can I talk with you
a few minutes in private?

212
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,019
It's urgent.

213
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:06,846
You know what? Why don't I go
put on a pot of coffee?

214
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,481
I might be able to help.

215
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:20,776
Your friend's here.

216
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,563
Good to see you again.
It's been, what, a year now?

217
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,991
We were just about to sit down
and have dinner.

218
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:29,638
I haven't eaten yet.
I'll join you.

219
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,903
James took red ribbon
at the science fair today.

220
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,057
- Salt volcano?
- Cartesian diver.

221
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,219
Cartesian diver.
Good job, kiddo.

222
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,264
So how'd you two lose touch?

223
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,603
Our priorities shifted.

224
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,394
What are your plans
while you're in town?

225
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,813
I came with some old friends
to catch up a little.

226
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:00,182
They're coming by later, in fact.

227
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,670
They're eager to see John.

228
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,390
My family's not familiar
with the old gang.

229
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:12,703
Not at all?

230
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:16,290
No. Don't really dwell on the past.

231
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,002
There's too much richness
in the present.

232
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,800
Our pals have already planned
to see you,

233
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:24,465
counting on it.

234
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:26,592
You know how they are.

235
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,886
They won't leave
without at least saying "hello."

236
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:35,045
Tell you what,
why don't we meet them out instead?

237
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:39,063
No need to subject Lillie and James to a
house full of guests on a school night.

238
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:47,363
Sure.

239
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:50,650
Wouldn't want to inconvenience
your family, now would we?

240
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:55,268
I'm not interested in talking about
what my stepdad thought, okay?

241
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:58,314
So if you're just here to,
I don't know, find closure,

242
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:00,459
then I can tell you
what I learned a long time ago.

243
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:02,122
You don't find any.

244
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,131
What did your friends want
to talk to James about?

245
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:06,632
A family matter.

246
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,881
His stepfather?

247
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,162
I'm not sure.
Our buddy's pretty secretive.

248
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:14,170
You heard about the John May message
that went out from the V ships?

249
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:16,302
There's a lot of John Mays
in the world.

250
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:18,527
Your stepfather started
the resistance against the Vs

251
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:20,324
before anybody even knew
they were here.

252
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:22,039
We're part of that resistance now.

253
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,692
What resistance?
I thought the V's were friendly.

254
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,489
You guys are insane.

255
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:28,946
So how did you guys meet?

256
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:30,966
At a restaurant.

257
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,118
He was one table over,
and he sort of caught my eye.

258
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,828
That sounds romantic.

259
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,987
So why now?
What do you want?

260
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:41,626
John May had a comms device he used
to communicate with the resistance.

261
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:44,003
We need that device
to contact an ally up there.

262
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:46,172
We're running out of time.

263
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,010
Maybe we could raise Mork and Kal-El

264
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,213
on the kree omni-wave projector.

265
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,933
Look, James, I know it's a lot
to wrap your head around.

266
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:57,988
You think?

267
00:16:58,242 --> 00:16:59,894
Where did your stepdad
keep his things?

268
00:17:01,256 --> 00:17:03,416
Boxed up in a storage unit in town.

269
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,691
Got tired of looking
at his stuff everywhere.

270
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,653
Look, man, I'm sure you
and my stepdad were friends,

271
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:12,615
You clearly have your cult fantasy thing
about how swell of a guy John May was,

272
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,114
but you weren't the one
he left when he killed himself.

273
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,640
That suicide note was fake.

274
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:27,797
- Have you lived here long?
- No. I'm from LA, so...

275
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:31,342
- Did you go to school out there?
- UCLA.

276
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,886
- Great football. You like football?
- Oh, yeah.

277
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,514
- I love the Trojans.
- Me, too.

278
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,101
The only problem is,
UCLA's team is the Bruins.

279
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,363
I meant the Bruins.

280
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,229
A shame.

281
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:18,108
Pretty girl like her.

282
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:34,155
God.

283
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:36,782
Storage unit in town.

284
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,036
Let's move.

285
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:45,634
Are you with us?

286
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:47,486
Are you with us?

287
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:48,628
Come on.

288
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,179
The name you gave us isn't real.

289
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,588
Alex Morgan isn't real.

290
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,679
She was.

291
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,483
She was my unborn daughter.

292
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:20,284
He's stronger than we anticipated.

293
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,786
He resisted the scours.

294
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:26,749
You're going about this
the wrong way.

295
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,876
He can lead us to The Fifth Column.

296
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:31,462
We have to dig deeper than scours.

297
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,539
How long had she been like that for?

298
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,351
Why was she with me?

299
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:48,405
The V's planted her with you
to watch and wait.

300
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,106
She wasn't human,

301
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,881
Don't sweat it.

302
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,946
How did you know my stepdad?

303
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:01,200
- He meant a lot to me.
- That's not an answer.

304
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:03,369
Been a lot of that today.

305
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:06,270
Let's slow down.
Joshua said it was here somewhere?

306
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:09,222
He said it was in Reedsville.
He didn't say it was here.

307
00:20:13,888 --> 00:20:14,839
I found it.

308
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:18,362
- What if it doesn't work?
- We pray...

309
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,845
That Georgie dies quickly.

310
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,591
Come on.

311
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,980
He's been hiding something.
I don't trust him.

312
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:26,967
- That makes two of us.
- Just stop!

313
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,812
This is about Georgie.
Georgie, who's up there right now.

314
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:34,025
- We can't afford mistrust, guys.
- Make no mistake.

315
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,856
We will save him.

316
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,946
We can't lose our way.
Get it together.

317
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:54,545
What are you shooting at?

318
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:00,040
I don't know.

319
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,428
we better get out
before it wakes up.

320
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,795
It's that thing
from the warehouse raid.

321
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,226
A seeker.

322
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:12,647
- Where is it?
- I saw something flying over there.

323
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:14,391
Where the hell is it?

324
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:15,973
Does anybody see it?

325
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:22,907
Don't move.

326
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:31,582
How the hell did they find us?

327
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:36,140
Your girl with the claws,
Did she give you something?

328
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:37,755
Like a promise ring.

329
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:41,384
The watch.

330
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:47,781
Let's go.

331
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:50,317
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's go.

332
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:55,422
- Have you prepared what I asked for?
- Yes, it's ready when you are.

333
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:58,559
If we've learned anything,
it's that emotion is weakness.

334
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:03,406
Love is the greatest flaw of humans,
And our best tool to break them.

335
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:06,415
He says he misses his family.

336
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,244
Let's show him his family.

337
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,130
<i>Since we couldn't use your memories,</i>

338
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:15,272
<i>We've decided to show you
someone else's.</i>

339
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:18,149
<i>Here are the memories of the V,</i>

340
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:20,372
<i>who killed your family.</i>

341
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,095
<i>Run.</i>
<i>I'm behind you.</i>

342
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:29,056
<i>Get away from me! Don't!
Get out of my house!</i>

343
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:30,683
Turn it off!

344
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:34,230
Keep playing it until he
tells us what we want to know.

345
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:35,746
Turn it off!

346
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,460
Perfect. See?

347
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,541
- Pretty easy, right?
- Yeah.

348
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,647
- I'm thirsty, I'm gonna get sodas.
- You want one?

349
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:49,018
- Can I get you one?
- Please.

350
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:56,398
Listen,

351
00:22:57,104 --> 00:22:59,404
my dad wants me to stay a few weeks.

352
00:22:59,947 --> 00:23:01,672
And I'll still see you.

353
00:23:01,993 --> 00:23:04,243
Believe me, I really wanna see you.

354
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,555
And I know it sucks, but maybe...

355
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,721
Maybe this will help fix some stuff.

356
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:13,267
What?

357
00:23:15,217 --> 00:23:18,105
I overheard something,
But I should say anything.

358
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,066
What is it?
Just tell me.

359
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,885
I can't.
It's not my place.

360
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:26,969
Please, just...

361
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,261
It's okay.

362
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,412
I think your father's lying.

363
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:36,958
About what?

364
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:40,819
I don't think he's really your dad.

365
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,132
Come on. That's...

366
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:46,856
That's ridiculous.

367
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,473
I overheard him talking to your mom.

368
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:50,991
Sorry.

369
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,520
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- Hey, guys, here we go.

370
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,355
What's wrong?

371
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:04,779
There's a weird mix-up
going on here.

372
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:09,388
Lisa just said that she
heard you talking to mom,

373
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,664
And you said something about
you not really being my dad.

374
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:13,772
I don't know.

375
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:15,525
It's crazy.

376
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:23,521
It's true?

377
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,594
It can't be.
This is me and...

378
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:31,549
And you.

379
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,152
It's...

380
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:35,725
it's complicated.

381
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,992
Don't you look at her.

382
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,252
- You lied.
- Wait. Wait, wait,

383
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:46,569
- What, is this why you left mom?
- No.

384
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:49,785


385
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:53,326
I said I couldn't trust her, Ty.

386
00:24:53,732 --> 00:24:54,781
What about me?

387
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:57,390
You left me, too, dad.

388
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,788
You feel duped for raising
somebody else's kid?

389
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:03,795
I love you, Ty,

390
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,649
Either way.
Please trust that.

391
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:10,730
You need to go talk to your mom
about this.

392
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,161
Yeah, I will.

393
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,980
When I ask to be a part
of "Live Aboard".

394
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:28,061
At the healing center,
I never thought I'd get picked.

395
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:31,451
I never thought I'd get picked.

396
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:33,866
<i>I've always thought of myself</i>
<i>as having bad luck,</i>

397
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,202
<i>But this...</i>
<i>Why'd you think you had bad luck?</i>

398
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,704
<i>When I was 15,</i>
<i>I had an appendectomy,</i>

399
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,439
<i>and complications left me</i>
<i>unable to have children.</i>

400
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:43,938
<i>I mean, I feel blessed</i>
<i>for everything that I have.</i>

401
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:45,873
<i>At family reunions,</i>

402
00:25:45,998 --> 00:25:49,173
<i>my siblings all have big families.</i>
<i>Not under eight kids.</i>

403
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,092
<i>Everyone?</i>

404
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,000
<i>... Siblings all have big families.</i>
<i>Not under eight kids.</i>

405
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,808
<i>Not under eight kids.</i>

406
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:00,685
<i>Everyone?</i>

407
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,603
<i>It's huge.</i>

408
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,493
Joshua, it's Ryan.

409
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:21,410
You found it. Good.

410
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,291
Listen, we have a friend up there.
His name is Georgie Sutton.

411
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,295
He went up there,
and they caught him.

412
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,004
I haven't heard anything.

413
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,203
He's up there.
I need you to find him?

414
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:32,296
I will.

415
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,594
Keep the comms device close.

416
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:48,691
Is it true what you said?

417
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:51,669
My stepdad faked that suicide note?

418
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,451
Bastard.

419
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:04,443
That man changed my life.

420
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,411
Good for you.

421
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:09,045
He changed ours, too.

422
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:11,297
Now listen to me.

423
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:13,306
Your stepfather didn't abandon you.

424
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:16,636
He never had left you
if he wasn't forced to.

425
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,552
How the hell would you know?

426
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:25,323
Because I'm the one that forced him.

427
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:29,169
- So what have you been doing this year?
- Looking for you.

428
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,985
No, I mean, what have you
experienced in your time here?

429
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,198
You never took a drive in the night
just to feel the wind in your face?

430
00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:41,118
Or had a cold pint on a warm day?

431
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:44,121
Saw a woman who literally
took your breath away?

432
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,292
No, I think you've been touched,

433
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,998
Living among people.

434
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:52,797
Maybe not much,
but there's a glimmer.

435
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:55,403
I can see it in your face.

436
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,890
You know, the humans...

437
00:28:03,322 --> 00:28:07,260
They have an expression they use when
they realize what truly matters to them.

438
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:11,300
They say they've found
their "true north."

439
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:15,319
Well, I've found mine here,

440
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,239
With that woman and that boy.

441
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:19,657
What's that?

442
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,483
That's my suicide note.

443
00:28:25,526 --> 00:28:29,161
Take a good look at that family
in there, am I gonna need it?

444
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:40,864
They're expecting you, John.

445
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:44,849
It's too late.

446
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,270
Ten years ago, when I came
to your house for dinner...

447
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:55,651
That was the day
that I killed John May.

448
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:05,828
You knew and
you didn't say anything?

449
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,789
- You knew that John May is dead?
- No, not just dead.

450
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:10,865
Dead at his hand.

451
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,557
Every single day, I wish I could
go back and undo what I did,

452
00:29:14,682 --> 00:29:15,789
But I can't.

453
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:20,103
All I can say is
your stepfather led the way.

454
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:23,054
I've taken risks
that you can't even imagine,

455
00:29:23,336 --> 00:29:25,211
Because of what he taught me.

456
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:27,820
This fight...

457
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,698
Will be brutal beyond
anything you've ever seen.

458
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:33,293
And you, too.

459
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,609
And John May is
our greatest weapon in it.

460
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:38,229
Anna ordered his death.

461
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:40,988
Every single time she sees
the message "John May lives,"

462
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,615
It's like a dagger in her eye.

463
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,369
The 5th Column exists
because of him.

464
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:49,501
He existed because of you.

465
00:29:50,683 --> 00:29:53,125
You and your mother taught him
what it's like to be human.

466
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:54,632
He taught me.

467
00:29:58,435 --> 00:30:01,425
So if nothing else, I just figured
that you should know the truth.

468
00:30:03,588 --> 00:30:04,809
No more lies.

469
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,833
I feel really stupid
forgetting the combination.

470
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,877
No, it happens more
than you'd think.

471
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:17,441
Let's just see,
the model number here.

472
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,957
The reset code is...

473
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:22,666
8-3-3-2-8 pound.

474
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:30,450
Okay, well, I'll...

475
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:32,636
I'll just see myself out then, huh?

476
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:49,724
You convinced a lot of people today.
To come live aboard your ships...

477
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:52,184
People like these two.

478
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:56,564
This woman comes from a family
with unusually high fertility rates,

479
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:58,941
but she's got a bad luck streak,
can't have kids.

480
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:02,987
This guy... brilliant violin player,
but a total mess.

481
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:05,948
I looked into our other guests
from today's story.

482
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,930
Same deal.

483
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,702
All so full of potential,

484
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,579
But, they're broken toys.

485
00:31:12,722 --> 00:31:15,708
This type of person is
of great interest to you.

486
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:17,286
The question is...

487
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:18,589
Why?

488
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,161
As sophisticated as humans are,

489
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:25,142
you don't see
the true value in people.

490
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:27,475
You discard them.

491
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:30,074
I see their inner worth.

492
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:33,225
Every V, regardless
of history or luck,

493
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,779
or circumstance, receives my care.

494
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:39,030
I'm only showing humans
the same regard.

495
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:53,597
I'm not buying it.

496
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,441
I don't know exactly
what all this means yet,

497
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:00,860
but I'm pretty sure
it adds up to something.

498
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,207
And if I can get this far
in half a day,

499
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:06,384
How far do you think
I could get in a month?

500
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:09,361
What do you want?

501
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:16,749
I'll tell you what I don't want.

502
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:21,065
I don't want to be ordinary.

503
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,111
If you were ordinary, Mr. Decker,
you wouldn't be here.

504
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:29,291
Which is exactly why I'm
gonna keep digging into this.

505
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:32,524
And eventually, I'll find enough
to run this story.

506
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:37,623
Or you can give me a bigger one.

507
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,377
I can protect you.

508
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,286
The question is, can we
keep helping each other?

509
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:50,813
I think that we'll be helping each other
for some time to come.

510
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,740
I'm here. How's he doing?

511
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,294
He's alive,
and <i>he hasn't broken yet.</i>

512
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:27,759
Can you move him?

513
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:30,092
Everyone's being watched
too closely right now.

514
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,380
But the "Live Aboard" program
commences in a few days.

515
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:35,395
I might be able to smuggle him
onto an outbound shuttle.

516
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:38,535
Will he last that long?

517
00:33:42,046 --> 00:33:42,810
Yes.

518
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,529
<i>They'll keep him
at the edge of life.</i>

519
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,883
Is he conscious?

520
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,299
<i>Can he talk?</i>

521
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:01,554
Go ahead.

522
00:34:02,486 --> 00:34:03,872
Buddy, how you doing?

523
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:08,146
<i>Been better.</i>

524
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,593
You're off the ship?
You're safe?

525
00:34:14,062 --> 00:34:15,096
I'm safe.

526
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:18,057
- We're all safe.
- <i>Good.</i>

527
00:34:19,088 --> 00:34:20,884
We're gonna get you out of there.

528
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:27,566
That's what they're waiting for.
<i>That's what they want.</i>

529
00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:32,376
<i>You come rescue me,
you all get caught.</i>

530
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,648
Georgie, listen to me.

531
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,035
Just give us a few days.
Just hang on.

532
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,227
I don't have a few more days.

533
00:34:42,488 --> 00:34:43,647
<i>You know that.</i>

534
00:34:47,758 --> 00:34:50,047
- Let me speak to Jack.
- Georgie,

535
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:51,891
please.

536
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,718
I need to speak to Jack, Ryan.

537
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,768
We're not leaving you up there.

538
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,965
It's bigger than me now, father.

539
00:35:06,866 --> 00:35:07,916
No, Georgie.

540
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:12,945
Listen to me, hang on.

541
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:17,158
I'll see you around, Jack.

542
00:35:22,902 --> 00:35:23,873
Are you sure?

543
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:27,209
I'm ready to see my family now.

544
00:35:33,328 --> 00:35:35,384
God... Bless you, George Sutton.

545
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:37,469
God bless you.

546
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:41,303
Make sure they don't track it
back to you.

547
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:27,075
John May lives.

548
00:36:41,188 --> 00:36:42,368
To Georgie...

549
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,456
not in vain.

550
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:53,942
<i>Hey, this is Val, leave a message.</i>

551
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:55,628
Hey, baby. It's me.

552
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:00,363
There's something I need to talk
to you about when I get home.

553
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:02,573
I'm not who you think I am.

554
00:38:07,874 --> 00:38:10,119
<i>I just feel
you should know the truth.</i>

555
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,505
<i>No more lies.</i>

556
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,843
<i>No more secrets.</i>

557
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,597
<i>I just feel you should</i>
know the truth.

558
00:38:45,024 --> 00:38:45,800
Ty?

559
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:49,745
I always wondered why he left.

560
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:54,700
Deep down, maybe...

561
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:57,712
I even knew...
It had to do with me.

562
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,819
It didn't, honey.

563
00:39:01,784 --> 00:39:03,267
What did dad tell you?

564
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:06,011
I know everything, mom.

565
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:09,018
The tests are wrong.

566
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:12,283
The doctors were wrong.
He is your dad.

567
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:13,607
I promise.

568
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:18,065
- Not according to him.
- I know.

569
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,837
- How could you not tell me?
- Because...

570
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,795
I was scared
you wouldn't believe me, and,

571
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:29,184
I thought if I just kept going,

572
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,371
that somebody would tell me
that it was a mistake,

573
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:35,499
because it is a mistake.
I didn't. I never...

574
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:38,461
I thought that
I could always trust you

575
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:41,730
Baby, you can.
I was coming home to tell you.

576
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:44,094
- Why should I believe you?
- Because it's true.

577
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:47,658
- How can I believe you?
- Please, Tyler. Please.

578
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:50,177
It's not true.

579
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:51,606
It's not.

580
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:53,247
It's not true!

581
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:56,582
Honey?

582
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:00,006
Val?

583
00:40:28,335 --> 00:40:30,232
George Sutton died.

584
00:40:31,378 --> 00:40:34,148
The emotional trauma must have
been too intense for him.

585
00:40:34,716 --> 00:40:36,628
We did not get any names.

586
00:40:38,176 --> 00:40:40,084
"John May lives"...

587
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:44,334
Trite and untrue, but even still,

588
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:48,607
The message The 5th Column sent seems
to have produced a groundswell.

589
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:53,421
Let them have this one victory.

590
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:03,167
<i>Because I'm about to deliver them...</i>

591
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:09,336
<i>a thousand defeats.</i>

592
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,648
<i>Team Lézards</i>
