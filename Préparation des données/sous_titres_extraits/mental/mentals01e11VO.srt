they can wait.

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,100
okay?

63
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
is james coming here?

64
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,700
they're flying together.

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,400
the whole family.

66
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,700
you don't have to see them
if you don't want to.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,700
how do i look?

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,100
you're a mes

69
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
but with potential.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,100
amazing potential.
mm-hmm.

71
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,400
everything will be different
this time.

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,600
is there any chance
that the shot was accidental?

73
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,100
no, he changed hands.

74
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,500
what do you mean,
he changed hands?

75
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
clay's right-handed.

76
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
when i came
down the stairs,

77
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,900
he was hding the gun
in his right hand.

78
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,200
then he took the gun
in his left to fire.

79
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,200
he was so calm
about it.

80
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,000
it was no accident.

83
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,100
and clay jefferson --
how's he doing?

84
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,000
very good.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,500
the surgeon said
that he would retain 70% to 80%

86
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,900
of the use of his hand
with therapy and treatment.

87
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,800
has he been told?

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,100
yes, and he understood

89
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,200
that i didn't detect
any great relief.

90
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,300
suicidal?

91
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,600
i can't rule it out,
but instinct says no --

92
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
the self-mutilation
was just so specific.

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,700
does he constitute
a threat to his wife and son?

94
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,100
well, having fired the weapon
four times inside his home,

95
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,600
the answer
would have to be yes.

96
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,400
where did the other
three shots go?
into the diorama.

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
he built a full-scale model
of the battlefield.

98
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,000
so, who filed the complaint --
the wife?
no, the neighbors.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,800
they called the police
when they heard the gunfire.

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,500
i get the sense that everyone
would be very happy

101
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,700
to see this go away.

102
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,800
why is he not at the v.a.?
his choice.

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,200
they have
private medical insurance

104
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,400
through his wife, laney,
who teaches at the high school.

105
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
so, 72 hours.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,100
jack, i really need your help
with this one.

107
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,000
i tried to do
the intake.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,400
but he can't remember a thing,
and he refuses to try.

109
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,200
he just refuses to see his wife,
even his little boy.

110
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,800
i just find him
completely impenetrable.

111
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,900
we'll have a go.

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,900
ah, mr. jefferson,
this is dr. gallagher.

113
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,300
maybe you can tell him
why you're here.

114
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,800
i'm here so that you can
put your "x" in the box

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,600
next to post-traumatic stress

116
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,900
and feel like you've done
your good deed for the day.

117
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,000
you have ptsd?

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,400
we all do.
didn't you know?

119
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,700
crazy ex-killers,
violent and unpredictable --

120
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,000
uncle sam's
dirty little secrets.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,500
if we had any decency,
we would have died over there

122
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,200
and become
true american heroes,

123
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,700
instead of dragging our problems
back to your doorstep.

124
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,700
it's a nice speech --

125
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,600
think it up while you
were lying there?

126
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,400
clay, have, um --

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,100
have you changed your mi
about seeing laney?

128
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,500
keep my family
out of this.

129
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,600
when did you leave
the army?

130
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,900
it's in the file.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,700
i'd rather hear
you tell me.

132
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,100
the spoken word
has got an emotional content.

133
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,900
that way i can get
a real good bearing

134
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,800
on how much
of a nut case you are.

135
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,900
discharged six months ago,
two weeks after i was released

136
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,000
from the hospital
for my injuries.

137
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,100
i don't have ptsd.

138
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
it's just easier for you
to think that.

139
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,200
so, it was
a rational decision

140
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,700
to unload a weapon
at your wife and child

141
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,500
and blow a hole
in your hand?

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,800
i'm getting real sick
of your bogus questions.

143
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,900
maybe we should
just come back later.

144
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,700
i'm still
kind of curious...

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
...about what he's got
in the basement.

146
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,300
man:
go, go, go, go!

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
it's just a hobby.

148
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,500
oh, hi, sweetheart.

149
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,000
oh. oh, jackie.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,300
hi, mum.
where's your luggage?

151
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,400
we left them at the hotel,
but i've --

152
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,200
i've brought some clothes
for becky.

153
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
sure.

154
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,700
hello, james.

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,300
hello, son.
you're looking well.

156
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,400
i am well.
she's waiting for you.

157
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,500
all right.
how did she find you?

158
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,300
well, she called,
and, you see,

159
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,000
i told her where i lived,
where i worked.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
i think it sink in.
she walked over.

161
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,400
has she talked
about the attack?

162
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,200
she hasn't said much.

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
some people tried to
steal her food.

164
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,400
she's got some cuts,
abrasions,

165
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,300
cracked ribs,
some bruising.

166
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,900
is she still having
conversations with herself?

167
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,200
still crazy, sorry to report --
very disappointing.

168
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
it's just a question, darling,
just a question.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
who -- who's she?

170
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,600
jack:
that's dr. chloe artis.

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
she's a resident.
she's -- she's very talented.

172
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,300
ah.
and what was she doing?

173
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,800
establishing
a therapeutic relationship.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
very attractive girl.

175
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
you're still single,
right?

176
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,800
you offering me
some fatherly advice?

177
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,800
i don't --
i don't understand

178
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,900
why i can't go
in there, jack.

179
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,600
it's easier for becky to focus
on one person at a time.

180
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
[ sighs ]
you know what?

181
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,200
i'm -- i'm going in there,
i mean, just to say hello.

182
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,900
 <i>hey.</i>

183
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,800
 <i>you look</i>
 <i>so gorgeous.</i>

184
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,800
[ <i>laughs</i> ]
 <i>jack said i was a mess.</i>

185
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
 <i>he's a doctor.</i>
 <i>what do doctors know?</i>

186
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,800
 <i>yeah, i'm sorry.</i>

187
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,600
 <i>doesn't she</i>
 <i>look gorgeous?</i>

188
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,700
 <i>she seems safe.</i>

189
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,300
dr. gallagher?

190
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,900
major.

191
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,000
i'm here about clay jefferson --
arlen rawlins.

192
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
is thisan official visit

193
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,500
well, i know clay.

194
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,100
i was one of his
commanding officers in iraq.

195
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,100
he's a fine young man --

196
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,300
served his country
with distinction.

197
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,600
how's he doing?

198
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,800
i'm curious
how you know he was here.

199
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,500
our patient files
are confidential.

200
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,000
or at least i thought
they were.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,300
well, it's nothing
cloak-and-dagger.

202
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,900
clay receives
medical disabilities,

203
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,400
and the injury to his hand
prompted an inquiry.

204
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,100
that's all.

205
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,500
from whom?

206
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
i thought you might like
to see clay's service record.

207
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,200
i thought
it might be useful,

208
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,600
give you
some additional insight.

209
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,300
thank you
for the personal delivery.

210
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,500
the army takes care
of its own.

211
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,700
even after they've left?

212
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,100
bonds of loyalty
formed between soldiers

213
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,900
serving in wartime

214
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,900
transcends
formalities of status.

215
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,600
there's nothing in here
about ptsd.

216
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,200
when he was
in the hospital,

217
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,600
he was being treated
for his physical injuries.

218
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,100
ptsd was never diagnosed.

219
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,600
now, for the record,
i'm not one of these people

220
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,600
who doesn't believe in
the disease or its seriousness.

221
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,300
in fact, i am very familiar
with the work you've done

222
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,400
with veterans
in your vermont clinic.

223
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,700
it's commendable.

224
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,300
you seem to be familiar
with a lot of things, major.

225
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
i try to stay informed.

226
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,300
i know that clay will receive
the care he needs here, doc.

227
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,300
anything i can do to assist,
just ask.

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
thank you.

229
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,200
woman on p.a.:
 <i>orderly to ward two.</i>

230
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
 <i>orderly to ward two.</i>

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,600
what have i done now?

232
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,600
nothing yet.

233
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,300
preemptive strike?

234
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,300
did your parents
get here yet?

235
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,500
 <i>parent,</i> stepfather.

236
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,100
oh, god.
spare me the family drama.

237
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,000
what's your plan
with becky?

238
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
as soon as she gets
a little stronger,

239
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,000
i'll transfer her
to a long-term-care facility.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,700
narrowed it down to two --
they're both excellent.

241
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,700
great physical eonments,
top staff.

242
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,000
who've already agreed
to let you

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,700
puppet-master her recovery
from afar?

244
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,500
you know, just a guess.

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,300
what of it?

246
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
i'm worried
about your focus,

247
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,900
for your sake
as well as the hospital's.

248
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,400
i'll find the right balance,
nora.

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,200
where are
these facilities?

250
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,700
one's north of san diego.
the other's in ojai.

251
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,500
i'll see her
on my days off and vacations.

252
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
i'll give you
plenty of notice.

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
and no time for yourself.

254
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,900
i don't see it
as a burden.

255
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,600
it's actually more
of a gift.

256
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
and look
on the bright side.

257
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
i finally
get to buy a car.

258
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,600
what's that for?

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,200
for a little.

260
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,400
clay: i can walk.

261
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,000
regulations -- i know you know
about regulations.

262
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,800
if i wanted to take off,
how would you stop me?

263
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,500
recent surgery,
major trauma --

264
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,600
you might not be as fast
as you think.

265
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,600
i wouldn't run <i>from</i> you.
i'd run <i>through</i> you.

266
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,900
well, given your youth
and your training,

267
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,100
you'd probably take me
in a fair fight.

268
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,900
???

269
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,800
but that's
not the point.

270
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
what is?

271
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
you can threaten me,
insult me, ignore me.

272
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,100
you can do
all those things.

273
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,400
but you won't shake me,

274
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
so you might as well
stop trying.

275
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
why did you decide
on a military career?

276
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,100
i'm third-generation army.

277
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,900
i bleed khaki.

278
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,700
at least i did.

279
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,700
i spent my teens
on naval bases.

280
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,300
where?

281
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,500
south carolina,
new england, d.c. area --

282
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,800
my stepfather.

283
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,800
he was, uh..
he's retired two years ago.

284
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,300
he was a vice admiral.

285
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,700
[ clears throat ]
annapolis man.

286
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,600
i got a little problem
with you, clay.

287
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,800
why's that?

288
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,600
well, if you don't open up,
your whole evaluation

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,500
is gonna have to be solely based
on your actions.

290
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,500
i'll take what i deserve.

291
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,900
what you <i>think</i> you deserve.

292
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,400
i might have
a different opinion.

293
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,500
see, mental disease,
disorders, phobias,

294
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
whatever you
want to call them 

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,800
they can be traced back
as far as genetics,

296
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,600
but they can also be
the body's reaction to stress.

297
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,700
there's a reason
you wanted to hurt yourself.

298
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
and it's got
to start somewhere.

299
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,100
what do you want to know?

300
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
i want you to bookend
your memory loss for me --

301
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,300
the last thing you remember
before you don't

302
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
and the first thing
you remember after.

303
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
man:
go, go, go, go, go!

304
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
my platoon
was taking fire.

305
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,300
rpg! down, down,
down, down, down!

306
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,400
look out!

307
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,100
left two wounded with the medic
back on the road.

308
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,500
we got pinned down.

309
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
and that's
when it happened.

310
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,800
sonny!

311
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,500
sonny went ahead.

312
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,000
next thing,
everything exploded --

313
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,000
maybe an i.e.d.

314
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,800
i woke up in the hospital
in the green zone.

315
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,500
sonny didn't make it.

316
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
sonny?

317
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,400
first lieutenant
sonny bostock --

318
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,800
my best friend.

319
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,000
a commander of yours
dropped by to see me today.

320
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,800
major arlen rawlins.

321
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
who?

322
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,900
mum: i love it.

323
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,300
ah, it lacks soul.

324
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,000
[ laughs ]
no.

325
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,300
what it lacks
is a woman's touch.

326
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,000
oh, don't go there.

327
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,800
[ laughs ]
i'm your mother.

328
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,100
i can go there.
thank you, sweetie.

329
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,600
i guess some things
never change.

330
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,100
cheers

331
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,800
what are her chances,
realistically?

332
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,800
i mean, will she ebe
able to live an ordinary life?

333
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,400
well, leshoot
for extraordinary.

334
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,500
is that optimism
or determination?

335
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,600
[ laughs ]
both.

336
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,300
how's life, mum?

337
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,400
better now.
james has a job.

338
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,300
did you know?
no.

339
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,900
yeah, he's consulting with a --
for a defense contractor.

340
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,200
and -- retirement
didn't suit him.

341
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,100
we're doing very well,
in fact.

342
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,200
that's great.

343
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,100
he's a fine man,
your father.

344
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,100
he <i>was</i> a fine man
who died a long time ago.

345
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,400
oh, jack,
you are so stubborn.

346
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
i don't want to have this
conversation with you anymore.

347
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,800
tomorrow, when you
drop by to see becky,

348
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,200
have them come find me.

349
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,000
i'd like to go over
her transfer plans.

350
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,300
of course.

351
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,900
i worry about you.

352
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
i want you to be happier.

353
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
we found her.
she's safe.

354
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,200
and she'll finally get
the care she needs.

355
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,000
okay.

356
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,800
laney:
why won't he see us?

357
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,300
i was gonna ask you
the same thing.

358
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,800
i don't know.
shame, i guess.

359
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,700
i mean, he loves nathan
every bit as much as i do.

360
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,200
the idea of hurting him
would make him sick.

361
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,800
you know, at first i --
i was convinced

362
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
that i didn't want him
around us anymore.

363
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,500
now i --
i just want him home.

364
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,800
yeah.

365
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,700
so, what do you think?

366
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,100
when did he
start building it?

367
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,200
about six weeks ago.

368
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,200
any idea
what set it off?

369
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
4vyeah,
he ran into moon

370
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,900
at the hospital
after one of the checkups.

371
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
moono's moon?

372
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,000
he was a friend
from his platoon.

373
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,500
he was one of the men wounded
during the initial attack.

374
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,100
so, moon
told him something?

375
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,100
he said that clay came back
to the humvees to check on him.

376
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,100
this was after sonny
had been killed.

377
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,500
so suddenly,
that couple of seconds

378
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,800
that he couldn't remember
turned into a couple of hours.

379
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,800
and the next day,

380
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
he started hauling in bags
of sand and cement.

381
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,500
what -- what are you gonna do
with the diorama?

382
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,200
hire someone
to haul it away.

383
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,000
hold off on that
for a while.

384
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
i miss you.

385
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,600
you shouldn't be here.

386
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,500
you all right?

387
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,800
uh-huh. perfect.

388
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,900
can you do a favor
for me?

389
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
anything.

390
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
be nice to james.

391
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,000
mum put you
up to that?

392
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,900
no.

393
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,200
remember when mum first
brought him home for dinner?

394
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,600
he was an ass.

395
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,200
he was frightened.

396
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,000
of what?

397
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,200
us.

398
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,000
will you go back
to sleep?

399
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,200
okay.

400
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
you went to my home?
you took pictures of my work?

401
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,600
laney misses you.
so does your son.

402
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,900
i can't go back there
after what's happened.

403
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,800
i think you've punished
yourself enough. come here.

404
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
which one of these
little fellows is you?

405
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,700
come here, lieutenant.

406
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,000
this guy?

407
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,400
yeah.

408
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,900
what about sonny?

409
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,000
well, um,
he was supposed to

410
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,300
stay back with the wounded,
seal off the road.

411
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,700
i don't know
where he came from.

412
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,700
all right.
so, this iu.

413
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,800
where were you
leading your team?

414
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,900
there.

415
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,000
the gunshots
came from the roof.

416
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
i saw muzzle flashes
and movement.

417
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
all right.

418
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,100
there's something else
i don't understand --

419
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,700
this, this, and those.

420
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,000
bullet holes.

421
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,100
real bullet holes?

422
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,500
i'd been working
the model all night.

423
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,200
everything felt wrong.

424
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,400
i got frustrated,
and i lost it.

425
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,100
all right,
so, you fire three times.

426
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,700
you hear a sound.
you turn.

427
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,300
your cover with your loaded
weapon. it's nathan.

428
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,600
he thought
i was playing with him.

429
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,300
but it was sonny
that i saw.

430
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,100
clay!

431
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
all right,
so, you lower your weapon.

432
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,200
nathan's fine.
he's safe.

433
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
laney's safe.
no harm done.

434
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,700
but you switch the gun to your
other hand, and you fire.

435
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,500
what are you thinking?

436
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,900
it ends here.

437
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,900
hey.

438
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,800
hey

439
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,900
[ clears throat ]
what's all this?

440
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,500
uh, it's a patient --
army lieutenant wounded in iraq.

441
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,000
those are of a model he built
to re-create a situation

442
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,500
in which he was wounded.

443
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,100
he's got
some memory loss.

444
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,900
i'm trying to help him
fill in the blanks.

445
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,900
where's mum?

446
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,900
she's still with becky.

447
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,400
how is she?

448
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,400
she's not too good today.
she's confused.

449
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
i don't understand what --
what happened.

450
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,800
well, i told you.
she goes in and out.

451
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,100
she's doing really well, but
she's a long way from stable.

452
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
look, james, i'm --
i'm kind of under the pump.

453
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,800
can we make it for later?
we can eat at the loft.

454
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,900
oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
that -- that sounds fine.

455
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,100
so, this is -- this is meant
to replicate a combat situation?

456
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,200
yes. yes, it is.
hmm.

457
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,800
can you take a look at these?
you can take them with you.

458
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,700
yeah.

459
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,300
[ sighs ]
all right.

460
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,100
what's so interesting?

461
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
well, you know,
old habi die hard.

462
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,100
when you see something,
i'd like to know.

463
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,800
your patient was
the commander, right?

464
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,700
yeah, it's --
he's here.

465
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,600
yeah, well,
he's a lousy soldier, jack.

466
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,800
well, he's west point.

467
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,400
what?

468
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,800
well, all right,
you tell me

469
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
exactly what
i'm looking at here.

470
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,900
all right, so,
clay's leading his men

471
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,400
in -- in this direction
towards this building here

472
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,500
when they start coming
under heavy fire.

473
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,700
right, and this is the target
structure, right?
yeah.

474
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,800
well, why would he
have his men enfilade?

475
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,900
i'm sorry, what?

476
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,500
well, lined up to take enemy
fire along their longest axis.

477
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,900
that's bad?
that's fatal --

478
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,800
the easiway for the enemy
to inflict maximum casualties.

479
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,300
you h...

480
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,800
all right, here.
see?

481
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,600
these are the good guys,
okay?

482
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,500
yeah.

483
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,200
i'm the bad guys.

484
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,000
how can i miss?

485
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
i miss the guy in front,
i take down the guy behind him.

486
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,100
and it makes return fire
even harder

487
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,800
because the guys
in the back of the line

488
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,000
have to fire through
their own men at the enemy.

489
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,500
see what i mean?
it's fatal.

490
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,200
you know, i'm gonna wait
for you outside.

491
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,700
it shouldn't be long.

492
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,900
come in,
dr. gallagher.

493
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
gallagher,
how's our boy?

494
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,900
our boy hasn't the faintest idea
who you are.

495
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,600
well, it's a big army.

496
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,500
there was
no insurance inquiry.

497
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,500
are you accusing me
of something, doctor?

498
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,900
well...you're keeping
your eye on clay

499
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,800
long after his discharge.

500
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,600
what do you want,
rawlins?

501
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,600
i just want
clay and his family

502
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,500
to have a good life.

503
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,800
he's earned it.

504
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,100
that's all?

505
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,500
this is satellite imagery
of the baghdad neighborhood

506
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
where clay and his men
were attacked --

507
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,600
one taken shortly before,
the other just after.

508
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,400
no explanation?

509
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,900
by helping you,
i hope to help clay.

510
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,000
he may have a decision
to make.

511
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,000
regarding what?

512
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,100
jack, meet moon.

513
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,400
nice to meet you, sir.

514
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,700
you, too.

515
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,000
private --

516
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,600
just moon will do.

517
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,900
moon, what do you think
of lieutenant jefferson?

518
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,700
he's very cool
for an oer.

519
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,600
when i was hit,
he was right there.

520
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,200
lieutenant's good people.

521
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,300
lieutenant bostock --
sonny?

522
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,300
 good people,
excellent.

523
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,800
now, nobody likes to talk ill
of the dead, of course.

524
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,000
that's right.

525
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,500
you know,
we're both doctors, though,

526
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
so whatever you say
is completely confidential.

527
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,900
we're trying to help
lieutenant jefferson.

528
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,200
he's having a hard time.

529
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,700
james: florida.

530
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,900
there's a facility
very near our home,

531
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,800
extremely highly rated,
also near the beach.

532
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,100
and your mom and i
would be 10 minutes away.

533
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,800
when you come to visit,
you stay with us.

534
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,000
there's a guest room.

535
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,600
but best of all,
as becky progresses,

536
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,200
if they let her out on weekends,
she could come home.

537
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
before any of this happens,
we'd like you

538
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,000
to check out the facility
and consult with the doctors.

539
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
we'd rely on you.

540
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,200
well, this is,
uh...unexpected.

541
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,000
[ sighs ]
she's our daughter, jack.

542
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,200
we -- we've talked about this
for years.

543
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
it was a major factor

544
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,600
in buying our home
and locating where we did.

545
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,300
why didn't you tell me
about this?

546
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,800
it's just speculation.

547
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,100
we had no way of knowing
under what circumstances

548
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,400
becky would be found,
or even if.

549
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,600
i don't know.

550
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,500
i -- this is gonna take me
a little bit of time to --

551
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
how lore you guys
in town?

552
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,500
jack.

553
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,100
please don't just reject
this suggestion out of hand.

554
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
i'm not gonna reject
anything...yet.

555
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,600
look, i realize that
we've sprung this on you,

556
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,800
but it deserves
serious consideration.

557
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,300
and i'll give it
serious consideration.

558
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,300
look...guys, really,

559
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,000
i've -- i've got an early start
in the morning,

560
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,200
and it's getting late.

561
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,000
can i call you back?

562
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,800
yeah, okay, thank you.

563
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,000
i need legal advice.

564
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,900
okay, i know a number
of good attorneys.

565
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,500
just listen
for a minute.
okay.

566
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,700
they want to take becky
back to florida and put
her in treatment there.

567
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,700
and i think they have
becky's power of attorney,

568
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,800
authorizing themo make
medical decisions on her behalf.

569
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,000
and you want to fight that?
how do i keep her
in california?

570
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,100
um, get becky to revoke
the power of attorney,

571
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,700
file suit on her behalf.

572
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,700
your medical credentials
should help your case.

573
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,100
she's here now.

574
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,900
it's gonna take some time

575
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,600
for your parents
to get a court to act.

576
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,800
by that time, hopefully,
she'll be settled

577
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,100
into a facility
that you've chosen.

578
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
i need those names.

579
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,800
how do you think
the stress of a legal battle

580
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,400
will affect becky?

581
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,000
maybe she doesn't
have to know about that part.

582
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,200
it could get pretty ugly.

583
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,200
it'll be what it is.

584
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,600
why else did you build it, clay,
if not for this?

585
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,300
it ends here.

586
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,500
sonny!
[ explosion ]

587
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,400
man:
man, we got to go!

588
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,000
that's the last thing
i remember.

589
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,100
maybe these will help.

590
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,300
that's right

591
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,000
there was...a home.

592
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,200
i ran through it
a thousand times.

593
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,900
i couldn't figure
how i could let us

594
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,000
get caught out in the open
like that.

595
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,700
????

596
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
neither.

597
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,300
the explosion.

598
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,800
i thought it killed sonny.

599
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,600
that was his grenade.

600
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
man: move!

601
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
get inside now.

602
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,400
what did you see?

603
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,000
bodies.

604
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,100
mostly women and kids.

605
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
moon told us
that on a previous mission,

606
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,900
it seems sonny rolled a grenade
into a house

607
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,800
without looking inside
to see who was there.

608
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,300
sonny was firing
into the bodies...

609
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,700
sonny!
what are you doing?!

610
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,000
...making sure
they were dead.

611
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,700
there was a boy, maybe...

612
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
maybe 5 or 6.

613
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,900
blood on his face.

614
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,700
sonny put his rifle
to the boy's head.

615
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,300
i tried to stop him.

616
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,800
don't do it, sonny.

617
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,500
i killed my best friend.

618
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,200
you knew what i did
all along?

619
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,700
nope. no one else
was inside the room.

620
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,400
and now that you do...

621
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,800
you can't tell anyone?

622
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,700
patient/doctor thing.

623
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,700
right.

624
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,100
but i can.

625
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,900
we thought laney
should hear this, too.

626
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,300
we filled her in
on some of the background.

627
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,800
so, here's what we got
from moon.

628
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,700
soon after you
entered the house,

629
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,800
reinforcements arrived,
and the enemy fire melted away.

630
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,700
that's when rawlins showed up,
went inside where you were.

631
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
and no one else was allowed
inside the house.

632
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,000
i remember.

633
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,300
he -- um,

634
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,700
he ordered me to carry on,

635
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,100
said there'd have to be
an investigation.

636
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,800
sometime after that,
a car showed up.

637
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,200
someone handed rawlins
some gear in a duffel bag,

638
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,600
and he went
back into the house.

639
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,300
when he came out,
the duffel was empty.

640
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,500
i saw the detonator.

641
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,600
that's when you went
running back to the place.

642
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
i thought the boy
was still in there.

643
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,600
no. he'd already been
medevacked out.

644
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,700
and the whole place was
vaporized -- no more building.

645
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,600
that was
the second explosion,

646
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,600
the one that caused
your injuries.

647
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,200
and the amnesia?

648
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,200
post-traumatic
stress disorder.

649
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,200
it's all over,
baby, okay?

650
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,100
it's for the army
to decide.

651
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,400
nathan.

652
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,100
these little fellas
are for you.

653
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,500
come here.

654
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,200
here you go.
come here.

655
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,700
come here.

656
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,400
there you go.

657
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,300
attaboy.

658
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,200
but if it
were nathan?

659
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,700
what?

660
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,400
what if it were
an unnamed soldier...

661
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,800
aiming the gun
at nathan's head?

662
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,800
would you really condemn the man
that saved your son?

663
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,600
come here.

664
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,400
no crimicharges filed.

665
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,600
he'll receive
outpatient therapy.

666
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,000
he has decided,
for the good of his family,

667
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,300
to let the past
stay in the past.

668
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,300
case closed.

669
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,100
you knew the story
all along.

670
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,700
we both got to the same place
by different roads.

671
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,200
someday, god willing,
we'll make it

672
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,100
so that good men
like clay jefferson

673
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,800
will never again be placed
in impossible situations.

674
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,800
until then, i'll look
for small victories.

675
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,800
come here.

676
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,600
that's it.
i've got you.
