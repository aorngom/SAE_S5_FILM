00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:26,470
His handiwork, i assume.
mahatma gallagher.

4
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:28,818
He mentioned something
about shintoism.

5
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:31,410
celebration of
nature's spirits and ancestors.

6
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:32,690
Nice touch.

7
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:36,412
So, what's his story, anyway ?

8
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,433
What do you mean?

9
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:39,112
Divorced, attached,

10
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:41,357
fugitive from the law, c.i.a. mole ?

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,668
He's currently uttached,
severe commitment disorder,

12
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,687
exercise junkie,
peter pan syndrome.

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,233
Not that i've paid much attention.

14
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:49,276
He has a seriously smokinbody.

15
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,213
Not that i've noticed.

16
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:52,350
Hey, guys.

17
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,100
beautiful day,
isn't it?

18
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:55,137
So...

19
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:58,130
Are you ready for some
patient-doctor bonding ?

20
00:00:58,342 --> 00:01:00,935
Well, 're waiting for rounds.
we just need to get in six north.

21
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,743
- Great, then...
- And the director

22
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:05,385
usually accompanies us
on the rounds.

23
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:10,319
Gotcha.

24
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,626
- Doctor, i need a little help.
- Talk to me, gorgeous.

25
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,724
Ranier, Melissa.

26
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:20,097
Third trimester.
Here visiting relatives.

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,199
She was alone shopping at the grove

28
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,357
when she jusstarted having
contractions and faied.

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,493
just took her b.p.
she's slightly hypertensive.

30
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:27,973
okay. thank you.

31
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,033
You busy later ?

32
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:32,814
But i'm pretty sure you're not.

33
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:41,329
I'm dr. moore. How are you doing?

34
00:01:41,412 --> 00:01:44,708
I started getting contractions,

35
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:47,164
and...then i got
so light-headed.

36
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:49,108
i'm only seven months.

37
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,729
i'm so scared.

38
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,655
Is my baby okay ?

39
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,740
well,
let's take a look.

40
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,144
where are the patients?

41
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,002
What's going on ?

42
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:15,640
relay races?

43
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:18,082
is this supposed to take
the place of morning rounds?

44
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:20,507
Of course not. rounds are good.

45
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,269
Actually, veronica,

46
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,810
instigating a morning fitness
regime is not a bad idea.

47
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,577
exercise has been shown
to elevate

48
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,127
brain-derived
neurotrophic factors.

49
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,430
right, but this more

50
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,108
than encouraging the patients
to work out.

51
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:33,848
this is a trust exercise.

52
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:35,432
trusting
other patients?

53
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:38,147
no.
trusting their doctors.

54
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,035
the three-legged race
is up next.

55
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:45,164
wait. hey... we're...
you mean we're supposed to...?

56
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,222
you can't be serious !

57
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:49,043
actually,
it looks like fun.

58
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,604
unfortunately, my back.

59
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,429
i'm in heels.

60
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:55,271
guys, whether these patients
are here on a 72-hour hold

61
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:57,278
or they've committed
themselves voluntarily,

62
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,325
they've all put their well-being
in our hands.

63
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:00,709
if they don't believe

64
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,752
that you're willing to get
down and dirty with them,

65
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:05,990
how can you expect them
to confide in you?

66
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,319
and, people,
this is not a suggestion.

67
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:32,004
this is gonna be a little cold,
and i'm sorry.

68
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,355
it's okay.
i've done this a million times.

69
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:03,693
i'm gonna get you something
to stop those contractions, ok ?

70
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,643
back in a flash.

71
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:08,309
Ready !

72
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,774
on your mark!

73
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,840
Set !

74
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:42,740
races ?

75
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,677
it's cool.

76
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,494
i just called you. i need you down
at the e.r. for a psych consult.

77
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:49,693
really?
yeah.

78
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:52,082
absolutely.
let's go.

79
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:54,793
so, what's up?

80
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,206
we, this patient informed us
she was seven months along.

81
00:04:58,289 --> 00:04:59,906
she fainted
when contractions started.

82
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:02,066
she has hormone levels
that are raised

83
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:03,318
and cervical softening.

84
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,349
well, then why -- why are you
asking for a psych consult?

85
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:06,887
call an ob-gyn.

86
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,900
take a look
at the ultrasound.

87
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:12,211
what's wrong
with this picture?

88
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:15,079
i don't get it.
i can't even see a baby.

89
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,350
there is no baby.

90
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:29,119
Pseudocyesis

91
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:42,053
Is she still pregnacy ?

92
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,637
is she still in the e.r.?

93
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,495
- I ordere some blood work.
- Why ?

94
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,182
just to buy some time.

95
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:49,055
i read about this
in med school,

96
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:50,599
but i never thought i would
actually see it firsthand.

97
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,381
and she actually looks
pregnant?

98
00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:53,427
Not just looks.

99
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,789
she has all
the classic mptoms

100
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:57,106
right down to hormonal levels,
water retention.

101
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,862
the mind speaks.
the body answers.

102
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:00,505
But for seven months ?

103
00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:03,023
is there a husband?
she's wearing a ring.

104
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:04,363
So, what should  do with her?

105
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:06,699
well, i told her there was
no room in maternity.

106
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,765
i just -- i wasn't sure
how far to push at the intake.

107
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,139
we should go easy on her.

108
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:12,404
something tells me we shouldn't
burst her bubble just yet.

109
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:15,833
Let's get her to the psych ward.
is there any other business ?

110
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:19,083
want to grab some breakfast?
i'm buying.

111
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,515
thanks. I have a budget meeting.

112
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:27,511
try not to, piss anybody
important off today.

113
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,047
- really go...
- he baby cakes.

114
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:31,868
Denny.

115
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,694
what's going on?

116
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:39,100
what's going on?
it's thursday.

117
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,093
i have a standing engagement
at the hospital, remember?

118
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,723
yeah, i blew it off.

119
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,717
you know, i'd much rather play
for the kids here.

120
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,586
what's the matter?

121
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:58,063
what about those producers
you said were really hot?

122
00:06:58,146 --> 00:06:59,612
those guys
are all the same.

123
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,282
they're all part
of the same corporate machine.

124
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,880
they make
a ton of promises,

125
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,938
and they never deliver.

126
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,434
so, what?
you want me to go?

127
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,901
no.

128
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,414
i just -- i just question
your priorities.

129
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:13,835
that's all.

130
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,744
hey, if you think i'm being
irresponsible, jt say so.

131
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,124
hey, we'll set you up
outside.

132
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,247
i'll call down to pediatrics,
let them know you're here.

133
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,044
great. thanks, malcolm.

134
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,405
i got to go.

135
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:29,904
you gonna come by later
and hear me play?

136
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,383
yeah, if i can.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,889
so, i understand
you're from out of town.

138
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,668
yes.
florence, arizona.

139
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:46,577
and we're here visiting
my husband's family.

140
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:49,160
how long
have you been married?

141
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,595
it'll be two years
this spring.

142
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,180
is this
your first pregnancy?

143
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,707
yes.

144
00:07:57,438 --> 00:07:59,613
and... have you...

145
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:02,525
have you picked out a name ?

146
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,260
- Sean.
- Oh, that's nice.

147
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,330
tell me, melissa,
have you experienced

148
00:08:07,398 --> 00:08:08,965
any other discomfort
during your pregnancy --

149
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:10,433
morning sickness,
spotting?

150
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:11,548
no.

151
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:15,383
actually, everything's been
pretty easy up until this trip.

152
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,789
were you working
when you got pregnant?

153
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,574
yes. i was waitressing
when i met richard.

154
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:24,636
we started dating.

155
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,840
we went on this whirlwind trip
around europe.

156
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:31,135
we got married
at the hotel cipriani.

157
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,190
- That's in venice.
- Yes.

158
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:34,848
it's a beautiful hotel.

159
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,364
isn't it?

160
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:38,328
And...

161
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:40,805
well, a month later...

162
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,457
we both wanted
a big family.

163
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,485
i come from one.
richard's an only child.

164
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,088
- Is richard on his way here?
- Yes.

165
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:54,232
they called him from the e.r.
and left him a message.

166
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:55,993
he'll be here soon.

167
00:08:58,902 --> 00:09:01,218
can you hold on a minute?
the --

168
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:03,584
excuse me.

169
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,980
- sure.
- i'll be back very soon.

170
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:07,666
becky,
hold on a minute.

171
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,636
the reception
is no good inside.

172
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:12,510
do you have any children?

173
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:16,637
oh, well, i'm -- i'm --

174
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,680
my husnd and i have talked
about it, of course,

175
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:22,050
and, uh, even though
the clock is ticking --

176
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:24,021
and it's ticking --

177
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:28,442
there just never seemed to be
the perfect time.

178
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:32,150
is he a doctor, too?

179
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,609
no. he's a...

180
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:35,657
musician.

181
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:39,341
oh, wow!
how wonderful!

182
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:40,276
what does he play?

183
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:43,582
the piano, jazz piano,
and he composes, too.

184
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,382
must be amazing
to have talent like that.

185
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:48,167
i wish i did.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,386
we've been playing beethoven
and bach sonatas for the baby.

187
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:55,042
oh, that's nice.

188
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,684
so, melissa...

189
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,693
do you have the name
of your ob-gyn at home

190
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:02,809
so we can get in contact
with him or her?

191
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,480
actually, it's richard,
my husband.

192
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,276
okay.

193
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,495
<u>he's got the whole world in his hands</u>

194
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:19,451
<u>he's got the whole wide world in his hands</u>

195
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,480
<u>he's got the whole world in his hands</u>

196
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:25,640
<u>he's got the whole world...</u>

197
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,042
<i>Thanks for not hanging up.</i>

198
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,484
<i>i'm outside in the garden area.</i>

199
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,481
<i>it's really nice.</i>

200
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:35,318
there's jasmine here, beck,

201
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:36,891
loads of it.

202
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:42,158
it's a bit like the isle
of wight. do you remember?

203
00:10:43,473 --> 00:10:46,955
you said you loved the smell
and you never wanted to leave.

204
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,804
rebecca, you know,
i was thinking...

205
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:57,735
it would be really nice
if you could stop by. We could...

206
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:03,505
<u>he's got the whole world in his hands</u>

207
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:06,832
<u>he's got the whole world in his hands</u>

208
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:11,420
<u>he's got you and me brother, in his hands</u>

209
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,132
<u>he's got you and me, brother, in his hands</u>

210
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,927
<u>he's got you and me, brother, in his hands</u>

211
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,139
<u>he's got the whe world
in his hands</u>

212
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,183
<u>he's got the whole world</u>

213
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:30,183
<u>in his ha-a-nds</u>

214
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:32,274
All right !

215
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:40,572
it's the perfect alibi.

216
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,298
what is?

217
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:45,010
well, having your husband
as your ob-gyn.

218
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:50,751
that's assuming
her husband actually exists.

219
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,203
it could be
just another delusion.

220
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:54,082
well,
we'll know soon enough.

221
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:56,840
dr. delusion
is on his way over here.

222
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,096
it's just so sad,

223
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:00,749
i mean, believing you're about
to give birth when you're not.

224
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,615
it's also incredible.

225
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:04,281
cessation
of the menstrual cycle,

226
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:06,007
abdominal enlargement,
breast enlargement,

227
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,118
quickening galactorrhea,

228
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,195
cervical softening,
uterine enlargement.

229
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:10,430
yeah,
but how is it possible

230
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:12,496
that the abdominal enlargement
is so massive?

231
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,422
excess bowel gas,
uterine distensi,

232
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:16,657
bladder retention.
could be aot of things.

233
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,488
but she's not gonna be able to
keep this up much longer.

234
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,651
Help !

235
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,212
Help !

236
00:12:21,846 --> 00:12:23,450
My water just broke !

237
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,088
Hey Melissa, feeling better ?

238
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:40,318
yes. thank you.

239
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:43,324
<i>I told you already !
i'm looking for my wife !</i>

240
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,596
oh, Richard !
oh, thank god you're here !

241
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,449
i'm so sorry.
are you okay?

242
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:52,165
yes.

243
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:55,649
She's fine now, mr. Ranier.
I'm dr. Hayden-Jones.

244
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,532
it's dr. ranier.
who's in charge here?

245
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,522
you're the idiot who put my wife
in the psych ward?

246
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:05,430
what the hell is wrong
with you people?

247
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,185
i want her transferred.

248
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:10,366
i need an sma 20,
cbcc, beta-hch,

249
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,680
and an abdominal
ultrasound stat!

250
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:17,129
why are you
just standing there?

251
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,228
my wife is seven months pregnant !

252
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:20,431
this baby could be in distress !

253
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:21,633
have you all lost your minds ?

254
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,909
i need to speak
to the hospital administrator.

255
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:30,600
now!

256
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:33,277
Good idea. I'll call her.

257
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:39,986
stay with them.

258
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:42,473
are you okay?
yes.

259
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:45,220
- Yes ? You feel all right ?
- I'm so glad you're here.

260
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:46,948
you look so beautiful.

261
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:55,772
no way.
this guy's legit.

262
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:59,869
Dr. Richard Ranier licensed physician
with an impeccable reputation.

263
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,466
i suppose it's possible
he never examined his own wife.

264
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,177
she told me she'd been
under his care exclusively.

265
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,049
she's allegedly had
regular checkups.

266
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:08,267
i mean,
she'even had amnio.

267
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,147
and we're absolutely sure
that she's not pregnant?

268
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,216
yes, carl, we're sure.

269
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:15,688
how could he have lied to her
for seven months?

270
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:17,225
probably kept her
pretty isolated.

271
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:19,289
so, now what?

272
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:20,422
well,
i'll tell you one thing,

273
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:22,360
he's not gonna let us
hold his wife without a fight.

274
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,014
so, don't fight it.

275
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:24,865
in a couple of months,

276
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,530
they'll figure out
the wholthing for themselves

277
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:27,881
without our interference.

278
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,285
it's not interference, carl.
it's called treatment.

279
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,517
just let them go!

280
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,330
Nice, carl, let her give birth,

281
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,199
raise the kid,
send it off to college,

282
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:38,126
and sit back and wait
for the imaginary grandkids.

283
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:42,631
oh. he's screaming his head off
and asking for you again.

284
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,176
Well, might as well
face the music.

285
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:49,036
pure folly
to keep this farce alive.

286
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,023
you're a gens, carl.

287
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,653
pure folly.
that's exactly what it is.

288
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,078
followy lead.

289
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:58,027
i'll follow you anywhere.

290
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,870
because
that very important person

291
00:14:59,953 --> 00:15:02,310
you weren't supposed to
piss off today...

292
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:03,828
that would be me.

293
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:12,077
i am so sorry for
all the confusion, dr. ranier.

294
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,663
i'm nora skoff,
departmental administrator.

295
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,596
we, of course,

296
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,932
welcome all visiting physicians
to whartonemorial,

297
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,751
and i promise
you will receive

298
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:22,404
the full measure
of our professional courtesy.

299
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,815
the maternity ward,
unfortunately, remains full.

300
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:27,348
are those her tests?

301
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,556
the, fetus does not appear
to be in distress,

302
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,901
and... i can assure you
that the birth is not imminent.

303
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,773
there's been no dilation.

304
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,256
well, the blood work
can't be right.

305
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,961
melissa said that you did
an ultrasound?

306
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:52,784
yeah. thank you.

307
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,429
whoever did this ultrasound
is a moron.

308
00:15:57,512 --> 00:16:00,222
the image is so blurred,
it's useless.

309
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:04,445
i-i personally did an ultrasound
on melissa just days ago.

310
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,568
I have it. Here it is.

311
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:12,095
okay.
there you go.

312
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:18,999
sweetheart, i am so sorry that
i couldn't get here earlie

313
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:22,944
it's okay. i'm fine.
the baby's fine.

314
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,524
i just --

315
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:28,752
i lost control
of my bladder,

316
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,045
and i thought
that my water had broken.

317
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:32,501
it happens.

318
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,874
sweetheart, there's no reason
to be ashamed.

319
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:37,475
come here.

320
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:41,082
it's a good thing
that your water didn't break.

321
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:46,103
it's too soon.
the baby is protected.

322
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,120
and there's no chance
for infection.

323
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:52,928
sean is healthy and happy.

324
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:57,907
what you need now is rest.

325
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,853
i'll make the arrangements
to take you home.

326
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,391
i'll be right back.

327
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,194
well, my wife
has had quite a scare,

328
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:22,038
but i know her very well,
and she's ready to travel now.

329
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,708
so, if you'll just give me
the release forms...

330
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,269
actually, we'd like
to keep her overnight

331
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:27,170
- Just as a precaution.
- No.

332
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,514
no, i've already put up with
what i consider to be

333
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:31,638
gross incompetence
on behalf of this hospital.

334
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:33,822
that ultrasound was shoddy.

335
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:35,602
You're absolutely right.

336
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:37,415
let's schedule another one
tomorrow morning.

337
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:38,914
and there are
liability issues.

338
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:41,448
i'm sure you can understand,
doctor.

339
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:44,530
fine.

340
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,441
fine. i'll do the ultrasound
myself...

341
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:47,710
Today.

342
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:52,540
excuse me.

343
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:03,594
may i?

344
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:07,434
i'd rather you didn't.
i'm expecting a call any minute.

345
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,156
no. i don't mind.

346
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,379
hey, honey.

347
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,633
i'm just taking
a quick lunch break.

348
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,694
how did the opening go?

349
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:21,672
that's great.

350
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:26,105
i miss you, too.
is it snowing there?

351
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,995
perfect. t weather's
always perfect here.

352
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:29,858
but it's not new york.

353
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,651
i know. i can't wait.

354
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:36,502
i got to go, too.
i'll call you later.

355
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:37,947
love you.

356
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:44,724
long-distance romance...
doomed to failure.

357
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,386
unless...

358
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,286
unless what?

359
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:52,209
you have a lot
of meaningless but hot sex

360
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:54,674
with skilled but
emotnally detached partners.

361
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,669
i'm available.

362
00:18:59,677 --> 00:19:01,503
arturo, seriously,

363
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,674
what do you think
is gonna happen here?

364
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:04,942
seriously,

365
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:07,501
i think that you're gonna come
to your senses and realize...

366
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,555
do you honestly believe

367
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:12,118
that you're the personal panacea
to my lesbianism,

368
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:14,857
that i'm suddenly gonna realize
i'm straight

369
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:17,069
and want to jump
on top of you?

370
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:18,226
Yeah.

371
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:19,236
One night.

372
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,172
that's all it'll take.
maybe two.

373
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:23,161
i can work with you
on that.

374
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:26,790
stand up.

375
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:29,372
stand up.

376
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,302
drop your pants.

377
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,346
i want to see it.

378
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,890
show me what i'm missing.
rock my world.

379
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:47,748
not that i'm shy, honey,

380
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:50,554
and god knows i had
no reason to be, but...

381
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,384
That would be
highly unprofessional.

382
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,380
Exactly. Unprofessional.

383
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,433
like you coming on to me
at every opportunity.

384
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,196
there.

385
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,967
there's the head.

386
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,268
it's beautiful.

387
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,734
melissa, look! look!

388
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,152
there's a hand.

389
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,664
healthy heartbeat.

390
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:51,634
healthy fetus.

391
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,961
okay.
get dressed.

392
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:56,612
we're leaving.

393
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:57,688
i'm sorry, doctor,

394
00:20:57,771 --> 00:21:00,612
but i can't allow your wife
to leave just yet.

395
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:03,066
you don't have
that authority.

396
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:04,557
i absolutely do.

397
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,251
- We're leaving.
- No, you're not.

398
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,118
Melissa's my wife,

399
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,018
Ok ?

400
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:12,115
you don't tell me
at to do!

401
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:14,697
melissa is your wife,
but this is my ward.

402
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,064
i say when
a patient's discharged.

403
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:31,040
security !

404
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:39,848
will he live ?

405
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:43,250
probably, but he's never gonna
play the trumpet again.

406
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:46,267
glad you guys
are enjoying this.

407
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,360
you did say he wouldn't leave
without a fight.

408
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:51,559
you're fine.
later, slugger.

409
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,720
doctor, that thing
you asked me about earlier.

410
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,524
the thing...

411
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:00,829
oh, no.
i'll... i'll find you.

412
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:07,825
security is holding him.
he's claiming self-defense.

413
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:09,911
yeah, right.

414
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:11,497
and just so
as we're clear,

415
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,055
if he hadn't sucker punched me,
i could ha taken him easy.

416
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:17,001
Jack, you can press charges.

417
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,769
no... no. come on.

418
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,306
the guy's got
enough problems.

419
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:21,441
you're right.

420
00:22:22,116 --> 00:22:23,346
<i>Folie à deux.</i>

421
00:22:23,414 --> 00:22:25,920
translation from the french,
"folly for two"...

422
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:27,635
"a rare
shared psychotic disorder

423
00:22:27,718 --> 00:22:29,231
"when an otherwise
healthy person,

424
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,023
- The secondary partner..."
- Melissa.

425
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:32,706
"...begins believing
the delusions

426
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,913
"of someone with whom they have
a close relationship,

427
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:36,312
- The primary partner..."
- Richard.

428
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,630
"...who is already suffering
from a psychotic disorder

429
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:39,991
with prominent delusions."

430
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:42,151
So, melissa believed
she was pregnant,

431
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:44,222
and he came to believe it,
as well?

432
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:46,037
other way around.
richard's the primary.

433
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,268
he convinced her she was
pregnant. he was her doctor.

434
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:51,175
so she had no reason
to question him. took the bait.

435
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,577
She's got a bun in the oven.

436
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,819
if richard's
the dominant partner,

437
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:58,347
then melissa's delusion's
more fragile.

438
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,961
easier to convince
that the baby's not there.

439
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:02,064
and with richard,
it's gonna be a lot more tricky.

440
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,215
but why?
what put this in motion?

441
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,697
melissa couldn't get pregnant,
so he just invented it?

442
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:10,577
that is exactly
the right question.

443
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:14,980
why don't you grab chloe
and do some digging?

444
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,281
i can't keep doing this.

445
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:04,973
i can't keep being here
and going home to denny.

446
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:06,283
you know that.

447
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:07,727
if you say so.

448
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:11,441
i really mean it
this time.

449
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:14,905
it's over.

450
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,966
you don't believe me,
do you?

451
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,389
no.

452
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:06,360
Dr. ranier quit hipractice
in phoenix seven months ago,

453
00:25:06,443 --> 00:25:08,640
presumably when he found out
his wife was pregnant.

454
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,718
he told everyone
that he wanted to spend

455
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,749
every moment with melissa
until she gave birth

456
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:15,068
to ensure the health
of their child.

457
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:16,476
according
to phoenix general,

458
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,096
the ultrasound richard gave you
is not two days old

459
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,010
but almost two years old.

460
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:23,052
so, this ultrasound...

461
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,331
It's not hers.

462
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,741
melissa told me and veronica
this was her first child.

463
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:29,089
but she also said
she got pregnant

464
00:25:29,172 --> 00:25:31,503
about a month
after her honeymoon,

465
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:34,203
which was
almost two years ago.

466
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:36,412
looks like whave
some more digging to do.

467
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,781
goody-goody.

468
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:50,167
hey, wendy.
how are you doing?

469
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:52,679
do you think
you might be able to

470
00:25:52,762 --> 00:25:54,677
put your head underwater
today?

471
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:15,990
Aquaphobic. Selachophobic.

472
00:26:16,528 --> 00:26:18,670
oh, i-i don't think so.

473
00:26:18,893 --> 00:26:20,548
well, that's okay.
that's okay.

474
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:22,205
you can always try again
tomorrow.

475
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:26,551
ultrasound taken
two years ago,

476
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:27,860
definitely hers.

477
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:28,839
she has a child?

478
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,069
it was never carried to term.
it was a molar twin.

479
00:26:31,152 --> 00:26:32,173
oh, god.

480
00:26:32,396 --> 00:26:34,033
when did you give melissa
the neuroleptic?

481
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:35,988
about an hour ago.
it should be working by now.

482
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:36,846
good.

483
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,188
well, when you're done here,
let's go have a chat with her.

484
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,971
Heard about
the <i>folie à deux.</i>

485
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:48,202
interesting, huh?
very.

486
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:51,419
spoke to nora about possibly
writing up a journal article.

487
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:54,074
it's good advertising
for the hospital.

488
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,151
Taking one for the team ?

489
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,786
Actually,

490
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,418
if i were the attending,

491
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,872
i might proceed
a little differently.

492
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,223
you see, the first thing i'd do
is i'd separate them.

493
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,629
the husband and the wife,

494
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:14,637
they're just finding
off of each other,

495
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,085
merging in their... mania.

496
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,288
under some circumstances,
you might be right,

497
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,555
but not this time.

498
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:25,534
well, you are in charge.

499
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:27,836
Yeah.

500
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:29,438
I'am.

501
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:41,951
Hi, melissa.

502
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:44,689
How are you feeling ?

503
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,363
sleepy.

504
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:49,354
And...

505
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,197
I'm a little warm.

506
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,471
that's the medication
we gave you.

507
00:27:53,554 --> 00:27:55,673
it's supposed to relax you
a little bit.

508
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:01,632
do you remember
when we asked you

509
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:04,016
if this was
your first pregnancy ?

510
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:07,821
yes.

511
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:11,144
actually...

512
00:28:12,987 --> 00:28:14,442
...there was another,

513
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:17,667
but i'd rather not
talk about it.

514
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:22,241
we know what happened,
melissa.

515
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:31,362
richard was so happy.

516
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,329
i got pregnant
right after we got married.

517
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:40,075
this isn't
his first marriage.

518
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:43,895
he tried with his ex-wife...

519
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,830
but she couldn't conceive.

520
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:56,914
you should have seen his face...

521
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:00,529
when the tests came back.

522
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:04,450
all his life,
he delivered babies.

523
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:05,782
Now...

524
00:29:07,332 --> 00:29:09,859
He's finally gonna have
one of his own.

525
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:21,160
i lost this baby, too,
didn't i?

526
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,264
this time...

527
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:29,117
there was no baby.

528
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:39,564
it's okay, melissa.

529
00:29:49,802 --> 00:29:51,716
Molar pregnancy.

530
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,875
It's pretty horrific.

531
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,806
two sperm fertilize
the same egg,

532
00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:59,087
producing one healthy fetus
and one mass of cells

533
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,397
without the genetic material
to form one.

534
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:04,344
and that mass of cells
growing quickly

535
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:07,547
can overwhelm the healthy fetus,
literally devouring it.

536
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:09,849
that would shake
anybody's world.

537
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:12,421
it unhinged richard.
that's for sure.

538
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:15,250
i'd say that's what
set all this in motion.

539
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:18,774
if his delusion is so deep-seated,
how are you gonna break it ?

540
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,085
i'll think of something.

541
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:26,160
why does that not give me
a warm and fuzzy feeling?

542
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:30,985
can you hang on
a minute?

543
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:36,125
rebecca, i'm inside.
i can't hear you.

544
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:47,678
damn it.

545
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:52,636
she's still calling.
you'll find her.

546
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,011
is my husband still being held
in security?

547
00:31:01,974 --> 00:31:03,195
yes, he is.

548
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:10,270
you know,
maybe you should press charges.

549
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,074
maybe he belongs in jail.

550
00:31:19,322 --> 00:31:21,053
look what he d to me.

551
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,701
he wasn't
just my husband.

552
00:31:27,523 --> 00:31:28,947
he was my doctor!

553
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:35,017
i mean, he knew i would believe
what he told me.

554
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:36,652
i'm so stupid.

555
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,815
i guesthat's what
he was depending on.

556
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,151
he's incapable
of depending on anything...

557
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,904
even his own mind.

558
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:49,689
he wants a baby
very badly.

559
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:57,690
and that's not
such a bad thing to want.

560
00:31:57,773 --> 00:32:00,274
he divorced his first wife

561
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:02,726
because she couldn't give him
what he wanted.

562
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:04,146
he married me...

563
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:07,845
A younger woman,

564
00:32:08,537 --> 00:32:10,624
A breeder,

565
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:13,472
'cause he was sure
i could do better.

566
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:15,720
he doesn't love me.

567
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:17,164
of course he does.

568
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:19,957
all this is just a product
of his disease.

569
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,983
to him, this all seems very,
very real.

570
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:25,435
no.

571
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:30,332
he doesn't love me.

572
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,471
he loves the baby more.

573
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:36,892
that's not true.

574
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,922
let me prove it to you.

575
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:09,458
i regret... no time for that now,
richard.

576
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:10,473
thank you.
it's okay.

577
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:11,697
melissa's
having contractions again,

578
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,100
and she's hypertensive.

579
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:14,909
the baby's in distress
and needs to come out now.

580
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:15,851
where is she?

581
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:18,434
she's in the o.r. being prepped
for an emergency c-section.

582
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:21,160
we have an anesthesiologist
and a surgeon on standby.

583
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:23,085
i presume you want to be present
at the delivery?

584
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,878
Yes. yeah, ye... of course.
I-i'll scrub in.

585
00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:30,576
you okay?

586
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:39,659
i'm gonna be a father.

587
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:48,025
why so happy, arturo?

588
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:49,997
dr. gallagher has invited us
to be present

589
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,998
at the delivery
of the ranier baby.

590
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:54,781
the imaginary
ranier baby?

591
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:56,465
yeah.
that's the one.

592
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,245
Well better i get going later.

593
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:19,582
are you aware
of what's abouto happen?

594
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,715
vaguely.

595
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:23,547
and you intend
to let him proceed?

596
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,526
for now.

597
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:27,771
have you anticipated what
the board's reaction will be to this

598
00:34:27,854 --> 00:34:28,934
Ill-conceived charade ?

599
00:34:29,017 --> 00:34:30,836
i dn't planned
on discussing it with the board.

600
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:31,902
are you suggesting
that i should?

601
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,007
undoubtedly,
someone will.

602
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:40,359
i'm trying to protect you,
nora.

603
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:43,691
ani appreciate that, carl.
thank you for your support.

604
00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:47,588
you put more than your reputation
on the line when you hired him.

605
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:50,826
- Whatever do you mean ?
- You know what i mean.

606
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:55,238
i seriously doubt you can handle
that kind of financial hit.

607
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:58,330
how did you find that out?

608
00:34:58,413 --> 00:34:59,859
do you honestly believe
thers anything

609
00:34:59,942 --> 00:35:03,041
going on in this hospital
that i don't know about?

610
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:06,847
i suppose not.

611
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:22,623
is that all?

612
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:24,571
no.

613
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:48,854
are we ready?

614
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,172
yes, doctor.

615
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,999
is the fetal
heart monitor on?

616
00:35:55,082 --> 00:35:56,332
yes, doctor.

617
00:35:57,742 --> 00:35:59,645
stabilized, 2 mics per kilo.

618
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,688
perhaps you'd like to make
the first incision.

619
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:38,198
<i>You're going to feel sleepy now.</i>

620
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:16,411
just wait.

621
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,993
we can't wait.
richard, the baby's in distress.

622
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,951
it needs to come out now.

623
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:30,270
<i>Check the heart monitor
and the fetal monitor.</i>

624
00:37:30,353 --> 00:37:31,957
something's not --
it's not right here.

625
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,855
this is what you wanted.
make the incision.

626
00:37:52,194 --> 00:37:53,061
no.

627
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:00,282
no, no, no, no.
please stop. just stop.

628
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,155
it's not right.
please.

629
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:25,396
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

630
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:27,544
It's okay. It's over now.

631
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,674
i would never
let anyone hurt you.

632
00:38:32,297 --> 00:38:33,365
Never.

633
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,604
I love you.

I love you, too.

636
00:38:49,836 --> 00:38:52,513
Dr. ranier
voluntarily committed himself?

637
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,098
He knows he's sick.

638
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:55,701
Worst part's over.

639
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:01,581
You aren't gonna
say anything ?

640
00:39:01,664 --> 00:39:02,604
About what ?

641
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:05,410
About the fact that you
booked a working o.r.

642
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,192
at the cost
of thousands of dollars

643
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,242
and were about to perform
an unauthorized c-section?

644
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:14,175
That you had real
surgical instruments in the room

645
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:16,046
and tried to put
a deadly weapon

646
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:18,594
in the hands
of a mentally ill person?

647
00:39:19,322 --> 00:39:20,339
No.

648
00:39:34,593 --> 00:39:36,078
I'm sorry i'm late.

649
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,874
I got something
i want you to listen to.

650
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:49,486
Is that new ?

651
00:39:50,816 --> 00:39:52,248
Wrote it for you.

652
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,639
<u>We talk about
social imperfections...</u>

653
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:00,525
Is... is everything okay, baby ?

654
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,140
God, denny.

655
00:40:09,223 --> 00:40:11,742
I-i...i don't know what to say. I...

656
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:15,023
I was so mad
when you came by today, and i...

657
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:19,666
and then i just saw you
with the kids, and...

658
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,642
they're great kids.

659
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,587
you know, maybe --

660
00:40:26,116 --> 00:40:29,176
I don't know, maybe we should
start having some of our own.

661
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,148
You'd make a great mom.

662
00:40:38,097 --> 00:40:43,894
<u>and it's me
that wants it all to be now</u>

663
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:46,401

664
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,777

- Who left this ?
- A lady.

671
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,315
She asked if you
were here and dropped it off.

672
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,722
- When ?
- A couple of minutes ago.

673
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,281
What was she wearing ?

674
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:12,232
Damn it, malcolm. this is important.
what was she wearing ?

675
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:15,143
I'm sorry. I was so bus
