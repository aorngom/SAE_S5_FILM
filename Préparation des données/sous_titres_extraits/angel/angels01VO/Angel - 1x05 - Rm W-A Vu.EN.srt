1
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,550
"I've had it with these
cheap trash bags.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,500
They leak and break
and end up costing us more."

3
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,379
- I believe it.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,789
It was a great audition.

5
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:20,800
I was all about things leaking.

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,570
How could they not pick me?

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,809
- They don't know what they missed.
- They gave it to a blond...

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,059
...in a skintight leather cat suit.
She's supposed to be a housewife.

9
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,380
She looked like Catwoman
taking out the cat-trash.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,880
- You gonna answer the phone?
- Good question.

11
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:38,799
Oh, yeah, right.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,090
- Angel Investigations,
- Machine got it.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,020
We help the helpless,
If that's you, leave a message,

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,759
Hey, Cordy, It's Aura,
I just wanted to check in...

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,920
...see how you're doing
and everything,

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,000
You would not believe what....

17
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,799
You don't want to talk to her?

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,179
Not just yet.

19
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:59,259
She's gonna ask me about where
I'm living, how the acting's going.

20
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,740
I'm just not up for leading
the parade of pain.

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,719
- I'll do it when things are better.
- I can't help with the acting.

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,329
- But about the apartment--
- What?

23
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:14,090
Well, if you ever want to spend
one night away from the place...

24
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,099
...maybe give me a call.

25
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:20,549
Well, stranger things have happened.

26
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,140
No, wait.

27
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:23,489
They really haven't.

28
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:27,010
I'll see you tomorrow.

29
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,579
Bye, Angel. I'm taking off.

30
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,959
She's really something, isn't she?

31
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,859
It's like wrestling a tiger
just to get to know her.

32
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,829
- Tell me stuff.
- What stuff?

33
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,640
About Cordelia.

34
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,120
Well, I know she can't type or file.

35
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,079
Till today, I had some hope
regarding the phone.

36
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,060
Who's Aura?

37
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,430
Oh, she's.... I think she's
one of Cordelia's group.

38
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,750
People called them "The Cordettes."

39
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,419
Girls from wealthy families.
They ruled the high school.

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,650
It was like the Soviet secret police,
if they cared a lot about shoes.

41
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,110
And she was the richest one of all,
because the way she talks...

42
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,939
...sounds like she had servants
made of solid gold.

43
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,979
Pretty much.
Till her parents lost it all.

44
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,080
- Riches to rags.
- That's one hell of a comedown.

45
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,370
But she's doing all right,

46
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,780
Ouch! Damn it!

47
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,490
Yeah, well. Of course.

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,819
Hi, this is Cordelia Chase
from apartment 4B.

49
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,949
I thought you were gonna have
the exterminator in here today.

50
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,460
Well, if he had,
wouldn't there be--?

51
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:37,960
Oh, my God!

52
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,800
Doyle. Doyle. Doyle. Doyle....

53
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,629
Hello, Doyle.

54
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,540
- You have the wrong place.
- You owe money.

55
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,779
It's all about money.

56
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,779
What about friendship, family
and priceless things...

57
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,639
...like they say
in the credit card commercial?

58
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,129
Oh, yeah, right.

59
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,779
You're a demon of focus.
I can see that.

60
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,050
I have your money right over here.

61
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,939
You're not stupid enough
to have a gun in there. Right?

62
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,490
Me? No way, man. Look!

63
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:45,769
All right, all right.

64
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:46,889
Oh, God, Angel.

65
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,889
It's so terrible. Oh, my gosh.

66
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:53,269
Don't even look at me.
I am such a mess.

67
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:55,110
I am the lowest of the lowest.

68
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,740
You're gonna want to get
my other suitcase out in the hall.

69
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,680
- What happened?
- My apartment.

70
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,160
It's like the barrio or...

71
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,569
...the projects or whatever.

72
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,199
And I live there.
I am a girl from the projects.

73
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,569
I don't know about that.

74
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,740
Get this. I tried to call Doyle--
I have sunk that low.

75
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,360
And there was no answer,
so here I am.

76
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,970
Not that you were the last resort,
but I had nowhere else to go.

77
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,139
Roaches.

78
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,000
Live ones, dead ones.
All skinny feet and creepy antlers.

79
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,230
- Antlers?
- Oh, my God.

80
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,449
I wonder how many are in that bag.

81
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,579
Also, the water is all brown
and spurty and not hot.

82
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,519
I am dying for a shower.
I actually smell.

83
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,769
Smell me. I never smell.

84
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,329
I didn't know I could.

85
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,009
I'll have to stay here until I find
a place, however long that takes.

86
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:53,310
When I do,
you're invited over.

87
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,199
You can just dump my stuff
on your couch...

88
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,129
...or let me have the bed,
whatever you feel good about.

89
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,970
My suitcase is still out in the hall.

90
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,319
Your shower's in here, right?
Do you have mousse?

91
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,000
Of course you do.

92
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,300
- Angel, you around?
- Hey, Doyle.

93
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,060
You ever get that feeling
like you just can't shower enough...

94
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,610
...like you'll never be clean?

95
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:53,079
- You got peanut butter on the bed.
- Really?

96
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,149
I don't think so.

97
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,329
I'll look.

98
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,139
No, no, no, no, no.

99
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,620
Angel, how could you?

100
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,600
How could I what?

101
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:10,120
You know I was crazy about her.
I was wearing her down too.

102
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,480
But, no. Handsome, brooding
vampire guy has to swoop in...

103
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,949
...all sensitive mouth
and overhanging forehead.

104
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,040
How about leaving some scraps
for the homely-looking fellas?

105
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,529
Something's wrong with her place.
I was on the sofa.

106
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,389
That's okay, I suppose.

107
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,750
At some point in recent history,
you got peanut butter on the bed.

108
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,039
It's gross.
You'd better change the sheets.

109
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,350
I don't eat.

110
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,029
Then I don't even want to know
how it got there.

111
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,049
Hey, you're looking great.

112
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,360
I wouldn't know.
Man doesn't have a mirror.

113
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:52,269
Like it'd kill him
to not see himself?

114
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,710
I was wondering
if anybody called lately...

115
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,779
...maybe asking about me
or wanting my address?

116
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,059
Your cousin called...

117
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,299
...with one of those names
from your part of England.

118
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:08,039
- My part of England?
- Connor or Fergus-- Did he find you?

119
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,139
Yeah. He did, all right.

120
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,210
A little warning
might have been nice.

121
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,100
Give a fella a chance
to neat the place up.

122
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,230
Jeez, I only helped the guy
as a favor to you.

123
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,289
Maybe next time I won't bother.

124
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,080
You don't even have to
pick up the phone.

125
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,059
You just let Aura hang there.

126
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,419
Okay, here's an idea.

127
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,309
Give me a list of the people
you're too good to talk to.

128
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,210
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Just....

129
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,019
- You got a bruise on your hand.
- Badminton.

130
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:46,549
And the reason there's a wet towel
on my leather chair?

131
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,799
Thank you.

132
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:06,779
What are you doing?

133
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,919
I just wanted to see if he had
hardwood floors under here.

134
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,330
I might be here awhile.

135
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,809
The things you learn.

136
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:19,649
I had no idea Angel
was Queen of the Winter Ball.

137
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,940
Those are mine.

138
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,259
Tough stuff!

139
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:30,740
Your diploma's all burned.

140
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:33,740
Yeah. It was a rough ceremony.

141
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:36,389
Yeah.

142
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,220
There it is.

143
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,159
My whole life, pre-here.

144
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:43,370
Five trophies,
with some of the shiny worn off.

145
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,279
It's good you can look back.

146
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,750
- I never look back.
- At what?

147
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:48,919
Doyle.

148
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,460
Is he down here? There you are.

149
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,580
A big guy's here to see you.

150
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:56,110
- I'll tell him you'll be right up.
- Okay, great.

151
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:09,320
It's not nice to trick people.

152
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,220
You gonna tell me what's going on?

153
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,029
You don't even know
who the demon's collecting for.

154
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,730
Here's how it works.

155
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:22,200
I owe some people,
other people owe me.

156
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:26,360
I do a favor, the debt goes away.
It's a system of checks and balances.

157
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,759
Some of your checks didn't balance.

158
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:30,490
Well, it'll work out.

159
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,360
It just takes a little diplomacy.

160
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:35,470
The kind of thing you're
so good at, actually. Maybe...

161
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,340
...you could take a crack at it.

162
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:38,860
We all have problems.

163
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,779
At the moment, I have
a bigger one than you do.

164
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,039
- Bigger than a Kailiff demon?
- Much.

165
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:47,220
You can help me with mine,
and I can help you with yours.

166
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:51,340
I don't know, man.
I mean, what's your problem exactly...

167
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,080
...because vampire business is....

168
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,730
Hi.

169
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,379
I was wondering
if you had any linoleum glue...

170
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,740
...for if it started
curling up all over.

171
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:06,490
I'll be there soon.

172
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:08,929
Okay.

173
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:13,620
Find her an apartment,
and I'll deal with your demon.

174
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,240
I wish you'd let me call my guy.

175
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,850
He probably judges
the property value...

176
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,879
...on how far the bus ride is
to the track.

177
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:26,139
It can't get any worse than this.

178
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,370
You can't tell from the hallway.

179
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,200
Hey, you're right.
You know what I smell in here?

180
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,029
Potential.

181
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,360
The next one'll be better.

182
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:46,649
It's like a community.

183
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,120
We share all the upkeep and chores.

184
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,899
My urination hasn't been
public enough lately.

185
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,129
We don't believe in barriers.

186
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:56,460
It's the first rule
of the Great Leader.

187
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,929
You can come to meetings.
Mornings at 5.

188
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,070
Okay. That's just a touch
too early for me.

189
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:05,490
Oh, you'll be up.
The chanting starts at 4.

190
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,419
So, you a single gal?
Gonna be living here alone?

191
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,159
I'm right across the hall.

192
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,929
You can sleep easy knowing...

193
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,700
...I'm the only other soul
with a key to that door.

194
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,779
You think about that
while you look, okay?

195
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,169
Okay, just out of curiosity,
you say you know a guy?

196
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:33,019
What is it with you and Angel?
You do everything the hard way.

197
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,940
Oh, my gosh. Have you ever seen
anything so beautiful?

198
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:16,649
No. Never.

199
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,299
It's perfect.

200
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,990
Really, really, it's just perfect.

201
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,250
It's amazing in there.

202
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:38,389
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing's wrong with it.

203
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,100
The previous tenant
just broke their lease.

204
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,190
I don't know how you heard about it.

205
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,419
It's quite a bargain.
And the furniture comes with.

206
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:48,980
Do you think you want it?

207
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,090
I used to have this. I was--

208
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,440
- I guess it's your lucky day.
- I used to have those too.

209
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,570
- Yeah, she'll take it.
- I'll fill out the rental forms.

210
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,220
First thing, I hire someone
to take out that wall.

211
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,330
- I thought it was perfect.
- And part of it being perfect...

212
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,940
...is there being one tiny flaw
for me to fix.

213
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,799
Must be why you find me
so fascinating.

214
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,129
Oh, my gosh. I love my apartment!

215
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,940
Your guy found the perfect place.
I love your guy!

216
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:22,929
It's a pretty good day's work for us.

217
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,730
I take care of your problem...

218
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,549
...Angel takes care of mine.
Things are pretty sweet.

219
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,049
Yes! I can move right in.

220
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,629
- My name's Angel. What's yours?
- Screw you.

221
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:56,159
My name's Angel. What's yours?

222
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,710
- Griff.
- Good start. Who do you work for?

223
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,360
He never gave me his card.

224
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,519
I don't know his name.

225
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:11,580
- You can get a message back to him?
- Yeah.

226
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,240
- You're letting me go?
- I'm letting you up.

227
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,070
- You were sent to collect for Doyle?
- At first.

228
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,259
But I'm not seeing any money.

229
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,610
So now Doyle gets dead.
A message for the others.

230
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,659
And your boss never gets his money.

231
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:32,440
Expensive message,
with what he's paying you.

232
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:34,139
My fees are competitive.

233
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,309
I can get Doyle to pay you.
You have my guarantee.

234
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:41,019
I saw what I saw, right?

235
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,580
You're a vampire.

236
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,629
How come you're helping
some demon half-breed7.

237
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,529
It's a good offer.
You should take it.

238
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:56,200
On the other hand,
you're making me want to fight.

239
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,769
You get lucky,
you might last 10 minutes.

240
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,090
Really lucky, and you're unconscious
for the last five.

241
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:08,579
You get Doyle to pay, and he's safe.

242
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:09,680
Thanks.

243
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:12,970
Good meeting.

244
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:47,509
What do you think you're doing
here? You never should have come,

245
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,509
I have to pay?

246
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,079
Man, I should have
just handled this myself.

247
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:01,200
I don't have the money.
You can't get blood out of a stone.

248
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,119
They can get blood out of you.

249
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,589
There's a price on your head.
They weren't looking for money.

250
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:15,069
Thanks, man.
You probably saved my life.

251
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,650
Can I ask you something?

252
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:22,490
- Why do you live like this?
- Well, what's wrong with it?

253
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,170
Yeah, well...

254
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,670
...I guess it's the kind of life...

255
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,630
...that keeps your expectations
from getting too high.

256
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,230
- Seems like you'd understand.
- I do.

257
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:39,750
Yeah.

258
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:42,539
I don't know why
it's important to you.

259
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:45,400
This kind of life sort of picked me.

260
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,329
You don't have to do it this way.

261
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,200
- What happened?
- Don't worry about it.

262
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:53,549
And things aren't all gloom
in Doyle City.

263
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:58,210
I mean, there's bright spots.
Like Cordelia.

264
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:00,890
I mean, she loves
that new place so much, man.

265
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,500
She's gonna be grateful
for a long time.

266
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,960
I knew this was too good to be true.
I knew it.

267
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:33,660
I'm from Sunnydale!
You're not scaring me, you know!

268
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,930
You're not scaring me.

269
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,750
You're not scaring me...

270
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,339
...one bit.

271
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,529
Bright, shiny morning.

272
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,680
Nothing bad here.

273
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,460
You know what? I get it.

274
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,769
You're a ghost. You're dead.
Big accomplishment. Move on!

275
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,279
You see a light anywhere?

276
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,640
Go towards it. Okay?

277
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:55,900
Cold wind. Scary.

278
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,799
What are you gonna do,
chap me to death?

279
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,109
What else you got?

280
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,559
Cordelia, you in there?

281
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:07,170
Cordelia?

282
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,170
Cactus. It's a housewarming present.

283
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,259
Hi. Thanks.

284
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,940
I'm still getting it
the way I want it.

285
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:22,019
Maybe in a few days.

286
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,490
The place looks great.
You worry too much.

287
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,609
But what did you have
against that chair?

288
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,680
Oh, right, you can't come in.

289
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,650
Wait. What about the rule?

290
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:35,430
You said when you got a place,
I was invited over.

291
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:38,819
I didn't have a place then.
The rules are getting screwed up!

292
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:41,470
- Don't touch that!
- I'm closing these...

293
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,329
...so our boss doesn't
burst into flames. Okay?

294
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,900
Yeah. I guess.

295
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,309
It's nice.

296
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,269
How about a tour?

297
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,579
The kitchen, living room.
I'll knock out that wall.

298
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:58,440
- Thanks for the cactus.
- How can you afford this?

299
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,250
I bet you want lunch.
There's a place down the street--

300
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,529
That thing's been doing that
all morning.

301
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,680
I think the mantle is uneven.

302
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:19,589
It lunged at me.

303
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:22,619
What's going on?

304
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,230
Okay, you're right.
It's not the mantle.

305
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,599
It's a very, very bad trophy.

306
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:36,740
- Dear sweet....
- Come on.

307
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,309
I'm not giving up this place.

308
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,180
- It's haunted.
- It's rent-controlled!

309
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:44,500
- It says, "Die."
- Maybe it's not done yet.

310
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:48,700
Maybe it's "Diet." That's friendly,
if a little judgmental, sure.

311
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,740
I am not giving it up.
It's perfect and beautiful.

312
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,009
It's so me. I need it.

313
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,059
It's just a place.

314
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:58,579
- You're more than that.
- How? How am I more than that?

315
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:01,509
We could cleanse it.
We could try. Can't we?

316
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,670
Put the ghost to rest.

317
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,119
- Can we?
- We can try.

318
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,900
- We'll figure it out at the office.
- Okay.

319
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:12,099
Listen good, Casper!
You haven't won a thing!

320
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:15,240
I'll die before I give up
this apartment! I'll die!

321
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,880
All right, dear,
If that's what you think is best,

322
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,269
A lot here about the building.

323
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,509
- Construction bids, inspections--
- We need people who lived there.

324
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:30,259
And died there.
The ingredients for ghosts.

325
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:32,880
Yeah. This isn't easy, you know.

326
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:39,480
You know, this really
is just a place to live.

327
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:42,509
No, it's more. It's beautiful.

328
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,859
- And if it goes away, it's like--
- Like what?

329
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:49,359
- Like I'm still getting punished.
- Punished?

330
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,309
- For what?
- I don't know.

331
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,660
For how I was. For everything
I said in high school...

332
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,140
...because I could get away with it.

333
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,779
And then it all ended,
and I had to pay.

334
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,740
But this apartment--
I could be me again.

335
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,740
Punishment over.
Welcome back to your life.

336
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,299
Like I couldn't be that awful
if I get a place like that.

337
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:14,029
It's just like you.

338
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,009
Working for redemption.

339
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,400
No, because you had that mansion.

340
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,809
I found something.

341
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,700
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a death.

342
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,450
First person to live in your place,
Maude Pearson.

343
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,289
- How'd you get it?
- Pearson Arms...

344
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,990
...is carved over the entrance.

345
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,400
I checked the obits for Pearson.
We got lucky.

346
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:36,720
Maude Pearson built the place
and took a unit there.

347
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,490
In 1946, she died of a heart attack...

348
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,640
...in Cordelia's living room
at age 57.

349
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:45,799
That's it! That's her.

350
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,319
It's not a violent death.

351
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,710
- Ghosts are usually--
- I know it's her.

352
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,779
The place has that weird
little-old-lady smell...

353
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:54,660
...like violets and Aspercreme.

354
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:58,500
They didn't find her for 3 weeks,
so it wasn't violets at the end.

355
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,009
This is easy.
Little-old-lady ghost...

356
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:03,579
...hanging around because
she left the iron on.

357
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,839
Get a cleansing spell and do it.

358
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,720
It's not easy.
Hawthorn berries, lungwort and bile.

359
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:11,460
I can't get everything.

360
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,609
I can. I know this guy in Koreatown,
does these spells all the time.

361
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,089
Goody. One of Doyle's guys.

362
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,349
Is this the same guy
that helped me find...

363
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,539
...my poltergeist-elicious apartment?

364
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,559
Doyle, go. Get what you need.

365
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:34,849
I'm gonna try to get more information.
Maybe Kate can find something.

366
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:40,500
How come Patrick Swayze's
never dead when you need him?

367
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,910
Angel Investigations,
We help the hopeless,

368
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,279
If that's you, leave a message,

369
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,259
Cordelia, are you there?

370
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,269
I think we can end this thing,

371
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,119
I'm here. About time you called.
You got something?

372
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,589
Meet me at your apartment,
We'll figure out what to do,

373
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,650
Okay.

374
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,950
Cordelia, I'm in the bedroom.

375
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:29,279
Angel?

376
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,470
You got my call.

377
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,119
Poor thing.

378
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,900
You just don't fit in
around here, do you?

379
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,359
Oh, too bad you wouldn't
leave my son alone.

380
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,690
Your son?

381
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:07,890
- I wish I could be more help.
- It's okay.

382
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,349
Just knowing things
that didn't happen is a help.

383
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,140
- Now you're talking like a detective.
- I am one.

384
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,700
The thing about detectives is,
they have résumés...

385
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,170
...business licenses and last names.

386
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:23,829
- Pop stars and popes have one name.
- I'm a pope.

387
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:29,410
Here you go.

388
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,829
Davis, you are beautiful. Thank you.

389
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,059
Let's take a look.

390
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,009
I didn't know you had
records that old.

391
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,339
Me neither. Let's see.

392
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:44,119
There was an investigation
into the death.

393
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:52,410
This guy, Detective Randall,
thought the death was suspicious.

394
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,170
The M.E. called it a heart attack...

395
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:57,750
...but there were problems
with the son, Dennis Pearson.

396
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,380
- He lived with her. They argued a lot.
- What about?

397
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,779
A girl. His fiancée.
Mom didn't like her.

398
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:12,599
Dennis skips town with her the day
Mom dies. What a coincidence.

399
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,250
- Cops never caught him.
- Unavenged murder.

400
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,430
- Sounds like.
- But no other deaths in the apartment.

401
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,779
You saw me check. No murders.
Not even domestic dispute calls.

402
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,920
No, not murders. Suicides.

403
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:29,299
There's a kind of killer
that does that.

404
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:31,880
Makes it look like a suicide.

405
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,000
There are always signs.

406
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,049
There.

407
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,309
Margo Dressner, 1959.

408
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,710
And Jenny Kim, 1965.

409
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:50,730
Natalie Davis, 5 years ago.

410
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:53,049
All in the same apartment.

411
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,859
I've gotta make a call.

412
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,329
Angel Investigations.

413
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,160
We hope you're helpless.

414
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,769
- Wait--
- It's me. Put Cordelia on.

415
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,740
She's not here.
Hang on, there's a message.

416
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,359
Are you there?

417
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,990
We can end this thing,

418
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,880
I'm here, About time
you called, You got something?

419
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,309
Meet me at your apartment,
We'll figure out what to do,

420
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,220
That's not me.

421
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,029
Whoever you think you're talking to,
it's not me. My name is Cordelia.

422
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,079
Oh, that's the name of a cheap,
small-town tramp...

423
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,789
...trying to sound better than she is.

424
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:49,519
You're not good enough for my boy.
This will never be your home.

425
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,839
This is my home.
My friends will come here.

426
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,789
You don't have friends.

427
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:58,200
Why would anyone care about you?
Nobody really cares.

428
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,920
You don't deserve to live here.

429
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:04,059
You don't deserve anything.

430
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,839
We were right about the ghost.
It's Mrs. Pearson.

431
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,630
- Her son killed her.
- A murder victim?

432
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,609
Filled with rage and confusion.
That's why she's been killing people.

433
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,480
That's a pretty strong ghost.

434
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:23,190
Bile. I should've got more bile.

435
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,049
I will leave. Please.

436
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:28,630
Oh, I don't think so.

437
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,019
- You're worthless.
- No.

438
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,380
You've never been kind or smart.

439
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,470
You're a user. You're nothing.

440
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,859
Everyone would be glad
if you were dead.

441
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,769
- No.
- Oh, come on.

442
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,160
If anyone really cared about you,
would you be here?

443
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:49,339
People let you end up here because
they were happy to see you fail.

444
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,890
I got her. Okay. All right.

445
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,289
The furniture and the wall
and the blood.

446
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,289
She's doing it. She's doing it all.

447
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:12,180
She'll be back.
She's stronger than us.

448
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,880
She knows me.

449
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,730
- We can stop her.
- No. No, we can't stop her.

450
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,599
She's made a connection with you.

451
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,279
She thinks you're someone
she blames for her murder.

452
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,500
- Answer me.
- I'm, I'm....

453
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,759
I'm taking her son away.
She thinks I'm taking her son.

454
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,490
That's good. Her son killed her.

455
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,259
You're playing a role in her delusion.
You can stop her.

456
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,039
Start the binding circle.
I'll find the spell.

457
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,609
"Bring the truth into the light.

458
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:52,619
Let it be revealed that the soul
can take its place in eternity."

459
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,109
She's coming!
She knows what we're doing!

460
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,440
- We need Cordelia now.
- Cordy, get up!

461
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,380
Cordelia, stand in the circle!
Strike at its center!

462
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,759
What?

463
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,319
You know what it means.
She's in contact with you.

464
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:18,890
They don't care about you.
They want you to fail.

465
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:22,059
- You're a whore with no money.
- Doyle, chant.

466
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,299
Oh, man, Latin! One of those dead
languages you always mean to learn!

467
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:29,259
V sounds like W.
Say each vowel separately.

468
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,829
You do know what to do.
You can stop all this.

469
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,200
I can't.

470
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,160
Look at you.
You're gonna let her do this to you?

471
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,950
Damn it! You're Cordelia Chase.

472
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,329
Are you just gonna lie there?
Get off your ass! Be tough!

473
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,630
I can't, I can't!

474
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,849
You can be the biggest pain.
Do it now!

475
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:56,049
- This won't work.
- It's getting dodgy here!

476
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:00,750
We gotta get her out of here.
This isn't safe.

477
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,849
Nobody's going anywhere.

478
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,259
- What's this?
- You were gonna let him pay.

479
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,809
I lied.

480
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:21,279
No more people!

481
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,099
- What is this?
- Ignore her. It's just a ghost.

482
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:27,140
Get out!

483
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,599
You broke it!

484
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,140
I'm gonna pay!
I got it in my wallet!

485
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,140
This is my house.

486
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,380
Knives!

487
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:23,500
I'll leave.
I'm sorry your son killed you.

488
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,900
You can have the apartment.
Just let me go.

489
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,530
- It's too late for that.
- No.

490
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,320
You know what happens next.

491
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,130
Your friends are dirty.

492
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,210
They ruined my nice home.

493
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,090
I knew you were trouble
from the start.

494
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,530
I'm surprised
that my son didn't smell...

495
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:51,000
...the stench of poverty
and failure on you.

496
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,050
I can.

497
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,269
I'm sorry.

498
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,500
You better be sorry,
you stupid little bitch.

499
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,920
I'm a bitch.

500
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,739
Take off the bed sheets.
Make a noose.

501
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,829
Go on.

502
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:11,360
It'll all be over soon.

503
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:18,449
I'm not a sniveling, whiny,
little cry-Buffy.

504
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:21,880
I'm the nastiest girl
in Sunnydale history.

505
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,420
I take crap from no one.

506
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,829
You're going to make yourself
a noose and put it around--

507
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,780
Back off, Polygrip!

508
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,239
You think you're bad?

509
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,780
All mean and haunty...

510
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,059
...picking on poor, pathetic Cordy?

511
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,670
Well, get ready to haul your wrinkly,
translucent ass out of this place...

512
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:47,960
...because, lady, the bitch is back.

513
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,780
Do you think I'm going to take that
from trash like you?

514
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,730
I'll tell you what I think.

515
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,199
You're gonna pack
your little ghost bags...

516
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,019
...and get the hell out of my house!

517
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:25,630
What happened? You did it.

518
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,780
Yeah, well, she pissed me off.

519
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,250
Well, maybe you found her center.

520
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,860
Cordy, what's wrong?

521
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,639
Cordelia!

522
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:12,539
Look what you're making me do, Dennis.

523
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,619
Mom, stop it.

524
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,599
How you gonna leave now, huh?

525
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:19,239
How you gonna marry
that streetwalker now?

526
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,360
You are nothing without me.

527
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,480
Mom, don't do this, please.

528
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,559
This is crazy.

529
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,679
Mom? I can't breathe.

530
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:36,539
Please! Let me out!

531
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:40,619
Please, Mom, I'll be good!
I won't leave you! I promise!

532
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:42,010
Mom, please!

533
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:49,380
This hurts me more than it hurts you.

534
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:51,960
Goodbye, Dennis.

535
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,769
Dennis, I presume.

536
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,289
Probably not too happy
with his mum.

537
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,960
Dennis, it was for your own good.

538
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,079
I had to do it.

539
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,389
She would've made your life
miserable. I'm sorry.

540
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,630
Please! Please!

541
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:36,820
I knew I didn't like that wall.

542
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:48,539
There.

543
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,199
Safe as houses.

544
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,630
You're gonna live like this?

545
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,579
Adding a dead bolt won't have
a huge effect on my life.

546
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,210
You know what I mean.

547
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:00,710
Well, there might be
misunderstandings...

548
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:02,550
...that sort of thing.

549
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:08,159
- You know I'll help you out.
- For which I'm grateful.

550
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,760
But sooner or later,
I'll need to hear it.

551
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,780
- Hear what?
- The story of your life.

552
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,050
And quite a tale it is.

553
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,849
Full of ribald adventures,
beautiful damsels with loose morals.

554
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:23,369
Doyle.

555
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,739
I will.

556
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,349
Just give me time.

557
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,699
The past don't let go, does she?

558
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,130
She never does.

559
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,170
God, Aura, I can't believe
I've missed your calls.

560
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,059
It's that incompetent girl at work.

561
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,940
But things are going great.

562
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:54,920
My new apartment, for one thing.
Celebrities are on top of me.

563
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:59,190
Steve Paymer, that's Dave Paymer's
brother, lives right down the hall.

564
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,349
You'd know him if you saw him.

565
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,989
And my view, it's amazing.

566
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,170
Yeah, I have a roommate.
But I never see him.

567
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,340
Hey, hey, Phantom Dennis.
Put that back.

568
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,570
All in all, it's working out great.

569
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,130
Dennis, when I am on the phone,
that's quiet time.

570
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:22,949
Thanks.

571
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,989
Sorry. So where were we?

572
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,920
Who's wearing what in Sunnydale?

573
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,800
No! Well, she never
did have any taste.

574
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,320
She's so nasty,
