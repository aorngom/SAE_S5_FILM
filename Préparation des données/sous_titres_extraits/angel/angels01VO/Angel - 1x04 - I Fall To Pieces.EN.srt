1
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,289
Ugh, look at all these bills.

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,199
Water and power.

3
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,760
Oh, and my perennial
favorite, the rent.

4
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,039
What am I missing?

5
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:22,839
- Not a thing that I can see.
- Doyle, try to pay attention.

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,140
I am paying attention, princess.

7
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,140
We just need the income
to pay for the outgo.

8
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:31,140
This is a business.
We need to start running it like one.

9
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,390
We should be charging.
Angel works day and night...

10
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,679
...to help people
fight personal demons...

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,520
...but I need a raise.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,320
You've worked for him for 20 minutes.

13
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,140
A month. And I have needs.

14
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:47,049
- Needs.
- A person needs certain...

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,000
...designer...

16
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:50,450
...things.

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,700
I don't think you need much clothes.

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,990
But you are right,
Angel needs to start charging.

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,950
He just hates bringing up
finances with clients.

20
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,320
He likes playing the hero...

21
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,099
...walking off into the dark,
his long coat flowing behind him...

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,930
...in that mysterious
and attractive way.

23
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,349
- Is this a private moment?
- No, I'm not saying I'm attracted.

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,890
He just projects
a certain kind of image.

25
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,189
Asking for money isn't part of it.
He's sensitive about that.

26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,939
Here he comes.
We're gonna stand up to him.

27
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,109
We're standing up.

28
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,930
Just as soon as he's had his coffee.

29
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,200
Right.

30
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,319
- Good morning.
- Morning.

31
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,849
- What is this?
- Last week's coffee.

32
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,579
- Think of it as espresso.
- I think my esophagus is melting.

33
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,620
Sure been making us proud
fighting the evil and all.

34
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:47,590
You've been fantastic,
saving people left and right--

35
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:51,319
- I'm not comfortable asking for money.
- Then get over it!

36
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,620
I mean that in a sensitive way.

37
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,040
It's not your favorite thing,
but you gotta do what's right.

38
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,150
It's right to ask people
in trouble for money?

39
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,739
No.

40
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,819
- So we agree?
- No.

41
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,519
- We don't agree?
- Make up your mind, will you? Doyle!

42
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,250
Uh-oh. Vision fit approaching.

43
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,060
Pen. Paper.

44
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,400
- A single malt Scotch.
- Here.

45
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,439
What'd you see?

46
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,900
Melissa Burns,
at Pardell Paper Products.

47
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,310
- How'd she look?
- Melissa Burns.

48
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,719
Better than me.

49
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,620
This ain't single malt. It's...

50
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,000
...polymalt.

51
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,310
Okay, Pardell Paper Products,
200 Wilshire Boulevard.

52
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,439
Guess I'm going to work.

53
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,879
Maybe I'm a little attracted.

54
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,400
I clearly said Penny!

55
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,310
I spelled it with letters.

56
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,659
It's okay, I'll fix it.
Here, you do these.

57
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,259
Aha! Perfect.

58
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,870
- Okay, light them.
- Okay, I'm lighting.

59
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,960
Great.

60
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,659
- What about the "J"?
- What's going on?

61
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,229
Happy birthday!

62
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,139
Oh, this is so sweet.
You've only been here a month...

63
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,810
...and already you know
four of the letters of my name.

64
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,480
Well, it's just we thought
you should be Penjy from now on.

65
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,850
We think it suits you better.

66
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,709
- Make a wish already.
- Okay, all right, wait.

67
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,980
Yeah!

68
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,860
I painted the pot myself,
so feel free to break it by accident.

69
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,769
Don't be silly. Thanks.

70
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,189
Check it out. My little
philodendron just got upstaged.

71
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,470
I don't know anybody
with taste that good.

72
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,160
Oh, right you are.
They're for Melissa.

73
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,769
- Who they from?
- I don't know.

74
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,269
Delivery guy from Ned's Flowers.

75
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,019
Something wrong?

76
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,420
No.

77
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,769
No one ever sends me flowers.

78
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,250
- Would you watch my phones?
- Oh, sure, honey.

79
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,420
Melissa.

80
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,519
I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to startle you.

81
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,560
- I thought you were someone else.
- You all right?

82
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,149
Yes.

83
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,600
- I'm Angel. I'm in private security.
- Excuse me?

84
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,149
It's what I do.

85
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,240
It's my job.

86
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,920
You walk around garages
telling people this?

87
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,360
I think you may need my services.

88
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,750
- I can't afford private security.
- It's not about money. I help people.

89
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,860
- Sometimes when the police can't.
- Out of goodness?

90
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,829
- I'm not explaining this very well.
- No, but thanks.

91
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,829
If you need anything,
call that number.

92
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:31,639
I scared her,

93
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,649
Seems like she was already scared.

94
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,000
Hey, am I intimidating?
I mean, do I put people off?

95
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,509
As vampires go, you're pretty cuddly.

96
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,069
You might think about mixing up
the black-on-black look.

97
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,000
Maybe she'd feel safer talking to you.

98
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,509
When she hires us, I'll get involved.

99
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,240
Cordelia's right.

100
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,620
I don't think so. I got a feeling
we should get involved now.

101
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,100
- This shouldn't be about money.
- It isn't.

102
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,779
Yeah, you should listen to--
It isn't?

103
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,639
It's about doing what's best
for those you've helped.

104
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,600
People get attached
to a mysterious savior...

105
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,160
...and can you blame them?

106
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,790
But as long as you're a man
who's doing a job and getting paid...

107
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,160
...they'll feel like they've paid their
debt and move on, independent-like.

108
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,959
You're a lot smarter than you look.

109
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,420
Of course, you look like a retard.

110
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,000
It won't work.

111
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,470
I changed your pin number.

112
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,990
I mean, your birthday? That's
the first thing a thief would try.

113
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,120
What are you doing here?

114
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,519
I changed it to 3-5-99.

115
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:51,490
The day we met.

116
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,310
- You have to stop doing this.
- Stop looking after you? Why?

117
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,009
What do you want?

118
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,079
I just want you to be
happy and healthy, silly.

119
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:03,480
Speaking of, are you losing weight?

120
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,430
I think it's the tranquilizers.

121
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,329
How many did you take
in the bathroom at work, three?

122
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,529
- How do you know--?
- To be honest...

123
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:14,350
...they don't help with the anxiety.

124
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,350
Now, I prescribed
a calcium selenium supplement.

125
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,160
Did you take it?

126
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,959
No, you threw it in the drawer
the minute you got home.

127
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:24,939
These are for your own good.

128
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,589
Why can't you just leave me alone?

129
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,139
How can people in love
leave each other alone?

130
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,700
In love?

131
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,230
Ronald, we had one date.

132
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:39,230
Honey, honey, don't get upset.

133
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,620
I take commitment pretty seriously,
and I know you do too.

134
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,870
Did you have a rough day
at work, is that it?

135
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,830
Surgery. I have to run.

136
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,200
Oh, don't forget
your money, sweetheart.

137
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,730
I'll see you tonight.

138
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,980
Angel Investigations.
We help the hopeless.

139
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,120
I'd say right away.

140
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,200
She's coming in.

141
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,340
I gotta change my shirt.

142
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,659
It's been going on about seven months.

143
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:29,570
It wasn't so bad at first.

144
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:30,799
What's his name?

145
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,289
Dr. Ronald Meltzer.
He's a neurosurgeon.

146
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,539
I had an infected nerve
behind my right eye.

147
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,830
He operated and saved my sight.

148
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,269
Afterwards, he asked me out.

149
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,669
I didn't really want to, but....

150
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,960
He helped you, you felt obligated.

151
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,299
Plus, a doctor.

152
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,120
So we had one drink, one time...

153
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,480
...and he started calling me, a lot.

154
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,059
Then he started showing up
at my work, my apartment...

155
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,759
...saying we had something special,
that we should marry.

156
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:02,460
I said I wasn't interested.

157
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:04,009
Then it got worse?

158
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:05,710
I know it sounds stupid...

159
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,690
...but I can feel him
watching me all the time.

160
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,480
Today, he knew I took my Xanitab...

161
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,779
...when I was alone in the bathroom.

162
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,110
He's just everywhere.

163
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,029
I don't think I can take
much more of this.

164
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,259
Well, we're gonna help you.

165
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,940
Bigtime. And for a reasonable fee.

166
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,220
- Doyle will see you home safely.
- Thanks. You've been really kind...

167
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,309
...listening to me...

168
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:35,710
...and it's terrible.

169
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,230
- We're gonna take care of that.
- No, I mean the coffee.

170
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,309
Angel...

171
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,039
...how did you know I needed help?

172
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,600
I have a friend
at the police department.

173
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,870
I'll check in with you later.

174
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,259
Can you imagine? A doctor.

175
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,169
They examine your body.
They know every inch of you.

176
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,320
How's he doing it?

177
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:06,090
How does he see her
when she's alone, in private?

178
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,169
Is he invisible?

179
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,570
Or some kind of ghost?
Maybe he can astral project.

180
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,980
Maybe he has an accomplice
or a hidden camera.

181
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,549
Not everything has to be creepy.

182
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:20,460
No, but Doyle had a vision.

183
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:24,860
Which last time led to a sex-changing,
tear-out-your-innards demon. Right.

184
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,330
I guess they don't call you
for the everyday cases.

185
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,179
He sees her when he's nowhere around.

186
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:33,870
How?

187
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,279
Okay, flesh, anytime you want
to stop crawling is okay with me.

188
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,320
Hello, Kate.

189
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:23,210
Angel.

190
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,070
Hi. It's good to see you.

191
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:27,799
You too.

192
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,450
Judging by your discomfort,
I'd say...

193
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:33,340
...you're about to ask me out
on a date or you need a favor.

194
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,519
And I'm gonna go with favor.

195
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:39,159
So ask, and I'll see if I can do.

196
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:42,059
A girl. A client.

197
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,299
She's being stalked.
I think it could get ugly.

198
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:50,340
She's being stalked, then ugly
it already is. What's her name?

199
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,889
You don't have to stay
with me all day.

200
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,889
I'm here to protect and serve.
If I'm not in the way.

201
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,190
I like it.
As long as you're not bored.

202
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,190
No, I'm good.
Got the word jumble right here.

203
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,399
Should keep me occupied,
sadly, for most of the day.

204
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,440
I feel better now. I guess Angel's
handled a lot of cases like this?

205
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,549
Dozens. Hundreds.
Dozens of hundreds.

206
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:14,429
It happens that often?

207
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:17,210
Well, exactly like yours?
Not quite so many.

208
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,860
But protecting women such as yourself?

209
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,259
Oh, yeah, there's been four,
and three of them are very much alive.

210
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,320
Is that you?

211
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,240
Yeah, bungee jumping.

212
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:33,870
I always meant to do that,
but I intensely don't want to.

213
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:37,990
- So I haven't gotten around to it yet.
- It's fun. It's scary.

214
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,070
You don't seem like
the thrill-seeker type.

215
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,139
Well, I used--

216
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,210
I used to do a lot
of things, you know, before....

217
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,179
Don't worry. When Angel's
done with this case...

218
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,700
...I guarantee you'll be wanting
to jump off a bridge again.

219
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,220
Your girl did file
a report two months ago.

220
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,899
The doctor responded
and denied everything.

221
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,409
A lot of noise from his lawyers.

222
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,039
What?

223
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:07,580
His lawyers. Wolfram and Hart.

224
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,730
- You know the name?
- I've heard it.

225
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,149
They're the law firm Johnnie Cochran
is too ethical to join.

226
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,259
They actually filed
a restraining order against her.

227
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,580
Very cute. There's still no record
of violence from the doctor.

228
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,000
Yet.

229
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,679
- You think he's gonna blow?
- I do.

230
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,730
I'll put a uniform on her.

231
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,289
I probably can't spare one
for more than a day or two.

232
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,659
- Thanks. That'll help.
- And your client? She's holding up?

233
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,230
She's scared.
He's put her on the ropes.

234
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,690
Help her get mad. That's the only
way she'll be able to fight him.

235
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,590
I'll fight him.
That's why she hired me.

236
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:48,590
That's not what I mean.
He could go to jail tomorrow...

237
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:51,480
...and still kill her
in her dreams every night.

238
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:55,289
I've put these creeps away.
It's hard to know he's still winning.

239
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,330
She's still afraid.
He took this girl's power away.

240
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,590
Nobody can get it back
for her but her.

241
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,079
- You're a miracle worker.
- Oh, thank you.

242
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,299
If you'll step right over here.

243
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,569
What are you doing in my office?

244
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,170
Name's Jensen. I must talk to you.

245
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,029
- Then make an appointment.
- I don't have time.

246
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:48,200
- I heard you do things nobody else can.
- I'm calling security.

247
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,730
My wife has a malignant tumor
pressing on her ocular cavity.

248
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,950
She'll die unless someone
has the nerve to operate.

249
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,430
You're talking about a
difficult and dangerous procedure.

250
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,480
I could lose my license.

251
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:04,509
I understand your situation,
but I can't help you.

252
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,900
- What does she mean to you?
- What?

253
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,490
Is she your wife? Your girlfriend?

254
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,329
- She's my fiancée.
- Nice. You set a date?

255
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,109
- We're working that out.
- Did you know right away?

256
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:19,369
That she was the one?

257
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,809
- I don't see how this has--
- I'll tell you how.

258
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,930
Know what it is to be so close...

259
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,430
...you don't know where
they end and you begin?

260
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,690
Would you die for her?

261
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,759
Yes.

262
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:34,480
Then you understand I won't
make any compromises.

263
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,529
I won't watch her suffer and die
while the law catches up with science.

264
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,750
What I will do is pay you
whatever it takes.

265
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,190
Think about it. Please.

266
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,839
Another article about Meltzer?

267
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:00,910
Well, our readers at...

268
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:04,650
... The Journal of Diagnostic
Orthopae-- Et cetera...

269
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,490
...seem endlessly fascinated by him.

270
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,799
He is fascinating. Before he
became an ocular surgeon...

271
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,710
...he specialized in orthopedics.

272
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,759
He developed nerve and blood vessel
accelerants that helped many.

273
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,380
- How?
- Well, when you sever a limb...

274
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:21,059
...you only have so much time
before it atrophies.

275
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,710
- Yuck.
- What?

276
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,849
Nothing. Please go on.

277
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:30,519
Meltzer's work extended
that period of time significantly.

278
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,420
He's one of the best
at reattaching nerves.

279
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,380
So he's good at the cutting
and the sewing.

280
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,500
He ever strike you
as a dangerous creep?

281
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,019
What? What kind of article
are you writing?

282
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:46,650
I've gotta be honest.
It may not be a very nice one.

283
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,089
I don't like the way he treats women.

284
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,809
I'll keep your name out of it...

285
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,910
...but just between us,
what is the real dish on this guy?

286
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,549
He's not very generous.

287
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,750
He doesn't share his techniques
with the medical community...

288
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,440
...and a lot of what he claims
to have done is pretty radical.

289
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:12,380
Like what?

290
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:15,900
Reattachment of eyes, for one thing.
He can do anything with a knife.

291
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:18,980
Oh, you so don't want
this guy fixated on you.

292
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,750
What is stalking now, the third
most popular sport among men?

293
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:24,700
Fourth, after luge.

294
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,130
I don't get it. He has a lot to lose.

295
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:29,849
What about Melissa
has got him going all O.J.?

296
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,920
Nothing. It's not about her.
It's about rage.

297
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,180
He's too messed up
to deal with a real woman...

298
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,569
...so he creates a fantasy
about a girl he barely knows.

299
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,000
She'll fail him,
and he has to hurt her...

300
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,420
...because when he looks at her,
all he sees is how useless he is--

301
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,200
What a fun date you must have been
back in your bad vamp days.

302
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,539
But, it should give you some insight
into the jerks of the world.

303
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:55,789
I know how he thinks.
I don't know how he does it.

304
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:57,700
Being everywhere at once?

305
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,000
Natpudan says we're everywhere at once
since we're made of the same molecules.

306
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:05,990
I remember that guy, made a big noise
a few years back on public television.

307
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,819
- Then had a big case of Joe Recluse.
- He had a nervous breakdown...

308
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:13,049
...not long after he had a retreat...

309
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,099
...for a group of famous
yogis and doctors.

310
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:17,779
I'm guessing Dr. Stalker
was at that retreat?

311
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,240
- What are you doing?
- Sending Joe Recluse an e-mail.

312
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,220
I need to talk to him.

313
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:27,019
"I hope you have the nerve to believe
I need help with Ronald Meltzer."

314
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:31,680
"Thanks for having the nerve to--"
Did you steal this book?

315
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:34,119
- Yeah.
- Good.

316
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,559
You said in your e-mail...

317
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:40,160
...that Dr. Meltzer
might hurt an innocent woman.

318
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:42,839
What do you think I can do about that?

319
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,890
Help me understand him better.

320
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,470
I don't think he's like other people.

321
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:51,450
No, he's not. Of course,
no two people are alike.

322
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,859
God, in His infinite variety and
wisdom, likes to keep it interesting.

323
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:59,400
- How'd you meet him?
- He came to one of my lectures.

324
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:02,400
My operating thesis at the time
was that the mind...

325
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:06,059
...is the single most powerful
force in the universe.

326
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:09,769
In any average human,
it regulates billions of cells.

327
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,950
And that's with 80 percent
of the brain still untapped.

328
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,069
What are the possibilities if a
person could master all that power?

329
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,920
I introduced Dr. Meltzer
to psychic surgeons.

330
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,809
Yogis who are able to shut down...

331
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,619
...their somatic systems
for days at a time.

332
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,160
But he eclipsed us all.

333
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:36,089
Until Dr. Meltzer, my studies had
been based on hearsay and theories.

334
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,490
But he exploded all that.

335
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,529
That's when I stopped teaching.

336
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,890
Because you stopped believing?

337
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:46,200
No.

338
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,160
Because I began to believe.

339
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,740
Completely.

340
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,640
All right, pal.

341
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:39,490
Why don't you just turn around?

342
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:40,839
Nice and easy.

343
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,920
Put your hands up.

344
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,849
I was just out for a walk.

345
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,230
Hands. Now.

346
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:07,869
I'm sorry.

347
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:10,380
We got a report of someone--

348
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,349
Not you.

349
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,819
That's quite all right, officer.

350
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:17,539
Just doing your job. I understand.

351
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:02,480
- What's wrong? Did someone break in?
- He's--

352
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:04,809
I can't help if you don't tell me.

353
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,099
Did someone break in
or you had a bad dream?

354
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,049
In there.

355
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,769
Okay.

356
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,069
Everything's okay now.

357
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:27,109
Look, there's no one in your bedroom.

358
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,410
There's no one in your bathroom.

359
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:32,549
Now, start from the beginning.
Just tell me--

360
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,079
It's me. It's me.

361
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,339
He's in there. He's--

362
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:52,700
His-- His hands.

363
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,329
I know what he can do.

364
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,950
He killed a-- Please don't leave
me alone. Please don't leave me.

365
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,170
It's all right.
I'm not gonna let him near you.

366
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,190
Here, drink up, love. It's over now.

367
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:45,319
- She's not making much sense.
- She's been living in terror.

368
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,440
- You think it's the doctor.
- I know it.

369
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:50,410
How could he do it?
She has bars on the windows.

370
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:53,970
The security cameras in the hallway
show officers going in...

371
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,339
...and nobody suspicious all day.

372
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,160
- I mean, who is this guy? Houdini?
- Something like that.

373
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:03,039
I've pulled prints.
If they match his, he's going down.

374
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,970
Detective, can you sign
the coroner's release?

375
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,150
- How's she doing?
- Numb. They get any prints?

376
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,970
- Yeah.
- Good, so we put him behind bars...

377
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,220
...for about 90 seconds
until he skitters through them.

378
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:28,700
Not many things make me shudder...

379
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,170
...but this guy,
crawling around under the covers?

380
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:35,119
At least it was just
his hands down there.

381
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,759
- I wish I hadn't even thought that.
- He's coming undone.

382
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,089
- I'll say.
- I mean, he's out of control.

383
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,539
He's killing now.

384
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:45,750
Anybody that stands
between him and his obsession.

385
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,650
You okay?

386
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:51,359
We stand between
him and his obsession.

387
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,619
Not putting too cowardly
a point on it...

388
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,420
...but if this guy can't be contained
or killed, what are we gonna do?

389
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,730
His body parts go too long without
blood and oxygen, they deteriorate.

390
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,150
He can't put himself back together.
Not even with psychic surgery.

391
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:08,160
So we break him down and box him up?

392
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,000
Of course, it's just a theory.

393
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,599
What do we do in the meantime?

394
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,420
Protect her.

395
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,619
It's not good for the ventilation,
but he's not getting in here.

396
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,309
I was just trying to fix your collar.

397
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,660
What say we leave it crooked
until this is resolved?

398
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,819
I don't see how this can--

399
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,779
I mean, this can't be happening.

400
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:34,289
What I saw. You must think I'm crazy.

401
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,160
No, I believe you.

402
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,490
But, it's not possible.
He can really--?

403
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,569
Yes.

404
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:43,920
Remember I told you I handle
things the police can't?

405
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,990
Now, this is one of those things.
I'll take care of him.

406
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,009
Doyle and Cordelia will stay with you.
Try to get some rest.

407
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:01,640
- Here.
- Thanks, but I'm not gonna cry anymore.

408
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:04,390
I'm tired of crying and being afraid.

409
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:07,539
- Don't be afraid.
- You're duct-taping for fun?

410
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,789
You survived a living hell
these last months...

411
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:12,369
...while he's coming unhinged
at not controlling you.

412
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:16,710
- He's weak. You're strong.
- He knows what he's talking about.

413
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,079
He has stalked plenty of--

414
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,079
Books on the subject.

415
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,150
Could I see you upstairs for a moment?

416
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:28,569
Melissa stays here with us,
that makes sense.

417
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,500
The part about you
taking care of the doctor?

418
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,250
This guy is really dangerous.

419
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:36,269
What are you doing?

420
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,839
Seeing where I can get
steel boxes at this hour.

421
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,140
Steel boxes? Why would you want--?

422
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:43,960
Oh, for packing up people parts.

423
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:47,170
This job-- Don't get me wrong,
I'm grateful to have it.

424
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,630
God knows it's educational
and all, but sometimes--

425
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,880
Who's calling at this--?

426
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:57,369
It's the special line.

427
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,480
- Answer it.
- Right, right. Okay.

428
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:02,950
Are we Johnson International Holdings?

429
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,450
- Jensen.
- Jensen. Good, got it.

430
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,630
Jensen. Now, does that sound
like an international--?

431
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,900
Cordelia.

432
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,910
Jensen International Holdings.
May I help you?

433
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,170
- Mr, Jensen,
- Please hold.

434
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,940
It's him.

435
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,500
- Brian Jensen.
- You're working late,

436
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,920
Downside of being global.

437
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,700
If you still want,
I'll operate on your wife.

438
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,829
I do, thank you,

439
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,450
We have to do it out of the country.
I'll need $100,000 to get started.

440
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,079
Are you in your office?

441
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,160
I'll bring it to you tonight.

442
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,480
You're going there?
What if he comes apart on you?

443
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:46,039
If he comes apart on me,
he's gonna stay that way.

444
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,990
That's a big box.

445
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,630
You didn't have to
bring it in small bills.

446
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,559
- Actually, I didn't bring--
- Any money at all?

447
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:11,490
No, I didn't think you would.

448
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,630
Although the safety deposit box
was a nice touch.

449
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,700
Your name's not really Jensen.
You don't have a wife.

450
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:20,670
What a tangled web, eh?

451
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,180
I developed this injector for animals.

452
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,319
They don't like having
their limbs cut off.

453
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,150
They can hurt you
if you get too close.

454
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:37,779
You'll feel a slight
sinking sensation.

455
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:41,029
That's your heart slowing
as the paralytic takes effect.

456
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,680
Eventually, it'll stop altogether.

457
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:48,299
I just can't get over the audacity.

458
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,420
To think you could take her from me?

459
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,890
I saw you holding her.

460
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:56,200
Nobody can break the bond
between us. Nobody.

461
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,759
Clearly, even she can't accept that.

462
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,730
I've tried so hard to show her
in so many ways.

463
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:09,160
I've taken care of her,
been there for her...

464
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,000
...even when she didn't know it.

465
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,079
If that's not devotion....
What do I get for my trouble?

466
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,589
She lies. She cheats.

467
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,680
But no more.

468
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,309
I won't be made a fool of.

469
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:26,910
She would've made a beautiful bride.

470
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:46,150
I got everything, I think.

471
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:50,670
She's resting.

472
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,029
What did you put in her tea?

473
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:57,750
Enough whiskey to drop my Aunt Judy.
That woman had some girth.

474
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:03,500
- What's the point?
- It tastes good and it relaxes you.

475
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:06,470
No, I mean of ever
going out with anyone.

476
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:09,160
Well, people need people.

477
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:12,759
And people who need people...

478
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:15,299
...I mean, are the luckiest peo--

479
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,569
If you like them, they don't like you.

480
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:20,519
Or you can't stand them, which
guarantees they'll hover around...

481
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,779
...and never go away.

482
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,960
I hate guys like that. It's-- Yeah.
I'm gonna check on her.

483
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,250
It's just so unfair.

484
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:34,849
This poor girl hooks up with a doctor.
That should be a good thing.

485
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:39,430
You should be able to call and say,
"Mom, guess what? I met a doctor."

486
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:42,400
Not "Guess what?
I met a psycho stalker.

487
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:46,670
By the way, his hands and feet come
off, and he's not even in the circus!"

488
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,990
Not every relationship
leads to disaster.

489
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,839
- What if Angel doesn't come back?
- He'll be back.

490
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:07,029
- What if Dr. Chop Salad shows up?
- I got this place sewn up now--

491
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,250
What was that?

492
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,500
Just the wind.

493
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,030
Want to play some cards
or watch the tube?

494
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:43,699
Sure. How about some gin?
A penny a point?

495
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,889
Yeah, you'll owe me money.

496
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:48,360
Yeah, we'll see about that.

497
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,960
Cordelia.

498
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,280
Whoa.

499
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,139
Hi.

500
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:17,940
Getting some rest?

501
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:20,449
What are you?

502
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,710
I'm more than meets the eye. But you
never bothered to find out, did you?

503
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:27,389
You just took advantage
of my kindness.

504
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:31,980
Led me on until you could find
yourself a vacuous L.A. pretty boy.

505
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,719
You disappoint me, Melissa.

506
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:41,619
I know. I didn't mean--

507
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,510
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Stop, now. You're babbling!

508
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,739
I think--
I think you disappoint yourself.

509
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:52,519
You gave up on being loved
a long time ago.

510
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:55,139
Now you're another creep
who gets off on pain.

511
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:58,030
- Don't use childish--
- I'd be crazy to want to touch you...

512
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:02,369
...to wake up next to little pieces
of whatever you are.

513
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,119
- Shut up!
- You turned yourself into a freak.

514
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:08,159
A vile, repulsive freak.
I'm done being afraid of you.

515
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:12,000
You can cut me, and you can kill me.
It still won't change what you are.

516
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:15,539
Angel was right, you're weak.

517
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,179
I'm weak? Then how is it
that I killed him?

518
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:20,760
Inefficiently.

519
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,440
You can't be alive. You're not human.

520
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,489
You should talk.

521
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:48,079
We could have been so happy.

522
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,880
Ronald!

523
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:02,519
You all right?

524
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,420
Oh, goody. Recycled coffee.
My personal favorite.

525
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:31,130
He'll never put himself
back together, right?

526
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,809
He's in 12 steel boxes buried
in 20 feet of concrete...

527
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:36,320
...in L.A.'s newest subway stop.

528
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,400
That ought to bring in the tourists.

529
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,880
Hey.

530
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,280
- Hi.
- Hey. How's it going?

531
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,050
I brought this for you guys.

532
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:46,300
Oh, hope it doesn't need light.

533
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:48,110
It'll be fine in here.

534
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,530
- Can I offer you some coffee?
- Coffee? Oh, no.

535
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,869
I can only stay a minute.
Places to go. People to see.

536
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,210
Thanks to you.

537
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,780
- There's....
- What?

538
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,119
There's a bill....

539
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,920
Bill who?

540
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,610
The bill. For my services.

541
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,170
Oh. Of course.
That's the other reason I came.

542
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:19,090
- Here.
- I'll take that, thanks.

543
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,699
I mean, I didn't do it
for the money.

544
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,650
Oh, please. You earned it.

545
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:26,929
Well...

546
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,610
...I hope I never see you again.

547
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,469
Me too. Good luck.

548
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,059
Thanks.

549
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,530
That didn't go so badly.

550
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,679
You can save the girl and make money.
Is this a great country or what?

551
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:47,429
Let's march down to the bank right now
and deposit this beauty.

552
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,130
You guys go. I think I'll stay here
and not burst into flames.

553
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,670
Oh, right, you're pretty much
a night deposit guy.

554
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,139
Well, still. Cause to celebrate.

555
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,860
You think everything's
a cause to celebrate.

556
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,099
- We need more of these.
- We'll have more soon enough.

557
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,170
- Now. Have a vision.
- I can't perform on demand.

558
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,889
- We need clients.
- Money's corrupted you.

559
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,639
If I hit your head,
will you have a vision?

560
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,619
Get away from me. You're insane.
