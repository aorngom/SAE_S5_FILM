1
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,050
When did he get back?

2
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,570
Last night.

3
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,299
- And?
- He seemed fine.

4
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,820
He was in Sunnydale for three days...

5
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,539
...tracking Buffy and that
thing in your vision.

6
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,579
Where's the crabby scowl,
the morbid gloom?

7
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,280
This means it cut deeper than usual.

8
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,350
- Look out, here comes Hurricane Buffy.
- You think?

9
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,649
Maybe he's over her.

10
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,140
You have much to learn,
little Irish man.

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,539
Oh, my God!

12
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,920
- Don't do it, Angel!
- Listen, it's not worth it.

13
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,180
- It's not?
- No.

14
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,650
You can't let her get to you.

15
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,650
You'll meet someone else.
Give it time.

16
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,510
Why don't you let me have that?

17
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,640
Because I need it to level my desk.
The floor's uneven.

18
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,489
- You thought--
- Doyle did.

19
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,340
You know how he jumps to conclusions.

20
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:33,040
- Because you saw Buffy.
- Look, I was there to protect her.

21
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,060
She didn't even know I was there.

22
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:36,829
Really?

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,260
So you avoided her?

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,420
Look, Buffy will always be a part of
me. That's never gonna change.

25
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,120
But she's human...

26
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,340
...and I'm not.

27
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,900
That's also not gonna change.

28
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:51,079
There's no need to stir this up again.

29
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,450
You don't want to stir...

30
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:56,480
...but if my ex came to town
and was stalking me...

31
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,760
- ...and didn't say hello, I'd be--
- A little upset.

32
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:04,390
Wouldn't you?

33
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,949
Buffy.

34
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,080
Buffy's here. In town.

35
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,069
- What brings you to...?
- I came to see my father.

36
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,699
Thought I'd stop by.

37
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,120
What a surprise!

38
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,990
- Cordelia, how are you?
- I'm good. You?

39
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,259
I've been better.

40
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,319
This is Doyle, he gets visions
of people in trouble.

41
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,919
- Nice to--
- And this is us leaving you alone.

42
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,349
Well, um....

43
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,560
It's good to--
Can I get you anything?

44
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,310
How about an explanation?

45
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,159
Who are you, coming to my town,
following me behind my back?

46
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,150
- Sorry.
- What is this...

47
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,189
...some new torment you cooked up?

48
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:58,219
- I didn't want to--
- You can see me, but I can't see you?

49
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,560
- What are we playing?
- We're not.

50
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,360
I wrestled with this decision.

51
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,300
- Which you made without me.
- I tried to do what was right.

52
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,659
It's complicated, Buffy.
It's kind of a long story.

53
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,909
Your sidekick had a vision
and you came to Sunnydale?

54
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,310
Okay, maybe not that long.

55
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:20,170
I wasn't important enough
to even tell me that you were there?

56
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,019
I'm trying to explain.

57
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,910
It's because I felt you were important
that I didn't tell you.

58
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:31,019
I'm a big girl now, Angel.

59
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,500
I'm not in high school anymore.

60
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,540
A lot has happened since you left.

61
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,720
I know. I respect that.

62
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,560
I don't need you skulking around,
trying to protect me.

63
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,350
Unless I'm in some gigantic
fight to the death...

64
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,089
...which I was last night.

65
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:53,850
That was you helping me?

66
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,529
I was in the neighborhood...

67
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,120
...skulking.

68
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:00,250
That's the Slayer?

69
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,860
That's our little Buffy.

70
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,509
- She seemed--
- Bulgarian in that outfit?

71
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,920
No, hurt.

72
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,110
That happens when they're together.
Come on.

73
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:09,519
Where we going?

74
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,060
They'll be here for a while. We have
time for the Titanic director's cut.

75
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,230
I'm sorry if I handled it wrong.
What else was I supposed to do?

76
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,920
I don't know.

77
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:26,319
I just know that when you're around...

78
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:29,980
...whether I see you or not,
I feel you.

79
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,480
Inside.

80
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,449
And it throws me.

81
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,779
It throws me too.

82
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,240
So let's stick to the plan.

83
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,209
We'll keep our distance
until a lot of time has passed.

84
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,569
- With time, we should be able to--
- Forget?

85
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:54,350
Yeah.

86
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,180
So...

87
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:02,629
...I'm gonna go start forgetting.

88
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:09,420
Angel!

89
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,350
- You hear that?
- "The Buffy and Angel Show."

90
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,069
First they talk, then they punch.

91
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:23,490
- Shouldn't we--?
- Get our noses flattened?

92
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,879
No, thank you.

93
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,939
- Friend of yours?
- Never saw it before.

94
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,199
It was rude. We should go kill it.

95
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,480
I'm free.

96
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:00,810
Got a place I can change?

97
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,600
It's heading towards the ocean.

98
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,660
- Are you sure?
- It's wounded, I can smell its blood.

99
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,959
Oh, right.

100
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:15,220
Handy skill.

101
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,209
Maybe if your crack staff
hadn't run off...

102
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,959
...they could've done some research.

103
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,389
Find out why
this thing wants to kill us.

104
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:28,850
Just a rat.

105
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,959
So you can put that down now.

106
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,199
I don't know why you brought that.

107
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,279
Because I know how to use it.

108
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,490
Besides, it's a lot handier
than your fighting ax.

109
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,379
Unless he chops it in two.

110
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,209
Can we just get on with the hunting?

111
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,459
- I'd like this done by dark.
- I can handle it.

112
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,149
You helped me, and I want to be even.

113
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:52,920
We're keeping score now.

114
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:01,209
You getting anything?

115
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,980
Because I sure smell sewer.

116
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,100
Tunnel number one it is.

117
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,250
Angel?

118
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,149
You okay?

119
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,480
I feel weird.

120
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,039
I know. I do too

121
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,529
I only came to see you so I could
tell you face to face...

122
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,460
...not to see me face to face anymore.

123
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,429
And I know there's
a flaw in that logic.

124
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,870
The next thing I knew, we were
attacked by this ninja demon thing...

125
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,259
...and then we're on the floor
on top of each other.

126
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,409
It's just really confusing
being around you.

127
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,850
No, I meant I felt weird
from the demon's blood.

128
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,990
- It's powerful.
- Oh. Okay.

129
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,350
Let's pretend my little outburst
never happened.

130
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,750
No, it is confusing.

131
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,039
When we're apart, it's easier.

132
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,720
It hurts...

133
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:23,620
...every day...

134
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,250
...but I live with it.

135
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:29,480
Now you're...

136
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:35,009
...you're right here,
and I can actually reach out...

137
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,389
...and....

138
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:39,820
It's more than confusing.

139
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,750
It's unbearable.

140
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,190
But we have to bear, right?

141
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,779
I mean, what else can we do?

142
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,169
It doesn't work with us.

143
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:53,590
It can't.

144
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,179
No, I can't give you anything
a real girl would want.

145
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,620
No matter how much we miss each other.

146
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,340
Or what we feel in the moment.

147
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,129
If we let something happen...

148
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,330
...we'd want more.

149
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,789
And nothing's changed.

150
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,720
We'd only end up having to
leave each other again.

151
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,710
And that's the best-case scenario.

152
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,720
Oh, boy.

153
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,700
I was really jonesing for a
heartbreaking sewer talk.

154
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,539
I'm sorry....

155
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,340
I'm onto something back home!

156
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,649
I'm heading toward
a pretty good life, now that--

157
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm out of the picture?

158
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,299
That's why I left. You should have--

159
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,500
Could we just find this thing
and get this finished?

160
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,919
What if it went up?

161
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,929
Into the day.

162
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,419
Where he knows I can't go.

163
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:02,970
But I can.

164
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,490
I don't want you going alone.

165
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,870
Look, it's best all around
if we split up.

166
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,289
I can handle it.

167
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,090
There's a dive on Second
near Beach, the Lone Bar.

168
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,049
Demons go there when they
need to get patched up.

169
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,700
Got it.

170
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,169
Be careful.

171
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,990
I'm alive.

172
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,169
When they fight....

173
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,730
- Oh, my God.
- What?

174
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,470
She killed him!

175
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:25,080
Oops, it's just dust.
I forgot to sweep under the rug.

176
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,889
Trying to give me a heart attack?

177
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,960
Don't blame me if he's too cheap
to hire a cleaning lady.

178
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:36,990
What's wrong?

179
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,820
What happened?

180
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,220
Did you do it with Buffy?

181
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,529
Watch it, don't get too close.

182
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:48,980
You walked in the front door,
from the street. You've...

183
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,429
...got an umbrella.

184
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,460
He's alive, Cordelia.

185
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,409
- Alive?
- Buffy and I were attacked by a demon.

186
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,919
I tracked it and killed it....

187
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,669
Some of its blood mixed with mine.

188
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,889
And you wound up with a pulse?

189
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:20,250
I want to find out about that demon.

190
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:22,370
My back. It hurts.

191
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,559
- Everything's--
- More real?

192
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,149
- Now that you're real?
- Yeah.

193
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,779
I'm mortal now. I have a mortal body.

194
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,460
And I'm so hungry.

195
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:37,799
Look out, he's gonna eat.

196
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:41,190
Everything in sight.

197
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,210
Oh, my God! Food.

198
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,240
This is unbelievable. This is so....

199
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,889
It tastes so good when you're alive.

200
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,919
They didn't even have
fudge mint chip in your day.

201
00:14:57,889 --> 00:14:59,330
I want some. Can you get it?

202
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,509
It'll go straight to your thighs.

203
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:07,759
Chocolate.

204
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,190
Chocolate.

205
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,889
We need to focus here.

206
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:14,919
- Try and figure out--
- I love chocolate.

207
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,120
But not, as it turns out, yogurt.

208
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,190
Orson!

209
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,059
We're in a situation here.

210
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,750
Right.

211
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,539
I know. You're right.

212
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,919
Let me think.

213
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,629
Now my stomach's killing me.

214
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,220
Cordelia...

215
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,740
...find Buffy in Santa Monica
and tell her I killed the demon.

216
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:37,370
Okay.

217
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:41,120
Oh, wait!

218
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:45,340
Don't tell her about me.
Not until I know what it means.

219
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,539
All right.

220
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,639
- That's it.
- It's a Mohra Demon.

221
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,169
They're pretty powerful assassins.
Soldiers of Darkness.

222
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,889
They take out our warriors,
like you and Buffy.

223
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,299
"Needs vast
quantities of salt to live."

224
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,570
It was headed to salt water.

225
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,659
"Veins run with the blood
of eternity." There it is.

226
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,769
Its blood has regenerative properties.

227
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,980
Which explains what happened to me.

228
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,679
It doesn't explain why.

229
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,940
Who cares? The demon's dead,
you're alive. It's happy, fun time.

230
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,159
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

231
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,909
I thought The Powers That Be
had to step in.

232
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,429
They could do this?

233
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,009
I get the feeling
you're not telling me everything.

234
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,879
I'm not.

235
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,980
- We're on a need-to-know basis.
- I need to know.

236
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,399
Is this permanent?

237
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,110
Am I a normal Joe now?
Can I have a normal life?

238
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,090
I want to speak to them.

239
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,539
That's not easy.

240
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,720
The Powers That Be
don't live in our reality.

241
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,269
You have to go through channels.

242
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,330
Dangerous channels.

243
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,440
You know what? Start approaching.

244
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,019
All right, all right.

245
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,490
We could try the Oracles.

246
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,980
If they turn you into a toad,
don't say I didn't warn you.

247
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,559
"The Gateway for Lost Souls...

248
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,690
...is under the post office"?

249
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,160
That would make sense.

250
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,289
The Oracles are unpredictable.

251
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:26,819
Don't dilly-dally.
Ask your questions, get out.

252
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,690
Aren't you coming?

253
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,440
I can't. I' m just a messenger,
you're a warr;or.

254
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,980
If your heart is pure,
and I do this right...

255
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,650
..."We beseech access
to the knowing ones"...

256
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,849
...we may just survive.

257
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,670
You're in.

258
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:54,839
Come before us, lower being.

259
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,470
- What have you brought us?
- Was I--?

260
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,589
You bring no offering?

261
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,390
I brought you this.

262
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,480
I like time. There's so little
and so much of it.

263
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,230
- Well?
- What's happened to me?

264
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:24,980
- It's true.
- He's no longer a warrior.

265
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,029
It was the demon's blood.

266
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,079
It wasn't The Powers That Be?

267
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,230
"The Powers That Be."

268
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,519
Did you save humanity?
Avert the apocalypse?

269
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,430
You faced a demon. Life goes on.

270
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,950
My life, as a human?

271
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,960
I'm not under some spell?

272
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,480
The auguries say no.

273
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,089
It was meant to be.

274
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,539
From this day, you'll live and die
as any mortal man.

275
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:52,089
Privy to all pains and pleasures.

276
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,769
You no longer serve
that which we serve.

277
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,470
You're released from your fealty.

278
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:04,160
That's it, I'm free?

279
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:09,490
- It didn't work.
- Yes, it did.

280
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,400
- You just went in.
- What?

281
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,769
Look at your watch.

282
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,259
I can't. And next time
remind me to bring a gift.

283
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,279
I forgot. So, what happened?

284
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,400
They're a little confusing.

285
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:22,970
But the gist is...

286
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,549
...it's real.

287
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:27,069
I'm free.

288
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,240
- I can't believe this.
- Me, either.

289
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,750
What now? I've got this new life
in front of me. Where do I begin?

290
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:38,039
It's overwhelming. You can almost
do whatever you want now.

291
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,740
So the question is...

292
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:42,490
...what do you want?

293
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,299
This plant was thriving
just this morning.

294
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:44,470
Now look at it.

295
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,809
I'm telling you, where she leads,
dark forces follow.

296
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:54,039
Buffy gave it mites?

297
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:55,869
How else do you explain it?

298
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,380
- Jealousy?
- I'm jealous of her?

299
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,180
Oh, please!

300
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,410
Just a theory.

301
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,619
Jealous or not, our lives
are about to kaleidoscope.

302
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,380
How do you figure?
Angel's only been human a day.

303
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:11,920
The last two hours of which they've
spent down in his apartment together.

304
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,319
Don't they deserve some happiness
after all this?

305
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,960
Let me explain the lore here, okay?

306
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:20,579
They suffer, they fight,
that's normal.

307
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,660
They get groiny with one another,
the world falls apart.

308
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,069
Well, he's not cursed anymore.

309
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,630
- And you can't be sure they're....
- Oh, please!

310
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,509
They've got the forbidden love
of all time. They've been apart.

311
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,250
Now he's human?

312
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,250
I'm sure they're just
having tea and crackers.

313
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,440
- Would you like some more?
- No!

314
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:46,380
Thank you.

315
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:52,980
- I'm sorry I kissed you.
- You are?

316
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,569
- Not for the kiss itself.
- Good.

317
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:59,569
Because as far as kisses go,
I thought it was well above average.

318
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,890
It was incredible. I just think...

319
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,049
...maybe we'd be asking for trouble,
rushing back into things.

320
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,089
Not that I don't want to rush.

321
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,039
I do, believe me.

322
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:15,099
Right. I mean, you spoke
to the Oracles...

323
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,029
...and they said
you were cured for good.

324
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:20,500
But how do we know
they speak for The Powers?

325
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:23,079
I mean, they could be pranksters.

326
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,990
- Or there's another loophole.
- Exactly.

327
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,150
And then we're in even deeper
and it's "grrr" all over again.

328
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,380
It'd be smart to wait a while.

329
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:34,509
- See if this mortal thing takes.
- Exactly.

330
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,799
Even if it does,
it's still complicated.

331
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,500
You're still the Slayer.
And I'm not sure what I am now.

332
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:43,910
I don't know what my purpose is.

333
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,410
I can't just wedge myself
back into your life.

334
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,180
It wouldn't be good.

335
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:50,359
Not to mention,
you just started college.

336
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,400
And what about slaying?
You might not be as focused.

337
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:57,599
Are you gonna pull out
a pie chart now?

338
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:01,579
Because I get it. It's not necessary.

339
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,390
I'm not saying I don't want you,
Buffy. You know how much....

340
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:16,369
I'm just saying, it's worth
the wait to know it's right.

341
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,319
I need to be sure you won't get hurt.

342
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,539
I'm glad I didn't fantasize
about you turning human...

343
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,480
...only about 10 zillion times.

344
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,450
Because today would've been
a real letdown.

345
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:39,420
So how does the mature plan go?

346
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,930
You call me? I call you? What?

347
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:44,509
We stay in touch.

348
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:47,220
- Just not--
- Literally.

349
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,890
Funny.

350
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,910
- Okay, I'd better....
- Right. Remove the temptation.

351
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,329
So we'll talk soon.

352
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,809
And peanut butter, preferably crunchy.

353
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,130
Got it.

354
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,019
A perfect yum.

355
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,359
This is a dream.
You're human for like a minute...

356
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,109
...and there's fudge mint chip
in the fridge.

357
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,529
- God, I love food.
- Food is good.

358
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,519
Why didn't you tell me about
chocolate and peanut butter?

359
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,339
Well, I figured if your vamp
taste buds couldn't really savor it...

360
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,240
...then it would
only hurt you to know.

361
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,829
By the way, I'm over the whole
needing-to-be-mature thing.

362
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:35,690
That time you just spent
in the kitchen...

363
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,700
...that was enough time apart.

364
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:39,930
Too much.

365
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:44,970
Oh, okay.

366
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,670
Mortal coordination leaves
something to be desired.

367
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:52,339
Wrong. It's just right.

368
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:02,259
This is all working out nicely.
I'm out of a job.

369
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,210
Hey, not just you, you know.

370
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:07,480
Who are you kidding?
You know you're glad this happened.

371
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,730
I'm glad for Angel.
If that means I'm off the hook...

372
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,960
...with The Powers That Be,
all the better.

373
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:16,339
I'll be free to go out
and make my own mark in the world.

374
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,539
We had a cat that did that.

375
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:24,069
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?
I'm good for exactly two things...

376
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,480
...international superstardom...

377
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:29,369
...or helping a vampire
to rid the world of evil.

378
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:32,930
That makes for a short
but colorful résumé.

379
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,220
Whatever happens from here on out...

380
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:37,630
...at least I'll say goodbye...

381
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,190
...to the bone-crushing,
head-wrenching, mind-numbing visions.

382
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:47,579
- What do you see?
- We got trouble.

383
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:51,359
That's a good sound.

384
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:56,759
Thump, thump, thump.

385
00:26:57,369 --> 00:26:59,400
It feels pretty amazing.

386
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,950
I'm so glad we didn't
logic ourselves out of this.

387
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:07,140
We'll make it work, right?

388
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:08,730
We will.

389
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,220
I'm so sleepy.

390
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:17,769
But I still want....

391
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,849
What?

392
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:21,529
You couldn't possibly.
I mean, not that I wouldn't.

393
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,289
No, no.

394
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,900
I'm spent.

395
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:29,400
Pleasantly numb, even.

396
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:30,819
You?

397
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:32,619
For now.

398
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,829
No, I want to stay awake...

399
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,450
...so this day can keep happening.

400
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,000
Sleep.

401
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,269
We'll make another one
like it tomorrow.

402
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,849
Angel?

403
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,400
This is the first time
I've ever really felt this way.

404
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,599
What way?

405
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,039
Just like I've always wanted to.

406
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,640
Like a normal girl...

407
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:10,690
...falling asleep in the arms
of her normal boyfriend.

408
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,180
It's perfect.

409
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:39,000
Hey. That Mohra Demon
regenerated more than just you.

410
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,190
- What?
- I had a vision.

411
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,170
It's regenerated itself.

412
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,500
- Where?
- In the tunnel.

413
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,119
Then in a factory. I tasted salt.
It could've been the margarita.

414
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:50,690
It needs salt to live.

415
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,240
It was very much alive in this vision.
And angry.

416
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,049
I'll kill it again.

417
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,250
Yeah, but you're human now.
They released you.

418
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,720
You want to let that thing roam free?

419
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,700
You saw it in a factory. We'll start
at a saline plant in Redondo.

420
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:12,000
But it can regenerate itself.

421
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:13,309
We'll figure it out.

422
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:15,809
Grab the book of Kelsor.
You'll read, I'll drive.

423
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:19,700
Doyle?

424
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,779
I think maybe we ought to bring
someone a little supernatural.

425
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:31,839
Don't you want to wake the girl?

426
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:36,069
Not for the world.

427
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:45,660
It doesn't just come back.
It comes back bigger and stronger.

428
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:48,140
- We should get Buffy.
- No.

429
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,880
But this isn't your average demon.
It nearly licked you before.

430
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:54,630
I'm gonna have to do this on my own.

431
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,420
I can't keep risking
Buffy's life every time--

432
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,259
Just tell me how to kill it.

433
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,920
"It regenerates until dark
future it envisions is upon us...."

434
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:06,069
"To slay the beast one must
bring darkness to 1000 eyes."

435
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,160
I only saw two.

436
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,480
Stay glib. It makes me
think we have a chance.

437
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,750
- Easy.
- The blood.

438
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:18,309
It's never an easy sight.
It's part of being human.

439
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,369
I'm gonna kill this thing.

440
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:28,119
Just remember that it's brutal,
deadly and...here!

441
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,019
Angel?

442
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,240
Cordelia.

443
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:15,910
- Is this antique?
- Byzantine.

444
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:18,839
Where's Angel?

445
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:22,299
I won't feel sorry for myself.

446
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:25,160
I'm organizing a little
going-out-of-business sale...

447
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:29,599
...to subsidize the severance package
Angel never set up for me.

448
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:31,900
Did he leave a message?

449
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,210
I'm in pain here, and all
you can do is talk about Angel.

450
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,059
Have you thought of how this
turning-human thing might affect me?

451
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,359
Regrettably, no.

452
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,869
Look, if you know where he is,
just tell me.

453
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,670
- He told me not to tell you.
- Is he in trouble?

454
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,250
Are we in second grade here?
Tell me.

455
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,690
Maybe it's time you grew up...

456
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:01,369
...and realized that
you can't have everything.

457
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:04,299
You can't have Angel
and save the world.

458
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:08,180
Anyway, it's your fault he went
to fight that thing without--

459
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,880
What thing?

460
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:40,190
The End of Days has begun
and cannot be stopped.

461
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:43,650
For any one of us that falls,
10 shall rise.

462
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,089
You hurt my boyfriend.

463
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:57,940
- A great darkness is coming.
- You got that right.

464
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,720
This is the great warrior
of darkness?

465
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,950
Together, you were powerful.
Alone, you are dead.

466
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:32,809
- What do you think of the warrior now?
- A little bland.

467
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,430
Needs salt.

468
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,650
A thousand eyes.

469
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,039
Smash the jewel in his forehead!

470
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:18,420
Buffy, are you...?

471
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,030
Shh, shh. Don't talk.

472
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,800
You're all right.

473
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:24,809
That's all that matters.

474
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,340
You're all right.

475
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:30,380
It's over.

476
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,039
And we're together.

477
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,510
You again?

478
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:50,309
- What have you brought me?
- A rose vase.

479
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:51,940
Ching Dynasty.

480
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,659
Circa 1811.

481
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,710
Lovely.

482
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,460
Why are you here, lower being?

483
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:02,389
The Mohra Demon said
the End of Days had begun.

484
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:05,280
That others were coming,
the Soldiers of Darkness.

485
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,210
- Was he telling the truth?
- As far as such things can be told.

486
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,880
What happens to the Slayer?

487
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:16,650
What happens to all mortal beings.

488
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:19,500
Albeit, sooner in her case.

489
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:21,800
She'll die.

490
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,750
Then I'm here to beg for her life.

491
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,750
It is not our place
to grant life and death.

492
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:34,150
And ask you to take mine back.

493
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,349
I can't protect her or anyone
as a Man.

494
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:46,139
You're asking to be what you were,
a demon with a soul...

495
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,250
...because of the Slayer?

496
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:53,489
This is a matter of love.
It does not concern us.

497
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,159
Yes, it does.

498
00:35:56,929 --> 00:36:00,900
The Mohra Demon came to take a warrior
from your cause, and it succeeded.

499
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,449
I'm no good to you like this.

500
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,849
I know you have it in your power
to make this right. Please.

501
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,340
What is done cannot be undone.

502
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,460
What is not yet done can be avoided.

503
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:17,630
We are not to indulge
the whims of lower beings.

504
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,880
You are wrong.
This one is willing to sacrifice...

505
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,989
...every drop of human happiness
and love...

506
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,110
...he's ever known for another.

507
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:28,860
He is not a lower being.

508
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,650
There is one way. But it is not
to be undertaken lightly.

509
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,039
We swallow this day,
as though it never happened.

510
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,059
Twenty-four hours from the moment
the demon first attacked you...

511
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:45,980
...we take it back.

512
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,380
Then none of this happened...

513
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,320
...Buffy and I.

514
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,719
But what'll stop us from doing
the exact same thing?

515
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,849
You.

516
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,670
You alone will carry
the memory of this day.

517
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,699
Can you carry that burden?

518
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,829
I'm guessing that expression
isn't because...

519
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,619
...they were out of fresh OJ
at the deli.

520
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,920
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

521
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,719
I just....

522
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:41,730
Where have you been?

523
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,719
I went to see the Oracles.

524
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,309
I asked them to turn me back.

525
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,130
What? Why?

526
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,659
Because more than ever
I know how much I love you.

527
00:37:58,329 --> 00:37:59,800
No. No, you didn't.

528
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:03,639
And if I stay mortal, one of us
will wind up dead. Maybe both of us.

529
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,719
- You heard what Mohra said.
- We killed him.

530
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,070
- He said others would come.
- They will always come.

531
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:12,650
That's my problem now, not yours.

532
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,400
I won't stand by and let you fight,
maybe die, alone.

533
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:18,150
- Then we fight together.
- Buffy...

534
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,989
...I'm a liability to you.
You take chances to protect me.

535
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:24,789
It's bad for you
and the people we need to help.

536
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:28,739
So, what? You just took a whole
24 hours to weigh the ups and downs...

537
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,900
...of being a regular Joe and decided
it was more fun being a superhero?

538
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,130
You know that's not it.

539
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,090
How can we be together
if the cost is your life?

540
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,289
Or the lives of others?

541
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,159
I know. I couldn't tell you.

542
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,550
I wasn't sure I could do it if
I woke up with you one more morning.

543
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,760
I understand.

544
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:07,000
So, what happens now?

545
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,369
The Oracles are giving us back
the day, turning back time...

546
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,409
...so I can kill Mohra
before his blood makes me mortal.

547
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,889
When?

548
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:20,800
Another minute.

549
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,500
A minute? No.

550
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:25,420
- No, it's not enough time.
- We don't have a choice.

551
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:29,119
How am I supposed to go on
with my life...

552
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,940
...knowing what we had,
what we could've had?

553
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,940
You won't. No one will know but me.

554
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:40,599
- Everything we did.
- It never happened.

555
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:43,460
It did. It did. I know it did.

556
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,650
I felt your heartbeat.

557
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,590
Buffy.

558
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,780
Oh, God. It's not enough time.

559
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,460
Please. Please, please, please.

560
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,460
I'll never forget. I'll never forget.
I'll never forget.

561
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:27,010
I'll never forget.

562
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:32,579
So then, let's just stick to the plan.

563
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:37,599
Keep our distance
until time has passed.

564
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,130
- Given enough time we can--
- Forget.

565
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,719
Yeah.

566
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,179
So...

567
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:51,610
...I'm gonna go...

568
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:53,309
...start forgetting.

569
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:14,869
That was unreal.

570
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:18,820
- How did you know how to kill it?
- It's a Mohra Demon.

571
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:22,139
I've had time
to catch up on my reading.

572
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,489
Yeah. Okay.

573
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,809
- So I guess we've covered it.
- Guess we did.

574
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,110
And that's all there is to say.

575
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:42,050
Yeah.

576
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,849
That's it.
