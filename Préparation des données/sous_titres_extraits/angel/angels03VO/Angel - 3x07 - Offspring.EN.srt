1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:05,019
- Previously on Angel:
- The Host reads their souls.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,389
But only when they sing karaoke.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:12,320
Imagine what could have happened if
you'd gone nuts and slept with Darla.

4
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,739
I would never do that.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,079
Get out. The next time I see you,
I'll have to kill you.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,079
I cannot help you. No man can.
This is not meant to be known.

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:36,460
I guess there's only one thing
left to do. Time to go visit Daddy.

8
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:03,989
Monseigneur Rivalli performed the
ceremony when Caroline and I wed.

9
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,550
- You remember Caroline.
- A pretty lass. Hardy screamer.

10
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,159
The monseigneur's been excommunicated.

11
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,219
His order, Inquisitori,
adheres to the old beliefs.

12
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,280
They're traditionalists
and good at their work.

13
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,490
Let's get started, shall we?

14
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,930
You lost me in North Africa.

15
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,509
I knew you'd come back to Europe.
But Rome, Angelus?

16
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,210
Why would you come
to the seat of all that's holy?

17
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:00,960
- Darla. She loves the Sistine Chapel.
- Michelangelo?

18
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,229
Not him.
She's mad about Boticelli's frescoes.

19
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,770
The Temptation of Christ is her
favorite because of the leper.

20
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,969
- What do you want, Holtz?
- I don't want anything.

21
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,620
My family's gone.

22
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,270
I don't trust you to give me Darla,
although I will find her.

23
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,599
My only desire is to discover
if a thing such as yourself...

24
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,050
...can be made to pay for its sins.

25
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,080
You're a demon.
Your nature is to maim and kill.

26
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,520
But you were also once a man.

27
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:44,009
If we beat and burn the demon out
of you, will there be anything left?

28
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,669
Anything at all?

29
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,990
I doubt it, but I'm willing to spend
the next fortnight finding out.

30
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,789
In either event, you have no soul.
You cannot be saved.

31
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,139
Sorry it took me so long, darling.

32
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,389
Kill them.

33
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,069
Grazie, padre,

34
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:02,199
- Darling...
- What?

35
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:04,040
...shouldn't we be killing Holtz?

36
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,649
But it's so much fun,
ruining his life.

37
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:09,790
He's like family now.

38
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,310
Thanks for the lift.
That didn't take long at all.

39
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,790
And they say there's no
public transportation in L.A.

40
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,750
Help! We got a Code 12
on the 5-8 line!

41
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,779
What's this?

42
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,509
It's just so dark down here
I thought I'd brighten it up.

43
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,750
You can't exactly go out and
enjoy the sunny fields of nature...

44
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,379
...but that doesn't mean we can't bring
a little bloom into your darkness.

45
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,189
- Fake.
- Put something real in here...

46
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,800
...and it'll die like that:

47
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,449
- Thank you?
- I've been around--

48
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:16,120
Which reminds me, next birthday, can
we skip the 250 candles on the cake...

49
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,519
- ...and just go with a little song?
- And I've never known anyone like you.

50
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,819
Time's a wasting, big guy.
Can we do it?

51
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,430
Okay. Last time, we worked
on not pulling your punches.

52
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,980
Don't worry about me.
That's good.

53
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:36,819
Good.

54
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,230
That's it. Where's your weight?
Don't forget to--

55
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,500
Oh, God! You said to--
Are you all right?

56
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,579
I'm a vampire. You can't hurt me.

57
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,149
- Good.
- You're off your game.

58
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,709
It's the prophecy Wes and Gunn
are trying to get.

59
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,680
- You think the end is coming.
- The end is not coming.

60
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:00,110
Someone always uncovers
some ancient scroll...

61
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,970
... that says something terrible
is coming.

62
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,740
Do you know how many
of these things I've seen?

63
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,740
- Four?
- Three, but don't worry.

64
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,850
Then why are they breaking
and entering right now?

65
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,810
Breaking and entering
is such a negative term.

66
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,290
They're retrieving pieces
of a Nyazian scroll to confirm--

67
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,620
That the end is coming.

68
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,009
All we can do is live each moment
to the fullest...

69
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,170
...and be glad we didn't lose
all our money in the NASDAQ.

70
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,830
Am I swelling?

71
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,990
Step one: Dobermans are gnawing steak,
alarm and vid lines are disabled...

72
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,509
...no infrared. Lucky break.

73
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,549
Step two: Cut a hole, snake the
minicam in, scan the interior.

74
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:04,789
If it's clear, we disable the locks
on the side door, thus completing...

75
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,179
...step three.

76
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,519
Thank you,

77
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,649
Can you believe this?

78
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,500
Some guys collect old cars.
Some guys--

79
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:54,740
It's like the eye follows you
wherever you go.

80
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,940
If you were a priceless Nyazian scroll,
where would you be?

81
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:16,230
If I was priceless....
I'd be in the vault.

82
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:20,500
The vault? Your snitch never said
anything about a vault.

83
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,950
I got a bad feeling.

84
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,769
We'll figure something out.
It's just a vault.

85
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:30,879
My bad feeling is more about the man
standing behind you with a large gun.

86
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,559
Move, and I'll kill you.

87
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,769
- I hope you call the police.
- I am.

88
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:41,610
Good. You can explain why you
have so much GHB.

89
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,740
You know, Rohypnol,
the date-rape drug.

90
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,950
- What?
- Used as a trancing amalgam.

91
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,539
Under the microscope, it's virtually
indistinguishable from GHB.

92
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,179
- All right, I won't call the police.
- I'm glad we understand each other.

93
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,980
- Until after I kill you.
- Oh.

94
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,320
- Hey, these worth a lot?
- Yes.

95
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,870
- They're Cyopian conjuring spheres.
- How much? Four figures each?

96
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,700
- Stop that.
- Put the weapon down.

97
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,759
Kind of delicate. We're not thieves,
we're investigators.

98
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,370
We need to look at your
Nyazian scroll.

99
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,679
- I'm getting kind of tired here.
- All right.

100
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,279
Always wanna finish big.

101
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:44,000
- Ow. That doesn't feel right.
- Just relax. You have to bend.

102
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:47,539
I don't bend there.

103
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,120
Now, that's downright unnatural.

104
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,649
If you're attacked from behind...

105
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:57,139
...shift all your weight
to your other foot...

106
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:00,629
...so you can spin and kick.
You try it.

107
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,480
Easy. All right, that's better.

108
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,539
We'll keep working on it.
That's enough for today.

109
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:14,350
We could do more, but then I'd have
to ice every bone in my body. See you.

110
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:18,039
- Hey, Fred.
- Hey.

111
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,159
Kyrumption.

112
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,769
Well, back at you.

113
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,340
- What did you say?
- Kyrumption.

114
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,100
It's the one nice word I remember
from the Pylean hell dimension.

115
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,870
- What's it mean?
- It's when two heroes meet in battle...

116
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,240
...and recognize their fate.

117
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,220
It's also a grog made of ox dung,
but that's archaic.

118
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:44,009
Well, that's interesting.

119
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:50,419
When I see you and Cordelia sparring,
kyrumption always comes to mind.

120
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,809
Me and Cordelia?

121
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,259
I know. She's such a hero,
with the visions and the courage.

122
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,240
It's only natural you two
are drawn to one another.

123
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,289
Plastic flowers, my favorite.
They never fade, you know.

124
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:15,379
There's nothing going on between
me and Cordelia.

125
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,129
- Nothing but moira.
- Who's Moira?

126
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,080
Moira's the gut attraction
between larger than life souls.

127
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:28,580
No. There's no attraction. Cordelia's
a friend, someone I work with.

128
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,950
See? You're being chivalrous because
you're a hero. You've got kyrumption.

129
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,230
- Stop using that word!
- What's going on down here?

130
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,570
- Nothing.
- Fred doesn't need to be shouted at.

131
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:43,799
He didn't mean anything by it.

132
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,330
- Is there something you wanted?
- Gunn and I were hoping...

133
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:53,220
...you could help with the prophecies.
We need someone to do the math.

134
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,679
Sure.

135
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,610
- Who gave you all the flowers?
- Nobody.

136
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:12,889
- So how you doing, Fred?
- It's a simple equation, really.

137
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,919
The ancient Roman calendar had
1464 days in a four-year cycle.

138
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:20,840
The Etruscan, Sumerian and Dradian
have their own cycles.

139
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:23,799
Work forward from the presumed date
of the prophecy...

140
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:28,909
...under each calendar, factoring in
our own 365-day calendar and....

141
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,909
That can't be right,
unless the world ended last March.

142
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,059
We talking Armageddon
or a bad house number?

143
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:44,940
- Is it a bad event or a bad guy?
- It's not clear.

144
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,590
It predicts the arrival
of the Tro-Clon...

145
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:50,799
...a being that brings
mankind's ruination.

146
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:53,419
A two-for-one. That's nice.

147
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,080
I'm not clear on the translation.
Ruination may, in fact, be purification.

148
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,940
Purification?
So this is a good thing?

149
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:04,809
I doubt that. It's "purification"
in Aramaic, "ruination" in Greek...

150
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,289
...and in Ga-Shundi, it's both.

151
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,710
And you don't want to make
the same mistake twice.

152
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:14,940
- No.
- What mistake?

153
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,440
There was a prophecy a while back.

154
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,139
It was about Angel and used
the word "shanshu"...

155
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,899
...which I thought meant "to die,"
and I told Angel....

156
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,129
- That he was going to die.
- Oh, no.

157
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,919
Then I found out it also meant
"to live. " It means both.

158
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,789
- So which is it?
- Both.

159
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,879
In his case, it meant that the vampire
in him might die...

160
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,100
- ...but the human in him might live.
- That he'd be like a normal man?

161
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,460
- Yes.
- Wow.

162
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,570
What would we do if that happened?

163
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,450
I'd buy him some plaid shirts
and take him to the beach.

164
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:00,649
- The boy needs some color.
- There.

165
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,570
That came out better.
No, it didn't.

166
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,879
It's preliminary, but if these
calculations are correct...

167
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,240
...this bad thing
should already be here.

168
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,620
Well, I guess not right here,
but here in L.A.

169
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:23,659
Let me run those numbers again.

170
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:26,429
Hey.

171
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:28,750
Hey.

172
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,870
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- No reason.

173
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:51,549
Okay, it's getting creepy now.

174
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,179
I was just thinking about things.
People. You know, how they relate.

175
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,039
Take you and me, for instance.
We're very different, obviously.

176
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,450
Human. Vampire.

177
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,539
Woman. Man...pire.

178
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,210
Has someone been putting vodka
in your blood?

179
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,140
You're funny. I get off a good one
now and then, but you--

180
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,809
Angel, are you trying
to say you love me?

181
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,769
- What?
- I love you too.

182
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,279
You do?

183
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,630
- When--?
- Angel loves me. I love him.

184
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,930
- Oh, my God.
- And we love you guys.

185
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:36,410
We love you, Angel!

186
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,500
They were all saying it in case
this prophecy comes true, and we die.

187
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,609
- You're not gonna want a hug, are you?
- No.

188
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:53,490
- We've been through a lot.
- That's all I was saying.

189
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,109
We've been through so much together,
you and me, as friends.

190
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,349
You've seen the good
and the not so good.

191
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:06,839
Just like you have in me.

192
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,630
And for the record, the good I've seen
far outweighs the bad.

193
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,750
- Thanks. You too.
- Hey, what are friends for?

194
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,650
You ask me, they're for knocking you
up and leaving you high and dry.

195
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,849
Hello, lover. Long time no see.

196
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,809
- Darla.
- Darla?

197
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,569
- Darla?
- Who's Darla?

198
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,279
- Angel's old flame.
- Not the one who died?

199
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,230
No, the one that came back to life.
She's a vampire.

200
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,180
- Do you have a chart?
- In the files. I'll get it later.

201
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:51,599
- When did this happen?
- You know exactly when it happened.

202
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,109
- Angel, did you and Darla...?
- Uh....

203
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,650
- This is impossible.
- Tell me about it, Daddy.

204
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,839
- You slept with her?
- Vampires can't have children. Wesley?

205
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:12,309
- No, he's right. It's not possible.
- That's not what I asked.

206
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,970
You know we can't.
I know we can't, but we did.

207
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:20,609
I wonder if this is that bad thing.

208
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,910
What did you do to me?

209
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,509
- Stop that.
- It's okay. It's all right, Cordy.

210
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,930
You'll hurt her.
Haven't you done enough?

211
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:36,170
Here, sit down.
You should get off your feet.

212
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,980
- Can we get her some water?
- That's Darla, you don't want to--

213
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,220
Did you or did you not?

214
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,339
Look me in the eye and say
you'd never do a thing like this.

215
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,549
He lied? What a surprise.

216
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:57,769
Hi, I'm Fred. Is water okay,
or did you want some blood?

217
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,329
Cordy, I'm sorry I lied. It was just--
It was a very dark time.

218
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,170
You used her to make you feel better
during your dark time?

219
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,779
Well, that makes it all heroic.

220
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,829
It wasn't like that. It just happened.

221
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,029
- I wasn't like I went evil, I just--
- You just went male.

222
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,720
Have you been to a doctor?

223
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,930
No, but I've been to every shaman
and seer in the Western Hemisphere.

224
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:36,240
- What did they say?
- They don't know what it is.

225
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,829
- It's never happened.
- Maybe it's an hysterical pregnancy.

226
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,720
- Wanna to feel it kick?
- Does it kick a lot?

227
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:48,529
- Like crazy.
- Wouldn't that be the first sign of...

228
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,170
...hysteria?

229
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:55,660
What can we do for you?

230
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,960
You can get your little gang
of supernatural detectives...

231
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,980
...to find out what's happening to me
and how to stop it.

232
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,950
Are you gonna take some
responsibility here?

233
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,920
- Angel?
- Oh, me?

234
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,660
Of course I am.

235
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,839
- Wes, let's get on this.
- What do you suggest?

236
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,289
Use your books and find out
what's going on.

237
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:23,470
Do I have to think of everything?

238
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,410
Here it is.

239
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,779
It says, "I have absolutely
no idea what's going on."

240
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,759
We should talk to the Host.

241
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:41,690
This is all wrong.

242
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,680
Violence restrained
This place a sanctuary was

243
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,869
- And shall be again
- That's great, girls.

244
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,400
Why are you charging me 1200
over the estimate?

245
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,190
I had to run a separate 212,
double insulation everywhere.

246
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,869
Plus, we had a run on vendrig lines.

247
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,240
And you said, "This club's my baby.
I want top-drawer throughout. "

248
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,420
Lorne, you here?

249
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,470
You gotta help me. We got kind
of a situation on our hands.

250
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:23,759
- Mmm.... Angel.
- Three more of Angel's chippies.

251
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,069
- You girls are on the pill, I hope.
- Mmm....

252
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,910
- Why are they here?
- They're recasting sanctuary spells...

253
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:36,150
...to prevent violence.
I'm covering demons and humans.

254
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:40,980
I'm opening the club again.
I was pretty blue for a long time.

255
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,390
If it had gone on much longer,
I would have turned aquamarine.

256
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,690
- Now, what happened here?
- What's it look like?

257
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:54,539
- Angel boned her.
- Just once. Just the one night.

258
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,319
Just the two or three times
that one night.

259
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,210
- Is Angel gonna sing?
- Oh.

260
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,900
- I suppose he has to.
- She's carrying the baby.

261
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:12,890
- What the hell's inside me?
- We're way beyond singing, mes enfants,

262
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,630
This is a brand-new day.
Everybody, that's a wrap.

263
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,970
We'll finish the spell tomorrow.
We got a crisis brewing.

264
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:25,380
Thanks for coming.
Check's in the mail. Get the hell out.

265
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,190
- Bye, Angel.
- Come see--

266
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:29,730
Us soon.

267
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,460
Mmm....

268
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,059
- Men.
- This is way beyond my Ken.

269
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:39,180
And my Barbie and all my action
figures. If it's alive--

270
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,329
It's alive. And kicking.

271
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:45,750
It could be anything.
A child born to vampires?

272
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,160
- Maybe it's some kind of über-vamp,
- The prophecies mention a Tro-Clon.

273
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:55,240
- It's supposed to be here about now.
- Born of darkness to bring darkness.

274
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,039
Great, so we're saying that my child
is the scourge of mankind?

275
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,950
You guys are upsetting her.

276
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:08,519
- I think she needs to lie down.
- She can have my bedroom.

277
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:09,900
Okay.

278
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:15,470
We can handle it.

279
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:28,269
- I think we should call a doctor.
- It'll pass. I just have to let it.

280
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,779
I'll stay with her.

281
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,799
- If you need anything, just holler.
- Okay.

282
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,599
I don't accept this. These prophecies
can be interpreted a hundred ways.

283
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,910
- Are your calculations right?
- I'm still working on them.

284
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:57,150
- What we do know is Darla's pregnant.
- It's impossible.

285
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,859
And mystically unfair.
You fought long and hard for good.

286
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,900
For you to spawn something evil....

287
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,950
Nothing spawned by Darla and me
can be good.

288
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:13,029
The prophecy about Angel being pivotal
in the battle of good and evil.

289
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,819
- That shanshu one?
- Maybe it's not you.

290
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,329
Maybe your child is pivotal.

291
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:22,029
Maybe your destiny is to help
bring it to the world.

292
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,839
Or to stop it.

293
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,769
Can I say something about destiny?

294
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:34,730
Screw destiny. If this evil thing
comes, we'll fight it and whup it.

295
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,440
Destiny just means inevitable.
And nothing's inevitable...

296
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,730
...if you stand up, look it in the eye
and say, "You're evitable. "

297
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:49,170
- Well, you catch my drift.
- I like her so much.

298
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,619
I want to see these prophecies
and anything else we've got.

299
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:55,599
Why don't I go get everything?

300
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,480
Good idea. We'll figure out
how to fight this thing.

301
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,170
- How's she doing?
- She's weary.

302
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:06,430
Poor thing looks about 18 months
pregnant. Hope they're not twins.

303
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,670
- Not her, Cordelia.
- I sense she's hurt and pissed.

304
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,119
What, with the lying and deception.

305
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:18,329
You should probably stay
out of her way.

306
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:23,420
- How are you feeling?
- Just crazy.

307
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:26,009
What?

308
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,740
Why would anyone bring something
into this world?

309
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:36,970
I was pregnant once.
I was out to here overnight.

310
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,119
Mystical thing.

311
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,559
I didn't go to term, but while
it lasted, talk about uncomfortable.

312
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:49,539
Your back and legs hurt. You're sick
to your stomach and can't eat.

313
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:52,579
And then you're ravenous.

314
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,920
Are you able to eat, or do you just--?

315
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:01,400
What? Drink?

316
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,799
Well, that's really none
of my business, is it?

317
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,480
You should rest and I should....

318
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,930
I'll just be real close by.

319
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,829
If there's anything you need--

320
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,839
I'm hungry all the time. It's weird.

321
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,980
Sure. You're eating for two now.
It's only natural.

322
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:35,980
No. What's weird is,
no matter how much I feed...

323
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,750
...I can't seem to get full.

324
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:45,730
Pregnant or not,
you're going to keep your distance.

325
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:12,880
Get away from her!

326
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,720
You're gonna be all right.

327
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:21,299
You're gonna be all right. Here.

328
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,240
I'll kill her for this.

329
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,009
You're gonna have to find her first.

330
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,039
- She bit Cordy.
- Are you all right?

331
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:33,420
Where is she?

332
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,740
- We hit her fists with our faces but--
- We'll get Cordy to a safe place.

333
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:49,519
- Are you feeling any better?
- Yeah. You don't have to stay with me.

334
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,440
Gunn's gonna be right here.

335
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,440
Thanks.

336
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,670
I'm not gonna keep telling you
how sorry I am.

337
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,690
I'm going to tell you
she'll never do it again.

338
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:14,960
It was my fault, Angel.
I felt sorry for her.

339
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:19,630
She looked so helpless, like a mother.

340
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,549
I forgot what she really was.

341
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:29,720
I'm starting to feel the pills.

342
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:49,730
- You see Darla anywhere in range--
- I'll take care of it.

343
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,160
Wait.

344
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,549
When she bit me, I had a vision.

345
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,440
- What'd you see?
- It was like no vision I've ever had.

346
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,690
She's so hungry. She doesn't know
how to make the hunger stop.

347
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,069
I think I know where she's headed.

348
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,730
I know you won't listen,
but don't do this alone.

349
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:21,359
- I have to do this alone.
- A normal vampire is strong.

350
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:24,819
Darla took us all down
without breaking stride.

351
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:27,819
She's stronger because
of what's in her.

352
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,339
I know. I put it there.

353
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:33,329
Why does he have to do
everything alone?

354
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:36,609
He just can't bear
to have us see him do it.

355
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:41,190
Kill Darla? She did try to kill Cordy,
and she's a vampire.

356
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,130
Who's carrying his child.
The one thing he can never have...

357
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:48,259
...even if he lives forever.

358
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,279
Mommy?

359
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,920
Mommy?

360
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:14,970
- Mommy?
- What's wrong, honey?

361
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,779
Lost your mommy?

362
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:21,539
Let's go find her together.

363
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:24,569
You're a brave woman.

364
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:27,079
About to have one.

365
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:31,000
Taking the other one out to play.

366
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:36,140
I love children.
I could just eat them up.

367
00:31:56,849 --> 00:32:01,630
It's all right. It's just a dream.
She can't hurt you.

368
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,990
I have to talk to Wes.

369
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,839
It was a dream,
but it was like a vision.

370
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,500
- About what?
- About what's inside Darla.

371
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:20,259
This Tro-Clon thing, the prophecies
say that it will be born...

372
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:22,710
...or it will arise?

373
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,480
The Middle English, arezan, and the
Gothic, urazan, both mean "to appear. "

374
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:32,900
Angel's not answering.
Should I leave a message?

375
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,410
Just try his pager.

376
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:38,309
There's a reference
to it being burren...

377
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:40,430
...which is Middle English
for "to be born. "

378
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,049
Well, we found Angel's beeper.

379
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:55,309
What is it?
What is the vision trying to tell you?

380
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,710
I think they're trying to tell me
why Darla is craving younger victims.

381
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,059
I don't think my mom is back here.

382
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:09,410
Are you sure? Did you look?

383
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,160
I don't see anybody.

384
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,720
There you are. Where have you been?

385
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:28,009
I told you not to wander off.

386
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,170
You so wanna play the good guy.

387
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,500
Yeah, you're the good guy,
who did this to me.

388
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,559
You have the face,
but you don't know the hunger.

389
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,319
It pounds. It won't go away.

390
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,779
- You can't stop it!
- I'll stop it!

391
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,469
How could you put this in me?
I hate you!

392
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,559
They breathe. They breathe and pound.

393
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,949
I don't breathe, you idiot!
You can't strangle me!

394
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:26,289
I'm not gonna strangle you.

395
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:30,309
Go on, do it.

396
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,659
Do it.

397
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,969
- Do it, do it! It won't stop!
- No, it won't.

398
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,199
- Darla, listen, it has a soul.
- What?

399
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,710
- It has a heartbeat, it has a soul.
- Not my child!

400
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,599
Our child. That's why you've
been craving pure blood.

401
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,320
That's why! It has a soul.

402
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,250
- No, it doesn't.
- It does.

403
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,210
- It can't.
- Yes, it does.

404
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,320
Drink this.

405
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:23,480
- Pig's blood?
- You'll get used to--

406
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,269
You're not alone in this.
We'll deal with this together.

407
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:36,360
Gosh, I'm the luckiest vampire girl
in the whole world.

408
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,570
- Get away from me.
- Try and get some sleep.

409
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,269
How's Cordy?
She wanna come up and visit?

410
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,110
- If she goes near Cordy or Fred--
- I know.

411
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,969
Don't underestimate her. She's
stronger than all of us right now.

412
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:09,710
Don't go near Darla without me,
Gunn and a lot of crossbows.

413
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,280
- You understand?
- Yeah. And if I forget...

414
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,909
- ...I have a nice reminder.
- That goes for you too, Fred.

415
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:19,739
Got you.

416
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:25,699
I guess you're gonna be a father.

417
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:31,489
- Guess I am.
- I felt it in my dream.

418
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,460
The same thing you did
when you found her.

419
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,440
- It has a soul.
- Angel has a soul. It makes sense.

420
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:45,010
As much as any of this does.

421
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,659
Angel, even with a soul...

422
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:53,940
...she could give birth
to what's in the prophecies.

423
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,650
The thing that's come
to kill and burn us all?

424
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,050
I know that.
I also know that child is mine.

425
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,760
- Right.
- Well.

426
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,239
Another big fun day
at Angel Investigations.

427
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,510
- Let's pour ourselves a good, stiff--
- Uh-oh.

428
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:17,409
A good, stiff uh-oh?

429
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:22,869
Remember when I said I thought I might
be off on my earlier calculations?

430
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:27,539
And Wes said the Tro-Clon
would "arise" or "be born" or both.

431
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:33,710
And arepare is Latin for "arrive"
or "come to," as from a deep sleep.

432
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,840
- Fred!
- Right.

433
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:39,820
I believe that whatever this thing is,
it's arriving about...

434
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,179
...three, two, now.

435
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:16,530
The weight of time is heavy on the
world, and all men born must die.

436
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,510
But there are worlds where dreamers
dream and sleepers sleep...

437
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:23,989
...and patiently await.

438
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,340
As pledged in Kaladan by Kadshi...

439
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,809
...one shall awaken in the first year
of the final century.

440
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,460
That one who lived before
and joined Kadshi in the great sleep.

441
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,250
Arise, as was promised and foretold.
Arise.

442
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,489
Arise!

443
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:44,269
Welcome to the 21st century.

444
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,469
Angelus is here. You'll see him soon.

445
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:51,730
You haven't used your muscles
in a long time.

446
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:55,670
It will be a while before you're
strong enough to--

447
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,820
Just tell me where he is.
