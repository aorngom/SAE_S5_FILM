1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:04,070
- Previously:
- You know Lilah Morgan.

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:06,120
- I'm Gavin Park.
- Boring.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,589
They use you as a slave.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,929
- Fugitive!
- Oh, no!

5
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:14,189
Handsome man saved me
from the monsters.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,059
- You gonna be all right?
- I'm fine. Go.

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,739
These visions are killing me.

8
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:30,679
Get dressed and get out.
Next time I see you, I'll kill you.

9
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,579
- He's a hard shaman to find.
- You know what they say...

10
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,500
...life's full of surprises.

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,780
No, Gunn, you misunderstand.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,060
I mean, I'm not saying
that we act differently.

13
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,840
I just think we should
be gentle in our--

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,219
- Evening, Cordy.
- Hey, Cordelia.

15
00:00:57,729 --> 00:00:59,450
- How was that?
- It felt genuine.

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,009
B plus, C minus.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,329
A girl can tell.

18
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:11,469
Fred, if you feel comfortable enough
grading our sincerity...

19
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,620
...how about joining us
for the meal?

20
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:18,290
Wasn't that the point
of coming downstairs?

21
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,500
I guess that'd be okay.

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,579
I don't mean to rush you back into
the 21st century, but use chopsticks.

23
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,079
Or a fork, maybe.
You remember forks, don't you?

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,680
Who could forget? Fork. Pitchfork.
Fork it over. Fork in the road.

25
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,870
One I'm not ready to take yet.

26
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,319
- Hello, again.
- Nice day.

27
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,719
- I know what you're doing.
- You do?

28
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,590
- Told you.
- You're being fake nice and sensitive.

29
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,390
Poor Cordelia's on edge because
she hasn't had a vision in a while.

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,239
For your information,
I look forward to my next vision.

31
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,830
- You do?
- Why not? The Powers That Be chose me.

32
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,020
- Who am I to refuse?
- Great.

33
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,789
How about using that vision thing
to find out where Angel is?

34
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,129
Because I don't care.

35
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,240
Cordelia doesn't choose to have
a vision. The Powers send them to her.

36
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,020
- Think of them as gifts.
- "Having my head torn open...

37
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,580
...and hot lava poured
into my skull" gifts.

38
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,449
Excuse me.

39
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,300
Uh, hi.

40
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,479
I didn't hear you sneak up on us.

41
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,169
Must be those tastefully expensive
Gucci loafers. Our fault.

42
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,930
He's not a client. He's Gavin Park,
attorney with Wolfram and Hart.

43
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,659
Pleased to meet you.

44
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,270
New player?

45
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:04,729
Now that we've had this lovely
reintroduction, I suggest you piss off.

46
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,900
- Is there a problem?
- No, no problem.

47
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,229
- No, Mr. Park was just leaving.
- No, actually I just arrived.

48
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,569
This is a list of 57 violations
for your hotel...

49
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,879
...including earthquake proofing,
asbestos and termites.

50
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,270
I've filed a copy
with the city planning office.

51
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,289
Gee, 57. Is that a lot?

52
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,960
I'll be in touch.

53
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,759
Yeah, okay...

54
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,919
...minion of darkness, Satan's toady.

55
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,349
But that is a nice suit.

56
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,050
Fred! Good to see you out and about.

57
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,479
It is, isn't it? Out and about.

58
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,659
I've been forking with Gunn.

59
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:08,689
You all right?

60
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,879
Talk to me.

61
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,250
There's a coin and two clawed things.

62
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:20,040
It's in Chinatown, I think.
An herbalist shop.

63
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,160
- Ah!
- Easy.

64
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:26,170
- Okay.
- Come on.

65
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,170
Okay, I'm fine.
It just caught me off guard a little.

66
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:33,959
Go find the coin.

67
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,889
It has a hole in it.

68
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,579
- Yes?
- Cordelia...

69
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,129
...that beast you saw,
did it have four or five claws?

70
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,389
Five.

71
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,000
You're certain?

72
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,600
Pretty certain.

73
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,850
- Anything of interest yet?
- Sure, lots.

74
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,660
H is a fascinating letter.
Helicopters, helium, hernias--

75
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,730
- Did you happen to notice "herbs"?
- I did.

76
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,670
Oh, right. There are, let's see....
Five herbalist shops in Chinatown.

77
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:38,560
- You got a name for these things yet?
- Circling.

78
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,079
We looking at either a Wan-shang Dhole
or a Cantonese Fook-beast.

79
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,860
I say we figure out what they are
after we find that coin.

80
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,089
Sounds like a plan.

81
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,610
Hey, Fred, I need you
to do something for me.

82
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,060
I told you,
it's about finding the coin.

83
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,329
- It's me.
- I'm fine.

84
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,029
I'm not leaving
until you open the door.

85
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,069
I mean it, Cordelia. Open up.

86
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,790
See? Fine.

87
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,879
- They're getting worse.
- I'm feeling better.

88
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,040
Once I get a little protein in me,
I'll be good as new. Honest.

89
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,699
Go declaw those things.

90
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,449
- Fred will take you home.
- I don't need to go.

91
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,519
There's nothing else you can do here.
Just get some rest, okay?

92
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,389
- No--
- Okay?

93
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,910
Okay.

94
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,389
Five herb shops, we've been to four.

95
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,100
How come it's always
the last place we look?

96
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,329
I suppose it's one
of the unwritten laws of being a dick.

97
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,250
A sleuth, a gumshoe, a Sherlock.

98
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:29,410
You use the word "dick" again
and we're gonna have a problem.

99
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,860
- What's the name of this place anyway?
- Van Hoa Dong.

100
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,480
It should be up here on the left.
How was Cordelia?

101
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,279
She said she was fine.

102
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,909
- You don't believe her?
- Here we go.

103
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,470
Next time, we're hitting
the last place first.

104
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:14,620
- Your kind not welcome here.
- Can't a brother buy some tea?

105
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,090
- Not you, him. Vampire not welcome.
- This is a public facility.

106
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,070
And any being may enter.
We're looking for an ancient coin.

107
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,370
You think some fancy flipping and
a little hollering can intimidate us?

108
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,639
- Okay, that creeps me out.
- You two take Grandma.

109
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,120
Damn, Grandma and Grandpa got game.

110
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,059
If we can just find that coin
before they come to.

111
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,799
Guys, over here.

112
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:55,379
Asbestos disposal? What?

113
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,110
I think that's mine.

114
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,289
My printer's down,
so I networked into yours.

115
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:06,149
Thanks for asking.

116
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,740
This hasn't been announced yet, but
I've been moved into Special Projects.

117
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,460
- From real estate?
- With karmically damaged property...

118
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:21,320
...not to mention demon infestation,
the partners felt I'd be useful.

119
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,159
I'm working on something aimed
at Angel Investigations.

120
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,399
If you're interested,
I'd love to have you on my team.

121
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,789
Your team? I'll be right in.

122
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,769
Let me tell you about your team.
You don't have one.

123
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,659
- You may have Lindsey's old office--
- I earned this office, as did Lindsey.

124
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,960
He sacrificed his flesh and blood,
had his hand cut off fighting Angel.

125
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,919
What are you doing?
Building code violations.

126
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,200
- I'm fighting Angel in my own way.
- Yeah, I bet he's really terrified.

127
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:04,909
Okay, ready for bed.
Face washed, teeth brushed.

128
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,519
Tired, tired! You can go now.

129
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,309
Fred?

130
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,960
- Okay, you can go now, Fred.
- Sorry, it's been so long.

131
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,899
Not a problem. Take it with you.

132
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,460
Enjoy that peanut-y goodness
in your own home.

133
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,429
- Wait, Angel said that--
- That you should wait until he calls.

134
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:37,419
But, as you can see, I'm fine.
I'm better than fine.

135
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,919
- I'm right as rain.
- I never understood that saying.

136
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,200
How is rain right?
Or wrong, for that matter.

137
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,029
I suppose if there's a flood,
it's wrong. And speaking of floods...

138
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,070
...what's it like to have a vision?

139
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,740
Wow. You know, next to you,
I am downright linear.

140
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,889
Do you see things, or smell them,
or just know? In-your-stomach know.

141
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:08,620
Like in fifth grade, when I saw
Grayson Wells, I knew we'd go steady.

142
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,169
We didn't, but looking back,
it feels like we did. Is it like that?

143
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,250
Okay, time to go.

144
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:20,620
Has anybody ever told you
you're exactly like Lassie?

145
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,000
You're like Angel's Lassie.
Sure, he does the saving...

146
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:30,460
...but it's your visions that tell him
that Timmy's trapped in the well.

147
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,610
He really needs and depends on you.

148
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,340
Well, thanks. I'd be flattered,
except that Lassie's a dog.

149
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,649
Dennis, a little help here.
See, I'm not alone. I have a ghost.

150
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,190
Bye. We'll have to....

151
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,769
Are you all right?

152
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:16,159
It was a demon.
An icky, boil-covered demon.

153
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,679
A storefront downtown
on the corner of 5th and something.

154
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:24,210
And there was a key. I should
draw you a picture of the key.

155
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:26,720
Cordy.

156
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,759
Oh, God.

157
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:35,580
Cordy, we should talk about this.

158
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,279
- You can't ignore it.
- I don't wanna talk.

159
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,320
What's there to say,
except gross, yuck and unclean?

160
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:50,070
- Like you're not thinking it.
- Has this ever happened before?

161
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,210
Earlier tonight.

162
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,799
Are you saying your visions
had a physical manifestation?

163
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,039
Yeah.

164
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:06,159
- Did this have anything to do with--?
- The yuck monster? Yeah.

165
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,919
It must be a mistake. The Powers
wouldn't do this to me on purpose.

166
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,629
I mean, I'm a part of their team.

167
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,950
Why would anybody do this on purpose?

168
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:33,070
We have to figure this out, and now.
Gunn?

169
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,980
I had this auntie who got
this crusty stuff on her back.

170
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,360
- Turns out she was allergic to fish.
- That was helpful.

171
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,820
Why would The Powers communicate
in this way?

172
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,610
Maybe we could ask them.

173
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,889
You used the word "communicate. "
Everything's made of energy, right?

174
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,990
Light waves, radio waves, X-rays, even
brain waves are all electric energy.

175
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,019
The visions are being
communicated somehow.

176
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,309
Maybe we could trace the frequency.

177
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,080
Yes, of course. Well done, Fred.

178
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,049
Gunn, go to the hotel
and get me some books.

179
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,980
We need to research that coin.
Angel, find that demon and the key.

180
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,779
I'm not going anywhere.

181
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,850
You see what the visions
are doing to Cordy.

182
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,250
We have to assume that the coin
and the key are very significant.

183
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:33,169
So is Cordelia.
If I go out, how can I help her?

184
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,549
By trusting me. I have an idea.

185
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,409
I want the key and I want it now.

186
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,200
Which key might that be?

187
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:03,350
- Man.
- Did you lose the original?

188
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,059
It looks like this.

189
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,650
Yes, of course.
This should only take a moment.

190
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:24,309
I know you're disappointed
you couldn't go with Angel.

191
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,059
Right. Why would I want to be
with a cute woman...

192
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,029
...when I could be out slaying
an ugly, boil-covered demon monster?

193
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,960
- I can't apologize enough.
- Hey, I just follow orders.

194
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,480
It's just that I'm still so jumpy.
But I guess that's why you're here--

195
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:48,589
- Who are you?
- Exterminators. You can't come in.

196
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:52,269
At night? I don't think so.

197
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:56,609
Get some of them books
out of Wes' office. You'll be okay.

198
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:59,009
I need to talk to this nice man.

199
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,630
Show me your work order before
I start doing some exterminating.

200
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,269
- How is she?
- We're finding out. Did you get--?

201
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,799
His Royal Badness. Would you talk
to her? She's resisting the process.

202
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,180
Process?

203
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:28,190
Oh, my idea.
The Host reads people's auras.

204
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:32,250
That connects him to
The Powers That Be. I'm thinking--

205
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:38,099
Sure, he can reverse the process
and trace the calls to The Powers.

206
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:41,329
Way outside my area of expertise.

207
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:45,269
But, hey, who knew
William Shatner could sing?

208
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,349
Okay, bad example.

209
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,000
Was it there?

210
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:55,539
I'll be ticked if I'm Phantom of
the Opera and there wasn't a key.

211
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,369
- It was where you said.
- Good.

212
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:01,509
Why won't you let
Lorne trace the visions?

213
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,480
I'm not morally against letting demons
into my subconscious for a lookie-loo.

214
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,180
But with The Powers That Be
doing this whole Book of Job thing...

215
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:13,900
...it's more noise in my head.

216
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,920
- Maybe he can make the noise stop.
- Yeah.

217
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:21,559
- Isn't it what you want?
- Yes. No. Well, no.

218
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:27,269
I hate looking and feeling like this.
But if I lose the visions...

219
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,160
...I wouldn't be able to help you
anymore. You wouldn't need me.

220
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,529
That's not why I need you.
You're important.

221
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:43,220
The visions are just extras, like
a Hurst shifter or Craiger wheels.

222
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,130
- Did you just compare me to a car?
- It was a very nice car.

223
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,440
- I guess it's better than a dog.
- Cordy, let us try and help, okay?

224
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:57,670
Okay.

225
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:04,819
All right, like I told you earlier,
you shouldn't even feel a thing.

226
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,269
You ready?

227
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,670
Now, I want you to relax.

228
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:17,000
Picture yourself outdoors,
in a field or on a mountain.

229
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,799
- I like the mountains.
- Beautiful.

230
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,079
You're on a mountaintop. It's warm,
the sky is blue, full of fluffy clouds.

231
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,009
You're Julie Andrews
in The Sound of Music,

232
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:34,119
You're relaxed and you're spinning,
and the camera's swirling, and--

233
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,670
Careful, honey, you've got some power.

234
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,930
Sorry. All that spinning
was freaking me out.

235
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,130
My fault, my fault.
I just love that movie so much.

236
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,319
Ready to try again? Let's go looking
for The Powers That Be.

237
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:54,059
See if we can reach out
and touch someone.

238
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,130
If we don't have your 1099,
Payroll can't cut you a check.

239
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:07,609
I know, I know.
Hey, you know a good tax guy?

240
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,690
Let's just finish the job,
then we'll talk about taxes.

241
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,890
You're the boss.
John Hancock, and done.

242
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:27,299
- You remember what we talked about?
- All that fire? How could I forget?

243
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,380
Cordy? Cordy!

244
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,470
- Well?
- I think she got the message.

245
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:45,009
Is Lorne going to be okay?

246
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,490
He's fine.
He's unconscious, but he's fine.

247
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,779
You're the one I'm worried about.

248
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:56,589
Am I a bad person?

249
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,269
Am I a horrible person?
I know I can be snippy sometimes.

250
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,569
This isn't happening
because you're bad.

251
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,630
If anything,
it's because you're strong.

252
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,019
Stronger than you realize.

253
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,569
I'm not.

254
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,950
I know what I said earlier...

255
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:26,099
...but I don't want
the visions anymore.

256
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:30,359
I tried to be brave, I did.

257
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:36,150
But I'm just scared now.
I'm scared all the time.

258
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,190
I mean, look at me.

259
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,460
What could be so important
that The Powers would do this?

260
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,619
- I don't understand.
- I don't either.

261
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:04,740
Angel, I really think
you should hear this.

262
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:17,380
This better be important.

263
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,019
- Did you make contact?
- The visions aren't from The Powers.

264
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:27,779
Sure, steal my thunder. Next time,
you can get thrown across the room.

265
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,769
- Who's sending the visions?
- I don't know.

266
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,059
But it's local, earthbound
and pretty authentic.

267
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,240
A person can mistake it
for the real deal.

268
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:42,710
- Someone's hacked into her head?
- Transmitting false data.

269
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,059
I know it's a mile-long list,
but start looking at enemies.

270
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,369
Who wants to get to you?
Who has the resources?

271
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,769
And who'd be willing to mess up
a pretty face like Cordelia's?

272
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,589
Concentrate.

273
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:06,519
- Damn it.
- Jeez, I hate traps. Don't you?

274
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,279
I was gonna knock, but you seemed
so focused. I hated to interrupt.

275
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,089
- How did you get in?
- Why didn't the vampire alarms go off?

276
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,730
Your colleague Gavin,
he helped me out.

277
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,400
Colleague, mortal enemy,
however you play it here.

278
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:27,930
So can we get down to business?
I think you might be looking for these.

279
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:32,150
What do you think?

280
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,869
- I think you might be right.
- Good. Then we're done here.

281
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,269
You got what you wanted,
now it's over.

282
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:49,849
Actually, it's not over. You'll need
these to complete the mission.

283
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,390
There's no mission. We're through.

284
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,339
That's where you're wrong.
We're just getting started.

285
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:01,150
There's a man who's unfairly
imprisoned. You'll save him.

286
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:04,579
Isn't that what you do, save people?

287
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:07,150
You'll need those
to complete your mission.

288
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:11,210
I see. I do this for you,
you stop sending the killer visions.

289
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,579
No. You'll do this for me
because I tell you to.

290
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,660
I know what you're thinking.

291
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,099
You could kill me, but you'll
never be able to stop the visions.

292
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,839
Those skin problems on
what's her name weren't intended.

293
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,650
Just a side effect.

294
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:33,160
Her name's Cordelia,
and you will help her.

295
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:43,329
So where's this jail?

296
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:49,819
This is why I chose you
for the mission.

297
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,480
I needed a man of character.
A champion of good, a warrior.

298
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:59,589
And someone who could travel in and out
of a fortressed demon dimension.

299
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,849
How's Cordelia?

300
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:13,220
Fred and Gunn are looking after her.
You figure it out?

301
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,720
I think so. Something you
won't like to hear...

302
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:19,539
...is that both artifacts
are objects of good.

303
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:24,119
- The Chinese guy and the boil guy....
- Aligned with the forces of good.

304
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:28,470
Damn. So hard to tell these days.
They should wear lapel pins.

305
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,980
Well, the inscriptions on
the coin and the key match.

306
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,799
They work together to transport you
to the other dimension.

307
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,519
Do we know what this dimension is like?
Besides fortress-y and demon-y.

308
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,230
Based on the burn scars
Cordy received...

309
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:48,339
- ...fire's not out of the question.
- Fire.

310
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:52,640
And if the man is imprisoned,
I'd imagine there may be guards.

311
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,519
Guards.

312
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:59,170
If Wolfram and Hart are behind
this mission, it can't be good.

313
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:05,380
Just because Lilah tells you
this man is wrongly imprisoned...

314
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,440
- ...doesn't make it so.
- You're right.

315
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:11,240
- This violates what you stand for.
- Right again.

316
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,819
Then you'll let me go too.

317
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,789
Right-- No. I need you to stay here
in case anything goes wrong.

318
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,950
Now, show me how it works.

319
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,289
I believe it's fairly simple. Ready?

320
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,079
This should take you there
and bring you back.

321
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,250
You're sure I can't come with you?

322
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,569
Take care of Cordy.

323
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,799
Sure, because it'd be too easy
if I could actually defend myself.

324
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,180
I've still got the key.

325
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:23,910
- Hi.
- Hi.

326
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,269
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Yeah. What about him?

327
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:34,880
Him? He's supposed to be here.

328
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,619
Do you know how bad a guy's
gotta be before he's sent to us?

329
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,980
We're a very high-end institution.

330
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,279
- And it's your job to keep him here?
- Yeah. I'm Skip.

331
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,180
Angel.

332
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,059
So you live in here, Skip?

333
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:58,170
No, I commute.
It's not too bad. About 20 minutes.

334
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:01,920
What keeps him in the fire?

335
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:04,529
My will.

336
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,650
How come he's not screaming in pain?

337
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,740
He is. My will prevents him
from being heard.

338
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:15,430
There's only so many "The pain!
Make it stops" you can listen to...

339
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,650
...before it bugs the crap out of you.

340
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:19,990
I see your point.

341
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:26,019
You're a vampire? How come it smells
like you work for The Powers?

342
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:28,390
Because I do.

343
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,839
But you're here to try
to rescue this guy?

344
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,869
We're on the same side.
Shouldn't you help keep him here?

345
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:41,329
I know. Long story. Involves a girl.
I don't like it any better than you.

346
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:45,859
So I really can't talk you
out of this?

347
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:48,009
Sorry. I wish I could.

348
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,839
I guess we'll just have to agree to--

349
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,690
--disagree.

350
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,589
Skip, are you okay?

351
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,359
Good. Sorry about this.

352
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,349
You know what to do,
anything goes wrong.

353
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,930
Pop goes the weasel.

354
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,660
No one at the firm thought
you could do it, except me.

355
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:38,930
You're a remarkable man.

356
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:42,380
Yeah. And you're an evil bitch.

357
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:47,880
Let's finish this. Take care
of Cordelia, you get your guy.

358
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,700
This should only take a moment.

359
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,179
Hello?

360
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,449
Wesley, it worked. She's okay.

361
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,710
It's just business.

362
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,989
Right. Just business.

363
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,960
Don't come at me through Cordelia.

364
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:46,329
You play that card a second time,
and I'll kill you.

365
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:14,929
I'm glad you're feeling better, but....

366
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:17,889
You're not really a foodie. I know.

367
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:23,739
But I saw this great big industrial
kitchen that we have and never use...

368
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,050
...and I thought that--

369
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:31,900
One of these days, we should get
someone in here that can cook.

370
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,659
Here we are.

371
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:43,730
Here we are.

372
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,719
Angel?

373
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:50,400
What you did for me was...

374
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:55,230
...unbelievably selfless
and brave and amazing.

375
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,130
It's great to know
that my next vision...

376
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,110
...will just be painful and not
turn me into the Elephant Man.

377
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,130
I hear a big "but" coming.

378
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,750
What if that guy you freed is
someone that's truly terrible?

379
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,469
They won this time,
and it's my fault.

380
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,860
It's not about winning,
it's about what's at stake.

381
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:18,980
In this scenario, you were way
more important than winning.

382
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,099
I can't worry about that guy
I set free. I did what I had to do.

383
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:28,719
I'll just deal with the consequences
when they happen.

384
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:00,400
You're a difficult man to find, señor.
Do you know why I'm here?

385
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:05,250
You are my last hope.

386
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:08,670
I've been told you're very powerful,
very wise.

387
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:12,300
I've tried everything,
and I can't get rid of it. I ask you:

388
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,940
What is this thing growing inside
of me, and how is it possible?

389
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,480
- The father is also a...?
- Vampire?

390
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:28,010
Yes. Though not a very good one.

391
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,260
- I will need some blood.
- Well....

392
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:36,690
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

393
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,230
Men are such babies.

394
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,559
This has never failed me.

395
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,989
I cannot help you. No man can.
This is not meant to be known.

396
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:47,809
Yeah, yeah.
Like I haven't heard that before.

397
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:52,289
I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

398
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,219
Time to go visit Daddy.
