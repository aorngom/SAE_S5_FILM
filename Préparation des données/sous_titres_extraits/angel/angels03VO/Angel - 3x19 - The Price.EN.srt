1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,979
Previously:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,480
We're back. What happened?

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,530
- Wes thought Angel--
- Was gonna kill Connor.

4
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:12,250
When he left with that child,
he wasn't planning on coming back.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,140
- The portal led to Quor-toth.
- There're no portals to Quor-toth.

6
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:21,890
Going to Quor-toth
would require dark magics.

7
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:24,649
We don't have the resources
to conjure that dark power.

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,399
I think we do.

9
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,399
Lilah, give him anything he wants.

10
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,770
You're messing with primordial
powers of darkness here.

11
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,710
- Where is he?
- You don't want to do this.

12
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:44,310
Lilah!

13
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,810
- They found Wesley?
- He's not out of the woods yet.

14
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:51,369
Your being here can help.

15
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,609
You took my son!
I'll never forgive you!

16
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,469
I'm so sorry.

17
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:17,750
Angel, you and I have fought
side by side on more than one occasion.

18
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,120
Fellow warriors, shoulder to shoulder.

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,569
By now, my counsel
must assuredly hold weight.

20
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,239
- So I beseech you to heed my words.
- Okay.

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,409
Pomegranate Mist is the wrong
color for this room.

22
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,379
What?

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,689
We thought-- Actually,
I thought, and Groo agreed...

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,500
...that since you have
to repaint the room anyway...

25
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,189
...maybe you'd like a change,
for a change.

26
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,780
- Groo agreed?
- Don't mock. He has good color sense.

27
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:54,250
Sunburst Splendor is a hue
more worthy of a champion.

28
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,489
Or perhaps this unique one
called "Pur-plah."

29
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,859
Purple. Yet you have no problems
pronouncing "pomegranate."

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,750
- It was my mother's name.
- What are the odds.

31
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,229
- Hang on. Where you going with that?
- Tossing it.

32
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,340
- It's an antique.
- It's charcoal.

33
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,969
We're not throwing it out.
The wall color stays too.

34
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,099
Look, guys, I really appreciate
everybody's help...

35
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,639
...but I just want everything back
to the way it was. Or close to it.

36
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,500
Not gonna be, you know.

37
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,750
Unless we pay for dishonest-to-goodness
contractors, those cracks will stay.

38
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,180
- Let them.
- Sure.

39
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,389
Maybe we can even dump our trash here.

40
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,949
The old gives-the-place-
character philosophy.

41
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,599
Guess that served you pretty well,
living in rotted-out mansions and....

42
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,819
I don't know why
I bought this for him.

43
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,330
It was a whim, I guess.
Thought he'd like to look at it.

44
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,039
Snow. Doesn't ever snow
in Southern California.

45
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,150
It did once.

46
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,729
We shouldn't waste time fixing up
my place when we have work to do.

47
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,969
What work?

48
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,539
Our jobs. The business.

49
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,750
We're neglecting our cases.

50
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,000
Angel, we don't have any cases.

51
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,889
We haven't had a call in over a week.

52
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,090
Really? Well, somebody
ought to be downstairs...

53
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,319
...in case a walk-in should...walk in.

54
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,770
Because we get those sometimes.

55
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,639
Never on Sundays.

56
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,979
Hello?

57
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,379
Angel Investigations?

58
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,170
Hey!

59
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,589
Anybody here?

60
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,889
Hey! Hello?

61
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:33,639
Look, unless you want me
to take my business elsewhere....

62
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:37,810
Fine. Probably couldn't
find my dog anyway.

63
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,180
Yes! Hi. I hope that you weren't....

64
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,139
May I help you?

65
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,980
What was that?

66
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:55,699
I was just saying, if you're looking
for Angel Investigations, I'm he.

67
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,420
Him. Angel. And you are?

68
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:01,040
I, uh....

69
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,779
I need....

70
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,930
Don't be embarrassed. Whatever your
problems are, I'm here to listen.

71
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,500
- And, you know, help, of course.
- We have to go.

72
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,720
What? Is there something wrong?

73
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,019
The pentagram. Don't worry.
That's an old case.

74
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,740
That's done. I'm totally here
to give you my...full attention.

75
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,009
When did we get the statue
for the lobby?

76
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,269
It's just you.

77
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:33,639
Can we get rid of this stain?
It scared off a client.

78
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,889
I think he was a client.
He barely said two words then ran out.

79
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,899
Well, you know, some people
can be pretty close-mouthed.

80
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:48,149
We've never talked about everything
that happened while I was away.

81
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,529
- You know the gist of it.
- I got loads of gist.

82
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,389
What I don't got is the specifics.

83
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,230
Specifically, that five-pointed
doodad decorating our lobby...

84
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,519
...and the voodoo that
you dood-- Did over it.

85
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,550
- Cordy--
- I know you don't wanna talk...

86
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,899
...but don't mess with dark magics
like it doesn't matter.

87
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,779
- It was a waste of time.
- I should know what spell it was.

88
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,560
There's a cosmic price
for using primordial powers.

89
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,329
There could be repercussions.

90
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,259
And the one person who could help us
with that isn't around anymore.

91
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,310
Not going there. Just saying....

92
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,939
Run away, avoid talking about this,
but you know...

93
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:34,629
...stuff we do in the past comes back
to bite us in our respective ass-i.

94
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,230
- What you did--
- So I wasn't thinking too clearly.

95
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,920
I was drunk on my own son's blood...

96
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,620
...slipped into my food
by Wolfram & Hart.

97
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,240
And my head was clouded with rage over
a trusted friend stealing my child.

98
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,550
Damn it, Cordelia,
you got me talking about this.

99
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,170
You probably just needed to vent.

100
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,149
Why didn't you call me?

101
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,819
I didn't want to mess up
your vacation.

102
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:13,279
I just thought one of us
should be happy.

103
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,410
But I could've helped.
I could've done something.

104
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,970
- There was nothing you could--
- How do you know that?

105
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,980
What makes you so sure? I've got
a hotline to The fricking Powers.

106
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,639
I could've gotten a vision to warn us.

107
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,750
Plus, I've got demon in me now. So
maybe there is some untapped power...

108
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:38,230
...that could've help find Connor
before, you know, before....

109
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,769
- Who needed to vent?
- I should've been here for you.

110
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,850
You were. I mean, you are.
You're always--

111
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,500
Look, I'm just trying to move on
like you told me to.

112
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:59,049
I'm just trying not to just be so
into my problems, into my head.

113
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,769
Just focus on something else
for a while, you know?

114
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,259
Sure. Yeah, I get that.

115
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,200
But next time, you call me.

116
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,259
All right.

117
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,039
There is something you can do for me.

118
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,080
Find me a case to work on. Please.

119
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,549
More. Like the last ones.

120
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:44,649
Not to be rude,
but you've been here six hours.

121
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:48,600
- And, like, 100 peach smoothies.
- You're not well, sir.

122
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:51,149
You haven't taken a whiz yet.

123
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:53,799
- Please.
- We don't take credit cards.

124
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:57,639
- Water! Water, then!
- Leave, or I'll call the police.

125
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,779
- We're thirsty!
- Okay.

126
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:05,440
I hear congratulations are in order.

127
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:10,240
Gavin. What a pleasant surprise.

128
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,929
People are saying you've made
great strides forward with Angel.

129
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,149
- What are you talking about?
- You don't know?

130
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,320
He tried to kill one of his people
at a hospital.

131
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:24,679
Gav, you're quick.
Maybe your next news flash...

132
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,730
...will involve that newfangled
invention called fire.

133
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,860
Despite our differences, when
a coworker pats you on the back--

134
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:35,269
I check for the knife.

135
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,480
Angel tried to kill a human...

136
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:42,740
...bringing him one step closer
to his dark side and to us.

137
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,990
Dark side, shmark side.
Remember a year ago?

138
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,559
- Wine cellar? Slaughter?
- They were lawyers.

139
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,960
- And you are...?
- A realist.

140
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,230
Angel tried to smother a friend.
We're making progress.

141
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:00,110
We could make more. Get them
together again, see what happens.

142
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,360
Might even make up
for you losing that baby.

143
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:06,919
Nice try. But unlike you,
I'm ahead of the game.

144
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,190
Angel tried to kill his friend,
kidnapped and tortured Linwood...

145
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,759
...and performed forbidden magics.
All on my watch.

146
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,740
- Congratulations, Lilah.
- Thanks, Gavin.

147
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,679
- Can we stop feigning now?
- Sure.

148
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,419
It's funny.

149
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,120
Sad, actually.

150
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,389
I keep expecting to find--

151
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,360
It's weird seeing Angel at that desk.

152
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,950
It was his when I came.
It's right that it's his again.

153
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,830
Yeah, but things have cooled down
a little since....

154
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,870
I'm just saying maybe it's time to....

155
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,840
Look, he doesn't have
to forgive Wesley.

156
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,129
Glad you think so 'cause,
not happening.

157
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,120
Right, he shouldn't.
But isn't there some way...

158
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,960
...to come back from this?

159
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,679
If Wes returns with Connor. Even then,
Angel'd probably kill him on principle.

160
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,090
- You don't really think that.
- He took the man's son.

161
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:16,289
Probably best we never mention
the guy's name again.

162
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,889
I give up. Tried soaking it out,
tried scrubbing it out.

163
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,919
No question:
We've got ring around the lobby.

164
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,009
I say we toss in the towel
and buy a big-ass throw rug.

165
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:40,190
- Who's with me?
- That honor is mine, princess.

166
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,210
Oh....

167
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,169
Groo, honey, will you do me a favor
and dump out this bucket? Thanks.

168
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,159
Cordelia.

169
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,200
He's such a sweetie.

170
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,799
- So loyal and loving, like a puppy dog.
- Cordy.

171
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,669
I know, that didn't sound very good,
but he is. A puppy dog.

172
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,259
A sexy, well-built,
go-all-night puppy dog.

173
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,399
- Okay, that sounded worse.
- Cor--

174
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,340
No. You want me to say something
to Angel about Wesley. Sorry.

175
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,820
Can't. Won't.

176
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,389
Why? Why "can't," "won't" you?

177
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,590
You've known them both longer
than anybody. Angel'd listen.

178
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,679
But he doesn't want to,
which is why I won't burden him.

179
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,340
Look, whatever he did, it's Wesley.
You care about him, I know.

180
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:37,009
Can you imagine his pain?
How bad he's feeling?

181
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:41,419
Angel's feelings are the only ones
I care about. He's my priority.

182
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,740
I got dosed with demon DNA for him.

183
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,230
I'm semi-demon, and I still
don't know what that means.

184
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,830
The random floaty-ness
and seizure-less visions are keen.

185
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,840
Except it's hard to tell when I'm--

186
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,100
Angel?

187
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:01,149
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

188
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,340
Big brouhaha at the juice bar.

189
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:06,730
Light on the "ha-ha."
Some guy's cracking up.

190
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,620
Here, key to the safe.
Take it. Just don't hurt me.

191
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,570
One minute you're there,
shocked-looking. Then:

192
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,279
- You're thrown across the room.
- Can we talk later?

193
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,879
- I'm working.
- Look out. He has Ebola or something.

194
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:29,370
This Ebola is a weapon
forged in magic?

195
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:30,970
Forged in monkey poo.

196
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:36,809
Okay, sir, you want to just
put down the Super Size, or....

197
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,429
I know you.

198
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,179
- You do?
- He came to the office today.

199
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,809
- Didn't mention he was a mummy.
- He's not. He wasn't. He's--

200
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:51,110
Philip J. Spivey from Inglewood,
according to his license.

201
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,980
Mr. Spivey?

202
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,340
Phil?

203
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,960
Hi. Remember me?

204
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,399
We are just gonna take a walk
to my office across the street...

205
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:10,980
...and we're gonna figure out
what's what. Sound okay with you?

206
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,570
- We're thirsty!
- I'll take that as a no.

207
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:20,940
Okay, people.
Looks like we got a case.

208
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,440
Okay, let's get him on the couch.

209
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:34,139
My God, look at his face.

210
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:37,700
Fred, do we have any water
in the fridge?

211
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,559
- Few bottles, I think.
- We're gonna need them.

212
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:43,629
- Lip balm wouldn't hurt either.
- Angel.

213
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:44,980
"We"?

214
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,570
- Glad you're having fun.
- No, he kept saying "we."

215
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,919
Earlier, it was, "We have to go."
Now it's, "We're thirsty. "

216
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:56,259
So he's pretentious.
We need to talk about my vision.

217
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,039
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.

218
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,629
You think The Powers
beam me visions for fun?

219
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:05,340
They tell me when someone's in danger.
That someone is you.

220
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,850
What else is new? I wanna deal
with somebody else's problem.

221
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,830
I wanna deal with Phil of Inglewood,
who came to us this morning for help.

222
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,730
He's who we should be concerned with.
This has nothing to do with me.

223
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,289
You!

224
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,200
This is all happening because of you!

225
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,799
This is all your fault!

226
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,000
- My fault?
- That's what the sandman said.

227
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,629
I was trying to help him.
What'd he say that for?

228
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,250
He didn't. That did.

229
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:56,960
- Okay, that was a thing.
- A big, ugly slug thing.

230
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,580
- Where'd it go?
- It has vanished.

231
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:03,769
Just like the glass eels
of the Krag Swamps in UxenBlarg.

232
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,589
- Just making an observation.
- So, what was it?

233
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,200
I don't know what it is
or what it has to do with me.

234
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,200
Um.... Angel....

235
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,680
Not the hunter type.
Can't I just be moral support?

236
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,670
- Hotel's shut tight.
- I don't want anyone else infected.

237
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:35,289
- This weapon will serve me better.
- Too big for our purposes.

238
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,359
- I've had no complaints.
- Start at the third floor.

239
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,049
- Make a sweep, work your way down.
- Hey.

240
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,680
How do we know slicing and dicing
will kill Mr. Sluggo?

241
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,650
We don't. Fred's gonna hit the books,
see what we're dealing with.

242
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,890
I am? Angel, I don't even know
where to begin to look.

243
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,750
- Start with thaumogenesis.
- Thaumo--?

244
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:00,170
Creatures manifested
as a byproduct of dark magic.

245
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,259
- I'll stay and keep watch.
- Watch close.

246
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,359
This thing drank the moisture
out of his body.

247
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,210
Let's wait to see what Fred finds
before chasing it.

248
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,039
If we wait, it could find a way into
the world. I won't let that happen.

249
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,799
Let's go.

250
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,700
- I don't wanna hear it.
- I didn't say anything.

251
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,390
Let's keep it that way.

252
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,039
Well, was I wrong?

253
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,750
It's my mess.
I'm cleaning it up. What more--?

254
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,059
- You mess with Powers of Darkness--
- There's a price to pay.

255
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,319
I know. There's always a price.

256
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,970
The question is:
Is it one worth paying?

257
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,750
So was this?

258
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,039
That spell I did was for nothing. I
didn't find my son. He's gone forever.

259
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,490
Was it worth it? Would I do it again?
In a heartbeat because he was my son.

260
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,690
Angel, what are you--?

261
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:52,099
Well, go team!

262
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,740
Now that wasn't so--

263
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,500
God, I hate this.

264
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,769
I'm with you.
That creepy crawler was messed up.

265
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:07,799
With those little feelers
sticking out of its face...

266
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:09,599
...slithering like a worm
with its slimy--

267
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,269
No. I meant I hate going
through these books.

268
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,869
Yeah, books. That's rough.

269
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,430
Everything on thaumogenesis is
so cryptic...

270
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:24,240
...and full of words I've never
heard of like "amulatives."

271
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,829
I have to keep cross-referencing
"Chaldean" with "Accadian Magics."

272
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,720
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah. Accordion music. Go on.

273
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,119
Ask me to research
wave-particle dualities...

274
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,309
...or the Schrödinger Equation,
and I'm a hellcat. But this?

275
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:48,519
Angel will just have to realize that
I'm not as qualified for this as...

276
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,640
...some people.

277
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,319
Some people aren't around anymore,
so you'll have to get good at it.

278
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,170
What if I fail?
What if I can't find anything to help?

279
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,910
We'll manage. Not that I don't
prefer something I can punch...

280
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:08,150
...that doesn't make that squishy
noise when you kill it.

281
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,259
But we can handle
one little slug from hell.

282
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:08,430
"Bio-plasmic infection"?

283
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,769
- Speaking of.
- You get the e-mail?

284
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,039
The confidential one? The one
I have to use a magic bug to open?

285
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:20,849
The one that you shouldn't
even know about?

286
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:23,779
Must've been a glitch in the server.

287
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:29,069
So psychics say it looks like Angel's
hotel has some uninvited guests.

288
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,180
Interesting. Why do I care again?

289
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,869
One word: thaumogenesis.

290
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,839
- The spell.
- The one you helped him perform.

291
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,539
Everything has repercussions.
Angel knew that going in.

292
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,339
I'm glad you see it that way.
Repercussions. Poetic justice.

293
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,980
You have a point, or are you waxing
my desk with your ass?

294
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,630
Whatever these things are...

295
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,759
...they're not too cuddly since
Angel barricaded himself inside...

296
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,210
...to prevent unleashing them
to the populace.

297
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,299
So yay. Let him reap what he's sown.

298
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,970
Maybe I'll get lucky
and they'll rip him to....

299
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,460
Think the senior partners
might be upset if he died...

300
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:17,609
...as a result of a spell
you helped him cast?

301
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:22,680
- You gotta be kidding me.
- With Linwood on vacation, unreachable.

302
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,619
This is a dilemma.

303
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,670
Well, bye.

304
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,710
Wait. So, what, I'm supposed
to go in there and save Angel?

305
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:36,559
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

306
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:40,460
Poor Angel. It's eating at him.

307
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,289
- You have another vision?
- What? No.

308
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,089
Knowing it was the spell
he performed to find Connor...

309
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:51,190
...that made this thing we're hunting,
that it caused a death.

310
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,309
- He's your priority.
- What?

311
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:58,769
You said earlier. Angel,
his feelings were your only concern.

312
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,359
He was all that matters.

313
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:06,710
Oh, no, Grooey,
I meant work priority. Work.

314
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,569
You see, you're
my other stuff priority.

315
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,299
You get that, right?

316
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:20,140
Groo, honey.

317
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:24,190
- We can talk about this.
- Do not move.

318
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:31,700
- Get it! It's going down.
- I instructed you not to move.

319
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:36,750
- Forgive me for saving my own life.
- I wouldn't have let it harm you.

320
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,369
- We saw it!
- You saw it?

321
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,349
- There's more?
- Two at least.

322
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,890
- We should assume there's more.
- Must we?

323
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:47,589
- At least we have one advantage.
- They glow in the dark?

324
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,559
That won't help
unless we shut the lights--

325
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,990
- You're not serious.
- They're hard to kill.

326
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:57,119
I speared one. It was strong enough
to attack us and escape.

327
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:00,119
If it makes them easier to find,
we do it.

328
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:03,019
- All the lights?
- Here.

329
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,390
Take this. Lock yourself in the office.
We still need answers.

330
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,250
- Right.
- This gets funner and funner.

331
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:12,089
Glad you're enjoying yourself...

332
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:15,400
...because somebody has to go to
the basement and shut off the power.

333
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:16,930
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

334
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,019
Rat.

335
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,539
Rat.

336
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,829
Everything okay down there?

337
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:35,369
It's a party.
Here's the icing on the cake.

338
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,730
- Where are we?
- South wing.

339
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:24,220
Haven't found a use for it yet,
so we keep it closed up.

340
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,680
- Do you hear something?
- Sorry, all I hear...

341
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,069
...is the erratic thumping
of the heart in my mouth.

342
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,619
It sounds like....
It almost sounds like....

343
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,779
Birds.

344
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,740
Do we even have a key for this?

345
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,990
Fred, it's me. Open up.

346
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,660
Sorry it took so long to get back.

347
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,680
I looked around to make sure
no slimeys were lurking.

348
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:05,420
We're good.

349
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,299
- How you holding up? You okay?
- Scared.

350
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,529
Very scared.

351
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,410
I know. It's gonna be okay, all right?

352
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,559
We just have to keep it together.
Watch each other's backs.

353
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,210
When this is over,
I think you and me...

354
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,059
...should go away someplace,
like Cordy and Groo got to do.

355
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:36,500
Maybe Baja. A little sun, sand.
I think we deserve it.

356
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,190
You have to get out of here.

357
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,910
That's what I'm saying. And we will.

358
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,779
Soon as we kill these creatures,
I'll talk to Angel. Maybe he'll--

359
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,589
Fred?

360
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,480
Oh, no.

361
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,630
We're thirsty.

362
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:08,190
- Where does that come from?
- Somewhere in this room.

363
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:11,900
Man, this place is one part hum,
two parts dinger.

364
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,049
Ever think of turning it
into a nightclub?

365
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,170
Missing the life. Sue me.

366
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:20,759
- Gunn!
- We have a serious problem.

367
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,660
- Oh, no, Fred.
- We gotta get her help, fast.

368
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,549
- Can you hear me?
- It's in her brain.

369
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:31,220
You can't reach her.

370
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,299
Angel?

371
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,630
Fred.

372
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:38,690
I feel it. Its needs.

373
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,259
Its thirst. Oh, God, I'm so thirsty.

374
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:47,829
- Hang on, we'll get you to a hospital.
- No, Charles, we-- No.

375
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:51,079
It wants that.

376
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,410
To escape. Spread.
You can't let it.

377
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,019
Let us--

378
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:03,819
It will kill.

379
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,039
It really doesn't like you.

380
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,509
- Feeling's mutual.
- That's it.

381
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:14,380
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

382
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:16,359
- But she said--
- I don't care.

383
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,809
- The thing inside her may be in charge.
- Don't do this.

384
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,720
- Get out of my way.
- Think.

385
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:24,750
How will she feel
if she causes more deaths?

386
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:27,470
- She? Or you?
- Me?

387
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:30,650
All this is happening because of you.
It's your fault.

388
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:34,349
- Messing with scary-ass mojo.
- I did what I had to do.

389
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,640
To get what you want.
The hell with us.

390
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,500
- My son--
- Is dead. Fred's not.

391
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,900
- We have to stick together.
- Yeah? Where does it say that?

392
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:49,529
Here. The sounds.
They come from under.

393
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,059
Oh, my God.

394
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,109
We have a pool?

395
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,980
Run! Move!

396
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,000
They're all over!

397
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,349
No more running. Too hot. Too hot.

398
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:48,900
Turn on the ovens!

399
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,839
- We gonna cook them?
- Cook the air.

400
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,549
Dry it out. Make it uncomfortable
so they won't want in.

401
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:59,509
- That's what I call uncomfortable.
- Charles! Where's Charles?

402
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,589
- What?
- He's gone!

403
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,650
Meet with the shaman exterminator
in 15. The S.W.A.T. team in place?

404
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,220
Good. The cleanup crew will join you.

405
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,660
Now I want everybody waiting
for my go. I'm heading out now.

406
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,079
- What's the activity?
- Cleaning out Angel's hotel.

407
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:21,089
I wanna stop this
before Linwood finds out.

408
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:24,890
A little late, but okay. Have fun.

409
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:28,039
- What did you say?
- "Have fun"?

410
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,779
Get out.

411
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,259
- You said Linwood was unreachable.
- He is.

412
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,319
Except for the emergency cell number.
He did give it to you, right?

413
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,089
Fine, play your little games.
I've gotta save my immortal enemy.

414
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:47,559
What? What--?

415
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:51,819
I don't question your loyalty, but
you sure that's what Linwood wants?

416
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,039
Angel kidnapped and tortured him.

417
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:59,269
Linwood may have unresolved feelings
since he was nearly blinded.

418
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:02,130
What did he say, Gavin?

419
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:06,609
"Let them die. Let them all die."

420
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,319
Maybe the old man has guts after all.

421
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:13,180
There was the part about
overstepping your bounds...

422
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,410
...and paying for the unauthorized
ops out of your salary.

423
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,380
Of course, how he can't
trust you anymore and--

424
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:23,980
Right, that he'd deal
with you when he got back.

425
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:28,700
I don't know what he meant by that.
But I'm not ahead of the game.

426
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,119
Need your help.

427
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:47,450
There are too many
to fight our way out.

428
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,640
I know.

429
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:56,440
We need water!

430
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:58,380
- Angel!
- Whoa, easy.

431
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:01,450
I wanna talk to that thing inside you.
What are you?

432
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,250
We....

433
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,579
We're thirsty.

434
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:13,049
Work with me, Fred. Make it answer me.
What do you want here?

435
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:16,130
To live.

436
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:19,769
To live.

437
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,819
To drink.

438
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:27,920
And be merry.

439
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:31,099
It hurts us.

440
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:34,349
We have to get out.

441
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,670
- Sounds more like they want in.
- Have to flee.

442
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:43,910
It brings pain.

443
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,869
- Such pain.
- "It"? What happened to "we"?

444
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,859
- Why the pronoun switcheroo?
- What are you fleeing from?

445
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,970
The bringer of torment.

446
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:56,720
Agony. Death.

447
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,980
- The Destroyer.
- Oh.

448
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:06,349
That is just not the name
you wanna hear.

449
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,619
- Why is this Destroyer after you?
- It's not.

450
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,139
It's coming after you...

451
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,860
...Angel.

452
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:28,920
I don't have time to get into it
with you. I don't wanna be here.

453
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,250
The hotel's infested
with some slug thing.

454
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,840
We don't know what they are
or how to kill them.

455
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,639
Well, now, that is a problem.

456
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,139
There's hundreds of them.
They enter you...

457
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,730
...and soak up the moisture
out of you. They drink you alive.

458
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:49,679
Why come to me? Angel will
figure out a way to kill them.

459
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,010
That's not what I'm looking for.

460
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:56,659
I need to know how to get these slugs
out of someone who's infected.

461
00:34:57,849 --> 00:34:59,880
- Sorry.
- Don't give me that.

462
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:04,010
- If you could see what they do....
- I wish I could help.

463
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:06,340
- Wes--
- Sorry you wasted your time.

464
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:07,969
It's Fred.

465
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:30,900
We're having a drink?
Did you hear me? She's dying.

466
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:34,400
I was dying. Throat cut,
life pouring out of me.

467
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,510
- Know why I fought to live?
- I don't have time.

468
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,070
I wanted to live
to see my friends again.

469
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:46,670
To explain to the people I loved
and trusted my side of what happened.

470
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,570
- We know what--
- You don't know anything.

471
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:57,750
I'll help because it's Fred.
But don't come here again. Any of you.

472
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,309
No. I need more.

473
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:03,590
I need more.
Tell me where you come from.

474
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:11,449
- Fred!
- You're gonna die so horribly.

475
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,460
Oh, God, help me.

476
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,489
Lorne, take her.
Shut off the ovens and stoves.

477
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,369
- Why?
- Hurry!

478
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,909
You guys get Fred to the hospital.

479
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:31,429
We talked about that.
Infecting the world and all.

480
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,630
They can keep her hydrated
until you come up with a cure.

481
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,110
- We're surrounded. How do we get past?
- I'll keep them occupied.

482
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,329
- How?
- By giving them what they want.

483
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,610
Damsel in distress.
You know what to do.

484
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,539
- Angel.
- Take Fred. Please!

485
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,550
Now!

486
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:12,340
Cordy, I told you to get out of here.

487
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,260
- Put my girl down.
- Where--?

488
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:28,010
News updates later. Just lay her down.

489
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,019
- She requires a healer.
- She requires this. Hold her.

490
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:34,860
Do it!

491
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,920
Come here, baby, come here, come here.
Drink, drink, drink, drink.

492
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,670
Angel! Incoming, four o'clock!

493
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:56,639
Angel.

494
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,670
Come on, baby, drink.

495
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,860
Angel, what's...

496
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,119
...happening to...

497
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,409
...me?

498
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,090
Unless anyone else has something,
I'll be the first to say:

499
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:58,780
- What the hell was that?
- Cordelia. That was Cordelia.

500
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,909
- You are truly a goddess.
- Well, demoness, anyway.

501
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:08,380
- Beats horns and a tail.
- Hey, I'm standing right here.

502
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,650
She okay?

503
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,519
Yeah. I got this idea.

504
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:21,019
Alcohol. Dehydrates the body,
gets the slug out.

505
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,340
So I left when those things
came out of the floor.

506
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,769
It's not like I was
running out on you.

507
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,460
Look, someone I care about was dying.

508
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,280
I couldn't sit around
and debate strategy.

509
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,489
I saw an opportunity
to get some help.

510
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,730
I did what I had to do,
and if you don't get that--

511
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:45,369
Yeah, I guess you do.

512
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:47,559
So we're good?

513
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:53,550
Good? We're not good. Did you forget
we have unexpected company on the way?

514
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,769
It goes by the initials
of "the Destroyer."

515
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,159
The Destroyer.
I remember the Destroyer's coming.

516
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:03,579
Yeah, we got that. Any idea when?

517
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,800
I think.... Now.

518
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,239
Hi, Dad.
