1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,870
Previously;

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,459
- We're not friends anymore.
- I didn't kill your father...

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,939
...so quit blaming me!

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,240
We were impressed with your sacrifice.
We'll get even.

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:17,829
- He killed me.
- He took from us. We'll pay him back.

6
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,339
Why are you so good to me,
after what I did?

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,300
Because you and I are one.

8
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:42,409
We made you some tea.

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,140
Great.

10
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,229
It's on the table in front of you.

11
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,560
Table seems far.

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,079
You must be tired from
sleeping the last three days.

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,619
He's the world's oldest teenager. Can
he be having a growth spurt at 248?

14
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,650
Two forty-seven.

15
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,659
If we garner some paying clientele
soon, we're financially sound...

16
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,239
- ...through last Wednesday.
- What? Where's it all going?

17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,040
There's the fixed costs: the mortgage
on the big hotel, my salary--

18
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,480
My salary is fixed too.

19
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,849
What if every time you identified
a demon in one of your old books...

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,299
...we gave you 10 bucks?

21
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,060
Or a chicken pot pie.

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,340
I have another idea. No!
Get a vision.

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,989
It doesn't happen
like a hit to the head.

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,340
Let's test that theory
with one of my books!

25
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:45,709
Stop arguing. Something will turn up.
It always does.

26
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,180
Guys....

27
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,409
Like that.

28
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,609
Are you all right?

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,930
- Want to sit?
- No, I'll throw up in my head.

30
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,010
Did it look like this?

31
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,419
No. More mushy and more moldy.

32
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,319
It was growing right out of the wall.

33
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,259
Maybe I'll just....

34
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:19,520
Mush monster's not going anywhere.
We have to find the place.

35
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,669
Its human disciples are killing
each other over how to worship it.

36
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,909
This is why, personally,
I rarely go to church.

37
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,370
I thought it was funny.

38
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,009
So did I.

39
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,080
God, I miss you.

40
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,590
What did the place look like?

41
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,879
I didn't doze off. Here I am.
Where were we?

42
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,949
Ascertaining the place in her vision.

43
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,860
- Ascertaining. Here we go.
- You are so weird lately.

44
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,949
It felt sacred, in a twisted,
demonic kind of way.

45
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,699
It's underground, like in a tank.

46
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,860
- Full of pillars.
- A water tank?

47
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,030
Could be.

48
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,919
St. Bridget's in Fremont. A convent
built on native burial grounds.

49
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,840
Land's cursed.

50
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,759
Eight murders in two years.
Then it burnt up.

51
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,289
Not as bad as what
happened at Our Lady of Lochenbee.

52
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,560
I dig convents.
Anyway...

53
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,099
...the state
dug a water tank there.

54
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,909
We'll need help. Call Gunn.
He's on the payroll.

55
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,580
But not like me.
He's more an outside contractor.

56
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,500
- Can we really afford--?
- Wesley.

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,229
Calling Gunn.

58
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,330
You're not paying me enough for this.

59
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:15,030
My Uncle Theo always said,
"Stay out of religious wars."

60
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,670
- You have an uncle?
- No, but it's good advice.

61
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,920
- Is it a Thrall demon?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,899
Kill the Big Ugly, and the rest
will stop killing each other.

63
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,240
Yes, that's the theory.
Thrall demons can be tricky.

64
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,069
At least they're killing
each other and not...

65
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:37,980
Intruders!

66
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,430
...us!

67
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,290
I'll get Fat Head!

68
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,759
Watch my back!

69
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,660
Or keep beating on that big guy.

70
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,050
Angel, it's over!

71
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,459
Stop!

72
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,850
- Teamwork's a thing of the past now?
- The job got done.

73
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,620
Take the car.

74
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,209
I need to....

75
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:58,089
He's just.... He hasn't been
sleeping well lately.

76
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,829
- He's off his game.
- Since when is it a game?

77
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,500
Thought we were meeting
in the square.

78
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,990
I ran into Lord Nichols.
Horrid little man.

79
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,040
He was dickering over price
with a prostitute.

80
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,279
Can you imagine?

81
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,829
- I told him I'd do him for free.
- Very charitable.

82
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,660
I so loathe cheap royalty.

83
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,700
- They all taste the same to me.
- My boy does have the touch.

84
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,169
- Darla?
- Yes?

85
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,169
Why did you kill the streetwalker?

86
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,509
Oh, I just liked her.

87
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,330
Guess what's next?

88
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:55,529
- What is it?
- Surprise. You have to guess.

89
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,179
The three daughters.

90
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,730
- All virgins.
- Close.

91
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,039
The middle one is delicate and unique.

92
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,259
Did you find me a saint?

93
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,679
Better than that. She has the sight.

94
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,820
Visions.

95
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,259
She sees the future.
She is pure innocence.

96
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:40,419
She sees what's coming.
She knows what I'll do to her.

97
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,899
I'll have to use care.

98
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,419
Now you're learning. Down, boy.
Let the plum ripen.

99
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,100
You always come up with new things.

100
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,460
It keeps me young.

101
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,679
Here you go, sir. Franks!
A dollar off! Franks! Franks!

102
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,690
Dollar off with coupon.

103
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:16,879
Hot dogs! Franks! A dollar off
with your coupon.

104
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,789
I really need some help,

105
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,370
They say he handles things.

106
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,220
Unusual things.
I need to see him right away.

107
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:29,669
He'd like that, soon as he returns
from an important case.

108
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,659
I'll take a report
and give you a list...

109
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,809
...of our payment plans.

110
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,440
Well, it's my wife, Claire.

111
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,009
She's really a lovely....

112
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,169
Go on. It's all right.

113
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,340
She gets abducted by aliens
on a regular basis.

114
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:57,279
Aliens?

115
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,480
- From outer space?
- It's quite common.

116
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,100
One minute she's there,
and the next....

117
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,169
She always comes back in a day or so.

118
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,990
What is it you'd like us to do?

119
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,320
I trust Claire.

120
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,490
But I found this receipt
from a hotel...

121
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,710
...two weeks ago, when she was
supposed to be in the Trifid Nebula.

122
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,269
- We'll figure this out.
- If it's not aliens--

123
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,409
Is that...?

124
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:30,730
Meet your new best friend.

125
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,870
- You think my wife's cheating?
- Probably.

126
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,590
He likes you.
He's jumping right in.

127
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,389
He didn't seem that--

128
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:41,629
All the greats are eccentric.
Holmes, Marlowe....

129
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,179
- Those are fictional--
- Right.

130
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,090
That gives him a leg up.

131
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,220
Terrific way to treat
our paying customers.

132
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:52,610
Especially since we have
so many of them.

133
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,620
See his file?

134
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,139
He has Visa, MasterCard, a problem.

135
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:02,809
Just what we need.
But if you want to be rude...

136
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,429
...I guess it's your shop.

137
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,389
Angel? What are you--?

138
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,879
Personal bubble. Personal bubble!

139
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,899
I need to speak with you.
Cordelia, you shouldn't be here.

140
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:19,370
- Did I do something?
- He felt my hair.

141
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,590
- What?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

142
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,009
Haven't been myself lately,
because of her.

143
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,570
I saw her, here in town last night.

144
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,539
Oh, no, not again. Look.

145
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,980
I like Buffy as much as--

146
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,919
Not Buffy. Darla.

147
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,409
Darla the vampire? Your sire?

148
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,570
Been dreaming about her like crazy.
The dreams have been so....

149
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,799
I thought I was losing it.
But she's here. She's alive.

150
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,399
Impossible. You killed her
3½ years ago.

151
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,730
I know. But it was her.

152
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,309
- Vampires don't return from death.
- I did. And I saw her.

153
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:02,669
- Where?
- Between the clowns and a big hot dog.

154
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,990
Walking on the promenade.

155
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,340
You said you were having
dreams lately.

156
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,850
Maybe guilt over killing
your sire.

157
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,990
Right! Guilt. Who loves guilt
more than you?

158
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,460
You need to go back to work.

159
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,799
We have a fun new case.
Aliens, adultery, it's a corker.

160
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:25,299
I dream about her because she's here.

161
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,539
You think she's here
because you're dreaming.

162
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,460
He's falling apart.

163
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,080
That's wonderful.

164
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,509
Unhinging a man with all his
strengths and weaknesses is tough.

165
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,289
I created many of his
strengths and weaknesses.

166
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,370
I have a pretty good handle on them.

167
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,159
We're counting on that.

168
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,649
You gave us invaluable
information on Angel.

169
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:00,789
Nobody knows him like you. Especially
the side we're interested in.

170
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,480
So, what is the plan exactly?
I tease him to death?

171
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,519
We want him dark, not dead.

172
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,809
And the best way to his darkness...

173
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,340
...is to awaken his nastier urges.

174
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,320
He did that to you?

175
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,580
What's it feel like?

176
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,440
Doesn't feel like anything.

177
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,789
Can I?

178
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,659
It's very smooth.

179
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,289
You don't feel anything?

180
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,779
Not in my hand.

181
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:50,850
How is it...

182
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,570
...seeing him again?

183
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,039
Strange.

184
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,580
He betrayed you.

185
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,789
Everyone betrays you.

186
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,820
That's not what eats at you.

187
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,559
Yeah? What does?

188
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,129
Missed opportunities.

189
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,919
He got a soul and it sickened me.

190
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,220
All that power wasted
on a whining, mopey do-gooder.

191
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,470
God, I could eat his eyeballs.

192
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:24,549
Our plans for Angel are more
long-term. But if you must, then...

193
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,679
...be my guest.

194
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,289
You're fun, for a human.

195
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:31,860
I've a special interest
in this guy.

196
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,330
Lots of people do.

197
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:40,990
Jack.

198
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,730
What brings you to Siberia?

199
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,129
Hello, Kate.

200
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:50,059
- You've been sick.
- No.

201
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,600
Busy, then?

202
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,419
Too busy to call and say hi?

203
00:15:58,009 --> 00:15:59,379
We were friends.

204
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:02,549
- Thought you'd be different.
- I supported you.

205
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:05,659
I objected when they transferred you.

206
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:07,600
You don't like regular work.

207
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,039
You got the scanner going
day and night, chasing the bizarre.

208
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:15,039
Did you think they'd promote you?

209
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,299
--working on 4O5 and Pico,

210
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:25,129
A friend of a friend thought
you might want this.

211
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:38,450
Thanks.

212
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,700
Stay out of trouble.

213
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:56,620
Now? You sure about this?

214
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:59,940
Marty, aliens abduct me
when the mood hits.

215
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:03,850
The mood hit as soon
as Harold left for work.

216
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:05,170
No kidding? Yeah?

217
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,980
- You're not in the mood?
- I'm in the mood,

218
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,170
I'm deep in the mood,

219
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,490
I'd love to abduct and probe you now.

220
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:17,930
- But I still got lots of repairs,
- I hope nothing is broken,

221
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,480
No, It all works,

222
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,599
So let's go upstairs,

223
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:30,819
Claire.

224
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:32,769
Do I know you?

225
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:35,579
I've been listening over there,
recording you...

226
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,960
...while my associates
tailed you, taking pictures.

227
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,119
I don't like doing this.

228
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,980
Your husband knows. Tell him the
truth. Stay or leave, I don't care.

229
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:48,609
But this....

230
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:58,420
- We had a paying client!
- It wasn't worth getting paid for.

231
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,980
Easy to say when you don't
need food to live.

232
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:05,309
That's her.

233
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:08,910
Oh, sorry.

234
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,690
Guess you didn't stay dead, did you?

235
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,970
- You trying to pass for a human?
- Excuse me.

236
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,250
I know your voice, Darla.
I can smell you.

237
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,569
I don't know you.
Leave me alone.

238
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:25,099
- Whatever you're up to, you won't win.
- I don't think--

239
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,559
- Is everything all right?
- No! This man was....

240
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,650
My name is DeEtta Kramer.
My husband is getting the car.

241
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,880
I don't know any Darla.

242
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,839
It's you.
I know you won't step in that sun.

243
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:40,180
Step over here--

244
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:42,470
- Stephen! Stephen!
- Angel!

245
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,599
Stephen!

246
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:50,170
Are you okay?

247
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,039
Guys, that was really fun.

248
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,809
Public humiliation, running
from hotel security...

249
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,509
...and the nifty outfit
telling so many conventioneers:

250
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,269
"Pet me, I'm a whore."

251
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,410
- There's a silver lining.
- Silver lining?

252
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:19,710
The woman went in the sun. Obviously
she's not a vampire. Angel...

253
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,369
- ...made a mistake.
- You think?

254
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:26,910
We have to come together and help him.
You're among friends.

255
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,430
- We won't condemn you.
- Right. You're crazy. You need help.

256
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,039
It was Darla. She's back and she's
human now. I know her scent.

257
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,430
Angel, you can't
just sniff a person and....

258
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,680
- You had sex last night with a blond.
- How--?!

259
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,460
That's unbelievable.
You had sex?

260
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,049
- She's not in here.
- Who, Darla?

261
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:52,400
DeEtta Kramer, the name she's using.

262
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,650
Run a title deed search.
Find her address.

263
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,650
- I'll try some other avenues.
- Okay.

264
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:05,000
Wesley, I need a few bucks
for the cover charge.

265
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,839
- Cover charge? You're going to--
- Do whatever it takes.

266
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,880
Everybody have fun tonight

267
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,089
Everybody wang-- Fun tonight

268
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,480
Everybody wang chung tonight

269
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,190
Everybody have fun tonight

270
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,680
Everybody have fun tonight

271
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:33,119
Everybody
Everybody have fun tonight

272
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,329
Everybody

273
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:40,509
Everybody have fun tonight

274
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,400
Everybody

275
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,740
I'm very sorry.

276
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,380
Tell me about Darla.

277
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:52,900
Give me a sec.

278
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,220
You're sending out some huge vibes.

279
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:58,369
My fillings are still humming.
Rico...

280
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,410
...refill my drink.
Win my devotion.

281
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,839
- You saw something.
- I saw lots of things.

282
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,740
- You're at a junction.
- So talk.

283
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,720
So, no.

284
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,250
- No? You won't tell me?
- You're in trouble.

285
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,769
Big trouble.

286
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,519
Let her go.
That way lies badness.

287
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,450
You give murderous demons free advice,
but you won't help me.

288
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,549
I set people on their paths, okay?
This is way off your path.

289
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,190
- Go home.
- Tell me where Darla is.

290
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:31,440
I know you won't start
anything in here.

291
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:33,420
You're a good boy.

292
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:36,339
Have a drink before you go.
It's on me.

293
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,809
Angel Investigations,
solving big problems for less.

294
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:48,759
- It's me. Did you get an address?
- It's him!

295
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,579
Angel, we really think you need to--

296
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:54,210
Address, now.

297
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,509
DeEtta and Stephen Kramer
own a home...

298
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:01,509
...at 1409 Galloway, Studio City.

299
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,309
Got it.

300
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:05,359
What are you looking at?

301
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,200
He hung up.

302
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:11,500
You really stood up to him.

303
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,349
"I don't bend to him
like you, Wesley."

304
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,450
Don't start with me.

305
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,079
If I sound like that, shoot me.
I'm joking.

306
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,369
It's not for you. It's a tranquilizer.

307
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:26,380
You mean if Angel really goes crazy
like he did before?

308
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,049
Think that'll do it?

309
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,089
I better call Gunn.

310
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,539
Thank you.

311
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:57,730
Of course, sweetheart.

312
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:00,369
Was that too much?

313
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,420
If we're married, would I
still be holding your chair?

314
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,319
That was fine. Now just eat.

315
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:18,900
Actors try to find
the truth in the moment.

316
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:22,599
Truthfully, I shouldn't
be holding your chair.

317
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,009
This linguine smells so,
you know, true.

318
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:30,829
I'll mime eating.
I gotta watch the figure.

319
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:36,230
So is he watching us right now?

320
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,509
Just nod and smile, Stephen.

321
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,410
What did this guy do to you?

322
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,390
All this trouble to get even?
Not that I mind working.

323
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,319
Last year, I did this
puppet theater and--

324
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,259
If you don't shut up,
I'm going to kill you.

325
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,359
Okay.

326
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,670
- Okay.
- Okay.

327
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:03,799
Lindsey, can you hear me?

328
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,420
I hear you.
How's the linguine?

329
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,099
He's here, I can feel him,

330
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:13,750
We know, Give me a few more minutes,

331
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,339
Hurry up.

332
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,670
Who are you talking to?

333
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,539
I'm shutting up.

334
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,009
This is all just precautionary.
When things get bad, Angel's a....

335
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,819
- We trust him.
- I see.

336
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:29,200
He doesn't turn evil
every time he gets cranky.

337
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,539
He turns evil?

338
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,710
Forces can revert Angel to Angelus,
who he was...

339
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:39,900
...before he got his soul.

340
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,460
How evil a vampire was Angelus?

341
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,019
As bad as they come.

342
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,980
Especially when he was with Darla.

343
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,990
We're researching her to see if she
has some kind of resurrection powers.

344
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,420
Maybe she's a vampire cat
with nine lives.

345
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,960
So he and Darla together is bad.

346
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,190
They ravaged half the world,
until Angel got a soul.

347
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,930
Imagine Bonnie and Clyde,
if they had 150 years.

348
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,650
So he thinks his girl is back.

349
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:13,069
If he's back to his old ways,
how bad can it get?

350
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,150
Hello, love.

351
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,970
You made a mess out there.
Blood and habits everywhere.

352
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,150
Convents. They're just
a big cookie jar.

353
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,549
Black sky.

354
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:44,650
It wants a little worm in me.

355
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,769
No.

356
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,650
No.

357
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:52,410
What is she doing here?
I thought you killed her.

358
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,609
No, just her family.

359
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,069
--eyes like arrows.

360
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:59,519
Like needles.

361
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:03,000
This one's special.
I have big plans for her.

362
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,210
Snake in the woodshed.
Snake in the woodshed.

363
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:12,680
Snake in the woodshed.
Snake in the woodshed.

364
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,579
- So do we kill her during or after?
- Neither.

365
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,819
We turn her into one of us.

366
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,539
Killing is so merciful, isn't it?
The pain ends.

367
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,119
But to make her one of us....
She's a lunatic.

368
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:34,529
Eternal torment.

369
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,859
Am I learning?

370
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,259
Lindsey, I'm waiting.

371
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,039
You're on. Have fun.

372
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,079
- 911, What's the emergency?
- I'm DeEtta Kramer at 1409 Galloway.

373
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:22,130
There's a man outside. Oh, my God,
he's breaking into the house!

374
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,920
He's gonna kill us! Help me!

375
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:27,750
- Help me!
- I didn't sign up for this.

376
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:30,990
- Do it. Make it look real.
- That was illegal.

377
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:35,299
Help me!

378
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,349
Somebody help me! My God!

379
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:40,880
Someone help me!

380
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,470
Don't hurt me! Please, no!
What did you do?

381
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:48,180
Why did you? He was my husband!

382
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,650
She should have her own series.

383
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,809
Don't hurt me!

384
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,609
What did you do?

385
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,509
Turn around!

386
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,950
On your knees. Do it!

387
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,710
You'll pay for this.

388
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:23,220
- In the attic.
- Right.

389
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,130
- Seal the house. I want SWAT, now!
- You got it.

390
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,109
He's on the roof.

391
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,440
There he is!

392
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:34,470
Go! Take the back! Move around!

393
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,160
I don't understand,

394
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,660
They shot him.

395
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,170
How did he get away?

396
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:46,009
Adrenaline. They chased him
for 16 blocks.

397
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,000
Don't worry.
He can't hurt you now.

398
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,740
They said you recognized him.
His name was Angel?

399
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,930
That's what he told me.

400
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:58,440
He started following me
a few weeks ago.

401
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,940
He said he helped the helpless.

402
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,589
I told him I didn't need any help.
He kept calling me Darla.

403
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,039
He said he knew me or
this Darla from a long time ago.

404
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,099
Today we were at the hotel
and he showed up again.

405
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,930
Then tonight, he came here.

406
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,970
I told him to stay out, that I was
calling the police and he broke in.

407
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,349
This will sound crazy, but
something is wrong with his face.

408
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,319
And he was biting.

409
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,809
It isn't crazy.

410
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,930
I want you to know I'll find him,
and he'll pay for this.

411
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,650
Thank you, detective.

412
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,359
Contact the hotel security
for any tapes of the...

413
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,660
...incident with Mrs. Kramer.

414
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:49,109
Make sure the coroner is careful
to preserve the scene.

415
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,230
You all right?

416
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,240
Just adjusting to the idea that
a good-guy vampire can go bad.

417
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,140
It takes time.
We've been there.

418
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,559
99 percent of the time he's good.
He's helped us.

419
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,140
I respect loyalty a lot.

420
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,519
That's good.

421
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,329
But if the bad Angel returns,
I'll kill him in two seconds.

422
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:21,099
Where is he?

423
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,460
He's not here.

424
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,299
Check every room.

425
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:30,049
He's dangerous. Bullets might
not work. If you see him, call me.

426
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,180
Do you have a search warrant?

427
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,160
He killed Stephen Kramer
and kidnapped his wife.

428
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:39,339
- He wouldn't.
- It's not the person he is.

429
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,549
He's not a person at all, is he?

430
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,930
You want to help yourselves out here,
or go down with him?

431
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,000
So be it.

432
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,250
- New player?
- He's a friend.

433
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,569
- And what's your name?
- Charles Gunn.

434
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,349
Let's see some I.D., Charles.

435
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:05,950
- You got any priors?
- I forget.

436
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,750
Montgomery, check it.

437
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,140
Whatever you think Angel did--

438
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,509
Who's Darla?

439
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:33,470
So you're what Wolfram & Hart
brought back in that box.

440
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:36,640
And they brought you back as human.

441
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,630
They think I won't kill one.

442
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,990
Wanna know what I think?

443
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:49,069
I think they don't know me that well.

444
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:01,559
You feel what this place was like
before they excavated it?

445
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,200
It was a convent.

446
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,289
You know how much I like convents.

447
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:16,630
Come on, Darla. You and I are
too old to play games.

448
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,369
I need to talk to the real you.

449
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,980
It's been a long time
since I said this to anyone.

450
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:30,750
But you can scream all you want.

451
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,309
I'm not gonna scream.

452
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,569
There's my boy.

453
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,660
Well, look here.
"Disturbing the peace.

454
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,890
Resisting arrest. GTA, assault."

455
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,440
You've led a rich, full life.

456
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:12,869
- I get around.
- I know this guy.

457
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,359
He helps people.

458
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,279
I bet this stuff happened
a long time ago.

459
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,109
- Some of it was when he was a minor.
- Uh-huh.

460
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,069
Some of it was
in the last two weeks.

461
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,349
Oh.

462
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:25,900
Word to the wise.

463
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:28,579
These two and their
boss aren't good for you.

464
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,369
I can see you're looking out for me,
detective.

465
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:34,609
Let's not get off-track.
We want to find Angel too.

466
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:35,990
No, you don't.

467
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,440
You want to protect him,
even though he's lost it.

468
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,000
He stalked that woman because
he thought she was this Darla.

469
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,819
He knocked down the door...

470
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:48,799
...and killed her husband.

471
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,359
I know what he is,
and I know he hasn't changed.

472
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:55,259
No, he hasn't. He's still a vampire.

473
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:56,849
Not helping.

474
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,569
So how'd he get in the house?
She invite him in?

475
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,769
Of course she didn't in--

476
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:04,539
The only way he could've
gotten in uninvited...

477
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:06,980
...is if the real owners were dead.

478
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,480
She isn't DeEtta Kramer.

479
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,170
- You're grasping at straws.
- Are we?

480
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,619
This is a daguerreotype of Darla,
taken over 100 years ago.

481
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,679
The woman who said she was DeEtta--
Look familiar?

482
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,409
That's enough.

483
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,500
I'm pretty familiar with the
international sign for enough...

484
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,579
...and you have a ways to go.

485
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,420
You're hurting me. I like it.

486
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,750
What's the play?

487
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,780
What kind of game are you running?

488
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,579
Just having a little fun.

489
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,219
Been out of commission too long.
You know.

490
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,079
They didn't bring you back for fun.

491
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:06,480
The dreams, the frame-job.

492
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:11,099
What's the plan?
Get me so screwed up I go bad again?

493
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,090
Trite, I know. What do
you expect? They're only human.

494
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:20,449
Better embrace that mediocrity.
You're human now.

495
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,510
But I'm still me.
I remember everything.

496
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:28,610
Everything we did,
everything we can do.

497
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,980
Yeah.

498
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:33,059
But the bitch is...

499
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,559
...you have a soul now.

500
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,630
Pretty soon...

501
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:43,539
...those memories will start
eating away at you.

502
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,119
No matter how hard you try...

503
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,769
...you won't be able to escape
the truth of what you were.

504
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,239
Believe me, I know.

505
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:53,639
But you can escape.

506
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:57,199
You can escape it all.

507
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:00,099
Remember what it's like to get lost?

508
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,989
Every thought a million miles away.

509
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,880
Every part of your being alive.

510
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:09,730
All you have to do is let me...

511
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:13,539
...give you one little moment
of happiness.

512
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,869
You took me places
and showed me things.

513
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,190
You blew the top off my head.

514
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,539
But you never made me happy.

515
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:34,500
But that cheerleader did?

516
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,530
We were together 150 years.

517
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,969
We shared everything.

518
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:44,739
You're saying never?

519
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,179
You couldn't understand.

520
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,969
I understand, all right.

521
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,349
Taste something fresh,
you think you're touching God.

522
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,179
- It wasn't--
- You bet your ass it was.

523
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,469
In the early years...

524
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,489
...you would've said
I was the definition of bliss.

525
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:07,929
Buffy wasn't happiness.
She was just new.

526
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:10,650
You know...

527
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:16,289
...you're getting awfully
bent over this.

528
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,019
I couldn't feel that with you...

529
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:23,949
...because I didn't have a soul.

530
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,190
But then I got a second chance...

531
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,769
...just like you have.

532
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:36,019
What a poster child for soulfulness!

533
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:42,099
This is no life, Angel.

534
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,550
You weren't just any vampire,
you were a legend.

535
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:48,869
Nobody could keep up with you.
Not even me.

536
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:52,119
You don't learn that.
It's innate.

537
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,769
It was in you before we ever met.

538
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:58,469
You said you can smell me?
Well, I can smell you too.

539
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,889
My boy is still in there,
and he wants out.

540
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:10,750
He's nowhere to be found.

541
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,570
Some of you stay here
in case he shows.

542
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,130
I'll be sure and mention
your cooperation in the report.

543
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,559
We did more than that.
We solved the case.

544
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,539
Whoever did away with the owners
of that house is your killer.

545
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:28,110
- You don't get it.
- The fact that he's innocent?

546
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,920
While you're fighting
your battles of good and evil...

547
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,210
...the innocent are the ones
in the crossfire.

548
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,610
Those are the ones I care about.

549
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,590
Like that man tonight.
Or the real owners of that house.

550
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,309
The ones I chalk up to your boss.

551
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,260
You can't blame Angel--

552
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,889
He's trying to do what's right.

553
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,289
That's right, he's good.
I keep forgetting.

554
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,610
And why did he
kidnap that woman again?

555
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,250
You're going to feel it.

556
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:20,670
What you did.

557
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,320
That man you got killed.

558
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,869
- Please. He was an actor.
- I'm serious.

559
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:29,809
Like a heart attack.

560
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:32,989
And just about as much fun.

561
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,460
- Hurt anyone else and I'll kill you.
- Yeah?

562
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,369
- Isn't that against your code?
- I'll make an exception.

563
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,519
You'll miss those dreams.

564
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:45,659
You should hear what
you say in your sleep.

565
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:47,809
Nasty things, Angel.

566
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,789
- Things--
- Stop it.

567
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,539
No, you stop!

568
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,070
No matter how good a boy you are...

569
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,659
...God doesn't want you.

570
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,690
But I still do.

571
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,699
What, no goodbye kiss?

572
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,349
It's us.

573
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:17,429
We didn't see you all day.

574
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:21,130
We just wondered
if everything was copacetic.

575
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:23,119
I didn't go bad.

576
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,579
I was never worried about that.

577
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,389
- Mr. Fussy Pants assumes the worst.
- What? I didn't....

578
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,639
- I never--
- Anything else?

579
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:35,750
Can't think of a thing.

580
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:37,230
Angel.

581
00:41:37,489 --> 00:41:39,030
- Careful.
- What do you mean?

582
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:43,469
It's just with Darla back, in
league with Wolfram & Hart...

583
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,829
...there are many forces
against you.

584
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,050
There's going to be trouble.

585
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:51,559
There's gonna be a lot of trouble.

586
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,739
And I say bring it on.

587
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,579
Thank you, thank you very much,
