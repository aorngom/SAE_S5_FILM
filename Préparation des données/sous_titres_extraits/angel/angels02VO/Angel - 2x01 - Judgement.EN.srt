1
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,839
First I was afraid
I was petrified

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,780
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side

3
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:24,320
But then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong

4
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,149
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

5
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,979
You know what I'm talking about.

6
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:35,520
In this city, you better
learn to get along...

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,880
...for L.A.'s got it all.

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,759
Glamour and grit,
big breaks and heartaches.

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,359
Sweet young lovers...

10
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:47,189
...and nasty hairy fiends
who suck out your brains.

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,179
It's the big wacky variety show
called Los Angeles.

12
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:56,789
You never know what's next.
Let's admit it, folks...

13
00:00:57,729 --> 00:00:59,340
...isn't that why we love it?

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,829
I'll survive
I will survive

15
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,689
Hey, hey

16
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:09,680
But why, Johnny? Why?

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,670
- It's over.
- No, I love you!

18
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,480
I gave you everything, didn't I?

19
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:21,540
- Yeah, and it's time to move on.
- You can't!

20
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:26,540
You're everything to me.
I'm nothing without you. Nothing!

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,629
Ow.

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,310
Hey, ow! She hit me!

23
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:37,310
I added that myself.
She's spineless, begging this creep--

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,900
That was just amazing.
You were Eleanor, body and soul.

25
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,170
Where does she hit me?

26
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,079
You're on fire! It's exciting.
Let's do it again.

27
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,329
Put the focus on how conflicted you--

28
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,939
Cordelia?

29
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,409
Sorry. Duty calls.

30
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,080
Sorry, lads. I'll have a rematch...

31
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,979
...another time.

32
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:24,830
Ow!

33
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,199
Can I help you?

34
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,530
The club's for members
and guests only.

35
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,939
I might join.

36
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,830
You can't come in without a pass!

37
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:47,169
Is this the right place?

38
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:50,800
It's a praetorian sacrifice.

39
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,520
The quadrants match.
Kwaini demons love muscle and mirrors.

40
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,759
I'm not fooling around.
I'll call the--

41
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,919
No reflection.
I'll fix that.

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,580
Stop that.

43
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,530
- He has horns.
- Steroids. Bad for you.

44
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,939
I think it was a sloth demon.

45
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,370
Sloth demons don't sacrifice
adolescents. You I.D.'d a Carnyss.

46
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,040
- Not the one last night.
- It's a nice gym.

47
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:00,420
One burned a month ago.
Wolfram and Hart...

48
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,350
...raised it when Angel
fought Vocah.

49
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:07,199
At a gym, people encourage you
to work out.

50
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,600
You don't have to.
You're eternal.

51
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,550
May not always be.

52
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,170
The Vartite Monster:
Took two days to kill that thing.

53
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,370
It's very Wolfram and Hart.

54
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,379
Steam, sauna, fresh towels.
How bad can it be?

55
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,990
- You shower with lots of men.
- I'll always be a loner.

56
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:31,839
Vision!

57
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,329
Just a sneeze.

58
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,629
- Oh.
- Oh?!

59
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,420
Bless you. Sorry about this.

60
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,300
Why not work at Wes'?

61
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,220
We'll get a new office.
I haven't--

62
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,839
Sneeze...

63
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,079
...followed by vision.

64
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,509
You all right?

65
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:05,610
I'll survive.

66
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,529
What is it?

67
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,100
A nasty demon.
Didn't recognize it.

68
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,089
Nasty...demon...unknown...origin.

69
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,170
Awful lot of that here.

70
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,279
He'll feel right at home.

71
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,439
You can review the contract...

72
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,839
...you should. We'll talk Monday.

73
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,540
Sign, or we'll sue your ass
and kill your kids.

74
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,899
Just kidding.
Nobody wants a lawsuit.

75
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,100
It's nice and gloomy in here.

76
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,290
You're not handicapped,
you're handi-capable.

77
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,689
She likes Chopin and Brahms.
She's not fond of the Russians.

78
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,420
Hello, Darla.

79
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,589
How are you?
Feeling any better?

80
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,310
- It's a beautiful day outside--
- Shut up.

81
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,209
She's not a child.
She's 400 years old.

82
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,220
The prelude.

83
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,240
In C minor.
The preludes and the nocturnes.

84
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,970
Much better than the waltzes.

85
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,490
- He had consumption.
- Died too soon. Lot of that around.

86
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,050
He's here.

87
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:47,019
- Chopin?
- Angel. He's here in town.

88
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,399
- You can feel him.
- Always could.

89
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,040
He hasn't helped us.

90
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,220
He killed me.

91
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,420
I remember now.
With a soul in his heart.

92
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:12,819
He's taken from both of us.
So when you feel ready...

93
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,689
...we'll give some back.

94
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,750
Angel. Been a long time.

95
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,069
I'd love to see that boy.

96
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,920
Eyes are farther apart.

97
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,419
They look through you.
This guy's not afraid of much.

98
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,429
I say Northern Pakistan, Hindu Kush.

99
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,820
Or the Tien Shenin in Kazakhstan.
I need Suleman's Compendium.

100
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,409
- Don't yell. You'll scare him.
- Scare him?

101
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,639
Dennis is sensitive. He wants to help.

102
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,090
He's more a person than a G-H-O-S-T.

103
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,129
We need an office.

104
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,289
There! There!

105
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,779
Prio Motu demon. It's a killer.

106
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,509
"Ancient Ofga-beast,
bred to maim and massacre."

107
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,879
Goody. A pit bull.

108
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,980
Now we know what we're dealing with.

109
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,570
A Prio Motu.

110
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,289
We need to find it.
It's narrowed down to "somewhere."

111
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,070
I can help.

112
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,259
I've broadened our contacts
to include the underlife.

113
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,029
I know who can help.

114
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,639
- Who?
- Parasite named Merl.

115
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,070
We'll pay the stoolie a visit.

116
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,809
Make with the chin music
till he canaries.

117
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:44,940
I watched a noir festival on Bravo.

118
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,230
He goes to a safe haven for demons.

119
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,820
I meant to take you. It may be of use.

120
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,799
- But....
- But what?

121
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,929
It's a bit outside the box.

122
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,039
I'm so excited

123
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:05,120
And I just can't hide it

124
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,460
Tonight's the night
We're gonna make it happen

125
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,399
Open your jacket.
All right, step back through.

126
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,669
I just can't get enough
And if you move

127
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,820
I'm so excited

128
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,159
Your stool pigeon feels safe
in a karaoke bar?

129
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,169
In this one. It's a sanctuary.

130
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,049
Oh, yeah
I'm so excited

131
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,860
I know I know I know
I know I want you, I want you

132
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,909
Move over, Pointer Sisters!

133
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,610
I'm losing control, and I like it.

134
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,169
I'm gonna go talk to Liz.
Don't go anywhere.

135
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,409
Next, Mordar the Bentback
does a personal favorite.

136
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,960
Make him welcome.

137
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,809
I see someone feels zippy.

138
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,320
It's hatching time, but
life's more than eating your young.

139
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:44,509
Here's what I see in your aura.

140
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,639
Hello, Merl.

141
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,289
- Cat got your tongue?
- I have no tongue.

142
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:57,820
Oh.

143
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,289
- Keep the sucker away.
- Can't hurt you here.

144
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:06,240
Hates his own kind,
beats on the demons he finds.

145
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:08,090
If they waste my time.

146
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,429
Looking for a Prio Motu.

147
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:16,519
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

148
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,809
You've never seen one up close.

149
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,990
Prios are stone-cold killers.
They got teeth that'll....

150
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,759
Sweeten this a whole lot.
And keep my name out.

151
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,639
Prios don't like it above ground.

152
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,730
He'll be in one of those
sub-tunnels off Redondo.

153
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:45,490
They're nasty.
Not a mosquito like you...

154
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,159
...turns to dust if you stake it.
Good luck.

155
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,879
Love the coat.
It's all about the coat.

156
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,299
Welcome to Caritas.

157
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:59,330
- Meaning?
- Latin for "mercy."

158
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,049
Smart and cute.
How about a number?

159
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,809
I don't sing.

160
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,590
Neither does Mordar.

161
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,909
He's a foghorn on two legs.

162
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,779
- Who is this guy?
- He's anagogic.

163
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,279
He looks like he eats enough.

164
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,990
Psychic.
He's connected to the mystic.

165
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,470
When you sing, you bare your soul.
He sees into it.

166
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:31,230
This is about your spirit.
I can't read you unless you sing.

167
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,250
- I don't sing.
- Come on, Angel.

168
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,330
- I want to hear you sing.
- No.

169
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,509
- It's a good cause.
- Who's the boss?

170
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:43,370
You feel smooth, in the groove.
Doesn't that come before a fall?

171
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,629
Three things I don't do:
tan, date and sing in public.

172
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:55,700
See you around.

173
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,659
I'd look fabulous in that coat.

174
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,399
It's okay. I won't hurt you.
Are you all right?

175
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,690
Look out!

176
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,120
It's all right. He'd dead.

177
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:08,580
What did you do? Oh, my God.

178
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,169
What have you done?
What have you done?

179
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,950
I thought he would hurt you.

180
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,720
He was my protector.

181
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,139
Stay away.

182
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,440
I'm sorry. I was sent to--
I'm not exactly sure, but--

183
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,090
- Sent here?
- By The Powers That--

184
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,539
It's a long story.
I help people.

185
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,070
You're joking, right?
I hate this town.

186
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,200
What did he protect you from?

187
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,629
- Things you can't handle.
- Like what?

188
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:58,309
Like the Tribunal! I don't know you
or what your deal is...

189
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,820
...and I don't care.
He protected me.

190
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:06,429
I had one friend and you killed him.
Stay away from me.

191
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,120
He was good?

192
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,559
Yeah.

193
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,679
And you....

194
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,200
Yeah.

195
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,500
That's bad.

196
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,440
Which, of course, you already--
Right.

197
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,929
Look, he was a demon.
I just assumed....

198
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,480
Why wouldn't you?
Cordelia said he was a nasty demon.

199
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,610
He looked nasty.
I didn't say he killed, you did.

200
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,389
That's what Prio Motus are.
They hunt, kill.

201
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,809
We're to think a creature
can change its M.O. overnight?

202
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,509
Turn into some noble protector
and defender of....

203
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,390
Oh, God.

204
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,210
I felt no fear when I saw him.
Angel should have helped him....

205
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,789
Thanks for the obscure visions.
We're doing great.

206
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,339
I killed an innocent.
He's a soldier, like me.

207
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,349
His mission is mine now.

208
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,940
It's a start.
He protected a pregnant woman.

209
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:34,319
- Find out what the Tribunal is.
- We will.

210
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,569
You didn't know.

211
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:39,970
But somebody did.

212
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,450
You're not on protected ground.
The truth.

213
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,460
- I told you where.
- I'm out of time.

214
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,140
- Why'd you lie?
- The price on the woman.

215
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,539
- Woman or the baby?
- The kid.

216
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:56,329
She'll be powerful. The Dark Ones
want her and her mom dead.

217
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,519
Local brokers offer hard cash,
but that Prio was around.

218
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:05,789
- Now that he's gone, we--
- Where is she?

219
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,500
If I knew, would I be
getting strangled?

220
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:11,380
Nobody touches her.

221
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,480
Too late.
You know how many are after her?

222
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,339
- Where'd he live?
- Don't know...

223
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:20,829
...Boyle Heights, underground,
by the DWP.

224
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,970
An iffy part of town.

225
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:34,390
Just take the car!

226
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,460
Look out!

227
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,490
You should go home now.

228
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,920
You're welcome!

229
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,930
People nowadays.
Would it hurt to say thank you?

230
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:10,880
Angel.

231
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:13,420
Been a while. You well?

232
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,259
Picture of health.
You haven't aged a bit.

233
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:21,930
- Got a situation.
- No small talk.

234
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:25,910
Go up to Broadway.
See you at the crib.

235
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,109
- Where's home?
- Nice landlord off 8th.

236
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,890
We keep the area safe, he cuts
the rent. What's up?

237
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:37,940
- Heard of a Prio Motu?
- Is it like a '62 Chevy?

238
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,670
I'll just say no.

239
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,000
A warrior demon.

240
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:47,750
I thought it was just roaches and
vampires. What's he do?

241
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,960
He's dead. He lived
underground by the DWP.

242
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,309
I know the area.
You want to do it now?

243
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,190
It's urgent.

244
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,829
- How deep are these?
- Pretty deep.

245
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,990
We killed vampires here last year.
Now we check it.

246
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,839
- And the Prio "Mojo"?
- Protected a woman.

247
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,440
- He was good?
- Yeah.

248
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,380
- What scumbag killed him?
- I'm the scumbag.

249
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:14,450
Oh.

250
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,299
Hold up. That wasn't there before.

251
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,849
You feel any air coming out?
I don't feel air.

252
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,529
Guy kept a neat house.

253
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,039
- "Kamal."
- What's that?

254
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,269
It was his name.

255
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,539
Looking for something?

256
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,569
- Like that?
- I hate to ask, but--

257
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,440
- What you need?
- I work with these people.

258
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:55,869
He must see this.
Say it's about the Tribunal.

259
00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:00,529
The Tribunal.
You gonna stay and soak up the guilt?

260
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,549
Something like that.

261
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,720
You're safe.
That's good.

262
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:18,680
You shouldn't be here.
You've no right.

263
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:23,329
I know. It's not my choice.
Kamal's mission is mine now.

264
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,430
You sound just like him,
with your missions...

265
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,869
...ancient laws, medieval honor.
I don't care.

266
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,859
I want to protect my baby.

267
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:37,869
- I understand.
- How could you? I don't!

268
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:42,319
Six months ago I worked
the register at Costco.

269
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:45,609
I began as a stock girl and I moved up.

270
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:50,720
I could provide for my baby.
Now I just hope she's born.

271
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:53,059
I want it too.

272
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,759
Right.
Because she's a seer or Joan of Arc.

273
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:02,049
Well, you know what she is to me?
My daughter.

274
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,529
Not a holy mission.

275
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,339
Oh, no, it's not exactly that.
It's sort of my job.

276
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,920
- Your job?
- Yeah. Look, I got cards.

277
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,369
And an office.

278
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:22,660
It blew up, but we have
an apartment in Silverlake.

279
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,210
Let me help you.
Let me help your daughter.

280
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,900
We need the coat of arms.

281
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,349
Kamal said to give it to the Tribunal.

282
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,049
Maybe if I do, they'll call it--
What?

283
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:52,910
Is it a round bronze talisman,
about this big?

284
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:56,509
- Yes.
- Yeah. I already found it.

285
00:24:58,009 --> 00:24:59,940
Yeah? Where is it?

286
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,150
What?

287
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:07,059
I don't have it right here
on my person.

288
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,660
I know where it is.
I can take you there.

289
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,140
The address on the card--

290
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:16,519
Do me a favor. Stop helping.

291
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,589
Get back!

292
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,009
- I can kill this. Right?
- Yes!

293
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,470
Sure? You don't think he
might be good?

294
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:37,059
Kill it!

295
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,809
All right, I think we should run.

296
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,980
- Who is it?
- Gunn.

297
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:59,369
- What was that?
- Something about a gun.

298
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,640
What if it's a demon with a gun?

299
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,650
Listen, whoever you are. We're armed
and we know how to do battle.

300
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,420
- If you know what's good for you--
- My name's Gunn. Angel sent me.

301
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,019
This is a little embarrassing.
Please, come in. Come in.

302
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:28,759
Wesley, you've heard Angel
talk about Gunn.

303
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,329
He's a great guy
with a really fly street tag.

304
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,980
- What's he fly?
- It's his street name, dorko.

305
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:40,480
It really lets them know
you mean business.

306
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:45,420
- It's my name. Charles Gunn. Two N's.
- Oh, Lord, will no one shut me up?

307
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,819
I'm Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,
and this is Cordelia Chase.

308
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,299
- It's nice to finally meet.
- I've seen you before.

309
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:58,759
- The Tan 'n' Screen commercials.
- I saw you in bed.

310
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,769
- What?!
- This is none of my business.

311
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,250
- You too.
- Now, just a moment--

312
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,740
In the hospital,
after the building blew.

313
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,650
He sent me to look after you.

314
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,509
- Right.
- I'm messing with you.

315
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:16,259
I hoped to fight demons, but I
wound up with a delivery job instead.

316
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,019
It may have something
to do with the Tribunal.

317
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,869
This could be an emblem
or some sort of protective amulet.

318
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:29,119
These all your cases?

319
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,730
- Isn't this the well-oiled machine?
- We set them up, we knock them down.

320
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,339
Well, we did, until Angel
knocked down the wrong--

321
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm sure he's on top of it now.

322
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,809
What?

323
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:46,420
This way.

324
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,809
- Where are we?
- Come on.

325
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:16,099
You've been here before.

326
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,309
It feels creepy.

327
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:24,920
Yeah.

328
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,920
What's the Tribunal?

329
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,359
Some other-worldly court. Supposedly,
they can save me and my baby.

330
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:35,190
You go before them with the charm....

331
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,559
I don't know how it works.
Kamal said he'd be my champion.

332
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,779
Screw this. I'm getting out of town.

333
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,230
- Try and stop me.
- They'll find you. Stay with me.

334
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:48,500
- You can't protect me.
- I can.

335
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,930
We'll get the charm and I'll make
this right. There's a gate in back--

336
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:56,259
Go to the address I gave you. Go!

337
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,819
- Are you all right? What happened?
- Is she here?

338
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,500
The pregnant woman? No.

339
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:16,829
- Gunn brought us the talisman, but--
- Working on it.

340
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,339
I told her to come here.

341
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,779
She doesn't trust me.

342
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,329
Why should she?

343
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,500
You can't see everything. You're
just a vampire like everyone else--

344
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:39,559
- That didn't come out right.
- I thought I was out of the tunnel.

345
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,019
Sure, you did.

346
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,799
Because the tunnel is, you know,
it's something we all--

347
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,869
Are we talking
a real tunnel or symbolic?

348
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:57,140
I saw the light
at the end of the tunnel...

349
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,569
...that, some day,
I might become human.

350
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,000
That light was so bright...

351
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,930
...I thought I was already out.

352
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:18,210
Yeah, we all got
a little cocky, didn't we?

353
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:24,390
It's gonna be a long while
till you work your way out.

354
00:30:25,569 --> 00:30:28,170
But I know you well enough
to know you will.

355
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,359
And I'll be with you until you do.

356
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,569
- And your inevitable stardom?
- I didn't say I won't have a day job.

357
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,769
We've got something. It's medieval.

358
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,740
A small badge or coat of arms to be
presented when going before the:

359
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,819
- Translated, the Chair of Judgement.
- The Tribunal.

360
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,299
A court to settle grievances.

361
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:03,390
- With lawyers and stuff?
- This is a little more primitive.

362
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,109
- It's a fight to the death.
- Kamal....

363
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,970
- Where would it be?
- There's no way to tell.

364
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,670
They could rise up
in our reality whenever.

365
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,880
We gotta find her right away,
whatever it takes.

366
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:19,140
There's only one way.

367
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:24,759
You came and you gave
Without taking

368
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,359
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy

369
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,599
Oh, Mandy

370
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,819
That man will do anything
to save a life.

371
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,119
Stop me from shaking

372
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,420
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

373
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,720
How about that? A performer.

374
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:06,490
Let's just call him
"Angel, the vampire with soul."

375
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,009
While I chat with
"Tall, dark and rocking"...

376
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,589
...Durthock the Child-eater
will open up.

377
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,089
A Gorrishyn Mage stole his power...

378
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:20,289
...so he's feeling a little bit
country. Let's give him a hand.

379
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,990
You're just the hot ticket.

380
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:29,079
One night only, two seats left,
partially obstructed view.

381
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,980
- So tell me.
- You're all business.

382
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,920
She's in danger.

383
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:37,549
You're feeling guilty.
You made an honest mistake.

384
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,589
A lot of guys
would have done the same.

385
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,940
Of course, now she has no champion.

386
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,079
- That's looking grim for her.
- Where are they?

387
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,119
Who's a little curt? Who's a little
Curt Jürgens in The Enemy Below?

388
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,410
The Tribunal will be wherever she is.

389
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,799
- And where is she?
- My question first.

390
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,130
And answer true, because you know
I'll know. Why "Mandy"?

391
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,000
Well, I know the words.

392
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,089
- I kind of think it's pretty.
- It is, you big sap.

393
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,849
There's not a destroyer of worlds
can argue with Manilow.

394
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:24,769
- The trial's at 4th and Spring.
- How does it work?

395
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:29,109
I can only tell you what I tell you.
The rest is up to you.

396
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:34,690
- Can I save her?
- Try, and find out.

397
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:34,300
- Where is your champion?
- He's dead.

398
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,039
- You have no talisman or champion?
- I ask for asylum.

399
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:42,489
Asylum is not ours to give.
Two are chosen to meet in combat.

400
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,809
One can save your life, one can
take it. This is the ancient law.

401
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:51,449
Your life is forfeit.
You have no champion.

402
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,280
Yes, she does.

403
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,480
The trial by combat will begin.

404
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:16,980
I really appreciate you
coming through for us.

405
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:21,739
But you know how you're not really
good at anything? Can you do this?

406
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:26,500
- I grew up around horses.
- How long since you've ridden one?

407
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,659
It's been a while. Don't worry,
it's not something you forget.

408
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:33,889
I can do this.

409
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:39,320
Nice horse. Try not to make me
look stupid out there, okay?

410
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,849
All right.

411
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,429
I guess that means go.

412
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:48,739
The champion is defeated.
She and all her issue are yours.

413
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,980
I move to appeal that ruling.

414
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:07,170
- She's safe now, right?
- You have won.

415
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:12,099
She's under our protection, as is
her daughter until she comes of age.

416
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:22,099
Are you okay?

417
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:24,079
Yeah.

418
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:30,210
- You sure seem to bleed a lot.
- It's part of the job.

419
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,090
Start over with a fresh slate.

420
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,739
We're starting over with no slate.

421
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,420
Of course.
We shouldn't be keeping score.

422
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,039
We're not running a race.
We're doing a job, one soul at a time.

423
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,349
You guys hold the fort.
I have somewhere to be.

424
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:02,710
Close off the yard,
Cellblocks A to C,

425
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,559
Hey.

426
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,559
Hey.

427
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,079
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, I guess.

428
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,230
I did sign up for this.

429
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,769
Regretting the choice?

430
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:26,699
Bad day. A girl tried to build
her rep by throwing down with me.

431
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:31,010
She had low self-esteem
and a homemade knife, so....

432
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:34,199
Is she...

433
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,769
...you know...

434
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:38,650
...alive?

435
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:42,980
She lives to tell the tale.
I took the knife away.

436
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:45,519
I can't say much for her wrist.

437
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:49,510
- So you didn't kill her.
- I really wanted to.

438
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,510
Took a good beating
from the guards too.

439
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:57,630
- I'm sorry.
- I've earned worse.

440
00:39:57,889 --> 00:39:59,889
Guys like us got it coming.

441
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,309
- I had to sing Barry Manilow.
- You're kidding.

442
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:08,429
In front of people.

443
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,969
And here I talk
about my petty problems.

444
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,380
- Wanted to give you some perspective.
- "Copacabana"?

445
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:18,280
"Mandy." I don't want to dwell on it.

446
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,010
The road to redemption
is a rocky path.

447
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:25,480
That it is.

448
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,230
Think we might make it?

449
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:31,619
We might.

450
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,780
- Food getting any better?
- It's similar to what I grew up on.

451
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:46,369
It's a little one-note,
eating the same thing every day.

452
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,369
I wonder what that's like.

453
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,250
I remember all my life

454
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,630
How you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking

455
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,650
Mandy, um....

456
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,739
look in their eyes

457
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,199
I see them in--

458
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:24,699
How you kissed me
And stopped me

459
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:28,329
It's shaking.
Freaks in the house, up front.

460
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:29,989
Oh, Mandy

461
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,280
Why are you in my living room?

462
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,510
Oh, Mandy

463
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:38,360
Thank you,
