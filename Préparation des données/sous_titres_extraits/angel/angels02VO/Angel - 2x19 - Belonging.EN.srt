1
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:03,609
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:07,309
- Charles Gunn.
- Anne, meet Rondell and George.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,839
- Somebody could have told me.
- You ain't been around.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,550
You've been playing
demon-detective with your new family.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,149
Hands on the wall, spread your feet.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,239
Wait! Officer, wait!

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,539
- He took a bullet for me.
- It was nothing.

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,050
I see you guys have bonded.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,870
None of us are ready just yet--

10
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:33,079
I don't want you to work for me.
I wanna work for you.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,219
Cordy!

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,939
What did you see?

13
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:40,859
Are these vision
hangovers getting longer?

14
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:43,229
I wish it would stop hurting.

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,850
- Want to try my sashimi?
- Raw fish?

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,759
Maybe when hell freezes over.

17
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,810
What are you looking for?

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,310
Celebrities. They won't put them out
here. They put them back in the dark.

19
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,570
Not like here, where
it's bright and open...

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,130
...and everyone can
stare at you and....

21
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,390
It's a little exposed. Kind of public.

22
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,090
That public thing. It happens
when you go where people are.

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,239
No, I like people.
Normal people.

24
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,310
I wanna be one,
celebrate Cordy's good news.

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,099
- It's just a commercial.
- A national commercial. Here's to you.

26
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,340
I can't drink. I have to be up
at 4:30 a.m. for the shoot.

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,769
But continue toasting and praising.

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,750
- You'll knock them dead.
- Don't leave us when you get famous.

29
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,629
Don't worry.

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,739
I can't leave you guys while I'm still
the owner of debilitating visions.

31
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:48,349
I feel a little guilty.

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,329
Don't.

33
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:55,540
A $19 sashimi couscous appetizer
is money well spent.

34
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,540
How is it? Good? It ought to be good.

35
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,230
Delicious, but that's
not why I feel guilty.

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,709
I'm not cheap, I'm old.

37
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,289
I remember when a few bob got you a
meal, a bottle and a tavern wench.

38
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,189
- You were saying?
- I was saying...

39
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,419
...I feel guilty leaving you guys
mid-case to do a commercial.

40
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,810
Angel will contact his
informant in the morning.

41
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,310
- Is it a he or an it?
- Actually, both.

42
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,219
Then it/he points us to the thing
you saw in your vision.

43
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,069
The Haklar demon. The
informant will lead us to its grounds...

44
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,810
...where we manly men will
gather around and kill it to death.

45
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:40,969
Sounds like fun.

46
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:44,750
If you guys want more wine....

47
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,340
Not for me. That imported
stuff goes to your head.

48
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,979
- Should we get a flame thrower?
- For the Haklar?

49
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,139
If you want another bottle--

50
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,520
If we're in a tight space,
we could burn each other.

51
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,500
Right, right.

52
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,930
You're the boss. You'll decide.

53
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,409
A flame thrower is big and loud.
It might call unwanted attention.

54
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,729
Stealth being a larger part of--

55
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,569
- Isn't this interesting?
- What? My shawl?

56
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,500
- Shroud woven of a child's skin.
- What's he doing?

57
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,979
I know a Voctar witch when I see one!
I can read the markings--

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,069
- Looks different up close.
- It's beautiful, ma'am.

59
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,860
It's a beautiful, thousand-dollar
Laura Mina original.

60
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:36,289
My friend loves beautiful things
so much, he can't control himself.

61
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,639
Because he's from France.

62
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,979
We're so sorry. So sorry.

63
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,740
We could set the table on fire with a
flame thrower, draw more attention.

64
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:57,189
- Those markings, from afar, looked--
- Let's just eat and go without--

65
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,389
Oh, God.

66
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,819
- What is it? What do you see?
- Moo--

67
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:06,009
- Moo? Some sort of cow-monster?
- Move! The sashimi's coming up.

68
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,419
They'll take that off the bill.

69
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,589
Yes, Mum.

70
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,459
Yes, well, put him on.

71
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:16,699
Right. You too.

72
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,680
Hello, Father. Happy birthday.

73
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,920
How are you?

74
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,500
Good.

75
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,959
No, it's going quite well, actually.

76
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,449
Yes.

77
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:34,779
I have news. I've been put
in charge of our group.

78
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:37,470
Yes, as their leader.

79
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,259
No, it's a permanent position.
As permanent as these things--

80
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,959
No, I certainly won't be fired.

81
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:53,660
Well, yes, I was that one time. Yes.

82
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,209
Again. No, you're right.
I see how you--

83
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,279
Yes, I'd forgotten. Thank you.

84
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,480
Yes.

85
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:11,829
Just recently. It's going
quite well so far.

86
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,170
No, I think this time--

87
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,420
I hope it will be different.

88
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,459
No. No, you're right.
I see how you--

89
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,399
I just thought you'd be--
I thought you'd want to know.

90
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:36,040
Right. Well, again, happy birthday.

91
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:38,139
Okay.

92
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,220
Talking to someone?

93
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,040
- My father.
- English, Sr.? How is he?

94
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,250
- Well. It's his birthday.
- Nice.

95
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,629
He sends his greetings
to all in Tinseltown.

96
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,089
Sorry.

97
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,350
What are you doing here?

98
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,670
Getting a tan.

99
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:48,209
Not bursting into flames.

100
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,600
So, what are you doing here?

101
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,420
In your vision, did the Haklar--?

102
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,350
Shut up! Seth,
the director, is coming.

103
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,750
- Hi. Thanks for casting me.
- You're welcome. Lose the bathrobe.

104
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,009
- Excuse me?
- You don't speak English?

105
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,910
The wardrobe, I need to see it.
Lose the robe, princess.

106
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,209
Sure, sure.

107
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,689
Turn around.

108
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,199
Well, nothing wrong there.
Okay, turn.

109
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,830
- When does she go to makeup?
- I've been to makeup.

110
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,480
Take her back and tell David to get
rid of the circles under her eyes.

111
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,879
She looks like an abused woman.

112
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,929
- I had food poisoning.
- Yeah, right. You eat. Good one.

113
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:50,009
I should want to sleep with her.
I don't.

114
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:53,360
- Do you? Of course you don't.
- You're out of line.

115
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,490
Apologize to her.

116
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,259
Let me guess. Wannabe rocker
or part-time male model.

117
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,490
- Could be either.
- Apologize.

118
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,820
- Billy, get security.
- Angel--

119
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:09,129
- Who the hell you think you are?
- I'm the director.

120
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,720
You're smart bringing your
unemployed boyfriend onto my set...

121
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:17,149
...to tell me how to film.
Really helps your career.

122
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:20,389
- Sorry. He won't bother you anymore.
- I know.

123
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,110
Security's gonna toss his ass.

124
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,169
Now get into makeup and
hope they can work miracles.

125
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:33,340
Want me to rip his head off?
I can rip his head right off his body.

126
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,600
Are you trying to ruin my career?
Is this a conscious effort on your part?

127
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,049
- No, I just--
- You need to go now.

128
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:48,200
- Why are you still here? Go!
- I have to ask you a question.

129
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:51,600
What?

130
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:57,090
In your vision, did the Haklar eat
his victim whole or rip out the liver?

131
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,889
According to my informant...

132
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:03,169
...liver-eaters feed differently
than people-eaters.

133
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,769
I have to know which it was
so I can kill it.

134
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,870
I hate my whole life.

135
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,950
This Heckler demon
we're supposed to kill--

136
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:32,700
- Haklar. Two A's.
- This Haklar we're supposed to kill.

137
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,700
Give me the specs.
What should I know?

138
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:41,100
The Haklar, descended from the Klenzen
demons, can weigh up to three tons.

139
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:46,039
It awakes from hibernation during
full moons only to feed and mate.

140
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,299
Often simultaneously. Incapable of
speech, they learned to communicate...

141
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:55,610
...via a complex pattern
of timed facial tics...

142
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,470
...similar to our own Morse code.

143
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,799
It prefers a warm, moist climate--

144
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,200
- Wesley.
- Yes?

145
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,779
I meant how do we kill it?

146
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,269
Your standard slice-and-dice.

147
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:15,980
Hey!

148
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,610
- What are y'all doing?
- Got a situation.

149
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,590
You remember Rondell and George.

150
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:24,519
Certainly. I never
thanked you properly.

151
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,519
- I owe you men my life.
- It's cool.

152
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,129
You got shot because
you had our backs.

153
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,059
- How you feeling?
- Better, thank you.

154
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,779
- What's the situation?
- Vamps.

155
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,740
Making Mackenzie Park
their new restaurant.

156
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,490
- Many homeless there.
- They're the meals.

157
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:45,409
- Sounds like we need to set a trap.
- Trap's already set.

158
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,389
It is?

159
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:50,389
We know the drill.
Everything's in motion.

160
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:53,879
- You just need me to--
- Lend us your truck.

161
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,529
- My ride?
- It's still tricked out for dusting?

162
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:01,250
- Yeah, but--
- We wanna go in with all we got.

163
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,889
- Count me in.
- And the Haklar?

164
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,769
Angel finds it, page me.

165
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:11,169
It lives by Lake Hollywood.
Let's hurry. A 5K race starts there soon.

166
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:13,789
Consider yourself paged.

167
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,529
I gotta take this. Wait for me.

168
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,559
We'll hook up at base camp
and go out together.

169
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,159
Whatever, G. Let's roll, Ron.

170
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,679
Angel, is everything all right?

171
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,360
- It's Cordy.
- What about her?

172
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,690
- More headaches?
- What happened?

173
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,340
Nothing happened.
It's just....

174
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,470
Acting's her dream?
She wants to live that?

175
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,860
- With those people? I don't get it.
- Who?

176
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,399
Mr. I'm-a-Commercial-Director-
So-I'm-the-Center-of-the-Universe?

177
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:00,659
If you're not in showbiz,
you're a step down.

178
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,009
We only save the world.
The way he talks to her!

179
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,169
It's like she's his commodity
or his slave.

180
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,769
The worst part? She took it.
When has she taken crap from us?

181
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,129
- Never. And the day after never.
- Exactly.

182
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,289
He's also got her wearing this
flimsy swimsuit that covers, like...

183
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,460
...nothing.

184
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,899
- Appalling.
- Disgusting.

185
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,629
- Shouldn't we be killing something?
- Absolutely.

186
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:38,419
Good. Let's get this show on the road.

187
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,110
Very superstitious

188
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,139
The devil's on his way

189
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,940
A broken looking-glass

190
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:59,549
Seven years of bad luck

191
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,230
Good things in your past

192
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,309
Oh, if you believe in things
that you don't understand

193
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,669
Then you suffer
Superst--

194
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,559
It's okay. Everything's fine.
Nothing to worry about.

195
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,600
It's all part of the show.

196
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,600
It goes on smooth like a lover's kiss.

197
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,480
It's the only suntan lotion
good enough for our man.

198
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,419
Cut! Cut!

199
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,519
- You're in his light.
- Still?

200
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:07,299
I told you, you have
to bend over more.

201
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:10,929
If I bend over more,
I'll fall out of my top.

202
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,200
Then you'll be out of his light.
Everyone wins.

203
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,570
- Isn't there something we--?
- You aren't here to play Ophelia.

204
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,539
Show cleavage, say the line.
Or do you wanna waste more time?

205
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,129
Got it.

206
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:40,179
- Has it--?
- Stopped bleeding? Yeah.

207
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,029
Cordelia.

208
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,039
Hi.

209
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,440
Look, if I was out of line today--

210
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,830
If you were out of line? If?

211
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:02,549
You're comfortable with your use
of the word "if" here, are you?

212
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,490
Sorry I embarrassed you.

213
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:14,450
Who am I kidding?
I embarrassed myself.

214
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,529
I just wanted to act, that's all.

215
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,700
For them to appreciate my talent.

216
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,029
I never wanted to feel like this.

217
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:32,549
- Wasn't Gunn with you?
- He had to take care of some vampires.

218
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,720
How was the big fight?

219
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:39,009
We killed it just before
it devoured some power walkers.

220
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:41,000
- Horrible.
- I know.

221
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,429
I saw it in my vision.

222
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:48,190
Not the Haklar, the walkers.
Walking I get, but power walking?

223
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,759
Why not run for a shorter time?

224
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,490
Weird.

225
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,419
- One of them hit him.
- A walker?

226
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,509
She felt I disrespected
the Haklar's culture.

227
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:03,340
This town sucks.

228
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:11,730
Am I happy to see you!
You're still a knight for hire, yeah?

229
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,670
I'm hiring. I need you
to kill something.

230
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,720
Here are the particulars:
It's a Drokken.

231
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,369
- Drokken?
- It's not in the books.

232
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,809
- It's from another world.
- How so?

233
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,970
Portal. Right in the middle
of my tune. Threw me off.

234
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,660
I hate to disappoint an audience.

235
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,579
What's important is you kill it.

236
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,460
I can't stress enough.
Kill it. You must.

237
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,039
- Where is it?
- No idea.

238
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,490
But I imagine it's getting
pretty hungry by now.

239
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,440
- That's it?
- Why is it here?

240
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,089
What's it want?
What's it capable of?

241
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:18,440
Who cares? It trashed
my club, my clientele.

242
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,309
Isn't violence was impossible there?
Isn't it a sanctuary?

243
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,740
I didn't say it killed anyone.
It knocked over a few of my regulars.

244
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,440
There were angry glances.

245
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,730
I sensed some bad intentions.

246
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:41,700
Not a nice fella. Bad beast.
Did I mention the teeth?

247
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,470
- You mentioned them.
- Are you gonna help me?

248
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,670
We can start at Caritas,
do a circular search.

249
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,309
Hope we get lucky.

250
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:52,579
Angel....

251
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,500
I didn't mean
to step on your toes, Wesley.

252
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:00,660
Quite all right.

253
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,759
- He's our leader.
- It's been a long time coming.

254
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,759
Kudos. Nice choice of conductor.

255
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,960
- So what do we do now?
- Well, um....

256
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,980
Angel's right. A circular search
for the beast seems best.

257
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,269
I like it.

258
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,950
Hey, what's with her?

259
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,319
Food poisoning.
Very expensive appetizers.

260
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,829
Or possibly a vision.

261
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,660
- Okay?
- Why does everyone ask me that?

262
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,640
Do I look okay?

263
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,480
- What'd you see?
- A woman at the public library.

264
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,299
She works there.
She was reading a book.

265
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:02,529
As scary as that sounds,
crazed Drokken on the loose.

266
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,450
I was here first.

267
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,009
There was an opening behind her.
Something magical. A portal.

268
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,980
- A portal?
- A portal?

269
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,460
- Like the one the Drokken used?
- We don't know that.

270
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,839
Let's get the library.
They close soon.

271
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,710
Great, The Powers That Be
have an interest in--

272
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:29,309
I mean--The problem I brought you.
What a break.

273
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,609
You coming?

274
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:35,450
I...thought you'd never ask.

275
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,299
Junior, where is everybody?

276
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,210
What's wrong?

277
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:21,900
What--?

278
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,059
- Did they make him drink?
- We don't know.

279
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,910
I have the weirdest sense of déjà vu.

280
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,839
How come you and me always end up
in a library? Let's do something fun.

281
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,339
- Like what?
- Elton's in town. Back row seats?

282
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,779
I don't do crowded.

283
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,529
Elton starts "Yellow Brick Road"...

284
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,210
...you feel like the only person there.

285
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:02,299
Hi. How are you?

286
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:06,420
You...you're...

287
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,430
...here for the children's program.
- Yes. Yes, I am.

288
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:13,420
- It's tomorrow.
- Yes.

289
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,660
I don't perform without
checking the space.

290
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,170
Oh! Well, the kids will flip
over your costume.

291
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,109
- It looks so real.
- Thanks.

292
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,930
- Not the horns. They're hard to fake.
- If you only knew.

293
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,799
The reading area's down that way.

294
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,910
Toodles. See you
and the munchkins tomorrow.

295
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,579
We close in five minutes.

296
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:41,470
We're looking for
a woman who works here.

297
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:44,609
- Who's that?
- Okay. She's tall.

298
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,910
She has brown hair.
Wears glasses. Pretty.

299
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,119
Sorry.

300
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,710
She wears a locket, shaped like a
ball or an apple, I think.

301
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,529
An apple? Fred wore one of those.

302
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,920
- Fred?
- Winifred. We called her Fred.

303
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,829
Do you know where she is?

304
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,880
She disappeared five years ago.
They never found her.

305
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,019
Police said if she didn't show up, well....

306
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:22,410
- We stopped hoping long ago.
- This is her.

307
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:24,220
Tell us about her?

308
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,160
She worked with me.
She wanted to be a physicist.

309
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:32,079
- The day she disappeared--
- Oh.... It was creepy.

310
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,369
She was cataloging in Foreign Language
and then she was gone.

311
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:46,299
Angel, why don't you look there?
I'll look over here and....

312
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,450
- Why are we here?
- I saw the portal here in my vision.

313
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,460
The reading room? To die for!
Stage, chair, fabulous colors.

314
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:58,589
I'm tempted to come tomorrow.

315
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:01,309
We're doing what you wanted us to do.

316
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:04,170
I liked that search pattern you pitched.

317
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,059
Are we going to do that?

318
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,079
Here it is. This is the book that
Fred had in my vision.

319
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,980
"Scrsqwrn." What language is that?

320
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:19,480
Last checked out May 6, 1996...

321
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:21,990
...and returned May 7, 1996.

322
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:24,500
The day she disappeared.

323
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,710
"Pat, I'll buy a vowel."

324
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,180
Landok? Is that you?

325
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:08,559
- You know him?
- That doesn't mean you should stop.

326
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,970
- Please continue.
- Can it be you?

327
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,039
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan?

328
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:16,369
- Do it, Angel.
- Krevlornswath?

329
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:18,490
Of the Deathwok Clan?

330
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,240
- I prefer Lorne.
- Lorne?

331
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:25,259
Yes, Lorne. Though I
generally don't go by that....

332
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,670
- Green?
- Huh?

333
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,490
Right! Lorne Greene.

334
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,259
Bonanza?

335
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:35,849
15 years on the air
means nothing to you?

336
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,920
Okay, now I feel old.

337
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,910
- What is this place?
- Los Angeles.

338
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,369
- This isn't a hot spot.
- Is it a prison?

339
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:50,210
Whoa, big fella. Put it down.
They're friends.

340
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,900
Angel, Cordelia, Wesley...

341
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,480
- ...this is Landok.
- Landokmar of the Deathwok Clan.

342
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,789
Deathwok Clan again.

343
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:02,430
- The two of you are--
- Cousins.

344
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,269
- Your cousin?
- Your vanishing was a great mystery.

345
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,970
Long story, boring ending.
It wouldn't interest you.

346
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,309
We hoped you died atoning
in the Sacrificial Canyons of Trelinsk.

347
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,240
It's been fun. But we have to go.

348
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,799
You'll be fine.
New people come to L.A. each day.

349
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,160
Were you abducted here?

350
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:30,369
- I came by portal.
- We will find a path back to our home.

351
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,160
- We'll go together.
- My ticket was one-way.

352
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:38,529
You won't return to remove shame
from your Life-Giver?

353
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:42,059
Is anyone else hungry?
How about Italian?

354
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:46,500
- Your mother's burden is terrible.
- Misses me, does she?

355
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,230
She rips your images...

356
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,509
...and feeds them to swine.
Butchers them...

357
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:56,569
- ...and feeds them to dogs.
- That's Ma. You pick.

358
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,799
I'm game for anything.

359
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:00,839
- You coward.
- These people...

360
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,259
- ...don't care about our family.
- Sure we do.

361
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:07,160
Yes! Let's hear about it.

362
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,440
Okay, for your information,
not a coward.

363
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:15,269
We were just on a Drokken hunt.
We must return to it.

364
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,920
- Excuse us--
- A Drokken's near?

365
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,960
- I will assist.
- Find your own.

366
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:24,450
- How do we kill it?
- Pierce it with thromite.

367
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:29,240
Sorry, cuz. Thromite: not exactly
existing in this world. Thanks.

368
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:32,849
Killing it will be most difficult.

369
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,500
- Decapitation?
- Stabbing?

370
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,099
- Electrocution?
- We've had luck with that before.

371
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,069
You must use thromite. The Drokken's
strong and fast, hard to hit.

372
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,220
- We gotta find it first.
- I can track it.

373
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:51,130
- You can?
- It leaves waves of hostility.

374
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,069
And you can read these waves?
All your people do this?

375
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,450
- Those who submit to training.
- Everybody on board.

376
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,470
- Guilt trip leaving.
- Show me where it appeared.

377
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:07,789
- I will help you.
- We welcome your help.

378
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:31,190
- You should've waited for me.
- We've been waiting for months.

379
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,009
Our path is true, our arrival late.

380
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,170
The Drokken has consumed.
It'll be at maximum power.

381
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,089
What's he doing?

382
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:04,690
He's channeling to identify its aura.

383
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,710
I use that to find destiny, and I'm a freak.

384
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,980
He uses it to hunt,
he's the golden spawn. Go figure.

385
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,769
So he's a hero back home?

386
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:20,140
Talk about weird values.
A world of only good and evil.

387
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,089
Black and white.

388
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,650
No music, no art.

389
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:28,930
Just champions roaming the country
fighting for justice. Boring.

390
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,789
Problems solved with a sword.

391
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,970
No one admits to having feelings
and emotions or talks about them.

392
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,670
- Can you imagine living like that?
- Not really.

393
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:48,619
Why isn't Gunn answering?
What if he's in trouble?

394
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,839
Maybe he's in the middle
of his stake-o-rama.

395
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,819
Last time we went chasing
after him, you got shot.

396
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,950
Point taken.

397
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,220
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

398
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,259
- We're missing something.
- When we get back...

399
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:11,210
- ...I'll decipher it.
- I mean something bigger.

400
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:14,009
- Like what?
- I don't know.

401
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:18,369
I feel like we're chasing after
the monster, which is good...

402
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,490
...but we're missing something.

403
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:26,319
It's this way. The aura's strong.
It's not far.

404
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,900
- What do you want, a medal?
- Krevlornswath mocks me?

405
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,369
Just the L.A. in me.

406
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:39,660
The Krevlornswath who refused
the traditional hunting and gathering?

407
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,470
I'll tell you a secret.
While you were hunting...

408
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:47,349
...I was with the señoritas,
gathering a little love.

409
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,339
- You brought cowardice to the joust.
- For the last time...

410
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,819
...not a coward.
I saw both sides of the joust.

411
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,630
How can you joust someone
when you agree with them?

412
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,839
It has taken food to consume later.

413
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,359
More food?

414
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,029
Oh, you mean people?

415
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,490
Oh! You mean people!

416
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,480
You sure this is where it came?

417
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:36,250
I am sure.

418
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,829
What do we do, Wesley?

419
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,690
We don't have Gunn.

420
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:43,789
- If it's as strong as Landok says--
- Yeah?

421
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,059
I have flares.
The light will distract him...

422
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:51,450
- ...long enough for us to--
- Enough words!

423
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,109
Patience: not a virtue with my people.

424
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,710
Angel, what are you-- What are you....

425
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,549
But we don't have a plan.

426
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,329
- Where is my sword?
- You're hurt.

427
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:35,079
- Fetch it.
- You're poisoned.

428
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:38,819
- There's time to die later.
- Poisoned?

429
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,460
The Drokken's bite is deadly
to my people.

430
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,210
- Is there an antidote?
- Back in our world.

431
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,369
It's going after the woman.

432
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,400
Find her, get her out.
I'll find the Drokken.

433
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,039
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan,
my sword!

434
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:40,450
Hello? Martyr complex?
You can't even lift your arm.

435
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,799
Hey, you want food?

436
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:56,549
I can be food.

437
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,299
Pretty tasty here.

438
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,599
Come on, where are you?

439
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:14,230
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

440
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,800
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

441
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:41,760
It's all right.
I'll get you out of here.

442
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,409
Don't be scared.

443
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,219
That was fun.

444
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,050
- If I perish tonight--
- Stop. No perishables allowed.

445
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:37,070
- You'll perform the rituals.
- I certainly will not.

446
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,360
I won't receive glory if you don't.

447
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:42,440
Glory you won't have.

448
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:45,440
You're the only one here
who can officiate.

449
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:49,320
We must get him home or he'll die.

450
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:51,900
- I think I understand.
- What?

451
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:55,349
- This book. It's how we do it.
- What do you mean?

452
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:58,429
If he reads from it,
it'll send him back.

453
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:02,300
My vision showed what happened
to that girl Fred.

454
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,030
The portal works both ways.

455
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,170
- And if it sends something here?
- It won't.

456
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:13,309
- How can you be sure?
- I can't. I just am.

457
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,570
Don't ask me how I know, I just know.

458
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:22,929
Let's go.

459
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,420
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan,
give me your pledge.

460
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,739
Will you perform the rituals?

461
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:37,949
I won't have to. No one's dying.

462
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:21,769
- Where'd it appear?
- There. Talk about upstaging me.

463
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,130
Cordy.

464
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,619
Just read aloud from it.

465
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:33,170
Well, that's the theory.

466
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:36,980
To defeat the Drokken,
you must be a noble warrior.

467
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,599
Well, you know.... I try.

468
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:44,320
I am happy to know you.

469
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:50,170
- Landok, be safe.
- Bye, Krevlornswath of Deathwok Clan.

470
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:53,050
Tell my mother I--

471
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,170
Tell her I threw myself into the
Canyons of Trelinsk.

472
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:02,170
- I feel we will meet again someday.
- Oh, God, I hope not.

473
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,429
"Klmprkthr pwlznth wrv...

474
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:09,309
...blrpnkntr vrbqwptl spgr drpvln--"

475
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:24,840
What say we all forget
this ever happened?

476
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:28,050
I'm down with that. Wesley?

477
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:30,380
Fine with me.

478
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:31,829
Cordy?

479
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,179
Cordy?

480
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:40,800
Cordy!

481
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,489
Oh, crap!

482
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,559
Thank you,
