I don't have it.

488
00:34:28,824 --> 00:34:31,987
- Where is it?
- You are one strange man, Señor Angel.

489
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,824
I'm not the one in a mask standing
in a cemetery in the middle of the night.

490
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,524
No.
But you will be.

491
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:42,026
You want this thing
to punch your ticket, fine.

492
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:44,037
But I'm not gonna
let it get the talisman.

493
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,973
Say you stop it. Then what? In 50 years
it's back, and nothing has changed.

494
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:52,479
- Give it to me!
- You were right about Tezcatcatl
not wanting to kill me--

495
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:55,482
that I am not a hero.

496
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:59,714
So I had to find a way to fool him...
to make myself worthy.

497
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:04,486
I swallowed the talisman. If he wants it,
he will have to cut it out of me.

498
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:13,660
You want your talisman?

499
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:23,634
Don't you remember?

500
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:26,009
I'm the hombre
who destroyed you last time.

501
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,049
Come on.

502
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:31,176
It's in here.

503
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:33,021
Come and get it.

504
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:33,419
Come and get it.

505
00:35:38,861 --> 00:35:40,726
[ Groans ]
That's it.

506
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,033
Again.

507
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,702
Not gonna make it
that easy for you.

508
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:12,186
We already did
this little dance, remember?

509
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:21,761
If you're looking for heroes,
you're wasting your time.

510
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,804
- [ Groans ]
- No!

511
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:42,989
About time
I taught you somethin'.

512
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,427
<i>Mis hermanos.!</i>

513
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:31,931
[All Together]
Ándale!

514
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,619
<i>Amigo. Ándale.!</i>

515
00:38:26,495 --> 00:38:28,690
We're tryin' to kill it,
not pin it.

516
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:41,567
Okay, pinning works.

517
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:53,013
[ Groaning ]

518
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,759
Hey.

519
00:38:58,994 --> 00:39:01,019
<i>Mis hermanos,</i>
they came back.

520
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:04,860
Because you're worthy.
You proved it.

521
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:08,800
Maybe.

522
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:11,099
But still, the demon
did not want my heart.

523
00:39:12,441 --> 00:39:15,808
- He didn't want mine either.
- Of course not, amigo.

524
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:18,937
Who would want that dried-up
walnut of a dead thing?

525
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,649
[ Coughs ]
Coffee.

526
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:25,720
Coffee?
You want coffee?

527
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:29,279
<i>Estúpido.</i>
The talisman, it's in--

528
00:39:29,391 --> 00:39:31,256
[ Groaning ]

529
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:46,940
I may not be a hero,
but I am not a fool.

530
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,505
[ Angel ]
See if you can put this someplace safe.

531
00:41:03,652 --> 00:41:05,916
Angel, are you okay?
I know you've been feeling--

532
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:07,921
I'm fine.

533
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:10,548
Got the job done.
That's what's important.

534
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:16,387
Been a long day.

535
00:41:16,498 --> 00:41:18,329
See you guys in the morning.

536
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:25,134
So, Number Five, he jumped in
and helped at the end?

537
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,435
He died a hero.

538
00:42:16,124 --> 00:42:18,092
[ Sighs ]

539
00:42:20,462 --> 00:42:24,694
Shanshu prophecy,

540
00:43:10,412 --> 00:43:12,812
Grr! Arrgh!
