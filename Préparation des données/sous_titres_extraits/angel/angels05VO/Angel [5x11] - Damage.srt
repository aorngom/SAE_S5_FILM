Oh, yeah. Look at the big, bad demon
hidin' inside the helpless little girl.

163
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:25,994
Why don't you come on out of there
and let's have a proper go, mate.

164
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:29,872

Sorry, luv.
I don't speak Chinese.

167
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,685
What happened?

168
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:20,551
I just thought I'd see what it was like
to bounce off the pavement.

169
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:22,955
- Pretty much what I expected.
- Stay out of it. Tactical's on the way.

170

Oh, right. Sure, she'll hang around
till they show up.

171

- You should have waited.
- Hey, keep your knickers on.

172
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:31,993
At least now I know what we're
dealing with. It's a Chinese demon.

173
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,435
Maybe a water dragon or one
of those elemental thingies.

174
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,275
What?

175
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:44,211
- A psychotic Vampire Slayer.
- How many times you gonna keep saying that?

176
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,976
Just trying to wrap my lobes around it.
A psycho Slayer.

- At least I was trying to stop her.

- At least I know the game now, don't I?

179
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:54,222
I killed two Slayers
with my own hands.

I mean, Buffy helped,
but it was mostly us.

So what happened? Last I heard, you went
all pillar of fire down in the Hellmouth.

We were just about to bring everyone
up to speed on Slayer mythology.

199

I'll take it from here, Pryce.
Best they hear it from an expert.

Oh, right.
Let the top man have a go.

Please, enlighten us.

Gather round and attend
to a most unusual tale.

203
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,872
A tale I like to call...
the "Slayer of the Vampyres."

204
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:28,975
[Clears Throat] Eons ago, on the dark
continent, three wise elders decided...

205
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,815
to fight evil with a taste
of its own <i>sinistro.</i>

206
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:36,449
They took a young girl, and they
imbued her with the power of a demon.

207
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,824
Thusly, the first Slayer
of the Vampyres was born.

208
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:44,389
But, alas, the existence of a Slayer
is often brutal and short-lived.

209
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:48,665
<i>And the Primitive, as she was called,</i>
<i>boasted no exception.</i>

210
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:51,070
But the elders had foreseen
this inevitability...

211
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:54,007
and devised a way
for her power to live on.

212
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,635
In every generation,
one is chosen.

213
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:59,715
Yes, attractive, slender woman.

214
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:02,478
There are many Potentials,
as we experts call them.

215
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:05,053
Hundreds, maybe thousands
per generation.

216
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:07,487
Each of them experiencing
vivid dreams...

217
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,026
some say nightmares,
of the heroics of past Slayers.

218
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:13,254
But only one can be chosen.

219
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:15,627
That's, uh, really great.

220
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:18,166
But we actually know all that.

Vampyr Slayer extraordinaire...

226

with the <i>beaucoup de magie.</i>

227
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,790
- One light show later...
- All the Potentials become Slayers.

228
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,690
An army of Slayers.

229
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:49,287
Brilliant stratagem.
But with the Watchers Council destroyed...

230
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,232
how will these new Slayers
receive their necessary...

231
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:56,101
Mr. Giles and a few
key Sunnydale alum...

232
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:58,936
have been tracking
down the recently chosen...

233
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:02,011
guiding them, training them,
giving them the full <i>X- Men...</i>

234
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:04,637
minus the crappy third act.

235
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:08,582
But this Dana girl, she's an anomaly
that no one could have foreseen.

236

<i>Tortured, traumatized,</i>
<i>driven insane by Yoda-knows-who.</i>

237
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,121
And then the dreams of demons and superpowers
she's always had suddenly become real.

238
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:20,219
The dreams of Slayers
are usually just that... dreams.

239
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,232
<i>But Dana's mental instability</i>
<i>may be making them seem more real.</i>

My hypothesis exactly, Pryce.

241
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:31,171
I see Mr. Giles may
have been wrong about you.

242
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:34,710
That explains why that skirt
was yappin' at me in Chinese.

- Only if you're the punch line.

We're the last two people that should be
confronting her. She's a Slayer.

252
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:01,665
She has every reason to hate us,
and she's unstable.

253

In her mind, there probably
aren't any good "vampyres."

it was like she was looking for something.

- No. Where all this started for her.

324
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:28,403
<i>That's where her pain lives.</i>

325
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:54,323
[Spike]
Let's try the blue one this time.

326
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:05,664
<i>[Andrew] Well, mostly</i>
<i>I talk to Rupert. But we all check in.</i>

327
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:09,795
Xander is in Africa.
He sent me a mbuna fish.

328
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,807
And Willow and Kennedy
are in Brazil.

329
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:18,074
They're based out of Sao Paulo, but, um,
every time I talk to them, they're in Rio.

330
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,342
[Sniffs]

331
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,818
[Sniffs]

332
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,754
What's it smell like?
Blood, I mean.

333
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:30,690
Metallic, sort of.
You ever taste a penny?

334
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:33,762
No. Wait. No.

335
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:36,627
Smells like that.

336
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:50,237
So, uh, heard
from Buffy lately?

337
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:52,678
Yeah, of course.
Uh, she's in Rome.

338
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,842
Dawn's in school there.
Italian school.

339
00:24:55,952 --> 00:25:00,184
Oh, Rome, eh? Never pegged her
for the expatriate show.

340
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,780
Yeah, she was rounding Slayers
up in Europe.

341
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:04,860
Decided she liked it there,
I guess.

342
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:08,797
I think that, uh...

343
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:10,866
- [Groaning]
- [Clinks On Ground]

344
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:14,460
I think she needed a break
from California.

345
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,538
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

346
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:19,608
She doesn't know you're alive,
does she?

347
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:23,873
I don't think so.
I mean, I don't know. Does she?

348
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,507
No. No, no, she can't.
I mean, I would have heard about it.

349
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:30,450
- We would have had a conference call.
- [Exhales]

350
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:32,885
Why haven't you told her?

351
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,152
Hello, Buffy, it's Spike.
I didn't burn up like you thought.

352
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:38,159
How are things?

353
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:41,630
Do you want me to tell her?

354
00:25:41,731 --> 00:25:45,326
<i>'Cause I'm really good</i>
<i>with those delicate, personal...</i>

355
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:48,096
No, don't tell her.
I'll take care of it.

356
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:50,900
Got it.

357
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:55,273
You're a loner, playin' it cucumber,
as in "cool as a."

358
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:58,905
- Just keep your mouth shut.
- No problem, brother.

359
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,483
[Andrew] You're a troubled hero.
A creature of the night.

360
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:04,382
<i>- El criatura del noche.</i>
- [Spike] Please stop.

361
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:07,923
Living by his own rules, unafraid
of anything, anyone.

362
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,287
<i>- Hey, how'd it go?</i>
- I want to find the guy who killed Dana's family.

363
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:13,419
His name, his past,
his whereabouts, everything.

364
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,690
- Police never caught him.
- Well, we're not the police.

365
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:18,164
Search our files, talk to our contacts,
raise the dead if we have to.

366
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:21,896
Just find him. Lorne, I wanna know
where he took her after he abducted her.

367
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:24,973
The psychic narrowed it down
to a basement that smells like molasses.

368
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:27,201
We can do better.
Start cracking the whip.

369
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,835
You got it, chief.
Danny, we're gonna need a whip!

370
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:34,645
So I say, "Well, the two of us
disagree with you, hombre."

371
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,945
And he's all,
"The two of you?"

372
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:41,353
And I say,
"Yeah, me and my electric net."

373
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:43,425
And then...

374
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:47,228
- What's wrong?
- Blood.

375
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,163
Smells different. Stronger.

376
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:52,234
Like nickels?

377
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:16,353
Dead end?

378
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,092
It's her blood.

379
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:35,997
All right, pet.
No getting away.

380
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:40,474
<i>Got your scent locked in now.</i>
<i>I can track you for miles.</i>

381
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:44,578
No escaping.

382
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,446
That's right, no escaping.

383
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,820
All the same, don't want
to have to hurt you.

384
00:28:54,924 --> 00:28:58,291
It doesn't hurt if you hold still.

385
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:00,521
[Chuckles]
Right.

386
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:04,862
Heart and head.

387
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:07,629
<i>Have to get home.</i>

388
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:09,863
It doesn't hurt if you hold still.

389
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:12,406
You're a real sack of hammers,
aren't you?

390
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:17,835
Hey, don't worry. I used to date
a girl who wasn't all there.

391
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:20,939
Heart and head.

392
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:25,086
Stab the heart,
cut off the head.

393
00:29:25,187 --> 00:29:28,520
- Only way to be sure.
- That's Slayer talk, isn't it?

394
00:29:28,624 --> 00:29:31,525
- Keep cutting till you see dust.
- Right.

395
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:36,030
<i>Let me explain.</i>
<i>You got visions, right?</i>

396
00:29:36,132 --> 00:29:39,397
Vampire, Slayer memories
kickin' around in your head.

397
00:29:39,502 --> 00:29:43,802
Which is tough, 'cause it sounds like
you're past midnight on the crazy clock anyway.

398
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:45,999
Please don't.

399
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:49,635
I have to get home to my son...
to my Robin.

400
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:51,940
Robin?

401
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:56,541
Oh, hey, you're talkin' about Nikki,
the Slayer I offed back in...

402
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:01,889
Uh, yeah, you probably don't
want to think about that, pet.

403
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:05,586
- William the Bloody.
- No, no, no.

404
00:30:05,694 --> 00:30:09,152
That's not gonna lead anywhere good.
You wanna focus on what's real.

405
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,859
- Head and heart. Don't be scared.
- Now, we're gonna...

You little minx.

<i>- Yellows make you weak.</i>

- Don't cry.

- Tactical found the body here, Fourth and Camden.
- Great.

00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,558
She's staying in the area. Let's get
aerial surveillance up, thermal imaging.

427
00:32:19,662 --> 00:32:22,529
- Have 'em go block to block, five-mile radius.
- What are they lookin' for?

428
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:26,362
I mean, this is an industrial area. Most of
the buildings have a basement of some sort.

429
00:32:26,468 --> 00:32:29,460
- Lorne, any luck with the psychics on this place?
- No, nothin' new.

430
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:32,233
It's still cold, creepy,
and smells like molasses.

431

What about... I almost said the words
"molasses factory" out loud.

Whiskey.

433
00:32:38,614 --> 00:32:41,139
Oh, God bless you, kitten. I was just about
to suggest the same thing.

434
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,186
No, I mean when you're cookin' up whiskey,
it makes the whole room smell like molasses.

Chain her into the van. I want armed guards
ridin' with her in the back.

491
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:37,668
<i>- That's all right, boys. I'll take her from here.</i>
- What?

492
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:41,647
Totally appreciate your help on this one, big guy.
Never could have found her without you.

493
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,015
<i>But you've got enough problems</i>
<i>of your own to worry about.</i>

494
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,350
Get out of the way, Andrew.

495
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:53,151
She's a Slayer.
That means she's ours.

496
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:57,390
Yeah. Sorry.
Not how it works.

497
00:37:57,499 --> 00:37:59,797
Load her up. Don't hesitate
to tranq her if she so much as...

498
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:02,028
I don't think
you heard me, Angel.

499
00:38:19,988 --> 00:38:24,084
You think we're just gonna let you take
her back to your evil stronghold?

500
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:28,652
Well, as they say in <i>México...</i>

501
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:33,361
no...

502
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:36,869
we're not gonna let you.

503
00:38:36,972 --> 00:38:40,567
She's psychotic, and I'm not
turning her over to you.

504
00:38:40,676 --> 00:38:44,772
You don't have a choice.
Check the view screen, Uhuru.

505
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,214
I got 12 Vampyr Slayers behind me,
and not one of them has ever dated you.

506
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,683
She's coming with us,
one way or another.

507
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,315
You're way out of your league.

508
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,360
I'll just clear this with Buffy.

509
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:03,522
Where do you think
my orders came from?

510
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:09,701
News flash... nobody in our camp
trusts you anymore.

511
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,535
<i>Nobody.</i>

512
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:16,106
You work for Wolfram and Hart.

513
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:18,805
Don't fool yourself.

514
00:39:18,914 --> 00:39:20,973
We're not on the same side.

515
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:28,118
Thank you for your help,
but, uh, we got it.

516
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:47,273
So that's it?

517
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,400
<i>Just gonna let him take her?</i>

518
00:39:50,545 --> 00:39:52,445
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>She's one of theirs.</i>

519
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:54,447
They can handle it.

520
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:58,986
Besides, you heard the man.

521
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:02,147
We got enough problems
of our own to worry about.

522
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,835
<i>[Footsteps Approaching Slowly]</i>

523
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,366
Come to tap-dance
on the patient, have we, Doc?

524
00:40:18,473 --> 00:40:21,033
<i>I'd give you the finger,</i>
<i>but apparently...</i>

525
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:24,203
I won't have the motor skills
till the drugs wear off.

526
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:28,114
A lot of pain?

527
00:40:28,216 --> 00:40:30,741
More than I'd like.

528
00:40:30,852 --> 00:40:35,221
But not as much as you would.
Just what I deserve.

529
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:39,090
[Sighs]
I didn't say that.

530
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:42,823
No. I did.

531
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:48,600
The lass thought
I killed her family.

532
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:51,228
And I'm supposed to,
what, complain...

533
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:54,968
'cause hers wasn't one
of the hundreds of families I did kill?

534
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,305
I'm not saying you're right.

535
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:05,011
'Cause, uh, I'm physically incapable
of saying that.

536
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,611
But, uh...

537
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:09,622
for a demon...

538
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:12,750
I never did think that much
about the nature of evil.

539
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:15,091
<i>No.</i>

540
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:17,688
Just threw myself in.

541
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:22,302
Thought it was a party.

542
00:41:22,404 --> 00:41:25,567
I liked the rush.
I liked the crunch.

543
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,338
Never did look back
at the victims.

544
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:35,675
I couldn't take my eyes
off them.

545
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,378
<i>I was only in it for the evil.</i>

546
00:41:41,223 --> 00:41:45,626
That was everything to me.
It was art...

547
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:49,094
the destruction of a human being.

548
00:41:49,197 --> 00:41:52,064
Geez, I would've considered
Dana a masterpiece.

549
00:41:53,335 --> 00:41:55,235
What happens to her?

550
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:57,601
I don't know.

551
00:41:57,706 --> 00:42:01,802
Um, Andrew and the Slayers took her.
Didn't trust us to help her.

552
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,208
Andrew double-crossed us?

553
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:08,276
That's a good move.

554
00:42:08,383 --> 00:42:11,477
[Chuckles]
Hope for the little ponce yet.

555
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:18,255
Though the tingling in my forearms
tells me she's too far gone to help.

556
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,429
She's one of us now.

557
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:26,132
She's a monster.

558
00:42:27,435 --> 00:42:29,926
She's an innocent victim.

559
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:34,731
So were we...
once upon a time.

560
00:42:37,345 --> 00:42:39,506
Once upon a time.

561
00:43:17,452 --> 00:43:19,852
Grr! Arrgh!
