1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,887
<i>Previously on</i> Angel.

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:05,520
<i>A Black Thorn is the senior</i>
<i>partners'instrument on Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,259
He wouldn't make it on the circle's radar
till he killed one of his lieutenants.

4
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:11,200
<i>Welcome to the fold.</i>

5
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,238
We know what
you been doin'.

6
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:18,442
- [Gasps]
<i>- Involvare.</i>

7
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:24,044
- All right. We have six minutes.
- Till what?

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,881
The glamour collapses.
As far as anyone outside is concerned,
we're at each other's throats.

9
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:32,947
<i>I'm talking about killing every</i>
<i>single member of the Black Thorn.</i>

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,119
You need to decide
if that's worth dying for.

11
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:40,055
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

12
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:48,206
Then we're all agreed.

13
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:52,209
<i>Yeah. We're all one big</i>
<i>happy Manson family.</i>

14
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:54,973
- We taking 'em all at once?
- Can't.

15
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:59,108
The Circle of the Black Thorn is the most
powerful group in this plane of existence.

16
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:01,243
<i>Together, they'd vaporize us.</i>

17
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:03,345
But separated,
they're just demons.

18
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:05,583
- When do we make our move?
- Soon.

19
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,591
In the meantime,
we keep up the infighting.

20
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,627
The circle needs to believe
we're comin' apart.

21
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,788
- What about Illyria?
- What about her?

22
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,765
Move like this, wouldn't hate
having Blue Thunder in our corner.

23
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,665
Can't trust she'll
come down on our side.

24
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,330
Oh, trust me. She's housebroken.
She was babysittin' Drogyn...

25
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,771
- She was with Drogyn?
<i>- Relax. The two of'em were gettin'on well.</i>

26
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,105
<i>- You have to get over there now.</i>
<i>- Why? What is it?</i>

27
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,044
Drogyn's dead.

28
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:30,707
And, uh, how do
you know <i>that,</i> Kreskin?

29
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:32,875
- Because I killed him.
- What?

30
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:36,217
Ow! You son of a...

31
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:40,486
Sorry. Didn't know
you were... in conference.

32
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:43,323
I was just making
a closing statement.

33
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,329
Unless somebody
didn't hear me.

34
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:53,637
Up to you too, Wes. Illyria's your responsibility.
Make sure she doesn't get twitchy.

35
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,674
- [Slams]
- Well, you've got yourself a problem.

36
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:58,744
Nothing you have
to worry about.

37
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:01,904
Oh, not me.
Your new friends, the Black Thorn.

38
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:03,948
They're very concerned.

39
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,042
Tell 'em to send me a memo.
I'm busy. Trying to run a business.

40
00:02:07,153 --> 00:02:10,054
You can tell them yourself.
They want to see you right now.

41
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,516
No rest for the wicked.

42
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:16,954
[Wesley]
Illyria.

43
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:19,251
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Bloody hell.</i>

44
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,258
Illyria, can you hear me?

45
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,690
Who did this to you?

46
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,232
It was Hamilton.
Took Drogyn.

47
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,171
<i>[Lorne]</i>
<i>Straight to his buddy, Angel.</i>

48
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:39,972
I'm telling you.
Our fearless leader has fearlessly lost it.

49
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,912
There's no part of this that makes
any sense. I mean, we could be next.

50
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,745
I don't think we're
being monitored here.

51
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,251
I'm not playing
to the crowd, Gunn.

52
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,015
I still don't trust the man.

53
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:53,751
We don't have to trust him.
We just gotta pray the Black Circle does.

54
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,386
[All]
...the world's woe, now convene.

55
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:01,660
All is bound by the circle
and its thorns...

56
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,702
invisible, inviolate.

57
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:10,674
We, the seeds of the storm at the center
of the world's woe, now convene.

58
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:23,954
The circle does not abide secrets.

59
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:29,526
Which is interesting
for a secret society.

60
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:32,392
Remember your place, vampire.

61
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:35,399
[Angel]
My place is in the circle.

62
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,959
This morning's insurrection
did not go unnoticed.

63
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,097
- You mean my people.
<i>- They tried to kill you.</i>

64
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,506
An embarrassing affront,
to say the least.

65
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,204
And a stepping stone
to disaster.

66
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:52,216
You have ascended, Angel. You should
not be burdened with this kind of...

67
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:55,549
[Gasps]

68
00:04:55,654 --> 00:05:01,092
Sebassis, your manservant has become
tangled in my bodily fluids again!

69
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:04,356
- [Yelps]
<i>- My</i> people are the problem?

70
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,488
Some of them, yes.

71
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:10,399
<i>Some?</i>
<i>Who missed the cut?</i>

72
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:13,529
We're interested in Mr. Wyndam-Pryce.

73
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,006
He seems intriguingly unstable.

74
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,976
<i>Mr. Gunn, on</i>
<i>the other hand, does not.</i>

75
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,411
Which is a pity.
He had so much potential.

76
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:26,042
He is not, however,
our greatest concern.

77
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:31,385
If the next words out of your mouth are
"Kill Spike," we just might have to kiss.

78
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,618
Spike is not the threat.
You are.

79
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:41,265
You've proven your loyalty
to the circle.

80
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:45,968
<i>Regrettably, there's</i>
<i>something stronger than loyalty.</i>

81
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:48,439
Hope.

82
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:54,945
- [Angel] This is the Shanshu prophecy.
<i>- The original.</i>

83
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:59,143
"The vampire with a soul will play
a pivotal role in the apocalypse."

84
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:03,449
<i>[Vail]</i>
<i>"And as a reward will become human."</i>

85
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:06,889
<i>[Sebassis] Aparanoid person might</i>
<i>think you're trying to manipulate us...</i>

86
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,654
in an attempt
to fulfill this prophecy.

87
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:11,957
I have no desire
to become human.

88
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,964
Oh, good.

89
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:17,297
Then you won't mind signing
that pesky future away.

90
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:20,338
<i>Through that document,</i>
<i>the prophecy can be undone.</i>

91
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,408
<i>Your signature there will</i>
<i>remove any opportunity...</i>

92
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,003
<i>that you will ever earn your</i>
<i>once-precious humanity.</i>

93
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:30,240
Will you sign it?

94
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:35,018
Of course.

95
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,487
- [Groans]
- It's gotta be signed in blood.

96
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,622
[Groans]

97
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,668
Um, Angel?

98
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:01,045
Just wondering
where everybody is.

99
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,281
You ever miss it?

100
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:12,014
You were turned, what,
five years ago?

101
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,717
Oh, that.

102
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:18,888
Yeah. Graduation night.

103
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,928
I don't know. It's weird.

104
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,974
Part of me always knew life
would end after high school.

105
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:35,672
I was very popular, you know.
The whole golden years thing.

106
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:41,817
I don't remember what
it was like, being human.

107
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,820
It was too long ago.

108
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,913
Not so great.

109
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:48,892
Zits, dandruff, mortality.

110
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:53,192
Although, I do remember...

111
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,324
my heart.
[Sighs]

112
00:07:55,434 --> 00:08:00,133
And the way it would thump when I kissed
a really hot boy for the first time.

113
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:05,499
That was cool.

114
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,982
Angel, something's
going down, isn't it?

115
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,549
And everybody's
in on it <i>except me.</i>

116
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:19,851
- You're not a part of this.
- I could be.

117
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,858
I'm your assistant, after all.

118
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,452
I could, I don't know,
assist you or something.

119
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,592
- Hamilton.
- Hamilton?

120
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:33,695
I need to get some things done,
pay a quiet visit to Archduke Sebassis.

121
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,866
- I'd like to keep our liaison out of the loop.
- Out of the loop?

122
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,443
- That's where I live.
- Distract him. I don't care how.

123
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:41,445
Throw some punches at him,
some files.

124
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:43,515
Just keep him busy
for as long as you can.

125
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,484
What are you gonna do now?

126
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,678
One more thing
I don't want to.

127
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:51,616
You gotta be joking.

128
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:56,491
Why on God's green and verdant earth
would I trust you?

129
00:08:56,595 --> 00:08:59,120
Huh? Or you trust me?

130
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:01,131
'Cause it's not about us, Lindsey.

131
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:05,761
It's about <i>them.</i> The wolf,
the ram, the hart.

132
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:07,964
The ones we've been
fighting against forever.

133
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:09,631
You can't beat 'em.

134
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,676
Maybe they're not
there to be beat.

135
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:13,904
<i>Maybe they're there</i>
<i>to be fought.</i>

136
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:19,279
Maybe fighting <i>them</i> is what makes
human beings so remarkably strong.

137
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:24,479
You're not talking about
the kind of strength human beings have.

138
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:28,386
This is not about coveting
your neighbor's ass...

139
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:32,089
your buddy's job,
last Mallomar in the box.

140
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,724
You're talking about fighting flesh
and something that passes for blood demons...

141
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,361
with enormous power,
and they <i>will</i> mow you down.

142
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:41,666
Maybe.

143
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:46,677
But I keep thinking that once
this world was theirs, and now it's not.

144
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,371
Isn't it?

145
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,539
Give me the hell
on earth speech, Lindsey.

146
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:54,050
I know how bad things are,
how much sway the demons hold.

147
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:56,053
[Scoffs]

148
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:58,988
I happen to be the greatest
mass murderer you've ever met.

149
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:01,457
Never given you props
for that, have I?

150
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,188
There's always gonna be power,
and there's always gonna be corruption.

151
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:07,356
- So again, I ask...
- 'Cause it's not what I'm expected to do.

152
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,297
'Cause you're good in a fight.

153
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,461
And let's say we come up rollin' sevens
and this <i>does</i> go our way.

154
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,233
We tear up this firm,
someone's gonna have to step in.

155
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,240
And I know that's what you want.

156
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:20,869
I'm a lot more comfortable with the thought
of <i>you</i> in that position than anyone else.

157
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:24,574
- The devil you know.
- That'd be you.

158
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:29,177
- And if you roll snake eyes?
- Talk your way out of it.
Tell 'em I forced you to help me.

159
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:31,188
Tell 'em I made my scary face.

160
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,851
Believe it or not,
I was actually talking about you.

161
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,895
I mean, you care about
being squashed like a bug?

162
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:41,432
You haven't heard
a word I've said.

163
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:44,730
[Scoffs]
For, like, years back.

164
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:48,102
You get a little speechy,
all right? I breeze out.

165
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,334
I got the Cliff Notes.

166
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:55,243
Honor and humanity,
absolute good. I heard it.

167
00:10:57,216 --> 00:11:00,049
So here's the plot twist. I'm in.

168
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:03,384
Why?

169
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:07,050
Everybody goes on about your soul,
vampire with a soul.

170
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:12,961
Nobody ever mentions the fact that you're
really a vampire with big brass testes.

171
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:15,158
This is gonna be a circus!

172
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:18,168
I mean, win or lose, you're about
to pick the nastiest fight...

173
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,636
since mankind drop-kicked
the last demon out of this dimension.

174
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:25,676
And <i>that</i> you don't do without me.

175
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:28,871
If you want me,
I'm on your team.

176
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,745
I want you, Lindsey.

177
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,442
Thinkin' about
rephrasing that.

178
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:36,919
- Yeah, think I'd be more comfortable if you did.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:44,187
- How's she doin'?
- She needs more care than I can provide here.

180
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:46,787
I have to get
some supplies from home.

181
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,033
Watch over her for me.

182
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:52,569
Fat lot of good that's gonna do
if Hamilton makes another house call.

183
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,504
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>Hamilton did this?</i>

184
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:59,134
- You didn't know?
- He brought Drogyn.

185
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:04,307
To the circle, so you could kill him
to prove you'd gone over.

186
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:08,443
<i>Say, any other tips on how to be a hero we</i>
<i>could share with the boys and girls at home?</i>

187
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:10,784
I didn't have a choice.
They would have killed us both if...

188
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:14,120
We get it. We'd just like to know
if they're gonna need the rest of us as proof.

189
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:18,492
- Pick us off one by one, you know?
- No, they won't.

190
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:20,622
We're killing 'em all tonight.

191
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:29,769
I want you all to do something
for me, for yourselves.

192
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,706
Take the day off.

193
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,710
What?

194
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:36,440
If we're plannin' to assassinate the power
elite of the apocalypse tonight...

195
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,448
shouldn't we be cowboyin' up?

196
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,281
We'll be ready. But, today,
I want you guys to go out.

197
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,720
<i>Live.</i>
<i>Do whatever you want.</i>

198
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:49,555
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>Live the day like it's your last.</i>

199
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,720
<i>'Cause it probably is.</i>

200
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,730
[Humming]

201
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:26,024
<i>[Chattering]</i>

202
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:28,531
<i>[Cash Register Ringing]</i>

203
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:32,200
Hi.

204
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,209
[Exhales]

205
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:44,544
Mmm. Nice crowd.

206
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,380
It can get pretty ugly in here.
I gotta warn you.

207
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:49,386
What I'm after.

208
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:56,188
Couple more shots of courage
and I may make my presence felt.

209
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,821
- Your funeral.
- Well, I never had a proper one.

210
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,036
Charles!

211
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,936
Annie, how you doin'?

212
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,601
Oh, pretty good, I guess.

213
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,735
Got a bunch
of furniture donated.

214
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:15,574
Gotta move this stuff
to the new shelter.

215
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:17,649
- Still fightin' the good fight, huh?
- That's the drill.

216
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:21,947
- How are things uptown?
- Well, more fight, less good.

217
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:25,546
Seen Rondell or the guys? I hit
some of the old spots, didn't see anyone.

218
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,751
They should be around.
Said they'd help me haul this stuff.

219
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,760
You know how it is though.
Things come up.

220
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:34,127
- You got much vamp trouble these days?
- Never goes away for good.

221
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:36,393
The boys help out though.
We're pretty safe.

222
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,595
Gives me time to concentrate
on the little things.

223
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:43,801
Crack, runaways, abuse victims,
psychotics... the old gang.

224
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,469
- Yeah, I remember.
- It's not so bad.

225
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:49,945
We've had some really decent donations,
and it's helping.

226
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:53,415
We actually have a part-time
paid psychiatric staff.

227
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:58,348
What if I told you
it doesn't help?

228
00:14:58,457 --> 00:15:01,119
What would you do if you
found out that none of it matters?

229
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:06,129
<i>That it's all controlled by forces more powerful</i>
<i>and uncaring than we can conceive...</i>

230
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:08,825
and they will never let
it get better down here?

231
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:10,834
What would you do?

232
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,171
I'd get this truck packed
before the new stuff gets here.

233
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:19,104
- Want to give me a hand?
- I do.

234
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,538
<i>One, two, three.</i>

235
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,120
I don't understand.

236
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,850
It'll help you heal faster.

237
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,724
- If you really plan to join us in this fight...
<i>- I will fight.</i>

238
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:39,456
I've been broken
and humiliated.

239
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,795
I will return in kind
every blow, every sting.

240
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,563
<i>I will shred my adversaries...</i>

241
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,471
pull their eyes out just enough to turn them
towards their mewing, mutilated faces.

242
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,567
You're a very inspirational person.

243
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:56,078
Have I mentioned that?

244
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,777
You are what
I don't understand.

245
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:05,755
And that would
be different because?

246
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,895
Angel told you to do whatever
you wanted... today.

247
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,567
Tonight you may all be dead.

248
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:20,263
Yes. Good point.

249
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:22,567
I am not what you want.

250
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:27,941
No.

251
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:32,779
- Then why...
- Don't I go off and have one last perfect day?

252
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:37,719
Smell the flowers, or skydive, or
have a go with Mistress Spanksalot...

253
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:41,224
or whatever the hell one is supposed to do
in these situations?

254
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:44,591
- Mistress who?
- There is no perfect day for me, Illyria.

255
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:49,856
There is no sunset or painting
or finely aged scotch...

256
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,426
that's going to sum up my life
and make tonight any...

257
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:58,742
There is nothing that I want.

258
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:02,639
You want to be with Fred.

259
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:12,416
Yes. Yes, that's
where I'd be if I could.

260
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:17,291
I could assume her shape, make her
come alive again this once for you.

261
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:22,423
But you would
never ask me to.

262
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:31,567
The first lesson a Watcher learns
is to separate truth from illusion...

263
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,168
because in the world of magics,
it's the hardest thing to do.

264
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,943
The truth is that
Fred is gone.

265
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:46,089
To pretend anything else
would be a lie.

266
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:53,526
And since I don't actually intend
to die tonight, I won't accept a lie.

267
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,169
Is it better?

268
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,476
It's better.

269
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,376
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>My soul is wrapped in harsh repose.</i>

270
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:13,110
<i>Midnight descends</i>
<i>in raven-colored clothes.</i>

271
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:17,148
But, soft. Behold.

272
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:19,155
A sunlight beam...

273
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,384
cutting a swath
of glimmering gleam.

274
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:26,721
My heart expands.

275
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,366
'Tis grown a bulge in it.

276
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,940
Inspired by your beauty...

277
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,203
effulgent.

278
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:42,803
<i>- [Man] Yeah.!</i>
<i>- [Cheering]</i>

279
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:46,807
<i>- That was great, man.</i>
- Thank you.

280
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,909
That was for Cecily.

281
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,421
All right, this next one's called
"The Wanton Folly of Me Mum."

282
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:55,322
- So she's a werewolf.
- And an art student.

283
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:59,420
She does this great pottery.
She made me a vase.

284
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:01,931
But it's the wolf part
that joneses you.

285
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:05,833
There's some full-moon love,
am I right? Fur flying?

286
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,700
Huh?

287
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:10,570
So vampires <i>really</i> don't
understand the concept of jokes.

288
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:13,610
I understand jokes.

289
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:15,771
I was at the first taping
of the <i>Carol Burnett Show.</i>

290
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,781
Tim Conway was on fire.
It was special.

291
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:20,783
I know you're my father.

292
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:27,123
You got your memories back.

293
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:29,785
Yeah, they're mixed in there
with the new ones.

294
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:34,126
Kinda like a... bad dream
I had, I guess.

295
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:37,030
A very strange and violent...

296
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:41,367
at times inappropriately
erotic... dream.

297
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,600
You probably have
a lot of questions.

298
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:48,978
No. I don't want to
make a thing.

299
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:55,148
I get what you did,
you know.

300
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:57,619
And I'm grateful.

301
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:01,920
That's as far as
I want to take it, okay?

302
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:08,631
So, what are you workin' on?

303
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:11,861
I am, uh, applying for
an internship.

304
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,495
- I'm supposed to write up a résumé.
- Need any help?

305
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:18,167
Have you ever written
a résumé before? Ever?

306
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:20,176
No.

307
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:23,008
- But I have very nice handwriting.
- You girl.

308
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:32,352
- What are you thinkin' about?
- Angel.

309
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,185
You simply couldn't have said
a worse thing than that.

310
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:40,958
- No. You know what I mean.
- I do.

311
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:45,264
It's nice to know you're one of the few things
in my life he didn't get his mitts on.

312
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:50,501
- I don't believe Angel trusts you.
- It ain't about that, love.

313
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:54,271
It's about what he needs. And right now,
he needs every hand he can get.

314
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:58,042
<i>As long as I'm fightin'on his side,</i>
<i>he'll play me fair.</i>

315
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:02,347
Smoke clears, then we'll
see where we stand.

316
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:04,354
You sure you can handle
the Sahrvin?

317
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:07,516
They're sending me in with karaoke boy.
How tough can they be?

318
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,924
- With Lorne?
- What's up? Worried about his reading?

319
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:12,929
Said your future was
gonna be crappy?

320
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:16,990
- He was probably tellin' you that
just to mess with you.
- Yeah, probably.

321
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,864
If this thing does go down,
I want you to stay the hell away from it.

322
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,404
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

323
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:33,316
Damn. Girl, you gave up
immortality for me.

324
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:37,377
- It's like something out of a fairy tale.
- We don't live in a fairy tale.

325
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:46,521
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>This may come out a little pretentious...</i>

326
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:49,691

00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:53,368

328
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:55,701
Oh. Can I deny you
three times?

You've seen his place.

<i>- Yo.</i>

338
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,860
<i>Your friend, Senator Brucker,</i>

herself with vampires.

dusted <i>nearly</i> enough this year.

- No offense.
- It's all right.

343
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:38,707
- Spike...
- Right. First off, I'm not wearin' any amulets.

344
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,252
No bracelets, brooches,
beads, pendants, pins or rings.

345
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:45,049
Fine. All you need is a rattle.

346
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:48,455
- Ah, the baby.
- And the legion of the Fell Brethren.

00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:55,756
Archduke Sebassis has over
40,000 demons at his command.

<i>- Oh, I'm not a fighter, Angelwings.</i>

353
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:10,147
Never had the stomach for it.
Looks like I'm your weak link.

354
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:11,909
I need you to back up Lindsey.

- He's part of this.

356

It'll be just as dangerous for him as it
will be for everyone else on our team.

00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:29,833
Mmm.

00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:51,278
So I guess we're not goin'

So be ready.

00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:05,334
Hey, uh, Ange...

367
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:10,169
I'll do this last thing for you,
for us, but then I'm out.

368
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:12,675
And you won't find me
in the alley afterwards.

369
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:15,337
Hell, you won't
find me at all.

370

Don't try.

372
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,050
Try not to die.
You are not unpleasant to my eyes.

373
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:32,221
Uh, thanks. You...
try not to die too.

374
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,999
Later, then.

375
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,244
What do you think all this means
for that Shanshu bugaboo?

376
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:54,682
We make it through this,
does one of us get to be a real boy?

377
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:59,120
Who you kidding?
We're not gonna make it through.

378
00:24:59,223 --> 00:25:01,521
Well, long as it's not you.

379

I'm curious.
[Slurps] Mmm.

380
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:15,298
What makes you think
I won't kill you where you sit?

381
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:17,567
Because you're smarter
than the others.

382
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:21,107
<i>Smart enough to have</i>
<i>your doubts about Angel...</i>

383

and rightly so.

384
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:28,311
He's... unpredictable.

385
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:31,411

You make a very persuasive argument.

00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:24,592
- Kinda like the feeling.
- Yeah, today.

496
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:28,187
- You really done with 'em?
- [Exhales]

497
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,362
It isn't my kind of work anymore.
It's unsavory.

498
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,563
Gee, I think it's
just getting interesting.

499
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:38,608
Yeah, I bet you do.

500
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:42,736
You don't trust me.
You don't think a man can change?

501
00:33:44,215 --> 00:33:47,810
It's not about what <i>I</i> think.
This was Angel's plan.

502
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:50,284
Come on.

503
00:33:52,223 --> 00:33:54,623
- I could sing for you.
- I've heard you sing.

[Grunts, Breathing Heavily]

505
00:33:58,195 --> 00:34:02,393
Why... Why'd you...

506
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,797
One last job.

507
00:34:05,936 --> 00:34:08,632
You're not part of
the solution, Lindsey.

508
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,573
You never will be.

509
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,075

<i>Did you really think you</i>
<i>had a shot at this?</i>

518
00:34:55,653 --> 00:34:59,350
I can bend the very fabric
of reality to my will.

519
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:04,450
Your parlor tricks could
never kill <i>me,</i> boy. [Laughing]

520
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:09,863
[Struggling] Then I'll just have to do
this the old-fashioned way.

521
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:16,305
Yes, I suppose we will.

- Wesley.

This wound is mortal.

Aren't we all?
[Gasping]

529
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:02,445
It was good
that you came.

530
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:07,856
I killed all mine. And I was...

531
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:12,051
Concerned?

532
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:15,364
I think so.

533
00:36:19,203 --> 00:36:21,103
But I can't help.

534
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:26,475
You'll be dead
within moments.

535
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:28,204
I know.

536
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,285
Would you like me
to lie to you now?

537
00:36:38,522 --> 00:36:43,482
Yes. Thank you, yes.

Hello, there.

Oh, Wesley.

I've missed you.

It's gonna be okay.

00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:30,501
It won't hurt
much longer...

545
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:34,168
and then you'll be
where I am.

546

[Crying]
We'll be together.

547

My love.

[Sobbing]
Oh, my love.

551
00:38:14,017 --> 00:38:18,454
How very touching
his meaningless death was.

552
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:22,321
But this fight
was never for mortals.

Connor!

559
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,717
Let me say this as clearly as I can.
You can not beat me.

560
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:58,227
I am a part of them,
the wolf, ram, and hart.

<i>Their strength flows</i>
<i>through my veins.</i>

My blood is filled
with their ancient power.

00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:15,204
Can you pick out the one word there
you probably shouldn't have said?

Wow! You <i>really</i>
are full of it.

What was that you were
saying about ancient power?

567
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:42,938
You don't really think
you're gonna win this, do you?

568

You don't stand a chance.
We are legion. We are <i>forever.</i>

Ah! Is he dead?

574
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:18,738
Yeah, he's dead.

Uh... that's not good, is it?

00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,774
Wolfram and Hart. Looks like
they're taking the gloves off.

- You go home.

As long as you're okay, they can't.

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,900
Go.

What the hell
is going on?

00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,387
We're gettin' kicked out
of the garden, Eve.

Where's Lindsey?
Where is he?

Supposed to wear that red stuff
on the inside, Charlie boy.

596
00:42:01,912 --> 00:42:03,812
Any word on Wes?

- And in terms of a plan?
- We fight.

610

Bit more specific?

611
00:42:49,993 --> 00:42:53,793

want to slay the dragon.
