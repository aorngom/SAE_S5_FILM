00:33:26,495 --> 00:33:29,521
<i>When the song is playing,</i>
<i>it acts as a sort of cloaking spell...</i>

478
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:34,432
allowing Framkin to address his target
without being seen by the rest of his viewers.

479
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:38,438
- So that's how he's been hiding it.
- That's how he <i>was</i> hiding it.

480
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,972
[Grunting]
Stupid fingers.

481
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:50,045
Stupid string.
[Grunts]

482
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:54,646
It's all in the broadcast. Some very
nuanced magic, but we found it... finally.

483
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:57,885
- Angel, what happened?
- Uh, nothing.

484
00:33:57,993 --> 00:34:01,292
It's not important.
Just doesn't matter.

485
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:05,493
- Go on.
- It's a hidden carrier wave masked by a spell...

486
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:09,230
that turns the TV into a two-way conduit
with direct access to the viewer.

487
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,397
<i>[Wesley] That's how he's been</i>
<i>draining energy from the children.</i>

488
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,101
And judging from the strength
of yesterday's signal...

489
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:18,339
- Framkin's ready to take out the whole audience.
<i>- The object you described...</i>

490
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:22,315
in that secret room is most likely
a repository for the children's life force.

491
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,443
We'll have to
break the binding magic on it.

492
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:29,354
Which should free those children
and reverse your puppet problem.

493
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:32,325
[Joyous Gasping]
I love you guys.

495
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,659
Oh. [Clears Throat]
We'd better get moving.

496
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:44,467
Framkin knows we're onto him. If he's ready
to zap his audience, he'll pull the trigger today.

497
00:34:44,573 --> 00:34:46,700
- Not him. Them.
- Gunn?

498
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:49,573
<i>Framkin's not doin'this.</i>
<i>It's the puppets. They're demons.</i>

499
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:53,136
The show is possessed<i>. Smile Time's</i> ratings
hit an all-time low last year.

500
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:55,944
Framkin made a deal with some devils
to bring it back to number one.

501
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:58,315
- You sure of that?
- Dead sure. Every contract signed...

502
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,651
with the lower planes is filed
in the Library of Demonic Congress.

503
00:35:01,757 --> 00:35:05,386
You just gotta know where to look.
Pretty tricky legalese too.

504
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:07,462
Framkin must have missed some
of the fine print.

505
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:11,795
- Which allowed them to take over everything.
<i>- Including Framkin.</i>

506
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,959
These particular devils
have a fairly distinctive M.O.

507
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:18,233
- They've done this before?
- You seen the last few seasons of <i>Happy Days?</i>

508
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,901
Point is, you wanna take out <i>Smile Time,</i>
