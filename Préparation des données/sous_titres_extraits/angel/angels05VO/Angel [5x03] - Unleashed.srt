<i>[Gunn] Yeah, man.</i>
<i>Why haven't we done this before?</i>

5
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:17,404
[Angel] Oh, you know,
you've all been working so hard.

6
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:19,976

- [Device Whirring]

7
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:23,945
We're clean. Nobody's listening.

8
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:27,484
- You were late.
- I thought I was being followed.

9
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:29,815
<i>[Gunn] I get that we have to be careful,</i>
<i>but it feels weird...</i>

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,820
hiding from the company
we're supposed to be running.

11
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:33,822
<i>We're not hiding.</i>
<i>We're being safe.</i>

12
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:36,085
There are factions at Wolfram and Hart,
people who want to see us destroyed.

13
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:41,096
But still, it's not like everyone there is evil.
I mean, we work with these people.

14
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:44,133
Some of them I see more than
I see you guys, at least lately anyway.

17
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:54,802

so much time with lately.

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,075

All I'm saying is he's not evil.

23
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:15,759

26
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:27,105

a lot of time for, you know, covert ops.

29
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:38,548
- What about Gunn?
- It's, well...

30
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:43,650
what they put in your head and all that
law knowledge and whatever.

31
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:48,420
Maybe you know something
more than the rest of us.

32
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:52,161
- The alteration to your mental capacity...
- My capacity's the same.

33
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:55,830
The good doctor just revved up some idling
brain cells, set 'em in motion.

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,408
<i>It's a legitimate concern.</i>
<i>You gave them access to...</i>

35
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:02,878
I made a deal. We all did. Seems like I'm
the only one who's willing to accept that.

36
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,211
Everybody here got something
out of this.

37
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:08,717
Fear, mistrust, a great motor pool.

38
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,720
I got the Nancy Sinatra
collection. Original 45s.

39
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:15,280
I did get a rather nice pen.

40
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:21,092
Sterling. Has my name on it,
which is not the point at all.

41
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:23,393
No, the point is what?
That I'm some spy for the senior partners?

42
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,867
- Nobody's saying that.
- Just thinking it.

43
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,600
- No. Charles...
<i>- The point is that the senior</i>
<i>partners have a plan for us.</i>

44
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,166
- And if we're not prepared...
- Angel, it's not like we don't wanna be ready.

45
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:39,341
We just have, you know, plates.
Big, heaping full plates.

Between running our departments,
handling clients, dealing with Spike...

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,881
Spike is a distraction. As soon as he's released
from his ties from Wolfram and Hart...

48
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:50,119
- That could take years.
- Using the amulet to destroy the Hellmouth...

49
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:53,788
- it turned Spike into...
- A spook?

50
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:56,389
Well, he's more than a ghost.

She was bitten.
I smelled her blood on him.

61

Tonight's the second night of the full moon...
two more nights for her to go all dog-girl.

- She won't. We'll find her.

McManus did. The guy you...

Killed.

66
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:22,438
I pulled his credit card records,
cross-checked them with police reports.

He left his wife and kids

68

Kept moving, staying in the middle
of nowhere most of the time.

69

First year or so, a few mangled bodies
showed up here and there.

70

But the last six months,
guy was leaving corpses like bread crumbs.

71
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:36,622
Probably tried to control 'em
for a while, then just gave up.

72
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:40,185

with nothing worth fighting for.

She's got us.

79
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:13,262
Spike, I'm sorry, but I'm kind of busy
right now with the situation.

80
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:17,766
Hey. I'm a situation, remember?
I'm a bloody phantom.

81
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:21,326

gonna help me with my bloody little problem.

82
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:25,966

What?

97
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,118
It was a long time ago.

98
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:20,287
He was a young Watcher, fresh out of
the academy, when we crossed paths.

99
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,399
It was a, what you call, battle of wills.

100
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:32,408

knowing about my condition, right?

priority, like finding and helping this girl.

tell me? All these resources...

00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:45,988
Are you okay?

161
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:51,793
I'm fine. I'm fine.

162
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:55,201
Those fine lines?
Bad for the car, good for us.

163
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:57,933
Apparently, they mean
old tires, at least five years.

164
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,010
Thank you. Nice sketch. Somebody saw
your girl last night. East Hollywood.

165
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,579
All right, so we're looking for
a midsize sedan, at least five years old...

166
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,046
- somewhere in the Hollywood area.
- Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

167
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,140
And the moon's arisin',

170

I mean, red light,
green light, same diff.

171
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,328
- Traffic cameras. We networked?
- Yep.

172
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:25,560
I'm looking at the cameras.
You get set to run with it if I find a match.

173
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:30,129
Course, I might leak the info to
the senior partners, 'cause we're tight.

174
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,038
- Just do it.
- Is the van ready?

175
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:38,012
- Yep, I triple-checked.
<i>- Good. 'Cause we got less than an hour.</i>

176
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:43,610
Lot of fuss over one girl. Other things to do
around here. Important things.

177
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,486
You know that "whoosh" thing that you do
when you're suddenly not there anymore?

178
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:51,391
- I love that.

Get off me! Let go of me!

supposed to be looking...

- Remember?
- Two nights ago.

217
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:19,255
You were attacked in the woods.
You were jogging.

218
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:24,664
Jogging. Wait, yeah.
I remember that l...

219
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,772
That... thing attacked me.

220
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:36,812
Not exactly.

221
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:42,916
<i>I was in the area. I heard screams, but</i>
<i>by the time I got there...</i>

222
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,921
That was you. Yeah. I remember.
You-You saved me.

223
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,423
I was too late.

224
00:18:06,943 --> 00:18:10,003
Oh, my God.

225
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:12,377
It was a werewolf, Nina...

226
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,551
and you were bitten.

227
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:22,388
No. This is insane.

228
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:26,952
The bite already started a process.
You may have already started to feel the effects.

229
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:31,022
Distorted vision. Heightened senses.

230
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:35,434
Blood. Jill, my sister,
she was cooking meat.

231
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:40,840
<i>Oh, my God. L-I smelled</i>
<i>the blood. It was making me...</i>

232
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:44,705
Oh, God. Amanda. My niece.

233
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:47,009
- She's okay and so is your sister.
- No, you don't get it.

234
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:49,016
- Nina, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

235
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:51,416
<i>- You didn't...</i>
- I wanted to rip her throat out.

236
00:18:56,993 --> 00:19:00,019
It wasn't you.
It was that thing inside.

237
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:02,927
- Oh, like there's a difference?
<i>- There is. A big one.</i>

238
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:05,830
<i>- I know this is a lot...</i>
- Don't tell me what you know.

239
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:10,065
You didn't wake up
and find out you're a... monster.

240
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:13,472
You don't <i>know</i> anything.

241
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:16,545
L-I'm not a werewolf... like you.

242
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:19,615
But-But, I know what it's like.

243
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:24,378
I'm a monster too.

244
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:29,716
So, what, you're like a Frankenstein?

245
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:32,351
What? No.

246
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,629
Um, I'm-I'm a vampire.

247
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:43,195
- Vampire.
- But I have a soul.

248
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,069
I'm not evil, and neither are you.

249
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:48,041
- But vampires kill people and they...
<i>- Can control themselves...</i>

250
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:50,442
if they want to.

251
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:53,209
I do it every day and so can you.

252
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,956
I'll help.

253
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:05,994
Can you... cure me?

254
00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:11,089
No. But I can keep you safe.

255
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:18,039
How is she doing?

256
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:21,440
Oh, agreed to stay in the holding cell tonight,
but she's pretty scared.

257
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:24,172
So, what do we do now?

258
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,579
<i>[Spike] We wait for the show.</i>
<i>Should be a good one.</i>

259
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,780
Everyone on pins and needles, dreading
the moonrise. Then pop goes the werewolf.

260
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:35,346
I can't stop what's gonna happen,
but I can keep her from getting hurt.

261
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,086
These first few transformations
are the worst.

262
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:41,288
The werewolf s strength combined with...

263
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:44,195
the disorientation and fear.

264
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,268
You mean she could hurt herself?

265
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,930
Oh, I've seen them bang their heads
against walls, claw at their own skin.

266
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,234
We'll just have to tranq her,
let her sleep through it.

267
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:56,642
Well, that could work for tonight,
but over the long haul, a bad idea.

268
00:20:56,746 --> 00:20:59,374
Well, there has to be something.

269
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:01,950
They like familiar scents, images.

270
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:05,987
Maybe if you took her home let her get a
few things, uh, could have a calming effect.

271
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,956
Fetching a blankie's not going to
make a bloody bit of difference.

272
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:12,687
- Spike, really not helping.
- I'm just saying... the girl's a killer.

273
00:21:12,795 --> 00:21:16,492
Maybe not tonight, or tomorrow,
but she will get out of that cage.

274
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:19,568
- Not if she doesn't want to.
- Oh, she'll want to.

275
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,160
- It's unfortunate, but...
<i>- And when it's not that time of month?</i>

276
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:25,297
She'll be wracked by the guilties.
What with a soul and all.

277
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:29,469
- Didn't seem to bother you.
- Oh, it's been nothing but a pain in my...

278
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,878
Finally. I'll take Nina by her house.

279
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:36,611
Angel, it's the middle of the day,
unless you plan on waiting in the car.

280
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:39,654
Take security, in case
she changes her mind.

281
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:51,493
So, the entourage. All this for me?

282
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:56,561
Um, no... Well, yeah, kind of.

283
00:21:56,673 --> 00:21:59,471
I mean, it's just in case you, you know.

284
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:02,373
- Run away?
- It's-It's not like you're a prisoner.

285
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:06,005
You're totally not.
It's just... [Exhales]

286
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,515
Really important that
you stay with us tonight.

287
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:14,523
This is just so... [Scoffs]

288
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:19,220
I should be in ceramics class right now.
We're learning raku.

289
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:23,791
Seems like somebody else's life.

290
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,701
Nina, it's just three nights a month,
not even days.

291
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,968
Your life doesn't have to change... much.

292
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:34,976
How would you... You're not
a monster too, are you?

293
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:38,536
Nope. Standard issue science nerd.

294
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,948
I did spend five years in a
demon dimension... till Angel saved me.

295
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,122
I guess he saves a lot of girls, huh?

296
00:22:47,223 --> 00:22:51,023
Girls, guys, puppies.

297
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,994
He's pretty much
an equal opportunity saver.

298
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:57,396
So you two are, like, a couple?

299
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,593
Me and Angel?

300
00:22:59,702 --> 00:23:02,569
<i>Oh, God, no. He...</i>

301
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:06,267
He was seeing someone, sort of.

302
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:11,506
<i>But, she... Angel doesn't date much...</i>

303
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:15,015
at all... 'cause of his circumstances.

304
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:18,246
- 'Cause he's a vampire.
- Kind of.

305
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:23,792
That doesn't mean that...
His situation's just complicated.

306
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:27,656
Must be lonely.

307
00:23:27,764 --> 00:23:31,222
Sometimes, maybe.

308
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:35,168
But, it's not like
he doesn't have anyone.

309
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:37,136
<i>We all...</i>

310
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,437
We try to be there for each other.

311
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:43,842
- Like a family.
- Yeah.

312
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:47,006
A demon-hunting, helpless-helping...

313
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:50,608
dysfunctional family.

314
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:57,184
<i>You sign this, we're all set to turn</i>
<i>McManus's body over to his family.</i>

315
00:23:59,228 --> 00:24:01,662
They made arrangements to
transport his body back to...

316
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:05,222
- [Sighs]
- The North Pole.

317
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:08,167
Turns out he had a close,
personal relationship with Santa.

318
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:12,073
Angel?

319
00:24:14,443 --> 00:24:16,911
What? Oh, I'm with you.

320
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:20,039
Turning over the... Santa?

321
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:23,778
Angel, you saved that girl's life.

322
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:26,514
- If you hadn't gotten there when you did...
- Werewolf would've killed her.

323
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:30,718
I know. Doesn't change what
she's gonna have to go through.

324
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:34,923
Well, that part sucks, no doubt,
but you did everything you could.

325
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:39,798
You know what, Gunn? Don't need
a pep talk right now. Just do your job.

326
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:47,399
Right. I'll just go do that
someplace else.

327
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:55,848
<i>Whoa, watch it there. Just passin'by and got</i>
<i>splashed with a heap of grouchy.</i>

328
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:59,854
Gotta tell ya, Angelkins, that extra weight
is not looking so good on you.

329
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,424
I'm talking about psychic pounds, pumpkin.

330
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:05,619
Why don't you consider me
theJenny Craig for the soul, huh?

331
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:10,022
- So let's hear it.
- I'm not gonna sing.

332
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:14,535
Couldn't bear it if you did. No, it's talking
you need. Or maybe a shoulder...

333
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:17,765
- I'm not gonna cry either.
- I was going to a leaning place.

334
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:21,332
<i>Okay, Atlas, how about a shrug?</i>

335
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:24,743
Look, so you've got
the weight of the world. [Chuckles]

336
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:26,940
A burden sure, but breaking news it ain't.

337
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:30,644
- Listen, Lorne, this isn't a good time.
- No. No, it never is.

338
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:33,483
Spike showing up your first day in
the Wolfram and Hart saddle?

339
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:35,750
Took the jolly
right out of the rancher.

340
00:25:35,858 --> 00:25:38,383
We've been feeling it
ever since then, Angelcakes.

341
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:41,588
Okay, so it's no secret.
I don't like the guy.

342
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:43,961
Like him, don't like him.
That's up to you.

343
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:47,263
<i>You're fighting so many enemies around you,</i>
<i>Angel, your punches are getting sloppy.</i>

344
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,601
And we've got
the bruises to prove it.

345
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:53,004
<i>We're operating in</i>
<i>unfriendly territory, champ.</i>

346
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:57,409
I don't want you to forget about
the people covering your back.

347
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,753
I changed my mind.

348
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,659
I could go in first, explain...

349
00:26:14,764 --> 00:26:17,562
- No, let's just...
- Hey. I know you're scared...

350
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:21,194
- but running away's not gonna help.
- [Sighs]

351
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:24,865
What about fleeing? Can I flee?

352
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:28,432
Maybe they're not even here.

353
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:31,342
<i>What the hell happened to you?</i>

354
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:34,143
I've been worried... Who are you?

355
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,687
- I'm Fred. It's nice...
- I come home, and you're just gone.

356
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:41,018
- Amanda was terrified.
- Jill, I'm sorry.

357
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:45,219
Who leaves the house without their purse or
keys? What'd you do, jump out the window?

358
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:48,627
- I thought Amanda heard me say I was leaving.
- Oh, that's great.

359
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:51,791
- Blame it on a nine-year-old.
- It's my fault.

360
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,166
I called Nina, like, totally suicidal 'cause
this guy in our ceramics class dumped me.

361
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:58,468
A-And then my car got towed and she wanted
to call, but my cell phone battery...

362
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:02,510
Do you mind, whoever you are?
This has nothing to do with you.

363
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:05,375
- Leave her alone.
- Oh, like you left Mandy alone?

364
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:08,507
<i>In the house? At night? Do you know</i>
<i>she didn't want to go to school today?</i>

365
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:12,018
- I had to lie. Tell her I'd heard from you.
- Shut up. Just shut up.

366
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:15,887
I called the police. I thought...

367
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:20,019
You sleep all day. You've got bruises
you don't remember getting.

368
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:24,259
Just tell me. What's going on?

369
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:29,263
I'm sorry about last night...

370
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:32,569
but you can't count on me
all the time.

371
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:34,768
Since when?

372
00:27:34,877 --> 00:27:38,677
Just... find another babysitter.

373
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:47,682
I'll just... if that's okay.

374
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,523
And, maybe. She's, uh, she'll be okay.

375
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:58,192
So she was yelling
and furious, but that's good.

376
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,598
It means, you know, she cares.

377
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:02,830
- If something happened to Amanda...
- But it didn't...

378
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:04,906
- and it's not going to.
- You don't know that.

379
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:07,635
Angel... That's weird.

380
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,150
And really not good. Run!

396
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,428
Almost military.

397
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:09,930
An underground, monster-hunting
military organization.

- It's happened before.
- It's all my fault.

- Anything happens to Nina, it's on me.

approach the mysteriously ajar door?"

Get enough of that from Blondie Bear.

But it's been hours. Angel...

00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:40,721
- What do you got?
- Usual suspects.

405
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:44,925
There's the sacrificers. Wackos who wanna
rid the world of abominations.

406
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:47,127
<i>And werewolf packs</i>

Damn. Like he can't hear me.
Just whoot! Right through the...

- Were you looking for me?
- Oh, is this your office?

416
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:34,579
I'm so sorry. I was following Spike...

417
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:36,981
and l-I kind of made a mess.

418
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:40,351
He just went right through the wall.
It's so annoying when he does that...

419
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:43,789
'cause there's nothing
you can do to...

420
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:45,450
stop him.

421
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,130
You're right. It's calendula. He must've
known we'd have him sing for Lorne.

422
00:31:52,234 --> 00:31:54,862
So he came prepared
to block the reading.

423
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,768
It's like taking a Valium
to pass a polygraph test.

424
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:00,501
I knew as soon as I saw
the vial in the trash can.

How'd you end up going through
Royce's trash anyway?

It was, well, Spike.

00:32:06,015 --> 00:32:09,143
- He led me in here.
- Yo, here we go.

428
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:11,515
We got ourselves a secret panel.

- Where is she?
- I don't know what you're...

430

<i>You're a good guy.</i>

We'll just, yeah, burning.
Burning would be good for these.

436
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:36,844
Not exactly an autopsy knife.

Oh, God.

Shortly thereafter...

00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:39,469
dinner will be served.

00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:48,149
<i>When I dined on werewolf in Seville...</i>

450
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:53,483
<i>the</i> cocinera <i>used an understated mole</i>
<i>sauce to bring out the meat's tanginess.</i>

I've never forgotten
that exquisite burst of taste.

452
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,295
But Chef Renault swears
serving it <i>anaise...</i>

453
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:04,765
with a light drizzle of white truffle oil
will be quietly surprising.

- If I were you, I'd just be hoping the girl's alive.

457
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,947
She has to be, at least through dinner. Once
a werewolf dies, it reverts to its human state.

458
00:34:29,057 --> 00:34:32,493
You mean, to eat werewolf

Listen to me.
Tomorrow you're gonna be home.

- It's a risk. What can I say?

Mr. Crane, please.
Oh, no. No, please.

482
00:36:21,403 --> 00:36:24,372
<i>Don't do this to me,</i>
<i>Mr. Crane. I'm sorry.</i>

483
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,931
[Whimpering]
Mr. Crane, I'm sorry.

484
00:36:28,043 --> 00:36:30,944
<i>No. Oh.! Oh.!</i>

485
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:34,709
Mr. Crane, I'm begging you. No.

486
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:53,591
[Gasps]

487
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:56,933
[Exhales]
Spike.

488
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:04,572
I've been looking for you.

489
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:13,385
You were there again.

490
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:17,117
Where you go when you're not...

491
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:19,693
here.

492
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:25,025
There.

493
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,363
Nowhere.

494
00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:33,833
[Forced Chuckle]
I didn't think I was coming back.

495
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:39,503
But you did... mostly.

496
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,849
And you led me to
Dr. Royce's office, which was...

497
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,957
completely not on purpose, was it?

498
00:37:52,794 --> 00:37:57,322
But, still, you're here.

499
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:04,631
Last gasp before eternal fire
and brimstone. Let's party.

500
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,867
We have to tell Angel.

501
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:08,738
- No.
<i>- But he could do something.</i>

502
00:38:08,844 --> 00:38:12,371
- Talk to the senior partners.
- I said no.

503
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:16,781
Okay, then I'm going to help you.
Well, I don't know exactly...

504
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:19,149
but I am going to
find a way to bring you back.

505
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:23,884
<i>Really bring you back. I promise.</i>

506
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,353
Well, all right, then.

507
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:30,865
No need to get dramatic.

508
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:48,281
[Singing]

509
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:52,218
This is it.

510
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,087
She's a really good artist.

511
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:59,627
Oh, our refrigerator's always available
if she's looking to show.

512
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:05,462
How do you live with it?

513
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:09,560
Knowing that you've killed people?

514
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:12,572
Nina, they were going to
eat you for dinner.

515
00:39:14,943 --> 00:39:18,401
I just wanna wake up, you know?

516
00:39:18,513 --> 00:39:21,641
<i>At some point, you'll be</i>
<i>at the grocery store or with Amanda...</i>

517
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:27,052
and, the whole werewolf thing,
it'll just be a part of who you are.

518
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:31,785
Next you're gonna tell me
you actually like being a vampire.

519
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:36,627
Well, being nearly indestructible's cool.

520
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,962
I can't tell them.

521
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,300
<i>Maybe, maybe not.</i>

522
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:47,034
That part's not covered in the manual.

523
00:39:49,578 --> 00:39:51,910
They're waiting for you.

524
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:57,907
You don't ever think about letting go?

525
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:00,453
Disappearing somewhere?

526
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:07,022
Look, if you separate yourself from the ones
you love, the monster wins.

527
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:10,929
- You make it sound simple.
- It's not.

528
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:16,437
See you next month.

529
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:23,973
<i>[Car Door Closes]</i>

530
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:33,950
<i>[Pop]</i>

531
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:48,265
[Engine Starts]

532
00:40:53,608 --> 00:40:56,577
<i>[Lorne]</i>
<i>Mmm. Talk about a room with a view.</i>

533
00:40:56,678 --> 00:40:59,476
<i>- [Fred] Wow, is that the hotel?</i>
<i>- [Wesley] Where?</i>

534
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:03,039
- No, I think that's the Center for Scientology.
- Oh. Right.

535
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:05,278
They look, um,
nothing alike at all.

536
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:08,015
I was starting to think we were never
gonna see the inside of this place.

537
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:10,250
I'm sorry. I probably should've
had you guys over sooner...

538
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:12,656
but I'm trying to get
used to the place myself.

539
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,559
Look at this.

540
00:41:15,664 --> 00:41:18,792
I'm home.
Hey, Cosmos all around?

541
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,528
<i>- [Fred] Sounds good.</i>
- Quite luxurious.

542
00:41:21,636 --> 00:41:23,194
It's not bad.

543
00:41:23,305 --> 00:41:26,274
- Don't mean to talk shop,
but Crane's Bistro of the Bizarre?
<i>- Out ofbusiness.</i>

544
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:28,842
- Permanently.
- What if I have a craving for Sasquatch soup?

545
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,071
Is that something you English eat
with your beans on toast?

546
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:35,138
Mmm, you guys are making me hungry.
Who wants Chinese?

547
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,718
As long as nothing
comes tartare, I'm in.

548
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:42,279
- No, I'm too tired to make any decisions.
- Just order the usual, Fredikins.

549
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,952
- I'm buying.
- Ladies and gentlemen, hell just froze over.

550
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:49,428
So, werewolf girl.
Think you got a shot?

551
00:41:49,531 --> 00:41:52,364
- She gave me a look.
<i>- [Wesley] Really?</i>

552
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:55,368
A look?

553
00:41:56,872 --> 00:41:59,841
<i>We moved, actually, to a law firm.</i>

554
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:03,900
Uh-huh. Different. No. Nice.

555
00:42:04,012 --> 00:42:08,574
Okay. Um, one mu shu chicken.
Two beef and broccolis.

556
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:13,643
<i>One cashew shrimp.</i>
<i>Um, maybe some lettuce wraps.</i>

557
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:48,354
Grr! Arrgh!
