1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,051
Previously on The O.C.:

2
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,618
You're leaving me for a guy named George ? No.

3
00:00:02,684 --> 00:00:04,618
I'm Paul. I'm here for George. George ?


4
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:06,718
The Global Environmental Organization

5
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:07,950
Regarding Greenhouse Emissions.

6
00:00:08,317 --> 00:00:10,184
This guy came by from GEORGE to recruit me.

7
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:10,684
You have to choose

8
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,384
between me and GEORGE.

9
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:14,818
You haven't... giving me the green
light on that marriage proposal.

10
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:15,850
I love you.

11
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:17,151
The real you.

12
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,884
Julie's had enough of the old Bullit head.

13
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:20,418
We can still play Ping-Pong.

14
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:28,284
Oh, my God.

15
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,317
Eggs... And flour.

16
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:36,284
There we go.

17
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,317
Milk.

18
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:41,784
Okay, now, Ryan, fire up the griddle.

19
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,484
And Sandy, beat until smooth. Sandy

20
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:46,484
Hey, Mama, have a seat.

21
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:47,717
In the mood for cr.es ?

22
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:49,150
Yeah !
You're making cr.es ?

23
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,150
Taylor sent Kaitlin a griddle from France.

24
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,484
With a super-long note

25
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:54,818
about how I need to broaden
my breakfast horizons.

26
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:56,350
She's 6,000 miles away and still annoying.

27
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:58,284
Ryan, have you talked to her ? Oh, no.

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,250
Haven't read her blog,

29
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:00,651
haven't looked at her scrapbook.

30
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:02,017
It's over and I'm okay.

31
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,717
It's been months. I barely
even think about her.

32
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:04,983
Even though you're living in her room.

33
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,050
You know, we've all had to make

34
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,050
adjustments since the earthquake.

35
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:08,417
Especially Kaitlin,

36
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:11,017
with the entire Cohen family
taking refuge here.

37
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,150
No, it's been nice.

38
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:13,517
I mean, I've perfected my Sandy Cohen.

39
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:14,517
Listen to this.

40
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:16,184
I'll schmear it for ya.

41
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,417
Well, you know, not bad.

42
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,184
I am very sexy.

43
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,851
Baby, stop mimicking Sandy.

44
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,684
Julie ! Cr.e ?

45
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,584
I think I'm too nauseous to eat.

46
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:28,651
Morning sickness.

47
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:30,517
Or wedding jitters. Who can tell ?

48
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:32,184
Well, your fiance is certainly
excited about the nuptials.

49
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,651
Yeah, he's kind of become

50
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:36,717
a broken record over and over
again. He keeps saying...

51
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:38,317
Bang !

52
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:40,284
Hey, Sandy. Bullit.


53
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,551
Ryan. Peanut.

54
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:42,983
Hey, Blondie.

55
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,050
And there she is,

56
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:46,050
the future Mrs. Gordon Bullit.

57
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,884
Well, wedding days

58
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,717
can be nerve-wracking, but just think,

59
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:52,284
after tomorrow you will be
just another old married couple.

60
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,417
Just like that one living upstairs.

61
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,417
Hey, breakfast time.

62
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,751
Toaster strudel !

63
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:03,350
Oh, you're the best cook ever.

64
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:06,484
Shh, enough talking,
what do you want to watch ?

65
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,983
Oh, I think you know what I want to watch.

66
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,484
Ladies and gentlemen, Briefcase or
No Briefcase ? Briefcase or No Briefcase ?

67
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,717
The premise is so simple.

68
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:15,784
Yet so compelling.

69
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:18,083
Can I come in ? Hey, sure.

70
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,983
I know you don't like to leave your lair,

71
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,484
but the inspector is coming 
to the house today.

72
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,983
I think everybody should be there.
But this chair is my home now.

73
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,950
Downstairs in ten minutes.

74
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,250
Boy, his body language is very negative.

75
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:34,317
You think ?

76
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:35,350
Wait, he just smiled.

77
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,083
I think it was more of a smirk.

78
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,484
Everyone keep your fingers crossed.

79
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:40,317
So what's the good news ? When can we rebuild ?

80
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:43,517
I hate to say this, but how about never ?

81
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,950
Excuse me ?

82
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:46,584
The amount of structural
damage is substantial.

83
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:48,417
But Dad, we can pay to fix it, right ?

84
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:50,184
Yeah, we've got insurance, savings.

85
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,851
Well, the cost of repairing the damage

86
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,517
is more than the value of this house.

87
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,784
I'm sorry, but there's no saving your home.

88
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:41,901
Nice view, infinity pool...

89
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,534
Yeah, but no pool house.

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,667
Yes, well, six bedrooms.

91
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:46,333
I think there's room enough for everyone.

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,700
Yeah, but it still just
doesn't feel like home.

93
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:50,734
You know, maybe I'm not ready
to leave the old place yet.

94
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:52,067
I'm going to miss it.

95
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:53,734
Doesn't mean I'm not looking
forward to Berkeley.

96
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,567
Oh, Berkeley.

97
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:56,734
Now, there was a house.

98
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,567
The minute we walked in the front door,

99
00:03:58,634 --> 00:03:59,734
we knew we were home.

100
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:01,034
Wood floors, exposed beams,

101
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:02,700
that house had character.

102
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,634
And this house has none of those things.

103
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,534
Well, it's got a Viking range,
granite countertops...

104
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,001
It's average and generic.

105
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:10,600
I couldn't agree with you more.
Let's get out of here.

106
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,667
I think we should make an offer. You do ?

107
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:15,400
You do ? Well, we've seen five
versions of the same house.

108
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,101
Does it really matter which one we pick ?

109
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:19,367
I'll draw up the papers.

110
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:23,067
Whatever you want, honey.

111
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,834
It's hard to believe that soon
all this will be gone.

112
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,234
Take a good look around.
Everything is about to change.

113
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,467
Actually, I have a surprise.

114
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:37,667
Look.

115
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,834
The floor plan to 
our apartment in Providence.

116
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:42,634
Hey, big-screen TV,

117
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,334
La-Z-Boys, hot plate.

118
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,934
It looks exactly like here. Mm-hmm.

119
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,334
Awesome.

120
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,134
Do you think our TiVo will keep
its memory if we pack it ?

121
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,234
I don't know. I should call the
help line right now.

122
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,867
Pen...

123
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,834
Oh...

124
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,834
What ?

125
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,400
Nothing.

126
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:06,901
You know, I think I'm going to call later

127
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,667
when there's less phone traffic in India.

128
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,001
What ?

129
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,600
Isn't it awesome

130
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,234
we get to live like this 
for the next four years ?

131
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:16,268
Mm-hmm.

132
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:17,600
Okay, got to run.

133
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,433
Hey, Atwood. Hey.

134
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,700
Ryan. Come in. Sit.

135
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,567
Yeah, not going to happen.

136
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:28,767
But I do need your help with a plan.

137
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,234
Does it involve leaving this room ?

138
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:31,501
It involves leaving the city.

139
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:33,317
Welcome back from Paris, Ms. Townsend.

140
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:34,584
You here for business or pleasure ?

141
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,584
That is an excellent question, sir.

142
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:38,484
The answer to which I spent the better part

143
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:39,983
of my trans-Atlantic flight
trying to determine.

144
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,784
Because it's not business,
but it's not pleasure.

145
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:45,684
Because that would imply that seeing Ryan
Atwood again is pleasurable,

146
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,584
when really, all it is is stressful and...

147
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,083
you know, really kind of surreal

148
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,617
that we ever dated in the first place.

149
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,184
Because it's not like we have anything in common.

150
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,150
You know, not that we didn't
try though, because we really did.

151
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:55,551
Like I stopped wearing shoes

152
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,950
and learned hacky sack in an effort
to fit in at Berkeley,

153
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:00,350
and then he learned French and
learned to appreciate

154
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,517
the difference between
a Brie and a Camemburt

155
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,517
And then he grew this little
mustache in an effort

156
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:07,517
to appear more French-like,
but you know, he's fair-haired,

157
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,551
and it was really just kind
of an above-lip disaster.

158
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:11,651
And from there we just realized
it didn't work, you know.

159
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:14,684
We didn't work and I left,

160
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:17,717
to escape the painful reality
of yet another failed relationship

161
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:20,250
and at least this time
I didn't stalk him though.

162
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,484
Because sometimes I do that.

163
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:23,317
Good thing I never fell in love

164
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,451
with the president, huh ?

165
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,417
That would be bad.

166
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:28,717
Right.

167
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:37,517
Summer !

168
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:38,684
Hey, Taylor.

169
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:40,183
Hi. Hi !

170
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,317
So good to see you.

171
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,617
Oh, you, too.

172
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:43,917
Did you come alone ?

173
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:45,684
Ryan doesn't know that you're coming.

174
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:47,617
You told me not to tell him.

175
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:49,283
Who said anything about Ryan ?

176
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,684
We're so over.

177
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,984
I just, I can't even believe
we ever even dated, you know ?

178
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:54,684
I don't even think I would recognize him.

179
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:56,550
You know, I just hope he shaved that mustache.

180
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,018
Did you get a rental car ?

181
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,851
Yeah. You got the address ?

182
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,717
Ryan, hi.

183
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:08,617
You found out I was coming
and decided to surprise me ?

184
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:13,517
No, I didn't know you were
coming back and I'm leaving.

185
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:16,018
Oh, well, now I'm surprised.
Where are you guys going ?

186
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,884
Oh, not far. We'll be back by tonight.

187
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,784
Yeah, it's a mission.
I'm going to call you.

188
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:22,450
Okay, well, brilliant catching up.
It's good to see you.

189
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:27,018
That wasn't awkward at all.

190
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:28,817
No, no, why would it be ?

191
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:31,417
It's not like I'm still in love
with her or anything.

192
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,317
Taylor, are you okay ?

193
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:38,183
No, I'm not.

194
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,851
I'm still in love with him.

195
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,217
I can't believe the Bullit's got 12 sons.

196
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:44,217
One from every major oil refinery in Texas.

197
00:07:44,283 --> 00:07:45,484
I mean, I've always wanted brothers

198
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,317
and now I'm going to have a dozen.

199
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,784
I mean, it'll be cool,

200
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:50,217
if they're all like you.

201
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,717
Well, that's the thing.

202
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:57,283
Oh, there she is.

203
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,984
Bullits, meet the Squirt.

204
00:07:59,051 --> 00:07:59,984
Howdy, Squirt !

205
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:01,217
Squirt, meet the Bullits.

206
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:04,717
This is Austin, Dallas,
Houston, Lubbock, Houston Lubbock

207
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,884
Odessa, El Paso, Amarillo, Texarkana,

208
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:09,250
San Antonio, Corpus Christi

209
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:10,517
and Hanoi.

210
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:13,784
Wow.

211
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:14,817
Okay.

212
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:16,217
Ain't that something ?

213
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:19,751
Now you got yourself a whole
buffet of Bullits to love.

214
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:20,550
Bang !

215
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:23,018
Wow.

216
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,417
Well, I guess the apple really
doesn't fall far from the tree.

217
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:26,450
Oh, not my apples.

218
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:28,651
The Bullit's DNA is bulletproof.

219
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,350
Not a recessive gene in the
whole damn double helix.

220
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,317
Oh, looky here, the wife-to-be.

221
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:35,617
What's the word, sweetie ?

222
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,851
It's a boy.

223
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,417
Bang !

224
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:42,450
Lucky number 13, yes !

225
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:51,717
This is it.

226
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:53,350
The Berkeley House.

227
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:55,517
Yeah, exactly how Sandy described it.

228
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:57,517
You ready for this ?

229
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,784
Hello.

230
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:07,118
Hi.

231
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,851
So we'd like to buy your house.

232
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:21,701
Please don't shut the door.

233
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:24,400
We'd really like to buy your house.
And you're an adorable couple,

234
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,134
but this house isn't for sale.

235
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,134
We should tell them everything. Okay, right.

236
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,300
Uh, this is my house.

237
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:30,333
Just shut the door.

238
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,634
No, no, he means it used to be his house.

239
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,551
Yeah, those baby handprints in the cement,

240
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:35,868
those, those are mine.

241
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:38,133
Oh, those little hands are yours ?
Those are so cute.

242
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,534
I know, thank you.

243
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:42,067
Anyway, my parents moved us
to Newport when I was two,

244
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,700
which was a mistake on many levels,

245
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,484
but it did allow us to adopt
a young ex-convict named Ryan.

246
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:49,051
Shut the door. I'm not actually a convict.

247
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:51,318
Right. Now our house is condemned
due to an earthquake.

248
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,017
My mom's about to have another baby,

249
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,517
and I feel like there's
this chance for our family

250
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,084
to have a fresh start.

251
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:57,684
Yeah, his parents are always
talking about the time

252
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,650
they spent here being the best of their lives.

253
00:09:59,717 --> 00:10:01,351
It'd be like coming home.

254
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:04,517
Look, I hear you.

255
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,483
But this already is a home, it's ours.

256
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,017
And it's not for sale.

257
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:13,151
I thought I had them with the
hands in the cement thing.

258
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:14,450
Me, too.

259
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:15,850
We should call your dad.

260
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,884
Sure, nobody can change
somebody's mind like my dad,

261
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,251
but he's not going to leave my mom,

262
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,884
and the airlines won't let women fly in their

263
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:22,750
ninth month of pregnancy.

264
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:24,750
What if she didn't fly on an airline ?

265
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:33,000
And you also sign here,
and here and this is your offer.

266
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:41,834
Well, we'll live there a year,
get settled with the baby,

267
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,401
and then we can look for
a house without feeling rushed.

268
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,568
And I know we can't impose
on Julie much longer.

269
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:47,534
I just wish...

270
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,900
Oh, me, too.

271
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:52,201
But wherever our family is, that's home.

272
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:56,800
Drop that

273
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:57,834
pen, amigo !

274
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:00,034
I'm kidnapping the both of you.

275
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,834
Come on. The jet is gassed up.

276
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:02,867
Is he drunk ?

277
00:11:02,934 --> 00:11:03,867
No. Your boys called.

278
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:04,967
They're up in Berkeley

279
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:06,634
trying to buy back the old homestead.

280
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
Just need you two up
there to seal the deal.

281
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,901
I figured the least
I could do is lend my jet,

282
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:13,901
since old Sanford here
introduced me to my lady love.

283
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,700
I can't fly. I'm nine-months pregnant.

284
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,634
Oh, my son Amarillo,
he's waiting at the plane.

285
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,400
He's one of those doctors
for women's private parts.

286
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,201
Come on, sunshine's burning. Let's go.

287
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:22,667
Not to pressure you,

288
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:25,433
but the owners
are expecting other offers.

289
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,533
Oh, what the hell, blondie,
I'll buy this house.

290
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,368
There you go.

291
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,567
There you go.

292
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:32,067
Thank you. Andele !

293
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:35,134
I'm not saying things will just
snap back to how they were,

294
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:37,268
but maybe we were too quick to give up. Mm-hmm.

295
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,901
So we'll be 6,000 miles away.

296
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,867
I'll be in Newport
for Christmas and the summer,

297
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,301
and you know, we'll make it work.

298
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:44,634
I should call him, don't you think ?

299
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,167
Oh, real-life Jake broke up
with real-life April.

300
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:48,667
What are you doing ?

301
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:50,400
I told Seth that I wouldn't
watch Briefcase

302
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:51,734
or No Briefcase till he got home,
Briefcase or No Briefcase

303
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,767
so I'm reading about The Valley.

304
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,268
Oh, my God, that show's still on ?

305
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:56,201
It just got picked up for five more seasons.

306
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:57,867
You know, these teen dramas,
they just run forever.

307
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,734
Okay, enough, this is insane. Hey !

308
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,433
Summer, when I left, you were
a committed environmentalist.

309
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,067
You were passionate.

310
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:05,567
You engaged with the world.

311
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:06,934
You... bathed.

312
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,600
I still care about things. Like what ?

313
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,433
Besides Briefcase or
No Briefcase or No Briefcase

314
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,967
and the stars of The Valley ?

315
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:16,134
Ooh.

316
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,867
Sweetie, tell me what happened.

317
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:20,001
I don't know.

318
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,700
Well, the earthquake happened,

319
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,301
then the comic bookstore closed down,

320
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,067
and Seth's room was destroyed.

321
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:27,368
I didn't join GEORGE, and then he moved in.

322
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,634
We talked about everything there was to talk about.

323
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,433
Then one day we turned on the TV.

324
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,001
And there it was.

325
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,134
Briefcase or No Briefcase.

326
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,334
And suddenly, we weren't
worried about the future.

327
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,767
We weren't wondering who we were.

328
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,934
For the first time, I think
we were really comfortable.

329
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:42,734
Maybe a little too comfortable.

330
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
You ever think about that ?

331
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,433
No.

332
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,967
Oh, my God, what is that ?

333
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,301
I don't know.

334
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,600
Pancakes had babies !

335
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,734
When did this happen ? !

336
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,034
You didn't know she was pregnant ?

337
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:01,567
I didn't he was a she.

338
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:04,834
Oh, my God, I'm a bad crack mother.

339
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:06,667
Shouldn't we be waiting at the house ?

340
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:08,334
Uh, we've got a little bit of time

341
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,034
until the Bullit is wheels
down with our parents.

342
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,467
Take a look around, man. In a few weeks,

343
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,567
you're going to have all
these new faces to punch.

344
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:15,934
Aw, you getting nostalgic on me ?

345
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,500
No. Seriously, everyone's moving.

346
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,201
Newport's over. This is the future.

347
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:22,967
And it's also possible you may
meet another Taylor Townsend.

348
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:24,533
What was that ?

349
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,934
There is no other Taylor Townsend ?

350
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:26,901
There's only one

351
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:28,317
and you're in love with her ? All right.

352
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:29,817
Listen, you haven't said
a word since we bumped into her.

353
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,133
I know it means you can't stop
thinking about her.

354
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,234
I'm going to get some coffee.

355
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,484
You love her, I know it.

356
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,584
Stop it. I know it !

357
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,717
Join GEORGE.

358
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,884
Fight the industrial
devastation of our planet.

359
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,017
Hey, are you Paul from GEORGE. ?

360
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:44,017
No, Tom from GEORGE. You know Paul ?

361
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,284
Uh, no, my girlfriend Summer Roberts met him.

362
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:47,518
Sure, yeah.

363
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,384
Paul was really disappointed
when she turned us down.

364
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,717
What's she up to now ?

365
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:53,017
Uh, not much of anything, really.

366
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,784
Well, um, give her this, would you ?

367
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,984
I hate to see someone like Summer
just waste their passion.

368
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,683
Yeah.

369
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:08,984
She... she loves otters.

370
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,484
Thank you.

371
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:16,217
Hello. Hello

372
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,017
Ryan, hi, it's me.

373
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:19,517
Oh, hey.

374
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,251
Ouch, this soap stings !

375
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:22,883
Well, that's because it's lye.

376
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,584
Sorry.

377
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:28,484
So I was, um, thinking
maybe we should get together

378
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:29,917
and talk about things.

379
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:31,618
Oh, uh...

380
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:33,217
But you don't want to ?

381
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:35,284
No, no, it's just I don't know
when Seth and I are going

382
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:36,117
to get back from Berkeley.

383
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:39,050
Oh. Why are you in Berkeley ?

384
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:40,950
Long story, but basically trying

385
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:42,750
to get the Cohens their old house back.

386
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,284
The Cohens are moving to Berkeley ?

387
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,417
If things work out.

388
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:52,017
So, that would mean you wouldn't
be coming back to Newport

389
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:55,618
for Christmas or summer or...

390
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:56,651
ever.

391
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:58,917
I guess not.

392
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:01,317
Um, listen, we could talk
after the wedding if you want.

393
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:04,917
Yeah, oh, yeah, I have to go.

394
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:06,284
Um, you have a nice trip.

395
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,917
Ugh !

396
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,417
We finish this and then we're done.

397
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,817
Unless there's anything
else you need for tomorrow.

398
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:22,084
I'm all good.

399
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,451
I've got my shoes, my dress, my cheat sheet

400
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:26,050
with the names of all my stepbrothers.

401
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:28,417
How was that, meeting all of them ?

402
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:32,117
Weird, but I mean, I love Bullit,

403
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:33,783
but one's kind of enough, you know ?

404
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,184
You're telling me.

405
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,417
What are you talking about ?

406
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:37,750
You're about to spawn off the latest.

407
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:41,384
Well, maybe he won't be all that Bullit-esque.

408
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:42,783
Don't count on it.

409
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,584
He's probably going to come out
with a cowboy hat

410
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:45,651
telling the doctor, "Bang."

411
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:47,850
Or a wife-beater.

412
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:50,684
Why would he be wearing a wife-beater ?

413
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,718
Oh, my God. Mom...

414
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:56,517
Okay, honey, just relax.

415
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:58,950
You have to be kidding me.

416
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:00,817
I mean, does the Bullit know ?

417
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:02,150
Of course he knows.

418
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:04,850
What, you told him that the baby is...

419
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,050
Frank's, yes.

420
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:08,684
And when were you going to tell me ?

421
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,351
Soon.

422
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,351
I'm sorry. This isn't easy.

423
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:16,817
Well, what happened with you and Frank ?

424
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:20,618
I got pregnant, and Frank
couldn't deal with it,

425
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:22,050
so I left him.

426
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:25,150
That's when the Bullit came back,
I told him everything,

427
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,517
and he still wanted to marry me.

428
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:28,984
That's the whole story.

429
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,050
Mom, do you love the Bullit ?

430
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,950
Yes.

431
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,484
I can't believe we're here.

432
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:46,317
Seriously, fellas, this is crazy.

433
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:48,718
You always said this was
where you guys were the happiest.

434
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:50,150
Every city needs public defenders.

435
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,950
Plus, I think my little sister deserves a shot

436
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:52,883
at growing up normal.

437
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,217
Well, we can at least talk to them.

438
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:56,317
Can't hurt.

439
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,283
Hello. Oh... Hi.

440
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,450
I'm Sandy Cohen.

441
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:07,550
This is my wife, Kirsten.

442
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:08,784
and we used to live here.

443
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:10,118
I'm Todd.

444
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:11,417
Patrick.

445
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:12,550
And, um, yeah, your son's

446
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:13,884
already told us everything.

447
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:14,951
about the earthquake, the hands in the cement,

448
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:16,851
the baby, but like we said...

449
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,051
You don't want to sell, I get it,

450
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:19,851
but just being here again,

451
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,751
I got to say it still feels like home.

452
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:24,051
Um, is the bathroom still
in the same place ? Do you mind ?

453
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:25,717
Why would I mind ?

454
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,417
Thank you.

455
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:30,017
I love what you've done
with the decorating.

456
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:32,383
Is there any chance
we could see the kitchen ?

457
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,817
Just to see if the Seth Cohen growth chart

458
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:35,383
is still notched in the wall ?

459
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,218
It isn't. We thought it was termites.

460
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:39,717
Oh, I hit three feet.

461
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:42,084
I mean, it was a pretty
huge accomplishment.

462
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:44,751
Sir, while we appreciate your nostalgia,

463
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:46,051
we have things to do.

464
00:17:46,118 --> 00:17:47,218
No, it's all right.

465
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,383
We'll be out of here in just a sec.

466
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,584
Oh, God !

467
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,218
Sandy ! Or not.

468
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,383
Sandy !

469
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:54,984
I'm here.

470
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:56,617
Oh, my God.

471
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:59,350
Okay, this isn't the bathroom.

472
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:00,717
I'm sorry, I didn't make it.

473
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,751
My water broke.

474
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:04,484
Seth, call an ambulance !

475
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,851
There's no time for an ambulance.

476
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,967
Okay, this is so random,
but I'm actually a midwife.

477
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,667
Because the baby is coming now.

478
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,907
Sophie Rose Cohen.

479
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:19,907
Aw...

480
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,707
It's got a nice ring to it, huh ?

481
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:22,907
She's beautiful, isn't she ?

482
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:24,573
She really will be in two years

483
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,540
when she doesn't look like
a squished meatball.

484
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,874
You just called your sister
a squished meatball.

485
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,273
You should have seen what you looked
like when you were born.

486
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,373
Oh, he was beautiful, too.

487
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,907
Yeah, I was.

488
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:36,039
Yeah, you looked like you went
12 rounds with Joe Frasier.

489
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:37,673
All right, move out of the way.

490
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,773
It's time for a feeding.

491
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Oh, she's going to...

492
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,340
Yeah, we should go.

493
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
No, thank you, Kirsten,
I'm lactose intolerant.

494
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,240
Bullit, what are you doing here ?

495
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:48,540
Aren't you getting married in a few hours ?

496
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,139
Don't I know it. Couldn't
get any damn airspace.

497
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:52,907
All those dot commers up here
with their private jets.

498
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:55,273
The runway was busier than
a bull in springtime.

499
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,373
It's fine now.

500
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,740
Hey, thanks for everything.

501
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,306
Give Julie our best

502
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,807
and please explain why we couldn't
make it. Oh, I will,

503
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:04,240
and she'll be thrilled.

504
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:06,974
And when she pops out lucky
number 13, bang,

505
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,340
I want you there.

506
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,707
Sophie Rose Cohen.

507
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:22,907
Caitlin, what are you doing here ?

508
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:25,006
Just wondering if you've got
an invite to the wedding,

509
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:28,139
'cause you didn't RSVP,
which is really rude,

510
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:30,473
considering my mom's pregnant
with your baby.

511
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,840
So she told you, huh ?

512
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:34,306
How could you do that...

513
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,573
just walk away from her ?

514
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,907
I mean, she loved you.

515
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:39,807
When she told me she was pregnant,
I did kind of panic,

516
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,240
and I know I let her down.

517
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,740
But when I went to see her and tell her that,

518
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,306
she was having dinner with Bullit.

519
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:45,540
For what it's worth,

520
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:48,740
I really do love her,
but she's made her choice.

521
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,974
I know better than to try
and change your mom's mind.

522
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:52,240
So you're just quitting ?

523
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:53,840
Whoa, wait a minute.
Isn't this what you wanted ?

524
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,707
Bullit and a new family ?

525
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:57,306
All I want is for my mom to be happy.

526
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:59,440
and for my little brother
to have his dad around,

527
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:01,840
but not if he's going to be a coward.

528
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,707
You know, I thought Atwoods
were good at fighting.

529
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,673
Hey. Hey.

530
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,840
Is Mom sleeping ?

531
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,607
Mother and daughter are snoring soundly.

532
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:24,340
How you feeling ?

533
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:28,406
Like I landed in a time warp;

534
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:31,840
your mother, me,
a new baby and this house.

535
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:33,073
It's almost 20 years later

536
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:35,006
and I feel like no time
has passed at all.

537
00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:36,406
Well, you look like it, too.

538
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:38,073
You got that full head of hair.

539
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:40,473
If I look half as good as you in 20 years,

540
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,039
I'll be a happy man.

541
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:44,340
Well, thanks, but I'd like
to see you being happy right now.

542
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:45,607
Seems the last couple of months

543
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:47,306
you've landed in a bit of a rut.

544
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:49,306
At least a La-Z-Boy.

545
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,406
Well, I sort of have, but being up here

546
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:57,106
and seeing Ryan's new life and
meeting my new sister...

547
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,006
I get that change is happening
whether I want it to or not.

548
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:01,707
Yeah, nothing lasts forever.

549
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:04,273
But you and Summer still have each other.

550
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,173
You'll be heading off
to Providence together.

551
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,540
Yeah.

552
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:11,006
Except I'm not so sure that
us being together

553
00:21:11,073 --> 00:21:14,240
is bringing out best in
either one of us right now.

554
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,340
But I'm afraid to let her go, so...

555
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:25,373
Well, things have a way
of coming back around.

556
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:28,940
Look at us.

557
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,907
Hey.

558
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:43,940
Maybe I should go try to find Julie

559
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:45,039
and see if she needs any help.

560
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:48,707
Sure, Summer, just abandon me, too.

561
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:50,406
Maybe I'll just strike up
a casual romance

562
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:51,473
with one of the Bullits.

563
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,473
Okay, who do you think's hotter,

564
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,974
El Paso or San Antonio ?

565
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,773
Ooh... hmm.

566
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,740
Yeah, I'm going to have to think about that.

567
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:02,640
Hanoi has a certain charm.

568
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:07,306
Thanks for filling in for Kirsten.

569
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:10,473
I hope she shows up soon.

570
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,173
You look so beautiful.

571
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,373
Thank you.

572
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,006
And you, it's nice
to see you looking so...

573
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,907
showered again.

574
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:20,173
Hmm, well,
I figured it was about time.

575
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,273
Yeah.

576
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,106
Is everything okay ?

577
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:27,073
I guess.

578
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,273
I don't know, you're with
the same someone for so long...

579
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,607
I guess you start to get a little comfortable.

580
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:36,440
I wouldn't know.

581
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:40,373
Do you think that
Seth and I are making a mistake ?

582
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,206
Living together right after

583
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:44,206
the earthquake, and then
getting an apartment together

584
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:45,273
next year in Providence ?

585
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,640
Uh, well,

586
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:49,206
you know...

587
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:51,006
I got married so young

588
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:55,273
that I never had a chance
to find out who I was

589
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,673
or what I cared about.

590
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,273
I mean, I never went to college

591
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,807
or learned any real skills.

592
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:04,740
And now here I am 20 years later,

593
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:06,440
still knocked up on my wedding day.

594
00:23:06,507 --> 00:23:08,206
Julie.

595
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:10,540
Summer...

596
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,139
you're a great girl.

597
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:15,907
And the world deserves to know you.

598
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:18,707
You deserve it, too.

599
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,240
Don't settle for comfortable.

600
00:23:23,907 --> 00:23:25,039
I got you something.

601
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,573
I know she would have
wanted to be here today.

602
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,240
Thank you.

603
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,073
Thank you.

604
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,974
Crap, my makeup.

605
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,840
Hmm, my makeup.

606
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:57,940
It'll take hours to fix.
­

607
00:23:58,006 --> 00:23:59,507
Hours ?

608
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:00,840
We don't got hours.

609
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:01,940
We're getting married now.

610
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,707
Now ? Is Kirsten here ?

611
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,707
Uh, about that... she dropped child

612
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:07,707
up in San Fran.

613
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:08,940
But lucky for her,

614
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:10,673
there was a hell of
a midwife standing by.

615
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,139
Kirsten had her baby ?

616
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,206
Yeah, and she said she was sorry
that she couldn't be here.

617
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:16,440
Now are you ready to get hitched ?

618
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:18,440
I can't get married without Kiki.

619
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:19,874
She's my best friend.

620
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,039
I'm sorry, but I'm not
doing it without her.

621
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:34,039
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

622
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,607
One of you two wouldn't be
a wedding planner would you ?

623
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,440
Actually...

624
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:45,773
Let me see my flower girl.

625
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,874
Julie ? Julie ?

626
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,073
Are you a runaway bride ?

627
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:50,039
Kind of a runaway wedding.

628
00:24:50,106 --> 00:24:54,940
Wait a minute, does that mean
that everybody came with you ?

629
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:56,173
Uh-oh.

630
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,106
Can I talk to you ?

631
00:24:58,173 --> 00:24:59,473
Do you have a minute ?

632
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:04,840
Okay, Ryan, what do you
want to talk about ?

633
00:25:04,907 --> 00:25:06,740
Well, I realized that
when I talked to you

634
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:07,874
yesterday on the phone,

635
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,440
I may have been a little insensitive.

636
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,740
You ? Never.

637
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,106
I also realize that

638
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:13,607
if the Cohen's do move to Berkeley,

639
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:16,440
we... we may never see each other again.

640
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:19,173
Hadn't really thought about it.

641
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,874
And when we do say good-bye,

642
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,740
I wanted it to be as friends.

643
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,874
Friends.

644
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,173
Sure.

645
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,640
Ryan Atwood, mon ami, sounds terif.

646
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:46,006
I'll sew those back on for you. Yeah, okay.

647
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:54,773
Okay.

648
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,306
What is it with you people ?

649
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,607
We're grandparents ?

650
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:05,006
Wow, that's, uh, that's amazing.

651
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:07,106
Congratulations to Pancakes.

652
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,573
Yeah.

653
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,039
Don't you think it's kind of weird

654
00:26:10,106 --> 00:26:11,740
that we didn't even know
Pancakes was pregnant ?

655
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:14,874
Well, we're not going
to win any parenting awards.

656
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,173
I mean, we must have been pretty out of it

657
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,807
to not even notice or care.

658
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,306
I think we've been in kind of a...

659
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,840
Rut lately ? Mm.

660
00:26:25,907 --> 00:26:28,206
Do you really think that we can spend

661
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:30,073
the next four years like this ?

662
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,306
Well, look, I'm a pretty skeptical guy.

663
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:39,740
I don't really believe in signs, but...

664
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,039
this one's pretty easy to read.

665
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,406
It's very easy to read.

666
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,406
Big letters.

667
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:48,273
GEORGE ?

668
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,006
You got to go, Summer.

669
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,907
But what about us ?

670
00:26:55,974 --> 00:26:59,240
This is for us, okay ?
It's for both of us.

671
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,106
"I, Julie Cooper, take you, Gordon
Bullit..."

672
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:15,073
I, Julie Cooper, take you,
Gordon Bullit...

673
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:35,640
Julie !

674
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:44,473
Now, by the power vested
in me, by the state...

675
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:47,106
Oh, come on, Squirt !

676
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,406
Frank ?

677
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:50,673
Frank ? Frank ?

678
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,406
Hello ?

679
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:53,807
Kaitlin, hey, is your mom around ?

680
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:55,773
Yeah, she's kind of getting
married right now.

681
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,440
That's what I was afraid of.
Put me on speaker phone.

682
00:27:57,507 --> 00:28:00,306
It took you long enough.

683
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:01,406
Julie !

684
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:02,807
Julie, can you hear me ?

685
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:04,273
Frank, what are you doing ?

686
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,306
I love you, Julie, and I want
to be there for you, and our son.

687
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:11,740
She's pregnant with Frank's baby ?

688
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,507
Who cares ? This is so romantic.

689
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:16,006
Hello ?

690
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:17,440
Sorry, Frank, old buddy,

691
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:19,840
we're having a hard time hearing you.

692
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,440
Let's get on with the wedding.

693
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:28,473
I'm sorry, can... can I have a moment ?

694
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,106
Oh, that woman is like
nailing Jell-O to the wall.

695
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,540
Mom ?

696
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:49,340
Not now, Kaitlin.

697
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:51,139
Mom's trying to figure out who to marry.

698
00:28:51,206 --> 00:28:54,206
I know.

699
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,940
Which is why whatever you decide,

700
00:28:57,006 --> 00:29:00,440
just make sure it's what you want...

701
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:03,807
because this is forever.

702
00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:23,806
So, um, Todd and I were talking

703
00:29:23,873 --> 00:29:26,440
and, um... I mean, look,

704
00:29:26,507 --> 00:29:27,674
you had a baby here, you had a wedding...

705
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,040
Christened one of our bedrooms...

706
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:31,640
Clearly you have a connection.

707
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:34,774
This is your house, we're just living in it.

708
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,140
We'll have our lawyers call you, but...

709
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:38,273
We can't fight fate.

710
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,640
We'll sell.

711
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:43,806
You mean it ?

712
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,607
Thank you.

713
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:52,307
You in ?

714
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,006
Yeah.

715
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:59,340
The Cohens are moving to Berkeley.

716
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:00,573
Sophie, you're home !

717
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,106
Hey, sweetie.

718
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:36,823
Our kitchen is going to be so empty.

719
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,190
I know.

720
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:40,756
I was kind of getting used to becoming a Cohen.

721
00:30:40,823 --> 00:30:43,157
My Sandy imitation was killer.

722
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:44,489
Mm-hmm.

723
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:45,857
Well, it's just the two of us now.

724
00:30:45,923 --> 00:30:47,324
Yeah.

725
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,356
It's pretty awesome that
you decided to stay single.

726
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:53,123
But do we have a plan ?

727
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,123
Yeah, I was thinking
we could go get mani-pedis,

728
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,756
maybe a couple of Mystics.

729
00:30:56,823 --> 00:30:59,257
I was talking about,
like, a real plan.

730
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,389
A life plan.

731
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:03,423
I know.

732
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,489
The truth is, I don't.

733
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:08,157
For the first time,
I am going to figure out

734
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:09,423
how to do this on my own.

735
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:10,890
You're not on your own.

736
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:12,623
I could work retail,

737
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,723
part-time at least.

738
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,057
We'll figure it out.

739
00:31:17,123 --> 00:31:18,123
We're Coopers.

740
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,489
Mm-hmm.

741
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:25,489
Oh, hey, Summer forgot her books.

742
00:31:28,324 --> 00:31:32,823
"Undergraduate Catalog."

743
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,090
Huh.

744
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,756
Aww.

745
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:00,923
All right, Roberts.

746
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,923
I'll see you.

747
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,090
See you, Atwood.

748
00:32:03,157 --> 00:32:05,890
Thank you very much for Flapjacks.

749
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:06,990
Oh... !

750
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:08,257
I promise I'll raise him right.

751
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:09,790
Well, don't forget to clean his cage,

752
00:32:09,857 --> 00:32:11,389
which should not be used for cage fights.

753
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:13,923
Got it. Oh, my gosh,
I'm going to miss you so much.

754
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,890
Oh...

755
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:18,790
Well, you can follow up with
my political efforts on my blog.

756
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:21,090
And you can follow
my personal efforts on mine.

757
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:22,723
Eww.

758
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:25,057
You're the best.

759
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,690
You're the only girlfriend I ever had.

760
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:29,356
I'll miss you. You, too.

761
00:32:29,423 --> 00:32:30,756
All right.

762
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,623
We'll be in the car.

763
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,224
Bye.

764
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,523
I don't know, some of these GEORGE guys,

765
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,356
they look so idealistic.

766
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,556
You got nothing to worry about.

767
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:50,690
Just remember, this isn't good-bye.

768
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:53,923
You're my destiny, Cohen.
.

769
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,756
Go save the world, Summer Roberts.

770
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:16,489
See you in '08 after
the New Hampshire primary.

771
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:18,389
Just go.

772
00:33:21,923 --> 00:33:23,723
I'm going to go.

773
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:22,057
So you're going off

774
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:24,957
to Berkeley, I'm going off to Paris.

775
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:27,224
Who knows what's going to happen, huh ?

776
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,590
Yeah.

777
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:30,523
Well, I think what's really important

778
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,823
is what's already happened,

779
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,790
which was this year... thank you,

780
00:34:33,857 --> 00:34:36,623
Taylor... you, uh, you saved me.

781
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,423
Well, you may have helped me iron out

782
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,324
a few issues of my own.

783
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,556
All right.

784
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:43,923
Come here.

785
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,057
All aboard !

786
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,356
Remind me why you're taking the train to Paris.

787
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:56,456
Oh, actually, I'm taking a train to New York,

788
00:34:56,523 --> 00:34:57,990
and from there I'm taking a boat to Paris.

789
00:34:58,057 --> 00:34:59,423
It's the strangest thing,

790
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:00,723
but no airline would have me.

791
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,857
Hmm.

792
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:04,523
Oh, you'd better get going.

793
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,456
Oh, yeah, but...

794
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,389
Ryan... better do that. Ryan...

795
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:10,456
Ryan. Huh ? -Ryan

796
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:12,157
They're not going to let you off the train.

797
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:14,356
Mm-hmm.

798
00:35:14,423 --> 00:35:15,523
Uh-oh.

799
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,423
Where's the next station ?

800
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:18,990
San Bernardino, I think.

801
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:20,090
It's an hour away.

802
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:21,523
Ooh, we can do a lot in an hour.

803
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,523
I did book a sleeper car.

804
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,489
That's the last of it.

805
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,623
Here we go.

806
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,057
Fly safe and we'll see you at Parent's Day weekend.

807
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:56,356
All right. Two months and 14 days away.

808
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:58,023
I will be counting the days as well.

809
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,556
Oh, I love you.

810
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:01,023
I love you, too. Let's group-hug it.

811
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,590
Well, I guess we'd better get going

812
00:36:09,656 --> 00:36:11,690
if we're going to beat the traffic.

813
00:36:11,756 --> 00:36:13,057
You take care of yourself.

814
00:36:13,123 --> 00:36:15,389
Okay.

815
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:19,190
You got the directions in case
we get separated ?

816
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:20,324
Yeah, you know what ?

817
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,123
I think I'm just going to hang out.

818
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,756
As much as this house meant to you...

819
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:26,157
Take your time.

820
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:28,257
I'll meet you at the rest stop
in Santa Barbara.

821
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:30,057
All right.
Time to go !

822
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:31,456
Yep.

823
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:50,890
I could give you a ride.

824
00:36:50,957 --> 00:36:52,857
No, no, this is better.

825
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:55,656
My new life of loneliness
and isolation begins now.

826
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:57,890
Ah, you're going to be fine. Yeah,
I don't know about you though.

827
00:36:57,957 --> 00:36:59,723
I've been doing some checking up
on your new roommate.

828
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,290
His favorite book and movie
are DaVinci Code.

829
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:03,456
He's no me.

830
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:04,823
You say that like it's a bad thing.

831
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,790
At least I leave you funnier
than when I found you.

832
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:10,423
Yeah, I'm a lot better off
than when you found me.

833
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:15,123
Me, too.

834
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:18,324
Should we hug ?

835
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:20,957
I know. It's crazy. Come on.
Give me a shake, dude.

836
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:25,057
All right. All right.

837
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:26,456
Aw. feels good in here.

838
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:28,389
Oh, it felt really nice.

839
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:30,257
Felt really nice. Yeah.

840
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:32,690
All right. See you later.

841
00:37:32,756 --> 00:37:33,723
Yeah. All right.

842
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,190
I don't know what to say,

843
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:18,489
except that you totally
had my back out there.

844
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:50,523
Hey.

845
00:38:56,923 --> 00:38:56,990
Ryan's going to stay with us now.

846
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:07,090
I'll unpack later.

847
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:24,157
No nukes ! No nukes ! No nukes !

848
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:26,623
Good job, you guys. Louder ! Come on !

849
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,023
All right,

850
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,023
what was... I think you can
pretty much imagine

851
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,257
what I'm going to talk about.

852
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,857
That's right.

853
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:54,556
I hope you know what I'm talking about.

854
00:40:54,623 --> 00:40:56,756
All right !

855
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:59,356
Any volunteers ?

856
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,523
Yes ?

857
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,489
X=24.

858
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:11,923
Whoo !

859
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:14,857
Whoo !

860
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,523
Yeah, I'm just leaving the site now.

861
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,790
Everything looks good.

862
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:09,923
We're on schedule to meet our target date.

863
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,990
Thank you.

864
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,090
Hey, kid.

865
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,157
Need any help ?
