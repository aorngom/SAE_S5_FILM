1
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,300
JULIE:Hello?

2
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,300
It's me, I'm leaving.

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,800
Do you need anything?

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,500
No.

5
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,200
So when does the plane land
in Providence?

6
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,149
Half an hour?Well, okay, 
but I need to talk to her now.

7
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,850
Do you think you could maybe
connect me to the pilot?

8
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,750
I'm...

9
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,850
(softly):Damn it.

10
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,750
JULIE:It took the investigator
six months to find Volchok.

11
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,450
Ryan, this may be
the only chance we get.

12
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,750
He's not going to get away.

13
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,449
I'll call you later.

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:23,768
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

15
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:37,249
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@ID Sync:FRM@Uranus</font>

16
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,050
Ryan, hey, you're
up bright and early.

17
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,150
I'm late.

18
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,950
Really? Late where?

19
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,650
It's 6:00 in the morning.

20
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,750
You got a paper route
or something?

21
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,350
The gym.

22
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,050
Oh.

23
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,750
Could you drop me off
at the store?

24
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,699
There's a new Supergirl
maquette coming in

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,899
and I want to be there
before Philip and Leon

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,349
get their greasy paws on it.

27
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,150
Yeah, the gym's the
other way, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,550
I heard you
on the phone.

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,250
You were spying on me?

30
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,250
I wasn't spying on you.

31
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,150
I was calling Summer
to find out why she left.

32
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,250
What are you doing?

33
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,050
It's none of your business.

34
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,350
Listen, if you know
where Volchok is,

35
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,450
let's just call the police.

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,450
No, I'm not
calling the police.

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,250
I can't let you go.

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,150
It's not really your choice.

39
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,050
So what? Then, you're
just going to find Volchok

40
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,650
and either kill him
or get yourself killed?

41
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,250
That's insane.

42
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,350
This conversation is over.

43
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,350
What are you...
what are you doing?

44
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,850
I'm coming with you.

45
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,149
It's not like you're leaving me
any choice.

46
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,950
I'm going to tell the cops.

47
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,950
I just need to see him first.

48
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,550
No offense, but, like,
nobody believes that.

49
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,650
If I tell Sandy or the cops,

50
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,450
they'll make me stay away.

51
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,950
I need to be there
when they arrest him.

52
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,650
The only way for me to do that
is if I'm there first.

53
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,650
Okay, take me with you.

54
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,250
No.

55
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,349
I won't get in the way.

56
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,749
You know how stealth I can be.

57
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,250
Why not? If that's really
all you're going to do.

58
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,350
Okay.

59
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,150
You have to do everything I say.

60
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,150
All right, you're the boss.

61
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,450
So where we going?

62
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,050
Mexico.

63
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,450
Perfect,

64
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,350
I need Chiclets.

65
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,750
(piano and acoustic guitar
strumming gentle melody)

66
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,450
 California, here we come 

67
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,950
 Right back where
we started from 

68
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:21,599
 California...
California... 

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,600
here we come..

70
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,350
They call this a place
of higher learning.

71
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,850
I'll tell you what I'm learning.

72
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,650
I'm learning to think
for myself.

73
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,450
I'm learning that what they call
their property...

74
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,150
No, it's our world.

75
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,850
Summer! Hey!

76
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,550
Hey.

77
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,749
It's so good to see you.

78
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,550
Where have you been?

79
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,250
Oh, um, I had to go home.

80
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,349
It was kind of an emergency,

81
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,350
but everything's okay now.

82
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,450
It was just hard being there.

83
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,149
What an amazing
spirit you have.

84
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,050
I'll bet you, in a past
life, you were an eagle,

85
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,050
soaring through
mountain passes.

86
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,750
Do you ever have
dreams of flying?

87
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,550
No, not really.

88
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,550
What's going on?

89
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,150
Oh, right, the
present, yes.

90
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,350
19:00 hours last night,

91
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,450
the board of trustees--

92
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,550
talk about an oxymoron--

93
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,750
voted to cut down

94
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,850
this majestic tree.

95
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,250
What?
They can't do that.

96
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,350
Exactly.

97
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,150
I mean, this tree
was, was an acorn

98
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,850
in the primordial
miasma of America.

99
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,650
It saw the rise of
this country, Summer,

100
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,650
and in my opinion,

101
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,550
its fall.

102
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,699
Now they want to cut it down

103
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,649
so some hung over sophomore
can get to Poli-Sci ten seconds faster.

104
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,850
So what's the plan?

105
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,750
The plan is to open
people's minds.

106
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
The plan is to reject their 
dollar-driven notions of progress.

107
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,550
Che,

108
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,950
what's the actual plan?

109
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,650
Oh, yeah, uh,
the actual plan.

110
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,050
We've got a petition
and a 24-hour tree-sit set to go,

111
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,050
so if that doesn't
work, revolution.

112
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,750
Okay, well,

113
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,250
why don't we just start
with the tree-sit?

114
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,550
I am so glad you're back.

115
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,949
So is Mother Earth.

116
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,150
Mm.

117
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,550
She loves you very much.

118
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,350
I love her.

119
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,650
Good.

120
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,650
Okay.

121
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,950
Summer's with us!

122
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,950
Huh? Huh?

123
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,750
MACHINE VOICE:You have no new messages.

124
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,150
WOMAN:Oh, uh,

125
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,399
Seth left you a message
last night,

126
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,349
but I accidentally
erased it.

127
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,350
Hey.

128
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,350
Taylor?

129
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,850
What are you doing in my bed?

130
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,849
Do you want to get in?

131
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,250
We could snuggle.

132
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,450
No.

133
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,650
Um, what are you doing here

134
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,150
and why are you listening
to my messages, Taylor?

135
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,750
I don't suppose you have
an espresso maker.

136
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,050
What are you wearing?

137
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,950
What? I always sleep in this.

138
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,750
Okay, just put this on...

139
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,850
immediately.

140
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,350
Okay, now,will you tell
 me what's going on?

141
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,250
First, you're in Newport when

142
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,450
you're supposed to be in France.

143
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,350
Then, your mom shows up

144
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,350
and you run away and--

145
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,750
How did you get
here before me?

146
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,850
Do you have
a secret twin?

147
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,950
Because that would
explain so much.

148
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,950
Okay, okay, sit down.

149
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,350
I'm going to explain
everything to you.

150
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,350
So, um...

151
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,750
Something... happened in France.

152
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,550
Just something... huge.

153
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,850
And, uh, I came back to
tell my mom about it,

154
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,750
and then,
I just got really scared

155
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,550
and, uh, I was
completely lost, Summer.??

156
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,650
But then I realized that you... 

157
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,850
were the one person
who would understand.

158
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,750
Summer,

159
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,050
I...

160
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,850
Oh, my God.

161
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,350
When was the last time
you shaved your legs?

162
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,550
It's like a forest, and--

163
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,550
(gasps):

164
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,550
Oh, my God, your toenails.

165
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,350
Okay, yeah,
I don't do that stuff anymore.

166
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,350
Obviously.

167
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,950
You've got hobbit feet.

168
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,850
CHE:Summer?

169
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,750
Enrique just saw two guys
with chainsaws.

170
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,250
This thing is going down
right now.

171
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,850
Okay, um,...

172
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,650
Taylor, I'm sorry;

173
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,250
my dining card is on the desk.

174
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,450
We will talk about this
later, I promise, okay?

175
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,250
Okay.

176
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,950
WOMAN:Six absentees,

177
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,650
13 tardies?

178
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,750
Mr. Street said she
fell asleep twice in Latin.

179
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,450
Well, you can't
blame her for that.

180
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,350
I'm getting no reception.

181
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,450
How many bars do you have?

182
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,650
She has a whole slew
of missed assignments,

183
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,250
and during bio lab,

184
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,950
Mr. Castle got the strong sense
 Kaitlin was flirting with him.

185
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,850
Is he the really short one?

186
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,650
I'm, I'm sure she just
thought he was a student.

187
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,850
Mrs. Cooper,you're in the office
of the dean of discipline.

188
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,150
This doesn't happen
because of misunderstandings.

189
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,550
Right, well, Dean Torres,

190
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,050
Kaitlin tests in the top
three percent of her class.

191
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,950
She's a natural leader.

192
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,550
Surely, this is just...

193
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,750
All the more reason she
shouldn't waste her potential.

194
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,050
Tell me, how are things at home?

195
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,650
Good.

196
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,550
Things are good.

197
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,050
I don't know what to say.

198
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,050
Yes, things have been difficult,

199
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,650
but we're doing our best.

200
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,550
Neil works a lot.

201
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,050
He actually just
left this morning

202
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,850
for a conference in Seattle.

203
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,350
But he and Kaitlin
are good friends

204
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,750
and, and things are good.

205
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,850
And you and Kaitlin?

206
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,650
Talk about school, her life?

207
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,750
I'm sorry, look,

208
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,150
Kaitlin is 15 years old.

209
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,150
If I don't find
voodoo dolls of myself

210
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,150
in her bedroom, I'm happy.

211
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,650
Harbor's running
a clothing drive

212
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,250
for the refugees in Darfur.

213
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,150
That's a great idea;

214
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,450
I'll make sure she's there.

215
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,050
Julie...

216
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,750
On a different note,

217
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,450
do you know if cell
phones work in Mexico?

218
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,050
I'd like you and Kaitlin to do
the clothing drive together.

219
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,850
Excuse me?

220
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,649
Huh.

221
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,949
That's exactly what I said.

222
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,950
And there was nothing else?

223
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,350
Nothing.

224
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,250
Angry?

225
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,449
Nudfo?

226
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,950
Chocolate love?

227
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,650
Nude fo...

228
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,950
Nudfo? Is that a word?

229
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,950
Not that I know of.

230
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,650
When did you find this?

231
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,650
Just now,

232
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,950
when I went to see
if the boys had anything

233
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,950
to give to the clothing drive.

234
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,850
You tried calling them?

235
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,150
No answer.

236
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,250
You know what I
think this is?

237
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,250
A coded message?

238
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,350
Nothing.

239
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,350
It's probably the
name of a band.

240
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,350
Seth wrote it ona piece of 
paper and put it in his pocket.

241
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,150
Relax, sweetheart.

242
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,049
Hello

243
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,850
Dad, it's me.

244
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,449
Did you get my note?

245
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,449
I had to write it in code
in case Ryan found it.

246
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,650
Right, the note.

247
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,650
Yeah, he says he's not going
to do anything to Volchok.

248
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,650
Wait, wait, what?

249
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,450
I thought you got the note.

250
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,350
No, no, no. I got the "Angry
Nudfo Chocolate Love" note.

251
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,750
I didn't get the one about
Ryan following Volchok.

252
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,150
What?

253
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,850
It's an anagram.

254
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,550
Oh, yeah?

255
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,250
Well, since when
is there a G in Ryan?

256
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:45,950
I was in a rush;

257
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,150
I had to add a few letters
so it made sense.

258
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,150
Well, you certainly succeeded'cause 
this thing is about as clear as mud.

259
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,250
"Ryan found Volchok."
Of course.

260
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,050
Where are you?

261
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,250
Okay, don't freak out.

262
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,250
Please say Newport.

263
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,250
We're in Mexico.

264
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,250
He didn't say Newport,
did he?

265
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,950
We're at a gas station
outside Ensenada,

266
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,150
but Ryan promises he just wants
to see Volchok.

267
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,750
I want you guys
back here right now.

268
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,249
No offense, Dad, but that
may be a tad unrealistic.

269
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,150
Let me talk to Ryan.

270
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,050
Yeah, I got to go;

271
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,650
I'll call you later.

272
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,650
Seth!

273
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,550
Hey, I was just leaving
Summer a message.

274
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,050
You ready to, uh, *ndale?

275
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,850
What did you tell Sandy?

276
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,650
Uh...

277
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,250
Ah.

278
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,250
Did you tell him about Volchok?

279
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,450
Yeah, I did,

280
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,450
and honestly, I'm glad

281
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,050
because you're starting
to freak me out.

282
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,950
I know you want
to kill him.

283
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,450
Yeah, I do...

284
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,150
but I'm not going to, all right?

285
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,700
You either trust me
on that or you don't.

286
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,650
All right, I trust you.

287
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,450
All right, let's go
to Ensenada and find him.

288
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,950
But I can't keep
watching you to make sure

289
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,950
you're not calling your dad.

290
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,750
It's going to be
kind of hard now.

291
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,950
Ow, you cut me.
So stop moving.

292
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,950
You guys are gayer
than your dad.

293
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,150
It's for water polo,
coach's orders.

294
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,450
That doesn't make it
any less gay.

295
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,150
Yeah, well, our brother
slept with your mom.

296
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,950
Yeah.

297
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,050
Nice try.

298
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,850
Big gay dad trumps slutty mom.

299
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,550
No, it doesn't.

300
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,850
Yeah, ask anybody.

301
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,450
Gay dad always trumps
slutty mom.

302
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,150
Dude, come on,it's burning.
It's all right.

303
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,050
Hey, did you talk to your mom about, 
uh, Dr. Roberts and his ex-wife?

304
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,650
No. He's at a conference in Seattle,

305
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,650
and I'm sure totally alone.

306
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,550
Here you are.

307
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,450
You are so...

308
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,550
What are they doing?

309
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,550
Their dad's gay.

310
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,350
BOTH:Hey, Miss Cooper.

311
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,450
I just thought you'd like to know

312
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,750
that I just got called in
to Dean Torres' office,

313
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,550
and because of you, I have
to work the clothing drive.

314
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,550
No way.

315
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,450
That's too funny.

316
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,550
I'm glad you think so.

317
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,650
I'll see you there at 6:00.

318
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,549
What?!

319
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,949
6:00 o'clock. No arguments.

320
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,950
Stop hitting on Mr. Castle.

321
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,250
You're giving away
Ryan's leather jacket?

322
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,450
He's not going
to be happy.

323
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,550
Well, he told me I could.

324
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,150
Wait a minute,

325
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,050
this one's mine.

326
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,950
I love wearing
this jacket.

327
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,650
That's the problem.

328
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,450
They didn't call.

329
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,450
I just... I feel so...

330
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,650
Honey, Seth is going to call back,

331
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,050
and then we'll get
some real information,

332
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,550
and then we can
do something.

333
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,250
I'm going to take this
over to Harbor.

334
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,350
Will you call me
if anything...

335
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,150
Of course.

336
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,750
Do you want your jacket back?

337
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,250
No... but thanks.

338
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,050
Can I give you a hand?

339
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,050
No... but thanks.

340
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,150
SETH:Oh.

341
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,150
So this is what 15 bucks
buys you in Ensenada.

342
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,750
Well, it's only
for a couple hours.

343
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,699
(sighs):And we're here because?

344
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,649
Well, I only know
the bar he works at.

345
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,750
But he only works nights,

346
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,150
and, uh,

347
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,150
I don't want him seeing us
walking around during the day.

348
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,850
Fair enough. I'm going
to use the restroom.

349
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,049
I did not want to go numero
dos in the gas station.

350
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,750
It's all yours.

351
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,450
Wow, the decorator clearly 
spent all her time in here.

352
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,750
Whoa, man, you got to
come see this spider.

353
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,750
It's uh... Ryan, could you bring 
a magazine or a chair, Ryan?

354
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,450
Ryan?

355
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,450
Oh.

356
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,350
Hey, this ain't
the bathroom, man.

357
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,150
You need something?

358
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,450
Does a guy named
Volchok work here?

359
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,350
Used to. Fired his ass.

360
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,550
Yeah? You know
where I can find him?

361
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,250
Yeah, man, let me
check my Rolodex.

362
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,250
Hell, no.
Anybody else know?

363
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,750
Hey, this guy's
looking for Volchok.

364
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,750
You know
where he's at?

365
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,250
The guy's gone.

366
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,250
Maybe you
should be, too.

367
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,650
That's like a hint, bro.

368
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,150
Oh, hi. I'm Taylor.

369
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,550
I'm one of Summer's
friends from Newport.

370
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,850
Amber, Summer's
roommate.

371
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,150
Oh, we must have missed
each other last night.

372
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,950
Yeah, I didn't make it home.

373
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,750
Got ya. College. Very cool.

374
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,550
So, uh,

375
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,950
Summer's really gotten into this

376
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,950
whole green planet thing, huh?

377
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,050
Still, you'd think
she would have

378
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,950
at least one picture 
of her friends, right?

379
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,950
I mean, look 
at your nice collage.

380
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,950
Who are all those guys?

381
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,450
That's my boyfriend.

382
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,250
He goes to Penn.

383
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,250
The others are just guys.

384
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,950
Guys like...?

385
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,450
Oh.

386
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,850
You think I'm a slut, don't you?

387
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,150
No. No, of course not.

388
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,450
Sure you do.

389
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,450
It's not your fault,
it's society.

390
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,850
A guy can sleep with as
many girls as he wants.

391
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,050
A girl does it, she's a slut.

392
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,050
There's three guys
in that picture.

393
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,250
AMBER:Oh, relax.

394
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,150
I put this up 
for my social taboo class

395
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,950
to see how people would respond.

396
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,050
I didn't sleep with them all.

397
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,650
Well, that's a relief.

398
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,550
Most are just oral sex.

399
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,050
Well, that's
a very nice collage.

400
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,850
And it only highlights

401
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,450
how impersonal Summer's side
of the room is.

402
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,150
She doesn't even have a single
 picture of her boyfriend.

403
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,650
Summer has a boyfriend?

404
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,450
You mean Che?

405
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,350
Who's Che?

406
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,150
Well, excuse me.

407
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,550
I-I was...
I was, um...

408
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,250
USMC!

409
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,250
ALL:USMC!

410
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,150
Excuse me, I don't want to...
 I don't want to bother you.

411
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,750
I was just wondering...

412
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,750
What? Stop stuttering.

413
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,350
Okay, uh, a friend
of mine's in trouble,

414
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,750
and I can't leave
without him, so I...

415
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,850
Did you hear what he said?

416
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,050
Uh, you know what? You
guys are busy, so...

417
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,150
Never leave a man behind!

418
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,450
ALL:Never leave a man behind!

419
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,350
Never!

420
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,250
Man.

421
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,450
I love you, man.

422
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,750
Yeah.

423
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,450
We love you.

424
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,450
I love this guy!

425
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,050
We're doing shots!

426
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,550
ALL:Shots!Time! 

427
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,150
I got to find my buddy,

428
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,550
so why don't you guys do shots?

429
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,150
First we do shots.

430
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,150
Then we find your friend.

431
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,450
I mean, we're brothers, right?

432
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,050
Oh, well, that's a
little fast, but...

433
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,350
And then we get tattoos!

434
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,650
ALL:Tattoos!

435
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,550
Great. This is
great. This is...

436
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,050
Aah!

437
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,350
KAITLIN:Mom, I mean it.

438
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,450
I really have to go study.

439
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,250
Please, honey.

440
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,050
At least come up
with an excuse I believe.

441
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,350
This is nice.

442
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,650
So why don't you try it on?

443
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,350
Because it's not a sample sale,

444
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,650
Kaitlin, it's for the refugees.

445
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,350
The very lucky refugees.

446
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,350
Tell me about it.

447
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,850
KIRSTEN:Oh, hi, Julie.

448
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,950
I didn't know you
were doing this.

449
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,550
Hey, Kirsten.

450
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,350
Well, you know,
got to stay involved.

451
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,050
But look at you.

452
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,850
I mean, your kids don't
even go here anymore.

453
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,850
Right.

454
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,850
Something wrong?

455
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,850
The boys went
to Mexico without asking us.

456
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,250
I'm sure they're
fine, but...

457
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,050
Wait. Seth went, too? Why...?

458
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,750
I mean, he just doesn't seem
like Mr. Donkey show.

459
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,250
Not that they're
at a donkey show,

460
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,850
or-or even know
what-what a donkey show...

461
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,350
Have you seen how great some
of these clothes are?

462
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,550
Excuse me.

463
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,350
What's a donkey show?

464
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,350
That's a question
for your mother.

465
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,950
Hello?

466
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,250
He wasn't there.

467
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,950
What?

468
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,150
He got fired.

469
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,350
Nobody knows where he is.

470
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,350
But he was supposed to be there.
He has to be there.

471
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,350
Uh, I'll keep looking.I'll call
 you if I find anything.

472
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,750
I hope everything's okay.

473
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,950
Maybe it was just Dr. Roberts.

474
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,950
He could have some
bad news or something.

475
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,550
Move it, hippies.

476
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,050
CHE:And in the Himalayan
kingdom of Bhutan,

477
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,050
they don't even have a
gross national product.

478
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,150
They measure gross
national happiness.

479
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,550
Isn't that
just beautiful?

480
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,650
Taylor, hey. Uh,

481
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,550
you can have my bed tonight,

482
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,350
'cause I'm going
to spend the night out here.

483
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,650
Uh-huh. I need to talk to you.

484
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,499
Wait. Taylor, hold.

485
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,100
Can't your secret wait?

486
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,350
This isn't
about that, Summer.

487
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,950
What is going on with you
and that Che character?

488
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,250
That Che character?

489
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,550
What are you talking about?

490
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,450
I have eyes, Summer, and ears,

491
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,150
and I don't like what I'm
hearing, or what I'm seeing.

492
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,750
Okay, maybe that makes sense
in French,

493
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,050
but not so much in English.

494
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,050
Have you called Seth back?

495
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,750
(scoffs):You haven't, have you?

496
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,650
Summer, uh,

497
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,850
my chains are coming loose.

498
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,850
I'll call him later, okay?

499
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,850
I'm busy.

500
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,950
You need to talk to him now.

501
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,150
Look, they're going to
cut down this tree, Taylor!

502
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,950
Well, then we'll have a fire.

503
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,950
Talk to him.

504
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,950
Unless you're afraid that
Johnny Appleseed might overhear.

505
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,050
Hello?

506
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,150
Seth?

507
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,550
It's some Mexican guy. Happy?

508
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,050
What?

509
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,250
Seth?

510
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,450
??

511
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,360
??

512
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,150
ALL (chanting):USMC! USMC!
USMC! USMC!

513
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,750
You drink now, pansy!

514
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,950
Oh, this is good.
Double Bob.

515
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,850
You're staying
with us, pal.

516
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,650
You ain't going anywhere.

517
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,450
Mmm.

518
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,450
One more shot.
One more shot.

519
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,350
You're about to do that shot,

520
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,550
or there's going to be about
six marines kicking your ass.

521
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,350
MEN (chanting):USMC! USMC!

522
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,850
Wait. Maybe just one more shot.

523
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,650
SANDY:We're doing the right thing
in trusting them.

524
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,250
I know.

525
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,250
They're adults.

526
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,750
We couldn't have
stopped them if we tried.

527
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,550
I know.

528
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,350
I'm going to Mexico.

529
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,350
I'm going with you.

530
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,450
Uh, excuse me.

531
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,550
What do you want?

532
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,150
Nothing, actually.

533
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,950
18 tequilas
is my limit.

534
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,850
I'm looking for my friend Ryan.

535
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,150
Uh, he's-he's about...
He's about...

536
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,050
He's in there
somewhere,

537
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,150
and he's... and he's looking
for a guy named Volchok.

538
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,650
He kind of
killed his girlfriend.

539
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,850
Leave.

540
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,050
I've got a tattoo, pal.

541
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,250
A tattoo!
Now!

542
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,750
Okay.

543
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,250
Hey.

544
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,250
Your friend was here earlier.

545
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,350
You know where he went?

546
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,350
Because that guy in there was,
like, very unhelpful.

547
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,250
Is that true?

548
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,250
That Volchok killed a girl?

549
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,550
Yes.

550
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,550
I know where he is.

551
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,450
So now what?

552
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,850
Ryan's not answering
his phone,

553
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,450
and we keep getting that Mexican 
guy every time you call Seth.

554
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,250
Well, at least we know
our phones work here.

555
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,050
So they can reach us.

556
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,750
I say we just start
pounding the pavement,

557
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,050
or the-the dirt,as the case may be.

558
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,550
Were we crazy coming here?

559
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,250
Driving all night
into a foreign country

560
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,550
where neither of us 
speak the language

561
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,950
and where we only have a vague
notion of-of where they are?

562
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,250
Yeah, that's
a little crazy.

563
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,550
How much longer
do we keep doing this?

564
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,850
Rescuing them every time
they're in trouble.

565
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,650
Oh, I don't know.

566
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,850
But for now,

567
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,850
I think that's our job.

568
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,750
I want you to know that I took
two semesters of Spanish.

569
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,250
Well, then you
can be our tour guide.

570
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,850
Hi. Hi.

571
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,350
Um, do you, uh...

572
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,050
I'm so thirsty.

573
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,350
Did you see my friend come
in last night by any chance?

574
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,450
I'm in the room without windows.

575
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,950
Well, how many rooms do you have
without windows?

576
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,850
I see.

577
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,350
Um, could I place a call
to America, please?

578
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,650
(speaking Spanish):Lo se, Miguel,

579
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,850
 pero alomejor Maria solo

580
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,050
 esta pasando por una etapa.
Si.

581
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,950
Uh, me-me tengo que ir.

582
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,550
Who are you
talking to?

583
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,550
Oh, Miguel.

584
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,150
The guy with Seth's phone.

585
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,050
He is having problems
with his girlfriend.

586
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,150
Taylor...

587
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,250
Where you going?

588
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,650
Back to Newport.

589
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,550
I realized that my problems
are not going to be solved here.

590
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,650
Because the truth is,

591
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,950
you need help
far more than I do.

592
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,250
Hmm.

593
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,350
God, have you ever tried
sleeping outside?

594
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,350
There is so much grass and you
can't turn off the stars.

595
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,950
Look, you want to be the next
Julia Butterfly Hill,

596
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,350
I support that.

597
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,050
But to push away
Seth for some guy

598
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,150
who read Siddhartha

599
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,550
and did a couple of
 outward bound courses.

600
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,950
Are you talking about Che?

601
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,550
Che is just my friend
and that is all.

602
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,750
This is not a love triangle.

603
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,850
I don't do love triangles
anymore.

604
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,950
Fine, but you're using him

605
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,650
and all of this save 
the Earth stuff to hide from Seth.

606
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,250
I'm not hiding from Seth.

607
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,450
Really?

608
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,450
Well, how often do you call him?

609
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,750
Once a week?

610
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,750
Once a month?

611
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,850
Summer, just talk to me.

612
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,050
Or better yet, talk to Seth.

613
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,250
Write him a letter.

614
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,350
But you have to tell him
what you're going through.

615
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,250
He'll understand.

616
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,450
I think you spent too much time
in France,

617
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,450
because here in America,

618
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,250
we hide our feelings.

619
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,750
And since when did saving the
Earth become such a bad thing?

620
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,350
I never said that.

621
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,850
No, but you came here 
with this big secret,

622
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,550
but you've spent 
the whole time telling me

623
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,750
what's wrong with my life!

624
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,150
And you're the one that's
avoiding, avoider!

625
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,950
Be that way.

626
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,650
But you're going
to lose Seth.

627
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,950
And then you'll wish
you listened to me.

628
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,950
And I was going to tell you how
I went to France, got married,

629
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,150
and now I have to get a divorce
from my French husband,

630
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,350
and you would have
found the story

631
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,350
 très intéressant.

632
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,150
 Au revoir, Summer.

633
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,250
Hey, where did this stupid
 espresso machine come from anyway?

634
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,050
It's a gift!

635
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,750
Hey.

636
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,850
I couldn't find your toothbrush.

637
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,650
Uh, just don't leave.

638
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,150
So did you kill him?

639
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,450
I mean, that was the plan,
right?

640
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,250
The real plan.

641
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,450
Not the lie you told me
when you said trust me, man?

642
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,550
You-you don't understand.

643
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,950
The guy killed Marissa,
you loved her.

644
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,150
What don't I understand?

645
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,250
No one made you come.

646
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,350
You think I want to be here?

647
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,250
Summer came back
for the first time in months,

648
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,450
left without saying good-bye.

649
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,350
I could be losing her right now.

650
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,350
All right, go home.

651
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,150
That is not the point.

652
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,450
I didn't find him.

653
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,150
Good, great, then let's both
go home together.

654
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,950
And I'm not leaving
until I find him.

655
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,750
So then,

656
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,750
what are you going to do, you
going to stay here forever?

657
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,850
You going to live
in Ensenada?

658
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,050
You going to
open a piñataria?

659
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,550
Huh?

660
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,350
You going to open
a burrito stand?

661
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:33,950
(sighs):You know what, fine,

662
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,450
if I tell you where he is,
you promise not to kill him?

663
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,850
What?

664
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,050
I went to the bar
last night--

665
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,449
I guess one you'd
already been to--

666
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,450
and apparently the waitress
and Volchok had had a thing...

667
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,350
Where is he?

668
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,650
Do you promise
not to do anything?

669
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,150
I'm gonna ask you
one more time-- where is he?

670
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,750
Drop the watermelon, dirtbag!

671
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,750
I will shoot you!

672
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,350
What are you watching?

673
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,650
 TV's Dumbest Cops.

674
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,750
Are people in America
really this fat?

675
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,450
You haven't moved in 18 hours.

676
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,450
Is everything okay?

677
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,450
Fine.

678
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,150
The world is
an amoral toilet bowl,

679
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,150
and one day
we'll all be flushed.

680
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,150
Okay, wow.

681
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,150
That was a really uplifting
message for your daughter.

682
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,350
It's better you know now.

683
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,150
Okay.

684
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,250
I'm just gonna go
to the clothing drive.

685
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,650
Why?

686
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,050
Because,
believe it or not,

687
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,050
I actually want a life.

688
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,750
Right now that
means school

689
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,550
and a stupid clothing drive.

690
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,450
So I suck it up.

691
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,450
You know,
some of us are still alive.

692
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,450
I need to talk to you.

693
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,150
Now, this is a surprise.

694
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,250
You alone?

695
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,750
Yeah.

696
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,250
How'd you find me?

697
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,850
The girl you...
worked with,

698
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,650
the waitress at the bar.

699
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,150
Right.

700
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,150
Yeah, her boyfriend
wants to kill me.

701
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,050
Well, he's gonna
have to get in line--

702
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,850
Ryan's in Ensenada.

703
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,150
You didn't tell him where I was?

704
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:09,950
I thought about it,

705
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,950
but in the end
I gave him the wrong address.

706
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,250
Why you looking out for me?

707
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,550
I'm not. I just
don't want Ryan

708
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,550
to ruin his life
by murdering you.

709
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,850
I'm touched.

710
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,150
So, you just taking off?

711
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,550
Isn't that
why you're here?

712
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,750
Warn me to get out of town?

713
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,050
He's gonna find you again.

714
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,750
Maybe.

715
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,850
So, what, then...

716
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,150
you keep running,
he keeps chasing you,

717
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,450
best-case scenario, you do that
for the rest of your lives?

718
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,750
Till I get tired
of running, yeah.

719
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,950
You should turn yourself in.

720
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,750
(chuckles):There's an idea.

721
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,850
My dad's a lawyer-- he could
help you get a good deal.

722
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,050
It'd still be prison.

723
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,350
He could make sure
you're in a safe place.

724
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,950
You know, this reunion
has been great, it really has.

725
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,750
But... I got to go.

726
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,450
You can't keep
running from this.

727
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,950
Let's see if your boy
can find me again.

728
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,150
I'm not talking about Ryan.

729
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,950
You should let my dad help you.

730
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,050
You didn't mean to kill her.

731
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,850
I know. But she's dead.

732
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,850
That's all that matters.

733
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,850
Seth set me up, didn't he?

734
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,750
He called; he was worried.

735
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,150
Come on, let's go home.

736
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,750
Why? So we can pretend like
 everything's the way it used to be?

737
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,650
We all miss her.

738
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,550
It's never gonna be the way
that it used to be.

739
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,850
But we are still a family.

740
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,250
You don't understand. He's here.

741
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,850
SETH:No.

742
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,350
He's gone.

743
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,550
Taylor?

744
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,150
Don't worry,

745
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,250
Summer, I'm leaving.

746
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,650
I was just postponing the trauma
of going though security.

747
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,350
Look, I'm... I'm so sorry.

748
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,350
Oh, my God, I am, too.

749
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,850
Oh, I don't want
to fight with you.

750
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,850
Even if you are all
gross and smelly.

751
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,350
And you can show up
on my doorstep anytime.

752
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,950
And how you live your life
is your business.

753
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,650
No, you were right.

754
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,650
You are in love with Che?

755
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,550
No.

756
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,850
No, about the Seth thing.

757
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,750
I have been pulling away.

758
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,550
It's just...

759
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,350
Summer, I understand.

760
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,350
But Seth will, too.

761
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,350
Just try.

762
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,950
So when you said
that, uh, you got married,

763
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,950
did that mean that, um...

764
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,350
Yeah, um, I am now Madame
Taylor Townsend DeMemorol.

765
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,950
Oh, my God. But how?

766
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,650
I keep asking myself
the same question.

767
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,550
I-I met him,
and the next thing I knew,

768
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,550
we were in his family's chapel
in Burgundy saying...

769
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,450
I remember telling Ethan Hawke
at the rehearsal dinner...

770
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,850
Ethan Hawke was
at your rehearsal dinner?

771
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,750
Oh, yes. Henri Michel 
translated one of his novels

772
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,550
into French as a 
joke, of course,

773
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,550
but don't tell
Ethan that.

774
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,650
Um, I got to go.

775
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,850
But Taylor, you got married.

776
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,350
It was Paris.

777
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,450
It seemed like the thing to do.

778
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,550
Okay, promise me
you'll write to Seth?

779
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,550
Okay, see you
at Thanksgiving.
Bye.

780
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,250
Oh, by the way,

781
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,350
your roommate is a big slut.

782
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,350
Yeah, I know.

783
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,650
Okay.
Will you guys hurry up?

784
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,950
Check out these awesome
leather jackets we found.

785
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,750
Your dad would be
extremely proud.

786
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,550
Now can we go?

787
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,050
JULIE:Kaitlin?

788
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,950
Mom.

789
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,450
What are you doing here?

790
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:54,250
Well, uh, what you said earlier
struck a nerve.

791
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,550
Life might
be difficult,

792
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,950
but it's our job to
make the best of it.

793
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,050
You inspired me.

794
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,050
So, what are you doing?

795
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,850
How can I help?

796
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,550
Um, well, the school promised

797
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,250
a local shelter some clothes,

798
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,350
so we're just
bringing them over

799
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,250
But I think we have it handled.

800
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,150
Yeah, we got it.

801
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,350
Thanks, Miss Cooper.

802
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:12,950
Oh, okay.

803
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,350
Julie,

804
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,950
I'm glad you're here.

805
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,750
Can I talk to
you for a second?

806
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,450
Mm-hmm. Okay.

807
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,450
I don't know how to say this,

808
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,150
but this afternoon

809
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,750
Amy Bennett found two tops

810
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,750
she donated at a used
clothing boutique.

811
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,450
Amy Bennett buys used clothing?

812
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,050
Julie, someone has
been stealing clothes

813
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,750
from the drive and selling them.

814
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,750
But who would do...?

815
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,650
Oh, no.

816
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,950
Oh, crap.

817
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,350
SUMMER: "Dear, Seth,

818
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,150
 I know you think I've changed,

819
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,950
 and I'm avoiding you..."

820
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,750
 "Dear, Seth..."

821
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,650
 "Dear, Seth,

822
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,350
 the reason I've been
 so distant is that..."

823
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,250
  "The truth is..."00:35:21.3: "The truth is..."

824
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,150
Seth, I still love you.

825
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,150
I really, really still love you.

826
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,950
I just can't...

827
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,150
(sighs):Oh, I just can't.

828
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,750
Thanks for driving.

829
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,950
I didn't get much sleep
last night.

830
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,950
Yeah, no problem.

831
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,350
You did the right thing, Seth.

832
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,650
You mean, betraying
my best friend

833
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,950
by ratting him out
to my parents?

834
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,350
You might have saved
his life today.

835
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,350
And sooner or later,
he's going to realize that.

836
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,550
You okay? You hungry?

837
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,550
This was my worst nightmare,

838
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,150
when you first came
to live with us,

839
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,950
that Seth would follow you
somewhere and get hurt.

840
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,750
I know, I shouldn't have
taken him, I'm sorry.

841
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,750
What I was going to say,

842
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,550
all that's changed is now I have
two children to worry about.

843
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,750
Summer, hey,

844
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,650
I am so...

845
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,450
Glad to see me? I know.

846
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,250
Um, I made wheat grass soup 
so we can stay out there

847
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,250
 all night if have to.

848
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,650
Where you going? We
have a tree to save.

849
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,750
Whoa, Summer, slow down.

850
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,150
But there's no time.
There's no time for anything.

851
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,150
We have to save this tree.

852
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,750
But we did.

853
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,850
The dean just came by.

854
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,850
They're not going to cut
the tree down. We won.

855
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,450
I can't believe this.

856
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,750
Oh, I get your point. What if
they go back on their word?

857
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,950
I told them we'd be watching.

858
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,350
Like a hawk over
the Serengeti,

859
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,550
we'll be watching, so I think

860
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,950
our friend is safe for now.

861
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,050
So, that's it?

862
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,250
Well, I mean, can't we just
go out there anyway?

863
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,050
Oh, I get it.

864
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,450
Why are we only with our tree
friends in times of danger?

865
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,050
We should be with them
in times of joy, too.

866
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,250
Exactly.

867
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,250
That's exactly what I mean.
Yeah.

868
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,250
I could learn a lot
from you, Summer Roberts.

869
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,050
Yeah.

870
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,150
Oh, my gosh.

871
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,150
Yeah, I know.

872
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,050
It... Some marines
were helping me look for Ryan.

873
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,750
It was a bonding thing.

874
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,850
(laughing):Wow. It's-It's-It's...

875
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,850
You know,
the artwork is really good.

876
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,750
What's this...

877
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,950
What's this say beneath?

878
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,050
Uh, Senorita Vixen.

879
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,750
One of the marines got one, too.

880
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,150
He thought it was pretty cool.

881
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,750
(laughs):You know, it does
have a certain...

882
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,450
Gay vibe. Were you going
to say gay vibe?

883
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,450
Exactly.

884
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,950
Let's see
what Summer has to say.

885
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,050
You know, the one thing
I keep thinking about...

886
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,650
...is how Ryan could have found
Volchok in the first place.

887
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,350
Oh, please, just leave me
out of it.

888
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,550
It would have taken
a private investigator,

889
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,650
which means money.

890
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,650
And any way I cut it,

891
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,650
it leads back
to just one person.

892
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,750
JULIE: There'll be no more hanging out
with Brad and Eric.

893
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,350
You're to come
straight home after school.

894
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,150
Do you have any idea

895
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,250
how lucky you arethat
 Dean Torres didn't expel you?

896
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,550
Mom, this whole thing
is just a crock anyway.

897
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,150
And how is that?

898
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,850
Do you really think
that Sudanese refugees

899
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,650
have an overwhelming need
for Paul Frank tops

900
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,950
and last season
Manolo Blahniks?

901
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,750
So, what, you think
you can steal them?

902
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,150
Look, I did research on the Web.

903
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,850
They have mountains
of donate clothing

904
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,750
in warehouses
in New Jersey.

905
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,550
They have all
they've ever needed.

906
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,050
You just made that up.

907
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,250
Maybe.

908
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,150
But it sounded true, didn't it?

909
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,550
Kaitlin...

910
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,550
...I can't do this.

911
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,750
I can't...

912
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,350
I can't keep this family
together

913
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,350
and have you running around
like Miss Clockwork Orange. I...

914
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,950
I can't.

915
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,450
Honey, please.

916
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:37,150
I need your help.

917
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,150
Mom, do you really think
that Dr. Roberts is

918
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:44,250
at that conference by himself?

919
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,050
No, of course not.

920
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,250
Look, maybe I can make you
some ice cream...

921
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,050
if you want.

922
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,350
That would be nice.

923
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,950
Just hold on.

924
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,750
Hello?

925
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,150
Yes, of course.

926
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,850
I'll be right there.

927
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,650
Honey, I have to step out
for a minute.

928
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,050
Take a rain check, okay?

929
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,850
Okay.

930
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,450
Sandy, what is it?

931
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,050
You said it was important.

932
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:42,950
I thought you
might want to know

933
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,950
that Ryan and Seth
are back home,

934
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,250
that Volchok's
disappeared.

935
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,450
What are you talking about?

936
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,250
Stop it.

937
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,850
You told Ryan where
to find Volchok.

938
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,350
Even for you,

939
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,950
this is a new low.

940
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,950
Okay, you know what?

941
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,750
You're crazy.

942
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,250
I'm just going
to say good night.

943
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,350
You sent Ryan down there
to commit a murder.

944
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,150
I could have you arrested.

945
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,050
But then you'd
get Ryan arrested,

946
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,750
and you're not going
to do that, are you?

947
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,350
If anything had happened
to him or to Seth...

948
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,450
Okay, it's late, and I'm not
in the mood for threats.

949
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,450
Sit down.

950
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,050
After everything our
families have been through,

951
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,150
you would put
our kids in danger?

952
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,650
At least you still
have all your kids.

953
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,350
Hey.

954
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,150
How was your drive?

955
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,550
Quiet. Yours?

956
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,650
We got stopped at the border.

957
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,650
I think they had a picture
of dad from his long-hair days.

958
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,150
Did he say anything
about me?

959
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,650
Maybe a rant about Judas?

960
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,850
Of course not.

961
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,850
You okay?

962
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:18,150
Yeah. It's just been
a long couple of days.

963
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,650
But I'm really
glad you're home.

964
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:39,750
