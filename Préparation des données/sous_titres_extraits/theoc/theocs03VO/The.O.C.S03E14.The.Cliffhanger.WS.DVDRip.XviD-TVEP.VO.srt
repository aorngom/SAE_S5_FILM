<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,757
Do you think that Marissa would mind
if I invited Johnny?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,951
She seemed a little weird
when she saw us together last night.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,718
But they're just friends,
so why would it matter?

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,355
I love Ryan.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,471
- It doesn't mean you don't like Johnny.
- I don't.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,877
Then you wouldn't mind
that I just made out with him upstairs.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,957
We both have very complex lives...

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,755
...and maybe we should consider
all the implications before going further.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,029
Are we building a hospital?

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,629
- Is it too late for a new approach?
- Let's do it your way.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,400
You're trying to take care of me.
The least I can do is take care of you.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,830
- Caleb would've been proud.
- We got it.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,798
Sandy, that's wonderful.
And you did it your way.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,228
Yeah.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,873
Cohen! I got one.

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,038
An interview with the Brown guy.
Rushfield told me, and you got one too.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,434
Please tell me it went okay.

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,915
It went great. We totally bonded.

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,548
Are you high?

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,948
Am I high?

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,518
Ryan. Ryan. Come on, wake up.

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,035
- Hi. What's wrong?
- Seth is gone.

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,518
- What? He's gone?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,956
His alarm went off, I went into
his room, his bed is empty.

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,798
- Calc exam.
- Calc exam?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,754
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He probably just
went in early to school, cram for it.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,111
- I'm gonna drive there to make sure.
- No, no, I'll go. I'll go.

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,872
I gotta get to school early anyway.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,476
If there was anything going on
with Seth, anything I should know...

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,114
...you would tell me, right?

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,392
Yeah. I'll call you when I find him.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,192
Hey, man.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,670
So Sandy noticed you're gone.
He's worried.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,833
- Just taking in the sunrise, Ryan.
- That's what they got windows for.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,231
So I wanted to be alone. Are you
the only one that's allowed to brood?

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,511
Man, whatever it is, you can tell me.

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,312
My Brown interview did not go so well.
Actually, it didn't go at all.

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,196
- You blew it off?
- Yep.

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,710
Then to put the cherry on top, I went
ahead and lied to Summer about it.

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,239
Right.

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,195
Well, I don't know, talk to her.

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,834
Yeah, it's just, Summer was
over pot by the 10th grade.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,117
She thinks it's juvenile. It's like
telling her I'm into Beanie Babies.

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,316
At least tell her
you missed the interview.

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,675
You do that, and I'll keep quiet
about the rest.

47
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,474
We're getting dangerously close
to an after-school special.

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,993
It's marijuana, I did it twice.

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,152
So you're telling me you didn't
come down here to buy a bag?

50
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,471
Fine, I wasn't gonna
smoke anymore anyways.

51
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,273
- What are you doing?
- Trying to decide on a bathing suit.

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,036
- Do you think tankinis are over?
- You're going swimming?

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,272
No. Johnny's taking me
for a surf lesson.

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,312
Says the waves are best
in the morning.

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,951
That's what I hear.

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,873
Look, I know that you're mad
about me and Johnny.

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,355
I'm not mad. Do I look mad?

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,357
Okay, we may not be BFFs...

59
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,080
...but you're my sister,
and I can tell when you're mad.

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,599
Kaitlin, look in my eyes.
I don't care about you and Johnny.

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,117
You have a boyfriend.
So Johnny Harper's fair game, right?

62
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,508
I'm not talking about this.

63
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,792
Can you honestly tell me
you have no feelings for him?

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,952
That's what I thought.

65
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,759
Hey. You're right on time.

66
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,480
Sorry, I didn't mean
to walk in on anything.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,837
- No problem. You ready to surf?
- I gotta go. Enjoy the beach.

68
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,672
Katie Rubel, 39, single.
Loves tennis, loves working out.

69
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,593
- Do we have anyone for her?
- I say she dies alone.

70
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,758
- Julie.
- I'm sorry.

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,959
I just can't focus on fixing other people's
love lives when my own is such a mess.

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,153
Dr. Roberts will call you.
Or if you want, you could call him.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,751
I know you've been married
for 200 years...

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,115
...but you must remember
something about dating.

75
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,430
Well, I hope so,
or I'm in the wrong business.

76
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,472
Maybe that's the answer.

77
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,108
Pitch Dr. Roberts the dating service,
set him up.

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,390
- Set him up? Are you high?
- No, I'm serious.

79
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,109
Then you'll be back on his radar, and
it won't seem like you're pursuing him.

80
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,159
I like it. I'm aloof, but thoughtful.

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,709
When he confronts the idea
of dating these Newpsies...

82
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,472
Half of whom he's botoxed himself.

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,154
- he will realize that the only woman
he wants is you.

84
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,039
- And he will call you for dinner.
- I'll suggest Al Forno's.

85
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,599
A table by the window.

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,238
I'm impressed. You're sneakier
than I thought, Kirsten Cohen.

87
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,238
Well, being around you
all these years, it's rubbed off.

88
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,593
- Hey.
- Hey, Cohen.

89
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,911
Hey, did you write your thank-you note
yet to the Brown interviewer?

90
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,878
No, actually, that's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

91
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,396
You came to the right person, because
I am master of the thank-you note.

92
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,788
Listen to this.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,434
"Thank you so much
for the resplendent interview."

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,273
- Resplendent?
- Yeah. I bought a thesaurus.

95
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,317
Shelley loves SAT words.

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,995
I didn't know you two
were on a first-name basis.

97
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,599
Oh, yeah, we totally power-bonded.

98
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,194
Which means I may have
a chance of getting into Brown.

99
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,954
You know what that means?
No calling, texting, e-mailing.

100
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,554
- Just us together. Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

101
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,190
So tell me, how did your interview
really go? Do you think you aced it?

102
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,791
- I knocked it out of the park.
- Really?

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,594
Yeah, yeah, and it wasn't easy,
believe me.

104
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,878
But, you know, I turned on
the Cohen charm, as usual...

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,429
...and the lady swooned.

106
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,359
- Cohen.
- Yeah.

107
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,431
Shelley's a guy.

108
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,314
Is it because...? Yes, yes.
You're... I'm sorry. Correct.

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,715
But with a feminine energy.
I got a gay vibe.

110
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,472
I'm gender-blind, that's the thing.

111
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,949
That's something that I'm gonna
have to work on...

112
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,350
...at Brown, next year,
when we go together.

113
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,555
When we go together.

114
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,790
- I'm gonna see you later. I gotta go.
- Cohen.

115
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,473
We'll talk after school.

116
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,231
Wow, somebody was
really craving caffeine.

117
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,789
Yeah. I can barely keep my eyes open.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,150
Early-morning wake-up call,
courtesy of Seth.

119
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,920
- Oh, has he told Summer yet?
- No, and he's not going to.

120
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,799
By the way, I promised that
we'd keep quiet about it...

121
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,030
...as long as he told her
about the interview.

122
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,636
I was looking forward to Summer
bitch-slapping Kaitlin for giving Seth pot.

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,439
- Gonna get away with it, like always.
- Maybe that's best.

124
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,279
I mean, she screwed up,
but she's still pretty much a kid.

125
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,237
Yeah, but with my mom's DNA.

126
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,868
Which means she's capable
of more than you think.

127
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,518
- Are we still talking about Seth?
- This is just sister stuff.

128
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,120
You know, I should probably
get to class. See you later.

129
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,759
Okay.

130
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,593
It's just sister stuff?

131
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,035
Okay, let's practice your pop-up
one more time.

132
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,073
When you told me you were
gonna give me a surfing lesson...

133
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,992
...I kind of imagined us in the water.

134
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,589
No, no. First lesson's
always on the sand.

135
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,548
As long as we're skipping the water
part, let's do this back at your place.

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,111
Or we could just blow the whole thing
off. Rent a movie, order in pancakes.

137
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,591
You said you wanted
to learn how to surf.

138
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,035
I'm not training
for the Olympics, okay?

139
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,559
I'm sorry. I'm just distracted.

140
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,995
Thinking about Marissa.

141
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,434
Story of my life.

142
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,592
I like a guy, he's in love
with my older sister.

143
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,554
Look, Marissa and I have
a history together, all right?

144
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,793
- It's just complicated.
- Uncomplicate it.

145
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,236
- Do something.
- I can't do anything. It's not my place.

146
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,315
If you're too lame to do something,
I'll just find somebody who will.

147
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,198
I thought this was a done deal.
Merriam gave us the contract.

148
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,079
He did. Now he has to present it
to the board of physicians.

149
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,437
Can't have a hospital without doctors.
Like it or not, they got a say.

150
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,149
Oh, great. Now we have to ply
more people with women and liquor.

151
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,357
I don't think that's gonna work.
They're doctors, not businessmen.

152
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,748
Then we got that in common.

153
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,639
Call it willful naiveté,
call it bleary-eyed optimism.

154
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,671
- You think we've got a shot?
- Yeah.

155
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,913
There's over 100,000 uninsured
that live in Orange County.

156
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,029
There's got to be some angle we can
find to make that land on these guys.

157
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,717
Well, there is.
The head of the board, Henry Griffin...

158
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,917
Turns out we have
a personal connection.

159
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,436
Well, now, there's a shocking
turn of events.

160
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,875
- It's his daughter, Maya.
- She's a stripper too?

161
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,750
No, she was a year
ahead of me at Kellogg.

162
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,071
Now she's his most trusted adviser.
She used to have a thing for me.

163
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,835
Well, who could blame her?
So now you wanna wine and dine her.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,309
Use her affection for you
to manipulate her father.

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,517
Listen, it's no worse than the strippers
we got for Bill Merriam.

166
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,955
Oh, I don't know.
I draw the line at family, Matt.

167
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,189
How about this?

168
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,150
How about we find a strategy that
doesn't involve liquor or sexual favors?

169
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,195
Thank you. I mean, <i>gracias.</i>

170
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,158
- Julie.
- Hi.

171
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,550
Your receptionist told me
you'd be home today...

172
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,672
...so I thought I'd come by
and personally thank you...

173
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,711
...for hosting Kaitlin's birthday party.

174
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,678
And as a token of my appreciation:

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,228
"Bachelorettes of Newport"?

176
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,239
- You wanna set me up?
- Well, unless you don't wanna be set up.

177
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,037
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.

178
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,233
Because I can totally understand
if a blind date seems like too much.

179
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,676
Let's see what you have there.

180
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,230
- NewMatch. Wow, she's pretty.
- Pear-shaped, but pretty.

181
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,356
- Look at her. Nice smile.
- Yeah. Adult braces.

182
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,959
And her.

183
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,835
Julie, all of these women
look fantastic.

184
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,749
It's gonna take me a while to choose
one. Mind if I get back to you?

185
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,915
Finally. You're home.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?

186
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,548
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were waiting for me.

187
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,554
Well, I just get kind of Ionely
while you guys are all at school.

188
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,598
Speaking of school, shouldn't you be
going back to yours soon?

189
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,072
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's called mid-winter break. It's long.

190
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,312
- Apparently.
- Look, I wanna talk to you about Marissa.

191
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,029
This whole Johnny triangle
we're all trapped in.

192
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,679
Triangle?

193
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,308
Now that I'm here,
it's more like a square.

194
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,831
Well, anyway, see, I like him.

195
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,635
And I'm not getting anywhere because
he thinks he's got a chance with Marissa.

196
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,717
Well, not that that's any of your
business, but it's not the case.

197
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,590
I don't know. See, today I asked her
if she had feelings for him, point-blank.

198
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,957
She didn't deny it.

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,878
Thanks for the heads-up.
Marissa and I can handle it ourselves.

200
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,439
So if you just wanna...

201
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,068
Ryan, I want you
to do something about it.

202
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,796
I mean, you're a man of action.
You throw punches, set fires.

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,036
That's the guy I remember
from two years ago.

204
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,749
- We've all grown up since then.
- You're reformed now. Congratulations.

205
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,833
- Doesn't mean you still can't talk to her.
- So you can hook up with Johnny?

206
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,549
You get something out of it too.
You get to find out where you stand.

207
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,354
Once and for all.

208
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,350
Ryan, hey. Is everything okay?

209
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,272
You sounded really weird
on the phone.

210
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,396
I need to know how you feel
about Johnny.

211
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,717
- So I take it Kaitlin paid you a visit.
- This isn't about Kaitlin.

212
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,196
We both knew this was an issue
long before she showed up.

213
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,751
- I'm with you.
- But that's not the whole story, is it?

214
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,315
Look, maybe you just
feel sorry for him.

215
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,837
Or maybe sometimes you didn't think
you could talk to me...

216
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,071
...or I wasn't listening.

217
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,230
Or maybe you're in love with him.

218
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,993
Either way, you gotta figure it out.
Until then, I don't wanna see you.

219
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,071
Look, I know things
have been confusing...

220
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,354
Hey. Morning.

221
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,428
Oh, no, the Atwood grunt.
That's never a good sign.

222
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,831
What's the matter?
Let me guess, Marissa or Johnny.

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,834
Maybe Kaitlin. I'm gonna say
probably a combo platter.

224
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,157
- I think Marissa and I are on thin ice.
- No.

225
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,318
She needs to figure out her
relationship with Johnny, pronto.

226
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,472
She's got good taste in people.
I'm sure she'll do the right thing.

227
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,557
Speaking of the right thing...

228
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,879
- I tried to talk to Summer.
- And?

229
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,838
I chickened out. Which is kind of
my go-to move these days.

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,833
But I'm gonna take care of it,
I'm rescheduling the interview.

231
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,554
Think they'll let you
after you blew the first one off?

232
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,234
Well, for the first one,
I had an epileptic fit.

233
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,752
There was a three-car pileup on the
freeway with a jackknifed truck, so...

234
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,034
- All right, I'll work on my excuse.
- That's a good idea.

235
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,074
<i>And, Rita, when did you first find out</i>
<i>that he was cheating on you?</i>

236
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,959
- <i>You mean, the first time?</i>
- Oh, Kaitlin, you're up.

237
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,951
I was just making some grits.

238
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,476
Okay, Mom, we get it.
We live in a trailer park.

239
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,679
- There's no need to go overboard.
- Marissa, you want some?

240
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,308
- I'm not hungry.
- Fine.

241
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,274
I'll go see if Gus likes these.
I mean, he does eat pigeons after all.

242
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,078
Be right back.

243
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,480
I'd kill for some Apple Jacks.
Do you think we have any?

244
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,235
Kaitlin, you had no right to talk to Ryan
about my relationship with Johnny.

245
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,960
- It's none of your business.
- I was sharing my opinion.

246
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,876
What did I ever do to you? I mean,
I know Mom ignores you and Dad left...

247
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,919
- Let's not turn this into family therapy.
- Let's not pretend it's all about Johnny.

248
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,635
- What else would this be about?
- You're doing this to punish me.

249
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,110
You know, I was happy
when you came home.

250
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,193
I thought we were gonna be friends. But
now I just can't wait for you to leave.

251
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,992
Summer. I just got off the phone
with Mr. Spivey from Brown.

252
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,470
- Looks like you've got a fan.
- Oh, great.

253
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,234
I was just curious, did he mention
how it went with Seth?

254
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,515
Seth Cohen?

255
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,517
Yeah. Gangly, mop head,
barely has an ass.

256
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,076
Right. Unfortunately,
Seth missed his interview.

257
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,959
- What?
- He was a no-show.

258
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,071
He was just here
explaining the situation.

259
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,151
Something about a
tractor-trailer accident.

260
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,232
- Oh, my God, that little bitch.
- Excuse me?

261
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,910
I'm sorry. Thank you for your help.

262
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,115
- Well, I finally heard from Dr. Roberts.
- That's great.

263
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,873
- Or not.
- He had me set him up with Laura Cross.

264
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,508
They'll be eating at Al Forno's.
Table by the window.

265
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,513
- Oh, Julie, I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, it's my own fault.

266
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,319
I let you do the scheming.
Clearly, not your wheelhouse.

267
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,795
From now on, if someone
needs to be manipulated...

268
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,349
...we put me in charge.
- Fair enough.

269
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,029
Laura Cross, I don't know her.

270
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,471
Well, she'll probably marry him
and enjoy a life of free browlifts.

271
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,435
Anyway, I am going to get to know her
and find out what I'm up against.

272
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,551
Don't tell me you're
gonna spy on them.

273
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,150
I tried taking your advice, Kiki,
and quite frankly, it sucked.

274
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,837
From now on, we do things
the Julie Cooper way.

275
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,472
Julie Cooper, be careful.

276
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,079
- I see we have a problem.
- Chili, man, I'm fine, all right?

277
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,151
- I'm just...
- In love with Marissa Cooper.

278
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,552
In all my years of loving ladies
and getting nothing in return...

279
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,517
...I have never been as bad off as you.

280
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,872
Thanks. It makes me feel a lot better.

281
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,915
Normally, I would advise you
to go cold turkey.

282
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,799
Delete her number from your cell,
spam-block her e-mails...

283
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,112
...and hope the obsession passes, but
I see that you are in deeper than this.

284
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,115
- So, what do I do?
- Take a shot.

285
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,472
That way, even if she rejects you,
at least you know you tried.

286
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,428
Yeah, and there's always the chance
that she feels the same way, right?

287
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,749
Reasons abound.

288
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,033
The point is, you owe it to yourself to at
least know whether or not she likes you.

289
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,477
- You could have a drink tonight.
- You sure?

290
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,993
Well, you've had a tough day.

291
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,029
So has Matt. Looks like he's
come here to drown his sorrows.

292
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,710
Oh, well, you should ask him
to join us if he's all by himself.

293
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,592
Or not.

294
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,479
Oh, that's Maya Griffin.

295
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,513
<i>OC Weekly</i> did a profile on her.

296
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,716
Apparently,
she's an up-and-coming Newpsie.

297
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,232
Wow, I have too much time
on my hands.

298
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,556
If she's the new queen,
she's got a lot to learn.

299
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,439
Well, why wouldn't she date him?
He's young and attractive.

300
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,319
He's using her.
Her father's the head of the board.

301
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,431
Are you gonna talk to him?

302
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,149
Tomorrow.

303
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,791
Tonight, I'm out with my lovely,
beautiful, morally uncompromised wife.

304
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,679
We could go to the Crab Shack.
Pick up something to go?

305
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,798
Sand dabs are in season. Genius.

306
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,871
- Hey.
- Hey. Thanks for meeting me.

307
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,837
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you too.

308
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,715
- Things have been really...
- Really weird between us. I know.

309
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,036
That's why I wanted
to get everything out.

310
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,719
Johnny, I don't know
if now's the time...

311
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,036
I love you.
And I think you love me too.

312
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,794
- Johnny.
- Look what's happened between us.

313
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,475
I mean, I got hurt, and you took care
of me, even when I begged you not to.

314
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,710
I know. That's true, but...

315
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,952
I told you to stay away from me,
and you showed up at my house.

316
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,951
I'm not imagining this, okay?

317
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,795
There's something real between us.
That's why neither of us can walk away.

318
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,032
Look, you don't have to say anything
right now, okay?

319
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,714
Just, you know, think about it.

320
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,548
- Morning.
- Morning.

321
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,314
- Hi, Ryan. Feel like a bagel?
- I do. Thank you.

322
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,911
- There's my son. How are you?
- Good. Do we have poppy? Oh, great.

323
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,031
- How are you, really?
- I'm really fine, Dad. How are you?

324
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,789
Good. Just making sure you're staying
afloat. I know you got lots of stress.

325
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,474
Exams, college applications.
- Yeah, not to worry.

326
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,755
It's all under control.

327
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,629
- Oh, hey, Summer.
- Hi.

328
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,274
- Just in time for breakfast.
- Oh, thanks, Mr. C.

329
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,278
Actually, I was wondering if I could
talk to Seth upstairs?

330
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,750
- Possibly alone.
- Okay.

331
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,236
All right, so... What the hell?

332
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,233
You lied about your college interview,
and I don't like liars.

333
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,960
- I can explain.
- Explain what? That you're pathological?

334
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,157
That you invent stories about interviews
that never even happened?

335
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,151
You make it sound so bad.

336
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,550
Cohen, you are in a deceit spiral.

337
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,593
If you don't stop, you'll turn into
one of those creepy men...

338
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,399
...with secret attics where they hide
stolen money and porn.

339
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,357
First of all, that sounds awesome.

340
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,278
Second of all, could be worse.

341
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,468
- I got scared.
- Scared?

342
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,918
Yeah.

343
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,477
Tongue-tied, dizzy,
my bladder felt weak.

344
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,951
I just wanna know
why you didn't tell me.

345
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,678
Because I was embarrassed.

346
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,872
You've got this natural confidence.

347
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,156
You're small and you're cute.
People like you.

348
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,073
I'm a social outcast
with a mumbling problem.

349
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,392
- You're just realizing this now?
- lf we go to college together...

350
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,757
...everybody's gonna love you,
and I'm gonna be your nerdy boyfriend.

351
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,832
I'm gonna be your not-so-bright
girlfriend that can't keep up...

352
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,912
...when everyone's talking about
yakuza films and Proust.

353
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,548
- It's Proust.
- See?

354
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,273
Look, we have to be honest with
each other, or this is never gonna work.

355
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,309
- No, you're right.
- Anything else you need to tell me?

356
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,712
Because now's your chance.
Just put it out on the table.

357
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,553
No.

358
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,109
Okay.

359
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,357
Then you are officially exonerated.

360
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,071
Thesaurus again.

361
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,989
You wanna get down?

362
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,479
Hey, I didn't know
we were working this weekend.

363
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,551
Thought maybe you
and I'd go hit the links.

364
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,835
And ruin a sport I love?

365
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,390
It's the weekend,
so I'm gonna make this brief.

366
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,074
I was at dinner last night
with Kirsten at the yacht club.

367
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,196
I saw you there.

368
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,588
With Maya.

369
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,158
Griffin told Maya about meeting me,
so she decided to get in touch.

370
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,788
- She asked you to dinner?
- She did.

371
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,514
Why, is it illegal
to take a girl out to dinner?

372
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,275
You know, when Kirsten
used to run this place...

373
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,672
...I saw a lot of creeps in nice suits
that tried to use her to get to her father.

374
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,713
I didn't like it then,
and I don't like it now.

375
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,111
We're trying to build a hospital
that could service 100,000 uninsured.

376
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,914
You're trying to use a daughter
to manipulate her father.

377
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,071
And you're comfortable with that.

378
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,796
Sandy, you're a great guy, but maybe
you don't have the stomach for this.

379
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,469
We have to bend the rules
if we wanna win the game.

380
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,437
That'd look great on a bumper sticker.

381
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,754
I wanna see you on Monday
with a real game plan.

382
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,399
All right.

383
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,471
Hey.

384
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,430
- Kirsten let me in. She seems really nice.
- What do you want?

385
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,112
Look, you've always been
a really good guy to me.

386
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,590
You know, you've helped me
with Volchok.

387
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,360
- Trusted me with Marissa...
- Now you're in love with her.

388
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,397
I told her.

389
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,079
I promised myself I would just
live with these feelings, you know.

390
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,549
I wouldn't do anything about them.

391
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,918
But I just can't do that anymore.

392
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,790
What do you want, my blessing?

393
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,236
I guess, I just...

394
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,318
Just wanted to say I'm sorry.

395
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,959
Thanks for that.

396
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,554
Leave. Now.

397
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,075
I'm passionately devoted to my work
on the board of the Children's Museum.

398
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,357
Children are so important,
don't you think?

399
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,272
She's so phony.

400
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,596
Well, of course she is.
She lives in Newport.

401
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,514
Oh, God, mayday.
Taryn Baker just walked in.

402
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,517
Get out of there before she sees you.

403
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,155
Oh, too late. Hi, Taryn.

404
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,510
Why are you all bundled up like that?

405
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,591
Has Newport been taken over
by the Taliban?

406
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,035
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I have to be going.

407
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,272
Oh, my goodness, it's Laura Cross.
Laura. Hi.

408
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,870
- It's me, Taryn, from Orchid Club.
- Oh, Taryn, of course.

409
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,798
- Do you know Julie?
- I have to go.

410
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,349
- We haven't met. Julie?
- Julie?

411
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,517
Oh, my. What a coincidence.

412
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,350
Have you been sitting
at the next table this whole time?

413
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,630
Are you spying on me?

414
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,673
I...

415
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,512
I'm sorry.

416
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,353
Hey.

417
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,439
There's a sale at Paul Frank
if you wanna go.

418
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,556
Probably can't afford anything.

419
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,518
- But we could try stuff on.
- No, thanks.

420
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,069
I'm guessing you're still mad at me.

421
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,755
I know you may not believe this,
but I'm trying to do you a favor.

422
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,589
Oh, yeah? Well, thanks.
So far it's been a real blast.

423
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,796
Remember when we were little, and
Dad used to take us to Baskin-Robbins?

424
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,512
You'd have to sample every flavor before
you could decide what you wanted.

425
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,153
And then once you did, you'd realize
you didn't like it, so you'd cry.

426
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,072
Dad would take you back
to get another.

427
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,959
Another story about how growing up,
it was always about me?

428
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,680
No. It's about you
not trusting your instincts.

429
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,995
- Maybe I'm not built that way.
- So?

430
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,997
It's a skill. Learn it.

431
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,798
Make a decision and stick with it.

432
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,519
- Remember what I used to always get?
- Gold Medal Ribbon.

433
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,829
Every time.

434
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,436
I figured, I loved it,
why question it?

435
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,269
Honey, you just missed Marissa.

436
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,714
- Marissa?
- Yeah.

437
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,149
She left this for you.

438
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,830
I'm sorry.

439
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,316
You wanna be with Johnny.

440
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,870
No. I'm sorry I ever made you wonder.

441
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,519
You two have a connection.
I get that. It's not about him.

442
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,956
No, it's about me.

443
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,436
It was just...

444
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,636
...not being able
to talk to you about Trey.

445
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,636
And then with Kaitlin coming back,
her hooking up with Johnny...

446
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,674
...it threw me for a loop.

447
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,589
- I think we can get past that.
- It's not that easy.

448
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,036
You can't just snap your fingers
and make everything the way it was.

449
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,679
Well, we can try.

450
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,557
Maybe start with dinner?

451
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,035
<i>Oh, no.</i>

452
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,556
<i>This is KRKR TV.</i>
<i>And now for the latest news.</i>

453
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,349
<i>Early tonight, the captain of a
<i>Swedish icebreaker in the Barents Sea...</i>

454
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,557
<i>... reported seeing a strange</i>
<i>red fireball come out of the sky.</i>

455
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,633
<i>Says the captain, "It hovered</i>
<i>above my ship for about a minute"...</i>

456
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,392
Johnny.

457
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,433
Which Coop are you here to see?

458
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,834
I'm here to see you.

459
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,877
I thought maybe
we could go to the beach.

460
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,359
For a night surfing lesson?

461
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,318
I was thinking more like
bonfire and tequila.

462
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,153
Even better. I know
where my mom keeps the stash.

463
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,272
So, what's the occasion?

464
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,273
Just feel like you and I
never got a chance to party.

465
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,873
- What do you say?
- Okay.

466
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,156
- Hungry?
- Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

467
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,393
- I should have called.
- Oh, that's okay.

468
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,596
I figured you were here.

469
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,473
Who would've thought
the Newport Group...

470
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,393
...would be where I go
for a moment of Zen?

471
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,269
Sometimes this job makes
you do a lot of hard thinking.

472
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,995
I want this hospital more than
I've wanted anything in a long time.

473
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,235
Then you can't let Matt's relationship
with Maya Griffin stand in your way.

474
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,310
She could be using him too.
Or they could live happily ever after.

475
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,758
The point is, if you want this
as bad as I think you do...

476
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,114
...you have to go for it.

477
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,309
So where's the line?

478
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,514
I'm not worried about you
knowing where the line is.

479
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,069
You always do. It's who you are.

480
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,873
Coming.

481
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,838
- Cohen?
- Hang on.

482
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,358
Cohen, why is the door locked?

483
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,917
Cohen. I brought some DVDs.

484
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,031
<i>Save the Last Dance</i> and <i>She's All That.</i>
I know you're not interested...

485
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,589
...but I can't watch another movie
with Japanese people flying.

486
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,318
That's fine. Let's go downstairs.

487
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,040
- That's fine? Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm great. Come on.

488
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,792
- What's that smell?
- It is incense.

489
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,191
- I was doing yoga, plus I had bad gas.
- Gross.

490
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,839
Wish we brought
something to mix it with.

491
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,035
Couple more sips,
you won't even notice.

492
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,715
Okay, alky.

493
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,549
Can we just hook up already?

494
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,039
Before you pass out on me.

495
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,712
You don't waste any time, do you?

496
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,555
Well, it's just the fire,
it's so romantic.

497
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,958
And the fire is actually kind of dying.

498
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,750
Well, okay then.

499
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,799
I'll just go find some driftwood.
Heat things up a bit.

500
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,115
What's that?

501
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,869
Nothing I wanna remember.

502
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,319
Where you going?

503
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,311
- Climb up there.
- Okay.

504
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,953
Tequila and rock climbing.

505
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,429
I'm not exactly sure
that's the best combination.

506
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,318
So don't come.

507
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,873
Johnny, wait.

508
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,351
Go away, Gus.

509
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,349
I told you, I don't wanna
play strip pinochle.

510
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,598
You play strip pinochle?

511
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,796
Long story. What...?
What are you doing here?

512
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,599
I stopped by to thank you
for fixing me up with Laura.

513
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,830
She's a wonderful woman.

514
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,278
Well, good. I'm glad it worked
out with the two of you.

515
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,679
If you'll excuse me, I have
a Hot Pocket in the microwave...

516
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,912
...and a wine cooler with
my name on it, so good luck.

517
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,398
What? What do you want?

518
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,959
You.

519
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,519
Excuse me?

520
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,119
You can be manipulative.

521
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,192
You can be aggressive.

522
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,559
I've known you to stretch
the truth on occasion.

523
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,074
But the fact is...

524
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,151
...when I'm not around you,
I miss you.

525
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,517
You do?

526
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,679
What can I say?

527
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,992
I've fallen for you.

528
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,552
Well, this just may be
your lucky night.

529
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,472
I have an extra Hot Pocket.

530
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,908
I'm almost to the top.

531
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,911
Johnny, would you just
come down already?

532
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,357
- You're wasted.
- I'm not wasted.

533
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,590
Johnny, just come down.

534
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,275
- Stop it, that's high enough.
- I'm not gonna fall.

535
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,919
You're scaring me.

536
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,640
I get it. You're awesome.
Just stop.

537
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,710
- Johnny! Oh, my God.
- It's okay!

538
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,399
Johnny!

539
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,793
- You see?
- Johnny, just come down.

540
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,871
I almost dropped it.

541
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,549
It's okay, I got it.

542
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,078
Johnny, please, just come down!

543
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,196
Seth is really into that movie.

544
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,158
Yeah, I know.
And he ate all of our dumplings.

545
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,072
I know it's gonna take more than Thai
food and teen movies to sort this out...

546
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,753
...but if you wanna talk...

547
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,671
Talking's the last thing
I feel like doing.

548
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,075
I figured, since you gave me the silent
treatment the whole way in the car.

549
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,599
What do you want from me?

550
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,030
I want you.

551
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,353
- You wanna answer that?
- Not really.

552
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,718
- It's Kaitlin.
- She's setting the mood.

553
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,395
All right. Let me just get rid of her.

554
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,597
Setting the mood. I'm telling you.

555
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,398
Wait. Kaitlin, let me call you back.

556
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,834
Can you come and get me?

557
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,309
<i>- I'm at Westwood Cove with Johnny.</i>
- No, I'm busy.

558
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,232
Yeah, you're getting busy.

559
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,277
No, but you don't understand.
I'm scared.

560
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,351
He's drunk and
acting like a crazy person.

561
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,313
Come up here!
You gotta see this view!

562
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,948
<i>- Johnny, just come down!</i>
- What's that?

563
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,951
<i>Marissa, it's him. I'm telling you.</i>

564
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,714
<i>Johnny's in trouble,</i>
<i>and I don 't know what to do.</i>

565
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,348
Hold on. She sounds really upset.

566
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,670
- It's Johnny?
- Yeah, he's in trouble.

567
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,078
- Kaitlin?
- <i>Ryan, you have to help me.</i>

568
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,038
<i>- He's drunk and he's gonna get hurt.</i>
- He's really in trouble?

569
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,316
- <i>Yes, come now.</i>
- Be right there.

570
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,556
So that was...?
That was <i>Save the Last Dance,</i> huh?

571
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,871
Okay, I know there weren't
any subtitles or kung fu or whatever.

572
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,474
- But I thought it was good.
- I thought it was amazing.

573
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,838
That dance number at the end
was so inspiring.

574
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,560
And, Summer, I'm so glad...

575
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,188
...I'm so, so glad...

576
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,557
...that she got into
Juilliard in the end.

577
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,508
And she did it for her mom.

578
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,357
For her mom, Summer.

579
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,511
Yeah, it wasn't that good.

580
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,953
This is pretty amazing too.

581
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,439
- It's just a blue screen, Cohen.
- I know, but it's so blue.

582
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,194
I never realized how blue
it was before.

583
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,319
I kind of like... I wanna
go swimming in it or something.

584
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,072
- Yeah.
- For a little dippy-dip.

585
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,708
- Okay. It's pretty blue.
- Yeah.

586
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,475
- Excuse me. I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

587
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,789
I'm not going anywhere.

588
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,599
We should...
We should take our pants off.

589
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,355
Come on, Captain Oats.
We both know something's up.

590
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,153
Over there. You go to Kaitlin.
I'll find another way up there.

591
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,276
- Keep him talking.
- Okay. Be careful.

592
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,191
- Johnny, just come down!
- Kaitlin.

593
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,920
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm so happy that you're here.

594
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,995
Marissa.

595
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,193
Johnny, look,
you have to get down from there.

596
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,033
Go home. I don't have
anything to say to you.

597
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,714
We can get through this.
You're one of my best friends.

598
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,152
After all we've been through,
I get to be your best friend.

599
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,790
Go away! Leave me alone!

600
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,396
Come on, just let me explain it to you.
Just come down, Johnny.

601
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,390
Dude, you are the last person
I wanna see now.

602
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,677
Let's get you down from there.
We can talk about it later, okay?

603
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,239
Right, right.

604
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,631
Right, so you can save me
one more time in front of Marissa.

605
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,194
Hey, Marissa! Marissa!

606
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,550
You wanna watch Ryan
save me again?

607
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,638
- Just come down, Johnny, please?
- So she'll love you even more.

608
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,234
- Get back from the edge.
- Listen to her!

609
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,111
- Just be careful.
- Or what, I might fall?

610
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,396
You get to come in
and grab me at the last second?

611
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,070
Ryan Atwood saves the...

612
