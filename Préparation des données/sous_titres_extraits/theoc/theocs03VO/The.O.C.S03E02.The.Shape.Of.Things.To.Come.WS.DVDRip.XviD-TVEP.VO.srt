00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,234
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,994
- You're gonna get through this, Coop.
- I shot someone, Sum.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,276
- Are we okay?
- Why wouldn't we be?

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,476
Since that night,
we haven't talked about it.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,996
What are you doing back in Newport?
Caleb dies... suddenly you show up.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,709
We'll collect on Caleb's will, and we'll
go back to being a normal, happy family.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,075
No matter how hard
I worked, or how hard I tried...

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,356
It was never enough.
Hi, I'm Charlotte Morgan.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,193
I'm not going back to my husband
and my boys until I know...

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,429
...that I'll never let them down.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,989
You should be
coming home any day now, right?

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,956
- Morning, Dad.
- Hey, just in time for breakfast.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,792
- Who wants cereal?
- We have cereal?

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,871
Yeah, I found some
tucked away in a cabinet.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,238
- Cereal doesn't go bad, does it?
- Oh, no, but milk does.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,358
- How about some hummus?
- For breakfast?

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,310
Sure, with a side of... Of sesame beef.
Breakfast of champions.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,552
- As much as I love botulism, I'll pass.
- I'm gonna stick with coffee.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,598
We gotta eat together.
It's a special day. You're both seniors.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,795
It's just registration.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,554
It's a coming-of-age moment.
We love coming-of-age moments.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,075
At my bar mitzvah,
he was frothing at the mouth.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,151
I was excited then, I'm excited now.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,756
I'm proud of you both. So's your mom,
even though she's not here to tell you.

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,797
Or prevent us from living
in this cesspool.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,794
Boy, she kept this place in tiptop shape
without so much as picking up a sponge.

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,758
- How does she do that?
- Her presence kept us neat, Ryan.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,559
It's that Protestant evil eye.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,199
It's a powerful thing.

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,828
She is a woman of many talents.

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,632
We could have dinner tonight, right?

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,394
- Sure, just the three of us.
- Yeah, Ryan'll even clean up.

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,954
He will.

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,031
I'll pick up the steaks.

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,676
Boy, you've got some nerve
showing up here.

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,311
Look, I apologize
for our little misunderstanding.

37
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,790
Oh, so I misunderstood. You didn't try
to frame Ryan for the shooting.

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,632
Sandy, I did what any parent
would do.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,758
- I was trying to keep my family afloat.
- By using my kid as a raft.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,035
You can lecture me later.

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,475
Right now, we need to put
our differences behind us.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,709
We have bigger problems.

43
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,949
What's happened now?

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,076
I got a call from
the school this morning.

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,835
Apparently, the parents are protesting.
They want Ryan and Marissa out.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,070
I should've seen that coming.
I'll talk to them.

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,676
No, you don't get it. They have
a petition. They filed a motion.

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,232
- See you, Dad.
- Have a good day.

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,753
Sandy, unless we can put a stop to this,
Ryan and Marissa are getting expelled.

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
And we'll take pancakes,
with extra butter.

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,189
Thanks.

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,909
Wow, it's the last time we'll ever order
pancakes before registration.

53
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,554
- And that's a sad thing to you?
- Yeah, it is sad.

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,996
Everything we do this year is for the last
time. It's like a farewell tour.

55
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,754
After the summer we've had,
that doesn't sound so terrible.

56
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,673
- lf we make it through this year.
- lf we get through graduation.

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,717
- With no major traumas.
- Then I'll be happy.

58
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,031
No, you guys, that's unacceptable.
Look, I know that our summer sucked.

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,078
- To say the least.
- But we made it through it.

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,470
No one is in juvie or in a jump suit.

61
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,471
I think Marissa would've
worn one well.

62
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,278
I do. It's the right cut on you.

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,750
Point is, the four of us are together,
and it's our senior year.

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,833
So it's our last time
to make everything all-time.

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,789
She makes a point.

66
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,871
Becoming quite
the motivational speaker.

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,157
Okay, Sum, you win.
It'll be the best year ever.

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,676
Thank you. High-five.
Best year ever.

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,318
- Jimmy couldn't make it?
- He's working.

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,357
A business associate
from Hawaii showed up.

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,115
Just as well. One Montague,
one Capulet. That should be plenty.

72
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,840
Sandy, Julie, come on in.

73
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,753
You have to understand...

74
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,037
...no student at Harbor has ever been
involved in a shooting.

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,397
And I know, as principal,
you have to do something, but...

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,471
If you could please avoid expulsion.

77
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,870
There is a petition circling
amongst the parents.

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,874
Almost 1000 signatures.
It's hard to ignore that kind of outcry.

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,554
Dr. Kim, you know my daughter, right?

80
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,199
Tall, pretty, wears Chanel?

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,430
Not exactly what you call gangster.

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,558
Look, the bottom line is
Marissa and Ryan are good kids.

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,951
- They deserve to graduate with friends.
- lf it were up to me, they would.

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,031
But it is up to you.
You're the principal.

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,431
The board thought it would be
a good idea to bring in someone new.

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,830
A specialist in school safety.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
Oh, you mean like a hall monitor?

88
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,555
Flattering. But actually
more like dean of discipline.

89
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,358
Jack Hess, nice to meet you.

90
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,795
Sandy Cohen. Julie Cooper-Nichol.

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,190
- I'm very anxious to talk about Marissa.
- And Ryan.

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,272
Thanks, but I don't really think
that'll be necessary.

93
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,910
I read their files, talked to the officers.
I know what I'm dealing with.

94
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,674
Well, you never really know
until you talk to the kid.

95
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,559
I was a PD in the juvenile system
for years, and l...

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,711
I've seen my fair share of kids
in trouble.

97
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,869
So have I, Mr. Cohen.

98
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,238
Got a master's in education, taught
six years in boarding schools back east.

99
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,630
- I like to think I know what I'm doing.
- I hope so.

100
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,076
These kids very much
want to go to college.

101
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,708
If you kick them out,
they've got no shot.

102
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,634
Well, frankly, I'm not here
to make everyone happy.

103
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,193
I'll let you know my answer
by this evening.

104
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,632
Jimmy.

105
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,756
Another Scotch on the rocks
for my friend.

106
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,480
Friend. That's a... That's a good sign.

107
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,792
You know I like you, Jimmy.
Even though you test my patience.

108
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,473
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,234
Soon. You will have the money soon.

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,038
I think you said that two months ago.

111
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,236
Well, the will's gonna be read
any day now.

112
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,153
- You gotta... You gotta believe me.
- I believed you before...

113
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,834
...when you said you were gonna
sell me a boat...

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,037
...but you pissed away my deposit
on some crazy stock venture.

115
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,111
Do we have to...?
Do we have to relive this?

116
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,316
Point is, I'm nice.

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,872
But I'm not as nice as I look.

118
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,150
I got a lot of friends who'd be more than
happy to take care of this for me.

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,515
All I gotta do is pick up
the phone.

120
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,436
You're gonna have your money.

121
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,789
I promise.

122
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,032
Coop, you need a wheelbarrow for
that binder. That thing's a monster.

123
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,156
It's everything I need
for Kickoff Carnival.

124
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,914
Waivers, invoices, vendor contracts.

125
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,991
That is so boring, it hurts.

126
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,799
So you won't be joining us
for Social Committee this year?

127
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,076
Let me think about it. No.

128
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,277
Sum, it's our last year. What happened
to "living every moment"?

129
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,749
You know how I feel
about school-sponsored events.

130
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,751
Love to go to them, hate to plan them.

131
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,717
I prefer not to look behind the curtain.

132
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,031
You see, if I join clubs, I'll have to
hang out with girls like that.

133
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,919
- Taylor Townsend?
- Okay, guys?

134
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,799
I spent the whole summer
working on your Kickoff Carnival...

135
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,837
...so I have tons of great ideas.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,275
I mean, I didn't even have a vacation.

137
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,271
But you know
someone has to do it, right?

138
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,590
Coop, she's totally stealing
your meeting.

139
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,309
Yeah, well, she's been fighting me for
Social Chair since, like, freshman year.

140
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,756
God. Nothing I hate more than perky
blonds who wanna take over the world.

141
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,751
- Come on.
- You'll be in charge of booths.

142
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,150
- And Meredith, I'm gonna put...
- Taylor?

143
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,675
Hey. I think you're at
Marissa's podium.

144
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,999
Marissa.

145
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,991
I'm sorry, I just went ahead
and guessed...

146
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,071
...that you weren't gonna be
making it today.

147
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,919
Well, here I am.

148
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,311
Well, I just assumed with everything
you've been through this summer...

149
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,595
You know, with the:

150
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,438
Right. Well, I'm fine, thanks.

151
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,718
You are so strong.

152
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,474
Listen, sweetie, if it gets to be
too much, just holler.

153
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,789
I can totally take over...

154
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,520
...since I pretty much did the whole
thing myself last year.

155
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,270
Yeah, that's great, but do you wanna
take your stuff off the podium now?

156
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,757
Absolutely.

157
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,037
I'll just be gone in a jiff.

158
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,515
Okay. Let's go.

159
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,034
Bye.

160
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,792
Oh, that bitch is going down.

161
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,432
You sure you don't need
a HAZMAT suit?

162
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,868
Oh, my God, look at this.

163
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,793
- Chicken from the Fourth of July.
- Those things fossilized yet?

164
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,075
Yeah. What are you doing?

165
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,038
Making a Seth Cohen starter pack
for Mom, rehab edition.

166
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,474
I got their new Klosterman...

167
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,359
...got Craig Thompson's <i>Blankets</i>
and I got Mötley Crüe's <i>Dirt.</i>

168
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,829
It will help
put Mom's indiscretions in perspective.

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,036
Very thoughtful.
That's pretty much everything.

170
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,758
You wanna give me a hand here?

171
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,235
- How are things with you and Marissa?
- They're fine.

172
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,913
Fine?

173
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,591
- They're fine?
- Yeah, why wouldn't they be fine?

174
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,991
I don't know, she shot your brother.
Throw the average couple for a loop.

175
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,151
We've been living
and breathing it all summer.

176
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,356
Now it's over,
we just wanna put it behind us.

177
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,750
You've talked about it, right?
I mean, hashed it out?

178
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,909
We don't need to.

179
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,548
Dude, Summer and I fought
over a comic book for a year.

180
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,914
Yeah, what's your point?

181
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,230
If I've learned anything
from being with Summer...

182
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,836
...it's that every issue in a relationship
snowballs. Even the small things.

183
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,313
You gotta deal with it,
or eventually it'll come between you.

184
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,471
Skipping town?

185
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,591
Yeah, checking out tomorrow.
You?

186
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,309
Yeah. Almost all packed.

187
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,191
Oh, I just can't wait to get back
to my family, my... My house, my bed.

188
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,195
Still, I know you were...

189
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,273
...worried about going too soon.

190
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,231
Well, I can't say that l... I feel really
ready, but I'm guessing that's normal.

191
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,151
Absolutely.

192
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,876
Going home
is the trickiest part of recovery.

193
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,999
The last time I went straight home,
I relapsed almost immediately.

194
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,711
I mean, after being here in this bubble,
it can be a shock to your system.

195
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,679
So this time I am planning
on making a pit stop.

196
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,195
Well, that seems like a good idea.

197
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,557
My father has a cottage
at Lake Arrowhead.

198
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,395
Totally remote and empty, which
makes it the perfect halfway house.

199
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,549
Well, it makes sense.

200
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,792
If there's one thing we've learned here,
it's to do things in steps.

201
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,670
You know, it...
There's a lot of extra room.

202
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,314
I mean, I know you wanna get home, but
if you're having any second thoughts...

203
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,314
Well, just think about it.

204
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,273
Thanks.

205
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,795
- Can I help you, sir?
- So have you heard anything?

206
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,869
About Marissa?

207
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,917
Is there another crisis
we're dealing with?

208
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,710
Of course not.
School hasn't called yet.

209
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,919
So how was your drink with that client?
Did you sell him a fleet of yachts?

210
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,354
It was... It was fine.

211
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,319
Look, I know you're worried
about Marissa, but you never know.

212
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,799
She could catch a break.

213
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,355
Marissa catch a break?

214
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,473
- That'd be a first.
- I don't know.

215
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,200
Cooper family's been on
a bit of a lucky streak recently.

216
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,272
My husband died in a pool.
Our daughter's about to be expelled.

217
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,668
What do you define as lucky?

218
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,550
You and I got back together.

219
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,793
And thank God.

220
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,871
Because it's the only thing
keeping me sane.

221
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,076
Whenever you're ready.

222
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,638
I... l...

223
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,912
- I left my wallet in the car.
- Jimmy.

224
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,389
Can't we just put it on Cal's tab?

225
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,518
Yeah, why not? We've charged
a summer's worth of drinks to him.

226
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,389
Julie Cooper-Nichol.

227
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,793
<i>It's the dean.</i>

228
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,439
Oh, I understand, dean.

229
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,875
And this decision is final?

230
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,273
Is there any way
I can get you to reconsider?

231
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,114
There'll be an opportunity for appeal?

232
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,477
I'm sorry to hear that.

233
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,990
I just want you to know I...

234
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,071
I think you're making a huge mistake.

235
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,912
Steaks ready?

236
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,640
Grilling is an art form, Ryan.
It can't be rushed.

237
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,155
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, you want yours rare, Dad?

238
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,038
Sure.

239
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,234
- What's wrong?
- I got some bad news.

240
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,470
I had a meeting at the school today.

241
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,871
They're concerned about bringing you
and Marissa back after what happened.

242
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,034
- I'm getting kicked out.
- No, you're not.

243
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,548
But Marissa is.

244
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,078
<i>"Dirt: The Mötley Crüe Story."</i>

245
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,993
Well, that ought to put things
in perspective.

246
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,835
Our son has a very strange take
on self-help.

247
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,795
How are the boys? I miss them.

248
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,349
They're great.
They miss you like crazy.

249
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,872
I'm guessing they'll be
seeing you soon.

250
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,759
I'm taking that suitcase
as a good sign.

251
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,595
- I am leaving.
- Oh, honey, that's great news.

252
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,957
Your timing couldn't be better.
We cleaned up the house. It was...

253
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,997
It was a pit.

254
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,835
Sandy, I'm not coming home.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,639
I'm going to Lake Arrowhead
with a friend.

256
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,395
- A friend?
- Her name is Charlotte.

257
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,160
She has a lot of experience
with these things...

258
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,673
...the dangers of relapse.

259
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,233
Honey, if you're thinking about relapse,
why check out at all?

260
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,153
I'm not saying that. It's just that...

261
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,559
- You don't want to come home.
- No.

262
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,309
Yes.

263
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,438
I want to come home. Of course I do.

264
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,077
I just need to know that when I do...

265
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,192
...that I'm home for good.

266
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,998
That this is all behind me.

267
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,276
Is there a timetable for this?

268
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,836
Oh, Sandy, I don't know.

269
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,870
Well, when you do, call me.

270
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,916
- Coop?
- Hey.

271
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,877
- How you doing?
- Oh, I've been better.

272
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,792
We thought
you could use some breakfast.

273
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,349
We got bagels and a support group.

274
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,829
Yes. Captain Oats
is a really good listener.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,956
Princess Sparkle stands there
and looks cute.

276
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,078
- You guys didn't have to do that.
- And we're getting you back in.

277
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,710
You shouldn't suffer for this.
It should be me.

278
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,474
Well, you didn't shoot somebody.
I did.

279
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,995
I don't care what it takes,
we're getting you back in.

280
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,869
- Hey.
- Hey.

281
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,508
I'm checking online.
There's decent schools in the area.

282
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,910
- Marissa won't be going to any of them.
- What?

283
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,832
I was brainstorming during
Cardio Barre...

284
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,595
...which is where I do all my best
thinking and I came up with a solution.

285
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,149
- Well, I'm all ears.
- Money.

286
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,960
- Excuse me?
- We give Harbor a fat donation.

287
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,396
Remind them they're kicking out
Caleb Nichol's stepdaughter.

288
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,038
Except that Caleb's
not around anymore.

289
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,111
But his money is, or at least it will be...

290
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,158
...when they get around to untangling
his 79 Swiss bank accounts.

291
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,716
I don't know, Jules.
I don't... I don't think it's gonna work.

292
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,395
Then it's a write-off. I mean...

293
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,235
Look, I admit it's a long shot,
but we've gotta at least try.

294
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,755
Honey, this is our daughter
we're talking about.

295
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,632
You're right.

296
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,392
So you write the check.
I'm dry until the will comes through.

297
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,271
Well, how...? How much you thinking?
Like, 2000? Or three?

298
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,029
Wake up, Jimmy.

299
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,270
The Siegfrieds donated a pool
and a field house.

300
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,318
Their son only smoked pot.
Marissa shot someone.

301
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,869
We've gotta at least give them
100 grand.

302
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,359
What happened to Marissa Cooper
is a tragedy.

303
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,155
But let it be a lesson to all of us.

304
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,393
One minute you're on top,
the next you're on the streets.

305
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,438
With that in mind, I would like to take
a moment of silence...

306
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,838
...to remember Marissa Cooper, and
the great work she did as Social Chair.

307
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,709
That felt really good.

308
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,594
Okay, so it is with a heavy heart...

309
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,629
...that I assume Marissa's post
as Social Chair.

310
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,515
Summer Roberts.

311
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,514
I was just wondering
if anyone else has a chance to try out?

312
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,394
What, are you saying
that you want to be Social Chair?

313
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,637
Maybe.

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,879
Okay. Have you ever done
this kind of work before?

315
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,632
Please. No, but l...

316
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,314
Have you ever done
any extracurricular activities at all?

317
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,629
And shopping doesn't count.

318
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,998
Okay, maybe I'm not, like,
super qualified, but neither are you.

319
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,391
Who do you think has been running
this committee these past few years?

320
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,513
- Marissa Cooper.
- Marissa Cooper has been busy.

321
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,355
Skipping school. Experimenting
with her sexual orientation.

322
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,995
And I was here, picking up the slack.

323
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,435
Doing all of the work
while she got all the credit.

324
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,477
Do you have any idea
what it's like...

325
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,438
...to have all of the responsibility
and none of the power?

326
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,272
Do you?

327
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,312
Okay, then.

328
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,759
Let's get back to work, people.

329
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,876
We have a carnival to throw.

330
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,317
Charlotte, it's so charming.

331
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,072
Thanks.

332
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,832
God, I haven't been here in years.

333
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,560
We stopped coming when Dad bought
a house on the Vineyard.

334
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,153
I always loved it.

335
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,788
Well, that wasn't too important
to dear old Dad.

336
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,279
You know how that is.

337
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,317
But you're here now.

338
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,319
Yeah.

339
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,919
Dad is also a security freak,
so he locks this place up like Fort Knox.

340
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,038
There we go.

341
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,669
So this is it.

342
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,037
The kitchen is right over there,
where I will be teaching you to cook...

343
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,077
...whether you like it or not.

344
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,712
It's beautiful.

345
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,314
Thinking about Sandy?

346
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,632
Can't help it.

347
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,276
I feel like I've let him down yet again.

348
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,192
You're doing this for him.

349
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,712
I don't think he sees it that way.

350
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,630
Well, then show him.
Invite him up for dinner.

351
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,358
- You wouldn't mind?
- Of course not.

352
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,910
You've been talking so much about your
perfect husband, I'd love to meet him.

353
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,033
- Ryan.
- Dr. Kim, hey, I need to talk to you.

354
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,590
Ryan, the board had an exhaustive
debate about you and Marissa...

355
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,069
...and they came to what I think
is a fair decision.

356
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,708
They might change their minds
if they knew what happened.

357
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,678
They do know what happened.
The board has reached its decision.

358
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,956
Look, who can I talk to?
How can I change this?

359
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,194
You'd have to talk to the new dean.
It's his department.

360
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,511
Great, so if Marissa and I
could just talk to him, tell him our story.

361
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,519
Please?

362
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,514
Hey, you hungry?

363
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,238
Thought we could get a bite to eat.

364
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,549
I'm too sick to eat.

365
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,234
- Sick?
- Yes, of senior year sucking.

366
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,356
But it hasn't even started yet.

367
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,873
So?

368
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,554
It's already terrible.
Marissa got the axe...

369
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,518
...and now I have to watch as Überbitch
feeds on her remains.

370
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,829
You mean that Taylor girl?

371
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,992
I thought I could compete
with Psycho Barbie for Social Chair.

372
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,357
- You wanted to be Social Chair?
- No, it's just all I could do to help.

373
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,999
To try to keep Marissa's legacy...

374
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,549
...from falling into the grubby paws of
Taylor Townsend.

375
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,551
- Okay, well, then you should.
- I can't.

376
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,439
She's Taylor Townsend.
She's like the Karl Rove of our school.

377
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,034
So you can take Karl Rove...
You know who Karl Rove is?

378
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,395
Yeah. My stepmom sometimes
naps in front of CNN.

379
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,516
I hear things as I'm dragging her
off to bed.

380
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,716
I know you don't think
of yourself as active...

381
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,677
No. Two hobbies: shopping
and sunbathing.

382
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,478
- but you have Marissa as a resource.

383
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,154
Now, you combine that with
your natural God-given rage...

384
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,471
...you have everything you need
to topple that tyrant Taylor Townsend.

385
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,712
You're right. You know what?
We need to go to Marissa's.

386
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,394
- Pretty sure I said I was hungry.
- Come on.

387
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,151
Jimmy.

388
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,953
You proved me wrong.

389
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,918
Figured you'd be tossing back
tequila shooters in Oaxaca by now.

390
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,031
I don't have the money.

391
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,795
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

392
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,235
I haven't even gotten
to the unbelievable part yet.

393
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,073
l... I need to ask you for a loan.

394
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,269
I'm sorry.
You want to borrow money?

395
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,873
A hundred thousand dollars.

396
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,359
It's for my kid. She's...

397
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,271
- She's had some bad luck.
- Runs in the family, I guess.

398
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,953
Look, the best way for you
to get your money is to give me more.

399
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,312
- So why don't you sell the boat.
- Well, if it were mine...

400
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,436
The bank owns it now. Look...

401
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,034
l... I'm... I'm in a real pinch here.

402
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,875
Once the money comes in,
I pay you back.

403
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,828
Julie and I, we... We...
We live happily ever after, okay?

404
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,116
Trust me, l... l...
I got a plan.

405
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,439
- You really think this is gonna work?
- Yeah, well, we gotta at least try, right?

406
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,191
You must be Ryan and Marissa.

407
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,672
It's good to finally meet Harbor's
most notorious couple. Please, come in.

408
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,274
Have a seat.

409
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,753
So we just... We wanted to tell you
our version of what happened.

410
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,071
This doesn't really concern you, Ryan.

411
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,076
As far as I know, you're still enrolled
at Harbor, despite my best efforts.

412
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,236
So I say we focus on Marissa.

413
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,236
So, Miss Cooper...

414
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,989
...tell me why I'm wrong about you.

415
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,194
- I...
- Because that's what this is about, right?

416
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,075
- I've got you all wrong.
- I don't know.

417
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,232
I just know I've never been involved
in anything like this before.

418
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,630
Really? Well, l...
I gotta disagree with you.

419
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,069
What are you talking about?

420
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,278
You know, I'm new to Newport.

421
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,034
I moved here a few weeks ago
from the East Coast.

422
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,919
So far, it's not bad.
The weather's great.

423
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,991
And you know what else
I like about it here?

424
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,072
People here talk. They love to talk.

425
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,229
Especially about you.

426
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,550
You can't buy into the gossip
in this town.

427
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,510
All right, so...

428
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,079
Yeah, you tell me, then.

429
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,672
Shoplifting, alcohol abuse,
an overdose in Tijuana.

430
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,035
And please stop me
if any of this is just gossip.

431
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,112
Those things have nothing to do
with what happened with Trey.

432
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,838
You know what, I did those things.

433
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,312
- But, I mean, the shooting was different.
- Marissa, it's never different.

434
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,075
A troubled kid gets ahold of a gun,
the ending is always the same.

435
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,755
- I'm not troubled.
- You almost killed another kid.

436
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,276
I don't even hear a hint
of remorse in your voice.

437
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,233
Because I don't have any.

438
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,153
I'm proud of what I did,
and I'd do it again.

439
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,276
So, you know what,
maybe the next time...

440
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,672
...you're out on the town talking with
people you should tell them I said that.

441
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,073
I hope she gets a good, long look
on her way out.

442
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,795
She's never setting foot
in this school again.

443
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,597
All the California fire codes
are in here. I think.

444
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,320
- Wanna test me?
- No.

445
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,675
Come on, I have to catch Taylor
breaking a rule...

446
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,035
...or I have no shot
at taking back this carnival.

447
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,997
Well, you're not gonna
out-Taylor Taylor.

448
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,357
I mean, fire codes and regulations,
that's her bread and butter.

449
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,669
Well, what do you suggest?

450
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,479
I suggest you find something
you're good at that she's not.

451
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,716
Hey, dude, you wanna play?

452
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,589
More in the mood for stewing,
I got it.

453
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,070
You should go talk to him.

454
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,674
Go talk to him.

455
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,638
- You okay?
- Not really.

456
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,076
Look, I know this thing with the dean
has you a little pissed off.

457
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,878
- Or a lot.
- It was all I could do...

458
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,759
...to keep from kicking that guy's ass.
- I know how it feels.

459
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,070
Actually, I don't.
But you don't do that anymore.

460
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,708
Sometimes it seems like
the best way to handle things.

461
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,110
- I don't like where this is headed.
- Yeah, well...

462
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,273
Okay, well, listen. I mean, even if
you can't get Marissa back into school...

463
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,876
...all right, at least she's not going
to jail. It's not the end of the world.

464
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,955
Voilà. One hundred thousand dollars.

465
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,315
Oh, thanks, but I don't think
we're gonna need it.

466
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,754
We don't?

467
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,956
Marissa had a meeting
with the dean yesterday.

468
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,112
Apparently she showed him a side
of herself usually reserved for me.

469
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,952
Oh, it was that bad, huh?

470
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,430
I don't think any amount of money
is getting her back in that school.

471
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,309
Oh, I'm sorry.
At least we found out now.

472
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,630
Saved us some money.

473
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,951
- Actually, I could use this.
- What?

474
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,793
Well, you know, the landscaper,
the pool guy, the gardener.

475
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,996
None of them have been paid
since Caleb died.

476
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,754
I'm afraid one of them's gonna kill me
in my sleep.

477
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,755
Okay, next I've got your stations
set up right here.

478
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,951
Summer, you showed up.

479
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,157
And you brought a little friend.

480
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,390
- Seth Cohen, is it?
- Present.

481
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,189
So as I was saying...

482
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,351
We had some ideas,
so we came to help.

483
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,432
Oh, well, that's sweet,
but we've got it under control.

484
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,953
Well, all right. Gotta go.

485
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,758
- So as I was saying...
- Hey, Ash.

486
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,559
What would you think
about getting a chocolate fountain?

487
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,870
Awesome. Didn't Britney
have one at her wedding?

488
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,678
You know what? She did.

489
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,796
And Seth and I here
rented one for tonight.

490
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,077
- Sorry, that's not really our carnival.
- Well, it should be.

491
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,719
- Yeah, really.
- What else?

492
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,991
Well, I was thinking, for food...

493
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,993
...how about, like, mini-burgers,
mini-dim sum...

494
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,628
...maybe, like, mini-soups
in little shot glasses?

495
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,313
How cute is that?

496
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,914
- Because mini is the new super size.
- So true.

497
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,071
We should also maybe
cancel Shenanigans.

498
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,229
What?

499
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,630
The Harbor Comedy Troupe's gotten
way too political lately.

500
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,030
Ever since Tina Wu left,
they are so not funny.

501
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,955
And why are we raffling off
a gas-guzzling SUV...

502
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,550
...from Taylor's dad's dealership,
when we could give away a hybrid?

503
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,720
- Air quality is so important.
- I know. We breathe it.

504
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,154
All right, you guys,
so who is onboard with my carnival?

505
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,949
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

506
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,879
Hey, you must be Sandy Cohen.

507
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,439
Bit of a legend back at Suriak.

508
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,158
Thanks, Charlotte.
Nice to meet you too.

509
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,992
Kirsten's just up in the kitchen.

510
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,311
- You left her unsupervised?
- Consider it therapy.

511
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,436
Boy, everything seems to be
therapy nowadays.

512
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,750
Cooking, holing yourself up
in the woods.

513
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,672
This place will be great for Kirsten.

514
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,798
What would be great for Kirsten
is for her to be with her kids.

515
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,159
Look, Sandy, I know you don't know me.
And I know this all seems a little weird.

516
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,153
But I've been around this track
a few times.

517
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,474
I'm not proud of that,
but I've learned a few things.

518
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,790
And I know that the reason
Kirsten was in rehab...

519
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,918
...is because she spent her life
trying to be the perfect daughter.

520
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,436
So now if she tries to be the perfect
mother and the perfect wife...

521
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,509
She may never come home.

522
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,630
- I'm so glad you're here.
- I am too.

523
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,158
Okay, who wants dinner?

524
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,073
- Hey.
- Hey.

525
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,832
Why aren't you at the carnival?

526
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,197
Because I was hoping I could
get you to go with me.

527
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,749
Seth and Summer are there.
It'll be fun.

528
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,150
Or really depressing.

529
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,475
Look, about that. It's not over yet.
I'm gonna talk to Sandy.

530
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,392
Maybe get him a copy
of our testimonies.

531
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,549
Ryan...

532
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,199
If you're innocent of all charges...

533
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,920
...they'll have to admit
you shouldn't be punished, right?

534
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,195
No. No, it's over.

535
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,516
I don't get it.
Why don't you wanna fight this?

536
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,511
Because I can't keep doing this, okay?

537
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,238
Look, I appreciate
everything you've done to help me...

538
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,630
...but maybe you've done enough.

539
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,998
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I don't need you to help me.

540
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,798
I don't need you to protect me.

541
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,157
- I don't now, and I didn't then.
- Wha...?

542
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,197
Oh, what,
so this whole thing is my fault?

543
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,759
What happened was between
me and Trey.

544
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,273
You didn't need to get
in the middle of it.

545
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,954
So I was supposed to watch you die?

546
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,993
I did what I did, and I'm prepared
to face the consequences.

547
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,436
Yeah, well, there are consequences
for me too. He was my brother.

548
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,079
Right.

549
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,231
And now, because of me, he's gone.

550
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,590
No, that's not what I mean.

551
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,952
Ryan...

552
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,878
<i>And the winner of the Toyota</i>
<i>Highlander Hybrid is Jillian Flynn.</i>

553
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,238
- I won! I won!
- All right, all right.

554
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,669
Hey, Summer.
Totally awesome carnival.

555
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,071
- We love the mini-burgers.
- And high-five for taking down Taylor.

556
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,549
Thanks, guys.

557
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,437
Bye, have fun.

558
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,996
Hey, why the sad face?
This is your <i>Rudy</i> moment.

559
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,594
I know, I just... I can't enjoy it.
Not without Coop.

560
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,796
- No?
- No.

561
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,234
We're never gonna go back...

562
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,550
...to the way things were, are we?
- I don't know.

563
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,711
You worked too hard on this
to miss out on it.

564
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,552
- I know, but, Cohen...
- Come on.

565
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,393
One mournful ride on the Tilt-A-Whirl
is the least we can do.

566
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,512
- I thought you'd be at the carnival.
- Didn't really work out.

567
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,868
I guess Marissa's expulsion
hasn't been easy on you too.

568
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,600
No, I just wish there was something
I could do, you know.

569
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,673
So you wanna fix this?
The universal male instinct.

570
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,789
Happens to the best of us.

571
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,951
So I'm supposed to sit here
and do nothing?

572
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,476
No, you need to go back.
But just listen.

573
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,115
- Just listen.
- Trust me.

574
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,508
Works better than you think.

575
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,477
Could we...? Could we get another bottle
of Dom Perignon?

576
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,555
Okay, Daddy Warbucks.
What's the occasion?

577
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,631
Can't I take you out
to a nice little dinner?

578
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,951
Sure, it's just that I thought
we agreed that tonight...

579
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,236
...was Taco Bell
and <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i>

580
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,914
Well, I brought you here
because I wanted to tell you...

581
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,596
...that I am never
leaving this family again.

582
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,910
I lost you once, Julie, and l...
I'm never gonna let that happen again.

583
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,116
James.

584
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,194
And with that in mind...

585
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,391
My old ring.

586
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,710
Will you marry me, Julie?

587
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,072
Again?

588
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,510
Of course.

589
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,792
Want some company?

590
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,673
Sure.

591
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,150
Sorry about before.

592
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,473
I know.

593
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,073
You know...

594
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,956
...I was always worried
that I'd screw things up for myself here.

595
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,872
Get in trouble.

596
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,193
Ruin the chance the Cohens gave me.

597
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,593
- And now I screwed things up for you.
- Ryan.

598
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,877
I'm not gonna let
getting kicked out of Harbor ruin my life.

599
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,996
I'm not even gonna let it
ruin my year.

600
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,435
Look, I know that we're not
in school together anymore...

601
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,478
...but at least we still have
this last year in Newport together.

602
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,638
I'm listening.

603
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,711
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

604
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,954
How you feeling?

605
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,796
My stomach is far too Jewish for that
ride, but I'm almost done spinning.

606
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,314
Summer. Hi.

607
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,439
I just wanted to thank you
for all your little touches on the carnival.

608
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,556
It's just... It's really sad that Marissa
Cooper couldn't be here to see this.

609
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,439
It must be hard having
your friend ostracized from school.

610
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,192
Okay, Taylor. Number one...

611
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,716
...Marissa was not ostra... Whatever.
- Ostracized.

612
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,791
Number two, she happens to be
on her way now.

613
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,191
- Marissa's coming here?
- Oh, I'm not done yet.

614
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,476
And number three...
Do we have a number three?

615
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,629
Oh, yeah, we do.

616
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,792
Number three, this is the best carnival
this school has ever seen.

617
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,996
And not just because
I canceled Shenanigans.

618
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,479
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

619
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,358
Come on, Cohen.

620
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,870
I didn't know Marissa was coming.

621
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,230
- Me neither. Coop!
- Hey.

622
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,469
You came.

623
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,596
I couldn't miss your first
Kickoff Carnival.

624
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,309
- Not bad, huh?
- I couldn't have done it better myself.

625
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,108
So can I interest you
in the Ferris wheel?

626
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,550
- What were you saying?
- Now we go to the carnival.

627
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,319
Charlotte?

628
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,154
Charlotte, what's wrong?

629
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,275
- I'm sorry. Did I wake you?
- No, no, I was up. What's the matter?

630
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,879
I haven't...

631
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,272
I haven't been totally honest with you.

632
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,316
There's something I need to tell you.

633
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,431
I haven't yet, but I might.

634
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,477
It's okay.

635
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,633
What am I gonna do when you're gone?
I can't do this without you.

636
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,112
I saw you with Sandy,
and I know how much you miss him...

637
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,669
...and you're gonna leave soon,
and what am I gonna do?

638
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,633
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me you're ready.

639
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,230
We're in this together.

640
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,154
Thank you.

641
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,188
Let's go to bed.
You'll feel better in the morning.

642
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,711
I'll be right behind you.

643
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,519
Okay, I'm nauseous again.
Ryan, I'm feeling queasy.

644
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,910
Will you leave them alone?
They're having a moment.

645
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,719
I just want to warn you
in case that dim sum resurfaces...

646
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,440
...you're kind of in the line of fire.

647
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,751
- You're getting good at this, aren't you?
- Yeah, third year's a charm.

648
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,834
Look, I know the last three years
haven't exactly been perfect...

649
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,195
...and I know this year's gonna be
even tougher...

650
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,999
...but we just gotta find our moments,
you know?

651
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,628
Well, I think we're having one now.

652
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,392
Excuse me, Miss Cooper,
what do you think you're doing?

653
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,755
- Taylor Townsend.
- She is Karl Rove.

654
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,876
We're not on school property.
She's my guest.

655
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,554
This doesn't involve you, Ryan.
I want you out of here.

656
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,439
- It's fine, okay? I'm leaving.
- No, you're not going anywhere.

657
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,397
She worked on this carnival
every year.

658
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,597
Thanks for the trip down memory lane,
but that is not my problem.

659
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,557
Now, get out of here.

00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,518
- Get your hands off her.
- Another word, you're out of school.

661
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,910
- Get off of me!
- Hey, don't touch her!

662
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,354
Ryan!

663
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,394
- Oh, my God.
- That's not good.

664
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,110
Well, this is my lucky day.

665
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,798
Here I thought I was gonna have to work
to throw you out of this school...

666
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,674
...but you did it yourself.

00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,034
Get out of here.

668
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,194
Either of you ever set foot
near this school again...

00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,033
...I call the police.
