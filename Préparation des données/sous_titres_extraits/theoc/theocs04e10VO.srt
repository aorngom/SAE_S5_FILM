1
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,560
It is.It's too much.

2
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,890
No,no,no,no.Not...

3
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,280
What is it?

4
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,740
New bookstore opened.

5
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,620
It looks like a good bookstore.

6
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,550
All right,well,look,I should get back to work.

7
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,030
Oh,yeah,okay.

8
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,930
But thank you.This was really great.

9
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,230
Good,I'm glad you liked it.Bye.

10
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,090
I'll call you later.
Okay.

11
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,860
a season for peaches
Henri-Michel De Momourant

12
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,640
Oh,no.No,this cannot be happening.

13
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,710
Excuse me,uh...

14
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,590
what is this book?
A Season For Peaches.

15
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,970
It's the bestseller from France.English translation came in today.

16
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay,what's it about?

17
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,700
Kind of like,Bridges of Madison County meets The Notebook meets ...porn.

18
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,350
Oh,my God.Plot,please.

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,210
Uh,this Frenchman seduces this young American girl and then they get married.

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,360
I can't remember where.

21
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,430
His family's chapel in Burgundy.

22
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,540
Oh,so you read it.
No.

23
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,280
I lived it.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,190
I'm Peaches.

29
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,800
Oh,trusty neck pillow.

30
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,360
What did Ryan do to you?

31
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,400
So you're really going to Seattle?

32
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,370
You don't want to marry a girl,you've got to ask her father's permission,Ryan.

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,470
It's the polite thing to do.

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,750
Yeah,except you don't want to get married,which you could still tell her,you know.

35
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,540
Not a chance.

36
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,650
So you guys are really gonna walk down the aisle because neither of you is willing to back down.

37
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,970
This is where Dr.Roberts comes in.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,010
He rejects me,this whole game of chicken ends and I don't have to be the bad guy.

39
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,840
But are you positive that he's gonna say "no"?

40
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,030
I mean,I thought you guys bonded before he left.

41
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,380
There was some golf watching.

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,140
There may have even been some sandwich eating.

43
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,000
But deep down inside,he still sees me as the skinny 16-year-old boy trying to seduce his daughter.

44
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,130
I just need to remind him of that.

45
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,700
Brilliant plan.Good luck getting rejected.

46
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,060
Fortunately,it's something I excel at.

47
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,140
Taylor.
Uh-huh.

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,890
Ryan,can I talk to you for just a second?

49
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,850
Yeah,sure.

50
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,780
Is anything wrong?
Oh,no.

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,490
Well,nothing big.

52
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,950
A teensy little thing.

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,620
So Michiko Kakatani called it "a sexual epic," which I think is a real stretch.

54
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,470
It's already been banned in Texas,so we don't have to worry about people there reading it.

55
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,230
I debated even telling you about this,but you know my policy- full disclosure.

56
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,150
So,how are you?

57
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,700
Okay?

58
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,830
Your ex-husband wrote this about you.

59
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,570
A novel,not a memoir.

60
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,220
It's a big difference.Ask James Frey.

61
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,740
It's just that things between us have been so good lately,

62
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,160
and I wouldn't want one silly,erotic novel to change all that.

63
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,650
So I'm gonna ask you a favor.

64
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,570
Please don't read it.

65
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,020
Look,I've never read a romance novel before.

66
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,980
Shocker.
And I'm not gonna start now.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,500
Thank you.

68
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,520
I'm gonna put this away now and we will never have to talk about it again.

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,440
Until the movie comes out.
Yeah,right.

70
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,630
Like they could make a movie about that.

71
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,260
Maybe on DVD at the adult video store.

72
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,440
Bye.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,700
Yes.

74
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,660
Yes.

75
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,960
No.

76
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,520
What are the numbers on this guy?

77
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,380
Uh,six feet,190.

78
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,690
18% body fat.

79
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,860
Nope.No good.

80
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,910
You know Mrs.Jacobson,she likes her boys straight out of Muscle Beach.

81
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,470
Okay,these two should do.

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,750
Tell her she can have either at $2,500,gratuity not included.

83
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,190
And here comes Kirsten.Go on,get out of here right now,thank you.

84
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,260
Hi,Kiki.

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,560
Hello,Spencer.

86
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,530
How's your dad?
Good.

87
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,480
Still in Dubai buying a fleet of limos or...

88
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,580
maybe they were camels,can't remember.

89
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,710
See ya.

90
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,510
What's he doing here?

91
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,740
Oh,he was just helping me move some furniture.

92
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,790
Everything looks the same.

93
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,500
Yeah,it looked terrible,so I had him move it back.

94
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,670
Would you like me to help you return those calls?

95
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,730
I got it.

96
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,580
Ooh,better get this.Work,work,work.

97
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,480
Oh,and thanks for the coffee.

98
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,780
Hello

99
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,570
Morning.

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,730
Hey.

101
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,070
What do you think of updos?

102
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,250
Are you reading Modern Bride?

103
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,550
As we speak,Seth is on his way to Seattle to ask my dad if he can marry me.

104
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,860
So,here comes the bride,I guess.

105
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,310
Summer,do you realize what you're doing?

106
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,910
You're about to enter into a doomed marriage.

107
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,340
I don't know,Seth seems really committed.

108
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,080
Look,I think I might marry him someday,so maybe there's no point in waiting.

109
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,490
So,living with me and the story of my divorce has taught you nothing.

110
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,560
No offense,Taylor,but you married some French dude you knew for,like,nine seconds.

111
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,300
This is a little different.

112
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,350
Okay,I see I need to get more into your wheel house if I'm gonna drive this home.

113
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,830
What about Holly?
From high school?

114
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,900
Yes,she got married last summer.Why don't you call her?

115
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,050
She could give you a preview of life as a wife.

116
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,570
Fine.Can we drop it?

117
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,980
Fine.

118
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,700
A Season For Peaches.

119
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,030
You know,I'm reading this.This is dirty.

120
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,550
Excuse me,the girl just has a healthy sex drive.

121
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,910
Yeah,for a hooker.

122
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,600
Would you just give me that?

123
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,280
Thank you.

124
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,090
She's just young and confused,okay?!

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,420
Can I get you anything else?

126
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,150
No,I'm good.

127
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,220
It's not a library,you know.

128
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,240
Hey,Ryan.

129
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,750
How are you today?

130
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,540
Let's see what am I going to have.

131
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,370
Two shrimp tacos,Luis.
Hola,Se~or Cohen.

132
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,700
Luis,how are you today?

133
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,140
I tell you,ever since you started working here,it's revolutionized my lunch hour.

134
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,620
Kirsten's reading that.

135
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,610
Let me tell you,there is one part...
Page 47.

136
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,600
Man,was that hot.
And in public.

137
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,470
I thought Peaches was going to get arrested.

138
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,870
It's Taylor.
Who's Taylor?

139
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,420
Her,the book,Peaches.

140
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,940
You know her?
No,what are you talking about?

141
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,840
It's about a girl from California who...

142
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,170
Yeah.

143
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,690
So,uh...

144
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,290
have you read it?

145
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,440
No,and I'm not about to start.Can I get you anything else?

146
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,210
No.No,I'm good.

147
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,060
Maybe a glass of water.
Great.

148
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,490
I just don't see how they fit in the voting boxes.

149
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,230
Come on,these women sacrificed their life so you can vote.

150
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,580
Maybe they should've sacrificed some cheeseburgers.

151
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm kidding.

152
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,410
Just ask me some questions.

153
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,140
What happened in 1848?

154
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,750
The first women's rights convention.

155
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,970
And...

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,610
Elizabeth Cady Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments,

157
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,730
which proclaimed that men and women were created equal.

158
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,420
All right,that's good.
That was awesome.

159
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,790
I'm gonna rock that test.

160
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,840
That's thanks to you for helping me study.

161
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,990
All right,I'll see you in class.

162
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,300
Wait.

163
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,860
What are you doing tomorrow night?

164
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
You asking me out?

165
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,280
Are you saying yes?

166
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,650
You go first.

167
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,650
Okay.

168
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,170
You're cordially invited to hang out at my house.

169
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,930
With me.

170
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,340
Well,I accept your invitation.

171
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,630
Nice book,professor.

172
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,250
Yeah,professor.

173
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,530
Real funny,guys.

174
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,010
See you later.

175
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,480
Man,that guy is like the professor of dorkonomics.

176
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,050
He should teach Dorkology 101.

177
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,420
He's not even a dork.

178
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,190
He doesn't surf and he doesn't play water polo.

179
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,880
Yeah,ergo,dorko.

180
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,910
Do you like him?

181
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,350
You shut up before I vomit on you.

182
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,480
What's wrong with this chick's hair?

183
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,200
Gruesome.

184
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,960
Oh,my God,look how ripped my arms are.

185
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,460
I'm so sorry I missed your wedding.

186
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,460
Whatev-skis.

187
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,830
You dropped off the radar when you started dating Seth.

188
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,310
Yeah.

189
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,760
You know,Holly,when you were engaged,were you totally sure that you wanted to get married?

190
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,660
Oh,my God,totally,bitch.

191
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,710
You are going to love being a wife.

192
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,420
You work out in the morning,meet the girls for lunch,and then we shop all day.

193
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,190
So there's,like,a whole crew of you guys?

194
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,360
We call ourselves the Newpsie-weds.

195
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,590
Can you even handle how cute that is?

196
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,630
Well,you'd better,because you're meeting us all at lunch tomorrow.

197
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,080
Yeah.

198
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,700
You know,it'd be nice to have a bunch of friends again.

199
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,510
Oh,my God,look what I just did.

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,710
So cute,I want to barf.

201
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,530
"Hi,Mom." 
No.

202
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,490
"Hi,Mom." 
No.

203
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,660
Bad idea.

204
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,430
The reading's over,but if you want your book signed,the author's still here.

205
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm sorry,what?

206
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,440
You may have to wait in line.

207
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,020
Ah,that won't be necessary.

208
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,140
Now...

209
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,630
who shall I make it out to?A girlfriend,perhaps?

210
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,410
What is her name?

211
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,540
Taylor

212
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,620
Ryan,you in there?

213
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,840
You know,I called you at work last night and,um,then at home,but I guess you must have been really tired.

214
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,830
Oh,no...

215
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,460
Hey.

216
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,650
Did you read it?
Yeah.

217
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,060
All of it?
Uh-huh.

218
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,950
Oh,God.

219
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,460
But I thought you said you...
Met your ex-husband last night.

220
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,920
He was at the bookstore doing a reading.

221
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,380
Wait.You met Henri-Michel?How did you know it was him?

222
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,930
Dirty hair,scarf smells like brie.

223
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,150
That's Henri-Michel.

224
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,540
I just can't believe this.I mean,did you read every page,even...

225
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,380
Page 47,yeah.

226
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,250
Okay,Ryan,even if I was that limber,you know I would never do that in the Chunnel.

227
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,220
I get that it's not true,and,uh,

228
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:31,730
you know,I'm sorry that I read it after I promised I wouldn't,but seeing the guy in the flesh...

229
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,190
Okay,but where does this leave us because you can't even really look me in the eyes,so that's not a great sign.

230
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,550
I don't know,I...

231
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,930
I got to shower and get to work.

232
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,550
So you're liking it up here?

233
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,050
Seriously?
Seriously.

234
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,390
I love it.

235
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,580
It's good to see you,Seth.

236
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,810
Good,'cause what I wanted to talk to you about is actually kind of a big deal.

237
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,170
I thought we're going to play golf.

238
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,040
Um,I'm actually up here for something else.

239
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,110
Okay,step into my office.What's on your mind?

240
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,960
Oh,you know,just thinking about marrying your daughter.

241
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,140
You want to marry Summer?

242
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,720
Marry,tie the knot,get hitched; whatever the kids are calling it these days.

243
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,240
Why on Earth would you want to do such a thing?

244
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,910
Well,the median age of married couples is getting increasingly higher,

245
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,330
so Summer and I have decided to buck the trend.

246
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,640
When the world zigs,we're gonna zag.

247
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,860
That's your reason?

248
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,170
I said the zig,then the zag,so...

249
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,730
Yeah,pretty much.
Well,let's back up.

250
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,510
Do you love my daughter?

251
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,280
Well,she's cool,right?

252
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,690
And,uh,she's pretty easy on the eyes.

253
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,510
She's pregnant,isn't she?
No.

254
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,340
Uh,we thought for a second,but thank God,we dodged that bullet,so no.

255
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,120
Yes.

256
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,970
I'll be right there.

257
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,780
I've got to go.

258
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,790
There's a man who's been impaled by what appears to be a unicorn,

259
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,650
Unicorns...
but our conversation's going to continue.

260
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,010
We'll talk about this on my rounds tomorrow.

261
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,280
So does this mean I have your blessing?

262
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,940
They do exist.

263
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,630
Henri?

264
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,500
Too late,it's gone.

265
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,790
Henri,it's me.
Peaches,you have come.

266
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,590
I see I'm in the doghouse.

267
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,610
Henri,these places come with bathtubs.

268
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,300
Bathing is for the bourgeois.

269
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,700
Now,tell me,Peaches,how have I offended you?

270
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,440
It wasn't enough that you had to write a book about me,you had to come to my hometown,too?

271
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,110
You think I want to be here?

272
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,820
This constant sunshine is so banal.

273
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Look at them down there,so clean,so passionless.

274
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,110
No,I am only here to promote my book.

275
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,740
Good,because if you think for one second that this little trip of yours is going to send me scurrying back to France...

276
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,420
Maisnon.No,no.

277
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,150
As they say in your country,"That ship has sailed.

278
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,450
" I see,though,that I'm still have the power to disturb you,yes?

279
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,790
What?No,no,stop that!

280
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,470
I just came here to tell you something.

281
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,520
I'm with someone now.

282
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,870
Ah,oui,I met him last night.

283
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,490
He seemed to roll with it as you say.

284
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,590
Yeah,well,he didn't.

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,140
And if I lose him 'cause of your stupid book...

286
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,160
Oh,Peaches.

287
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,410
Peaches,I cannot stand to see you sad.

288
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,120
What if he really got to know me,hmm?

289
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,350
He would see that I am not nearly as threatening as the fireball of passion he knows from the page,

290
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,200
and that I have no intention of stealing back my Peaches,

291
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,300
though they are looking ripe today.

292
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,340
Hey,up here!

293
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,740
So,okay,what are you saying there?

294
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,210
You're saying that,what,the three of us should go on a date?

295
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,920
Pr\cis\ment.

296
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,420
Peaches,I know I wronged you by writing this book.

297
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:14,720
Let me repay this debt by mending the rift with you and your corn-fed farm boy,hmm?

298
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,160
Now don't move.

299
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,310
The light.

300
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,170
I apologize about the last guy,Mrs.Jacobson.

301
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,510
This one will have his back waxed,I promise.

302
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,930
Two cases of toner will be fine.Thanks.

303
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,750
Copy machine's acting up again.
It was working five minutes ago.

304
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,940
That's what's so frustrating.

305
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,400
Julie,we need to talk.

306
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,140
Ever since Bullet's New Year's Eve party when all of our clients wound up with those young guys...

307
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,150
How funny was that?
you've been acting jumpy.

308
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,510
Overworked?

309
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,700
'Cause that's all it is.

310
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,300
I really love my job.
I know you do.

311
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,470
Which is why I don't want to see you jeopardize it.

312
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,510
I need to get that.

313
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,490
New Match,Julie Cooper speaking.

314
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,810
Hi.Yes.

315
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,460
Yes,of course.

316
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,530
Okay,uh-huh.I'll see you.Bye.

317
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,320
That was my lunch date.

318
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,550
I'm sorry.We'll have to talk later.

319
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,030
I'll see you,okay?

320
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,970
Okay.

321
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,700
Ready,Pancakes?

322
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,900
Summer,you came!

323
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,740
Hi.

324
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,500
I hope I'm wearing the right clothes.

325
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,020
You're not.

326
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,320
You are way too cute.

327
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,860
Hold on right here and I'll introduce you to the girls.

328
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,120
Hos,this is Summer Roberts.

329
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,360
She just got engaged.

330
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,020
Nice to meet you,too.

331
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,440
Summer,this is Bryn and this is Liza.

332
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,040
Oh,you're just in time for a toast.

333
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,430
To the newest Newpsie-wed,Summer Roberts.

334
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,210
Oh,thanks.

335
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,700
Bottoms up.

336
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,430
Hey,listen to this part.

337
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,210
I hoisted her onto the stack of hay and manfully...

338
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,080
Listen,buddy,there's a lot of...

339
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,070
Come on,Taylor,you can do this.

340
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,060
He likes you,you like him,he doesn't think you're a big fat divorc\e whore.

341
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,890
Hi.

342
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,080
Hi.

343
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,300
I was just trying to decide between a burrito or a taco.

344
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,300
Taco,burrito,big decision.

345
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,370
So you weren't trying to psych yourself up to come talk to me?

346
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,960
No,of course not.Yeah,kind of.

347
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,220
Taylor,look,it's,it's fine.I'll get over it.

348
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,380
Really?
Yeah,just give me some time.

349
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,450
Okay,well,there's something that might help speed the healing process.

350
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,590
Cheers,ladies.

351
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,790
Seriously,though,I am so using the champagne fountain.

352
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,080
And what about your colors?

353
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,800
Have you decided?

354
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,870
No,'cause that's what we're gonna be doing at my house tomorrow night.

355
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,680
Am I right,bitches?

356
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,830
But,seriously,they feel just like real boobs.

357
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,650
Let's cheers to that.

358
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,690
You know what?I am so down for that juice fast.

359
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,570
I told Brent that for Christmas,all I want is an African baby.

360
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,010
African babies.

361
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,140
I love them.

362
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,810
Mm-hmm.

363
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,980
Where's the waiter?I need me some more champy.

364
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,020
Hey,mama needs some more bubbly.

365
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,960
How can I help you,ma'am?

366
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,580
Jay?

367
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,180
Did you need something?

368
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,370
She wants some more champs,yo.

369
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,990
Hup,hup.

370
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,380
Summer,Huh?

371
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,870
you okay?

372
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,350
Yeah,just bring on the bubbly.

373
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,140
And the best part,these cops,they really are that stupid.

374
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,820
You really want to watch this?

375
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,110
Are you kidding?

376
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,460
It's my favorite show.

377
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,680
You can't make this stuff up.

378
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,620
Kaitlin,have you seen my cell?

379
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,720
Oh,I didn't know you had a friend over.

380
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,240
Mom,Will.

381
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,850
Will,this is my mother.

382
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,170
Nice to meet you,Mrs.Cooper.

383
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,160
Nice to meet you,Will.

384
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,370
Well,I wish I could stay and talk some more but I'm gonna go look for my phone at the office.

385
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,840
You two look cute together.

386
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,070
Mom...
Enjoy your date.

387
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,230
It's not a date.
Have fun.

388
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,560
Why did you say it wasn't a date?

389
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,670
It's not like dinner and a movie or anything.

390
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,610
Well,we just had dinner,and after this crappy show goes off,we can watch a movie.

391
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,900
Well,you got me there.

392
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,970
So,if this is how you act with your mom,how are you gonna act at school?

393
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,140
Let's just watch this show.

394
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,810
That cop,he just drove a car into a meth lab.

395
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,570
That's hilarious.

396
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,250
I didn't think it was that funny.

397
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,050
Well,maybe it's 'cause you're not high.

398
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,230
Do you want to smoke up?

399
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,780
I think I'm gonna go.

400
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,320
I thought the way you are at school was all just an act.

401
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,360
What are you saying?

402
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,500
Guess I was wrong.

403
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,660
And the lady publishes an inane article accusing me of being a post-structuralist.

404
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,860
Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.Am I right?

405
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,980
So,what are,what are your plans in Newport?

406
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,480
Well,I have been searching for even a nibble of culture,

407
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,200
but I think I must give up.

408
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,540
I only have one more commitment before I leave.

409
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,930
Tomorrow,I appear on your favorite show,Ja Pense.

410
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,290
Wait.Ja Pense is coming to Newport?

411
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,520
What is Ja Pense?

412
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,490
It's this literary talk show.

413
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,940
It's kind of like a French Charlie Rose,but with less interrupting.

414
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,260
They wish to do a field piece on the city that gave birth to Peaches.

415
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,670
They asked if you would appear...

416
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,070
Oh,no,no,Henri,I said the last time was my farewell appearance.

417
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,020
The last time?

418
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,860
You used to go on a French talk show?

419
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,410
Just a handful of times,though.

420
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,680
My favorite had to be that one roundtable we had Anäis Nin's bisexuality.

421
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,950
Things got heat-ed.

422
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,770
Oh,that reminds me,my publisher want to do a translation of Nin's erotic poetry.

423
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,160
Of course,I recommended you.

424
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,810
You...

425
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,890
Me?Seriously?

426
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,660
Of course.

427
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,330
Don't you think Taylor would be an inspired choice?

428
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,590
I don't,I don't know...

429
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,800
Nin's poetry.

430
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,100
People say it's pornography.

431
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,910
but it is really just deeply,deeply sexual.

432
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,890
And Taylor understands Nin like no other.

433
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,050
What was that poem you translated to amuse yourself?

434
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,890
Oh,mm.

435
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:08,720
"And the day came "where the risk remained tight "in the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.

436
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,710
" C'est tres beau,{a.

437
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,040
xxx

438
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,020
Well,I'm exhausted.

439
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,990
Uh,would you give Taylor a ride home?

440
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,850
Great.Good night.

441
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,400
Ryan?

442
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,020
Ryan!

443
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,180
Wait!

444
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,360
Ryan,what's wrong?
Nothing.

445
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,790
It's just,we've been in there four hours.

446
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,730
First course,second course,cheese course...

447
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,860
And you couldn't stop imagining it,right?

448
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,210
Me with him,page 47.

449
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,270
Ryan,I thought you said you were okay with this?

450
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,410
I guess I'm not.

451
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,340
I'm sorry.
Ryan...

452
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,460
Ryan!

453
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,260
m gonna be in court all day,so don't bother holding any of those shrimp tacos for me.

454
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,670
Tell me you are not reading that book about Taylor.

455
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,380
French philosophy at 7:00 in the morning.

456
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,480
Okay,I'll bite.

457
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,170
I read the book,Taylor's book.

458
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,130
So you must be feeling...

459
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,230
I'm not freaked out.

460
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,610
Even page 47?

461
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,520
No,no,I mean,I was,right?

462
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,240
But then,uh,last night we,uh,we went out with her ex.

463
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,990
And you know,it was all art and philosophy and how she used to go on that French talk show.

464
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,950
And you know that part in the book where she goes out to dinner with Jacques Chirac?

465
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,920
That's actually true.

466
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,110
Oh,so you're thinking "How can this kid from Chino be hanging out with that crowd?

467
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,650
" Pretty much.

468
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,350
Well,listen,I don't know anything about the world of French intellectuals,

469
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,080
but I do know Taylor Townsend,and seems to me,she thinks you are pretty terrific.

470
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,790
So just talk to her.

471
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,140
Or you can sit here,reading your Sartre.

472
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,890
I'll talk to her.
Good.

473
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,940
Hey,you know who else the French love?

474
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,060
Jerry Lewis.
Really?

475
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,250
Hey,lady!

476
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,670
G'bye!

477
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,240
Hey,babe,how was your date last night?

478
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,560
I already told you,it wasn't a date.

479
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,680
Why not?Will seems nice and very cute.

480
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,400
He is,he's a major dork.

481
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,200
You like him.
No,I don't.

482
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,350
Oh,my God,you really,really like him.

483
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,280
Oh,my God!No,I don't.

484
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,860
You think he's dorkalicious.
Stop it.

485
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,910
You want his big dorky arms wrapped around you while he gives you big dorky kisses.

486
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,610
Mom,I'm your child.
Sorry.

487
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,110
And even if I did like him,which I don't,it doesn't matter

488
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,550
'cause I screwed up,and he doesn't like me anyway.

489
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,430
Whatever it is you did,I'm sure you'll fix it.

490
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,820
At the very least,you have to try.

491
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,400
What are you doing,anyway?

492
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,800
My cell phone wasn't at the office.

493
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,120
So you think it's in the frying pan?

494
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,770
I've checked everywhere else,and I just really need it,okay?

495
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,020
Okay.

496
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,110
Oh,hello,I'm calling for Julie Cooper.

497
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,070
I'm just confirming the details of your date tonight.

498
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,280
That's right,Four Seasons,room 321.

499
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,920
Oh,I'm sorry,Mrs.Jacobson.8:00 isn't going to work.

500
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,310
We're going to have to reschedule.

501
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,770
Thank you.

502
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,790
Taylor?

503
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,180
You don't want to come in here,Ryan.

504
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
I'm reenacting page 112.

505
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,110
Look,I'm sorry,okay?I...

506
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,760
I wasn't freaked out about the sex,just so you know.

507
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,770
It was the,uh,you know,all those people you were talking about,the writers,the philosophers,people I never even heard of.

508
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,080
I just thought it was out of our league.

509
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:09,630
I just,I didn't grow up going to the opera or reading French poetry.

510
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:15,970
Ryan,you're just as smart as Henri-Michel,and I don't want you to be anyone else than who you are.

511
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,710
Thank you.

512
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,820
God,I wish I hadn't said yes.

513
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,800
What?What did you say yes to?

514
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,440
I agreed to go on Ja Pense tonight.

515
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,710
You know,I can cancel it.

516
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,380
No,no,look,I want you to be who you are.

517
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,990
In fact,I'd like to come.

518
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,410
Uh,okay.

519
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,570
Yeah?
Yeah,sure.

520
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,250
Now,I have a few minutes before I have to get to work.

521
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,030
And all that talk about page 112...

522
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,080
Kaitlin's right downstairs.

523
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,930
I know,but my impression of the vicar's very quiet.

524
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,280
It's really,you won't even hear it.
Really?Really?

525
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,370
No.Don't,don't!

526
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,500
So what was the deal with that unicorn?

527
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:57,200
It seems the guy dressed his horse up as a unicorn for his daughter's birthday,

528
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:02,700
and things went terribly awry,but it taught us all about the value of family.

529
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,060
And speaking of family,have you decided to bless our sacred union?

530
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,350
I've thought about your proposal,Seth,and seriously,I can't.

531
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,960
It's not because I dislike you,Seth,but I don't think that you really appreciate Summer.

532
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,780
What?
No.

533
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,540
Look,Dr.Roberts,with all due respect,uh,

534
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:28,150
you have a lot of grounds with which to object to this admittedly harebrained idea,

535
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,640
but if there's one thing that is undeniable,it's that I appreciate your daughter.

536
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:38,370
As you made very clear yesterday when you called her "kind of cool and easy on the eyes.

537
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,160
" You got to do better than that.

538
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:44,500
Well,she's hilarious,for one,and my favorite thing in the world is to make her laugh

539
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,550
because she has a crazy honk of a laugh I think Nelson from The Simpsons...

540
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,840
She does have a contagious laugh.

541
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,850
Yeah,stop me before I say that she makes me a better man,but she makes me more of a man.

542
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,630
Certainly less of a boy.

543
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,390
I love every minute I spend with your daughter,sir.I really do.

544
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,960
So this wasn't some goof.

545
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,620
You really want to spend the rest of your life with her?

546
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,620
I do,seriously.

547
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,480
Then come talk to me after you finish college and you got a chance at supporting her.

548
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,690
Got to go.

549
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,060
Have a safe flight.

550
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:38,720
So Brent and I were,like,we don't want to kill any endangered owls that live under our deck,

551
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,010
but I really want a Jacuzzi.

552
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,060
Oh,girl,you got to get your hot tub,right,huh?

553
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,890
Owls...

554
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,070
What,are you supposed to be,my conscience?

555
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,480
Maybe.

556
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,480
Is this what you really want?

557
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,130
Yes,it is.

558
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,710
Uh-oh,someone's had too much champy.

559
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,020
Summer's talking to herself.

560
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:06,090
Well,I know exactly what will snap her out of it.

561
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,530
Oh,my God,your dress!
I know.

562
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,050
I thought you could try it on.

563
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,420
I was really anorexic when I wore it,not to brag.

564
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,070
Oh,good for you.
Here.

565
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,450
Thanks.

566
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,450
You'd better not watch me change.

567
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,030
Hi

568
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,590
So,you're the friend Mademoiselle Townsend?

569
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,640
Uh,yes,yes.What's happening?

570
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,960
They started out talking about The Season For Peaches,

571
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,650
and now somehow,they are into Existentialism of the 21st century,

572
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,060
the responsibility of the post-colonial age,Johnny Depp.

573
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,270
amazing

574
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,060
I like it,and I think it looks good.

575
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,180
Well,as far as presents go,it's very beautiful.

576
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,580
Look,Seth is asking my dad,okay?

577
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,600
This wedding is happening,so I need to make the best of it.

578
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,080
Will you please stop trying to rescue me?

579
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,400
The only person who can save you,Summer,is you.

580
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,250
Okay,A) you look ten times better than Holly;

581
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,170
B) don't tell her that,

582
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,200
and C) we have the most rocked-out idea for your ringbearer.

583
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,850
Who's my ringbearer?

584
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,970
Cute little bunny.

585
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,030
Pancakes!
Check it,Summer.

586
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:38,950
We just realized that we can totally dye your bunny pink so that he'll match the bridesmaid's dresses.

587
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,740
Isn't that so adorable,you just want to kill yourself?

588
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,570
We're just gonna do a test run right now,aren't we,Rumples?Yes,we are!

589
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,130
Okay...

590
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,600
Pancakes!

591
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,890
His name is Pancakes.

592
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,620
Bitch,what's wrong?

593
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,660
Everything!

594
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,330
Good night.

595
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,620
Ja Pense!

596
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,940
You were amazing.

597
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,230
Thank you.

598
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,690
Okay,I'm gonna go say good-bye,then I'll be right back.

599
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,340
Okay,all right.
Okay.

600
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,000
And Ryan,what did you think?

601
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,850
I thought you guys were great,not that I understood a word of it.

602
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,300
We're going to celebrate with some Pinot Noir,and I would love to pick your brain on David Hume.

603
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,130
Sounds great.Who's David Hume?

604
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,240
Good question.

605
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,420
I'm sure you ask yourself this every day.

606
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,260
Last night after you left,Taylor told me of your studies,

607
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:49,400
the series of articles you wrote on the origins of skepticism.

608
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,340
For the Vienna Journal?

609
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,800
Maybe one day they will be expounded into a book.

610
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:04,260
After I heard about your research,traveling to Humes' personal archives in Edinburgh,even I was impressed.

611
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,380
I'm sure you were

612
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,960
to try it.
Yeah.

613
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,930
Can I talk to you a second?
Yeah.

614
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,390
Excuse me.

615
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,060
Thank you.I couldn't get out of there.

616
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,830
Why did you tell him I was writing a book?

617
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,990
What?

618
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,410
You couldn't tell him the truth,that I work in a Mexican restaurant?

619
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,440
Okay,Ryan,what did you expect me to do?

620
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,980
Because you said about three words all night and then you just ran away.

621
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,620
Henri asked me if you were on medication.

622
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,940
Oh,so now you care about his opinion?
Yes.Yes,I do.

623
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,090
Because I could see him sitting there judging you and I hated it.

624
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,790
I just wanted him to know how smart you were.

625
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,700
And maybe it was the wrong thing to do,but the story just kind of came spilling out of me.

626
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:44,750
All right,okay,you lied to make me look good- I get that- but the thing is,I think part of you wishes it were true.

627
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,140
No,Ryan,please,I just want you to be yourself.

628
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,930
Taylor...

629
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,020
I don't know,I...

630
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,520
I think this is what we've known from the beginning.

631
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,340
What?What's that?
We're different.

632
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,670
So what?Everyone's different.

633
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,580
It's what makes the world beautiful.

634
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,690
Right?

635
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,210
Okay,Ryan,I'm sorry.

636
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,330
What do you want me to do to make it better?

637
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,540
I think I should go.

638
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,280
Ms.Jacobson?

639
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,540
Hello?

640
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,400
Spencer.

641
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,890
No,I didn't get any of your messages.

642
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,120
My cell phone's been MIA for two days now.

643
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,460
I'm retracing my steps.

644
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,070
What do you mean Mrs.Jacobson got canceled on?

645
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,320
What...what partner?

646
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,150
Oh,my God.

647
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,100
Good champagne.

648
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,400
Sure you don't want any?

649
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,360
Uh,no,thank you.

650
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,480
Well...

651
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,840
shall we get down to business?

652
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,030
Uh,actually,Ken...

653
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,280
I'm new at this.

654
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,960
Could you walk me through it?

655
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,550
Step one: you put the money on the night stand.

656
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,330
Step two: we get nasty.

657
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,130
Or nice,depending on your taste.

658
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,280
I thought Julie told you all the rules.

659
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,430
She did.

660
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:27,270
I just thought...

661
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,740
Would you excuse me?I,uh...

662
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,130
I left some toys in-in-in my car.

663
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,710
I'll be right back.

664
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,870
Toys?

665
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,140
Sweet.

666
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,120
Hey,man,that looks good on you.

667
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,660
I like the red one.

668
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,430
Trust me,that's a woman's coat.

669
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,820
Hey.

670
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,130
I just came to clear a few things up.

671
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,380
I like you,okay?

672
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,410
Okay.

673
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,150
Maybe I messed things up so you can't like me back.

674
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,900
But I just wanted you to know that.

675
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,370
You don't.

676
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,430
No,no,I do,it's just...

677
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,200
Stupid winter clothing drive.

678
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,390
You may not know this,but there are homeless people that live in Newport.

679
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,750
Really?

680
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,750
Hi,Darryl.
Hi,Bill.

681
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,690
Hey,Kaitlin.
Hey,Kaitlin.

682
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,720
Hey,what you do say I give you a call when I leave here?

683
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,600
Okay.

684
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,710
Just can't believe this winter clothing drive is salting my game.

685
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,580
Kirsten,I can explain.

686
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,060
That you've been running a prostitution ring through our business.

687
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,410
It...

688
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,830
it just...it just happened.

689
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,030
There are dozens of names here.

690
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,540
Hercules,Commander Snake...

691
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,040
Kirsten,I am so sorry,but I promise...

692
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,930
I have known you a long time,Julie.

693
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,020
This isn't just a matter of cloudy judgment and questionable morals.

694
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,430
It's breaking federal law.

695
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,200
I understand.

696
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,960
I do.

697
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,490
And I deeply,deeply regret it,but if we just quit now,we can act like it never happened.

698
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,310
I wish I could.

699
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,930
I want you out of here by Monday.

700
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,380
Kirsten,please.

701
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,660
I'm going to do you one more favor.

702
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,630
I'm not going to call the police and I'm not going to tell Sandy.

703
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,570
You're on your own.

704
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,920
Hello?

705
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,200
Caterpillar,it's me.

706
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,690
You're calling me now?

707
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,070
Look,I already sent them all home.Isn't that enough?

708
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,850
What are you talking about?

709
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,050
Wait,where are you?

710
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,220
I'm in my dorm room.

711
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,780
Summer,I've been doing some out-of-body work.

712
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,930
I had a vision of you surrounded by owls in a white dress,

713
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,740
and Summer,the owls,they were crying for you.

714
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,830
God,I'm okay now.

715
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,130
I just...kind of got engaged.

716
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,740
That's amazing.

717
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,380
I'll weave you guys something ASAP.

718
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,160
Jay,I'm so confused.

719
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,440
I don't know what I want.

720
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:45,280
Summer,in order for two halves to be whole,each half must be whole on its own.

721
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,830
That is really true.

722
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,420
I'm gonna sing you a song.

723
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,450
* Moon,stars are above you... *

724
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,080
Oh,man sitting by himself in the dark.

725
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,170
It's not a good sign.

726
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,740
Are you okay?
I've been better.

727
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,460
I don't know what's going on with me and Taylor.

728
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,450
I think maybe we're just too different.

729
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,680
You said that like it's a bad thing.

730
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,580
Look at Kirsten and me.
Right.

731
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,750
Well,you know,you guys have your own rhythm.

732
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,930
Well,yeah,it took years to figure that out.

733
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,320
I love Kirsten dearly,and-and...

734
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,770
and still it gets complicated.

735
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,750
So how do you know you know,whether you're good,different or just...

736
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,390
From opposite planets?
Right.

737
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:47,320
At the end of the day,you either focus on what separates you or you focus on what holds you together.

738
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,550
And it's up to you.

739
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,350
Hey,stranger.

740
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,810
Hi.

741
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,840
How was Seattle?

742
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,620
It was good,good.

743
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,500
Yeah?
Yeah.

744
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,320
How was my dad when you asked him?

745
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,660
Cold,warm,lukewarm?

746
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,940
Well,he did not give us permission to get married,at least for the next few years.

747
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,170
damn.

748
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,390
Yeah.Okay,well,uh,here's,here's the deal.

749
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,420
I went up there,knowing your dad would say no and that I could get out of this,

750
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,710
but I realized I don't want out.

751
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,180
I want in with you.

752
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,380
forever,you know?

753
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,690
So,I think we should stay engaged.

754
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,980
It doesn't have to be today,but...

755
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,120
someday.

756
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:13,150
Seth,I realized something,too,while you were gone.

757
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,740
It turns out I have no idea who I am.

758
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,600
In the past few months,I went from being a hard-core environmentalist to a Newpsie-wed in training.

759
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,250
You're a Newpsie?
For 48 hours.

760
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:31,240
The point is,I don't think that you can be with someone until you can be with yourself.

761
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:36,090
I think it's something I need to figure out.

762
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,290
Oh,that sounds like a...

763
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,300
I guess it's a no.

764
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,560
I'm sorry.

765
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,880
Well,I think I'm gonna...

766
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,220
I'm going to see you tomorrow,okay?

767
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,300
Okay.

768
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,620
Hey...

769
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,320
you should take this...

770
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:01,090
because we might need it someday.

771
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,600
Please,don't be sad,Peaches.

772
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,760
Ryan?

773
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Taylor,I'm...

774
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,270
What is it?

775
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,360
Nothing.It's just...thought...

776
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,890
Nothing.

777
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,580
You know,it's getting late,Henri,so I should go.

778
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,760
Stay a little longer...

779
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,280
please?

780
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,410
Okay.
