1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,877
-Previously on The O. C. :
-Rebecca is gone.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,594
-What did you say to her?
-I asked her if she was in love with you.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,074
And she said she was.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,431
-I tried to tell Summer, and I couldn't.
-So you' re here to break up with me?

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,837
-Then I told her.
-I believe in taking every precaution.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,713
-Caleb's gonna ask for a DNA test.
-You can't let him adopt you.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,195
-What are you talking about?
-He might not be your dad.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,078
When we were about to...

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,191
-...there was this voice in my head.
-Seth?

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,595
Have a great time in ltaly.
I'm cool with it.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,270
I'm over you.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,871
Well, I cannot believe I'm saying this,
but it's raining in the O. C.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,877
I know, it's crazy.
I gotta tell you...

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,076
... traffic is a nightmare.
The 405 is jammed.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,196
The 5, the 7 10, they 're all gridlocked.

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,318
Stay safe, stay dry,
and let 's all pray for sunshine again.

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,558
Hey, I kind of need to talk to you...

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,599
-...so you coming over for breakfast?
-Need to clean. Swing by the pool house.

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,751
Look out the window.
It's the sequence...

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,956
-...from Day After Tomorrow.
-It's just rain.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,395
-I'll be here if you need to talk.
-Dude, come on.

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,036
I'm a child of Southern California.
I can't go out in this. I'll melt.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,189
-You wanna do it over the phone?
-Works for me.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,911
So does this weather.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,993
It's very reflective
of my current emotional state.

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,316
Yeah, I know what you mean.

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,789
So I'm gonna lose her, man.

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,520
Summer's leaving for ltaly tomorrow.
It'll be nothing...

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,716
...but cannolis and canoodling
with Zach.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,394
Haven't talked to Lindsay
since she ran out of Caleb's.

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,711
-You should talk to her.
-She won't talk to anyone.

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,394
I don't know. Maybe it'll
all work out for the best.

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,192
Yeah, maybe.

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,312
You don't think that's God trying
to tell us anything, do you?

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,040
Not gonna take that chance.
I've gotta talk to Lindsay.

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,872
You think we should stick together?

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,917
Kind of two by two, like Noah did.

38
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,275
He's very wise, Ryan. He had a beard.

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,550
It's just rain. It can't hurt us.

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,395
Not worse than our women can.

41
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,710
It's 1 0:00.

42
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,789
Are you gonna stay in bed all day?

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,552
Maybe.

44
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,756
I like it here.

45
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,992
Oh, I feel like-- Like we've
become like strangers.

46
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,197
Well, I was taught never
to talk to strangers.

47
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,994
Funny.

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,151
Not trying to be.

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,156
-Well, I'm sorry you're upset.
-Really?

50
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,999
Because the last time I checked,
everything was my fault.

51
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,549
-I never said that.
-Not in those exact words.

52
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,198
-Hello.
-Sandy.

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,275
-Rebecca.
-Now I'm up.

54
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,357
I wanted to run, Sandy. I...

55
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,909
...got on a bus. I was on my way.

56
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,992
But I realized I couldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

57
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,559
As long as you don't flee...

58
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,117
...we have a chance with your case.
Please, stay where you are.

59
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,235
-Hey.
-Good morning, Marissa.

60
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,753
Oh, I didn't know you
had a friend over last night.

61
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,518
-I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol.
-Alex.

62
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,359
Oh, so you're the feisty young lady
Caleb mentioned.

63
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,557
I was just making bagels.
If the Cohens can do it, why can't we?

64
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,069
None for me, thanks.
I don't eat breakfast.

65
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,198
That's very punk of you.
I used to like the punk in my day.

66
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,755
-Mom.
-You're right, Marissa. It still is my day.

67
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,911
I was just being modest.

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,797
We'll be keeping kosher in no time.

69
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,312
So how about this weather, huh?

70
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,354
-It's unbelievable.
-Yeah.

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,915
I think I have to go.
But very nice to meet you.

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,231
Rock on.

73
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,513
She seems nice.

74
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,076
No problem if you want
a friend to stay over.

75
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,232
-lf you could let me know beforehand--
-You didn't get the memo?

76
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,917
Marissa, I don't think it's too much
to ask to know what's going on...

77
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,116
...underneath my roof. That's all.

78
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,670
You want to know what's going on
with me? I'm gonna tell you the truth.

79
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,348
No screaming. No crying.
Just the truth.

80
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,028
You have no idea how happy
it makes me to hear that.

81
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,959
Hold that thought.
Alex is my girlfriend.

82
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,230
I know. I'm happy that
you've made a friend.

83
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,590
-Though I hope we keep seeing Summer.
-No, Mom.

84
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,910
Not my friend who's a girl.

85
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,036
My girlfriend.

86
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,471
Yeah.

87
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,350
-What are you doing?
-You wouldn't open the door.

88
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,114
-Because I don't want to see anyone.
-Please let me in.

89
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,874
I rode my bike here.
Bicycle, monsoon...

90
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,389
...seriously flawed plan. I'm freezing.

91
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,639
Come on.

92
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,639
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, no.

93
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,518
All right. Hold on.

94
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,475
Okay. Come here.

95
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,359
Well, you could've opened the door
for me a half-hour ago.

96
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,838
I thought you were Caleb, showing up
to drive me to my DNA test.

97
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,353
He scheduled you a DNA test?

98
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,831
It was either that or the pony.

99
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,476
-So you're not going?
-No way.

100
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,275
But you're going somewhere.

101
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,119
Yeah, I was gonna pack up
to move in with my dad.

102
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,350
But since he might not be my dad...

103
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,798
...I was thinking
about packing up for...

104
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,030
...well, maybe...

105
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,109
...I don't know, Chicago.

106
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,714
"l don't know, Chicago"?

107
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,909
Yeah. We have family there.

108
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,276
Actual, no-doubt-about-it family.

109
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,156
And my mom is thinking that
it getting out about her and Caleb...

110
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,392
...that maybe the best thing
would be...

111
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,039
...to start over.

112
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,395
And you'd go with her.

113
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,918
Well, if Caleb's not my dad,
what else can I do?

114
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,910
Except you don't know
he's not your dad.

115
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,755
I don't know that I want to know.

116
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,110
That's not gonna stop
until you know the truth.

117
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,069
And besides, if you are his daughter...

118
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,196
...at least you'll have a reason to stay.

119
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,312
I mean, the other reason.

120
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,638
I don't know, Ryan.

121
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,112
A DNA test just sounds so sci-fi scary.

122
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,679
I'll go with you.

123
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,394
Okay.

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,753
Who looks good in this much yellow?

125
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,833
Zach?

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,754
Oh, thank God. Look, I really
don't know about this dress.

127
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,673
Hi. It's just your friendly
neighborhood Seth Cohen.

128
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,399
-Okay. What?
-Well, I look stupid in hats.

129
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,630
And I don't have a raincoat...

130
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,917
...so Spider-Man is the only
protective waterproof headgear I own.

131
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,395
T oo bad you weren't wearing
protective headgear...

132
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,790
...when you were dropped
on your head as a child.

133
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,078
Zing. So listen...

134
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,279
...I know that my visits to your bedroom
are probably getting a little bit repetitive.

135
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,154
-You are helping me miss you less.
-That's great.

136
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,151
So....

137
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,633
-You're really going, huh?
-Yeah. Of course I'm going.

138
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,519
How could I not be?
I am in his sister's wedding.

139
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,954
-You are?
-Why do you think...

140
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,317
...I look like lemon meringue?
Bridesmaid's dress.

141
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,471
You're a bridesmaid?

142
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,271
That's really....

143
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,871
-Guess you and Zach are serious.
-Cohen, are we gonna do this again?

144
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,713
Or did you, like, actually come here
to advance the plot.

145
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,314
You're, like, part of his family.

146
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,393
Okay.

147
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,632
The reason I came by is to tell you...

148
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,312
...you need to take a special plug
for the outlets there.

149
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,677
For your hair dryer. Don't want you
to brownout Western Europe.

150
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,390
Goodbye, again.
And you have a safe flight.

151
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,157
-Thanks for coming.
-Oh, it wasn't easy.

152
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,557
It rains in Southern California,
all of a sudden, nobody can drive.

153
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,911
You're shaking.

154
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,234
I don't wanna run anymore.

155
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,472
-Come back with me.
-And do what? Sit in jail?

156
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,999
Destroy your marriage?

157
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,788
My marriage has
nothing to do with your case.

158
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,197
Come back with me. We'll explore
amnesty or some kind of plea bargain.

159
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,992
I think we can make this right.

160
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,551
-I told her.
-You told who what?

161
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,076
My mom, about us.
I can't believe it, but I did.

162
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,073
You-- You told her.

163
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,193
Well, I thought you'd be happy.

164
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,437
No, l-- It just depends.
Did you tell her to piss her off?

165
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,434
Hey, look. I told her
so this could be real.

166
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,877
For us.

167
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,632
So, what happens now?

168
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,479
She's probably having
a meltdown. I can't go home.

169
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,272
-So stay here.
-You sure?

170
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,311
Yeah.

171
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,791
But first, let's get you
out of these wet clothes.

172
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,230
Thanks for coming with me.

173
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,675
What's more romantic
than a DNA test?

174
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,913
Yeah. Maybe we can donate
kidneys one Saturday night.

175
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,156
Now we're talking.

176
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,235
So if, in 24 hours,
it turns out Caleb is my dad....

177
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,790
You talking dirty to me?

178
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,313
Sorry.

179
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,473
Well, if the tests come back positive,
then he'll adopt you, right?

180
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,473
Right.

181
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,035
Except, I don't know
if I want him to adopt me.

182
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,430
Well, you're not going to Chicago.

183
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,318
Let's just forget about that option.

184
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,638
No, l--

185
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,833
I know that.

186
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,275
I couldn't handle the cold...

187
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,317
-...and the wind.
-lt is the Windy City.

188
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,198
I'm not a big fan of deep-dish pizza.

189
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,555
Thin crust, only way to go.

190
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,635
And I couldn't be without you.

191
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,799
So I come in right below pizza.
That's good to know.

192
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,430
Yeah, well, a girl's gotta eat.

193
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,071
What are you doing here
late on a Saturday?

194
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,995
Oh, hey, Julie. I'm just trying
to distract myself and failing.

195
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,276
-What about you?
-Same.

196
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,476
How long is this weather
supposed to last?

197
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,993
News says 24 hours.

198
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,357
-I don't think my hair can take it.
-I don't know if my marriage can.

199
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,279
Gossip?

200
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,839
You have no idea.

201
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,317
Want to break into
Caleb's liquor cabinet, dish some dirt?

202
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,791
-I'd like to use this on Caleb sometimes.
-I know what you mean.

203
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,592
-More Scotch?
-Sure, why not?

204
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,349
Nothing like a rainy day to reflect
on what a mess your life is, huh?

205
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,111
I mean, not yours, per se.
It was, you know, the universal "you. "

206
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,393
My life is a pretty big mess.
I may even beat you on that one.

207
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,750
Oh, I don't think so, honey,
but go ahead.

208
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,436
Well, my husband is currently
transporting a fugitive...

209
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,114
...who used to be his ex-girlfriend.

210
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,034
Well, I'll see your fugitive former flame
and raise you a lesbian daughter.

211
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,798
Marissa?

212
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,229
Well, I'm sure it's just a phase.

213
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,436
It was for me.

214
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,072
And it is for you too.
You guys will work it out.

215
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,877
-I'm not so sure.
-No...

216
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,156
...Kirsten, seriously,
you have to work it out.

217
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,678
I couldn't handle it if you didn't. You
two are the moral center of the universe.

218
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,999
You're Sandy and Kirsten.

219
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,150
Yeah, well, now we're
Sandy and Kirsten and Rebecca.

220
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,515
-Oh, no, police.
-Take it easy. We're fine.

221
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,392
The road's
completely washed out ahead.

222
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,677
We need you to turn around. We should
have the road open by morning.

223
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,671
-Not till morning?
-Yes, sir.

224
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,229
There's lodging a few miles back.

225
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,198
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

226
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,788
You're listening to Boyz ll Men?

227
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,630
I can think of no sadder song
in the whole world.

228
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,155
So I'm guessing it didn't go well.

229
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,149
Unless I can think of one last grand
romantic gesture, Summer's gone.

230
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,230
I remember when I first heard
about Summer.

231
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,119
We were sailing. You said
you named your boat after her...

232
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,555
...which I thought weird.
You'd never talked to her.

233
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,235
Eureka, Ryan. Can't believe I just
said "eureka. " That's okay. That's it.

234
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,032
-What's it?
-Thing to win her back.

235
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,954
The grand romantic gesture that's
gonna put Zachary's Euro-trip to shame.

236
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,557
I shall take her on a sailing adventure
aboard the Summer Breeze.

237
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,192
-Except you sold the boat for bus fare.
-I did. Damn it.

238
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,995
Eureka, Ryan. I shall buy back
the Summer Breeze.

239
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,594
-Yes.
-Except with what money?

240
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,872
If I wanted my parade rained on,
I'd step outside. Let me ask you.

241
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,429
-Do you like the shape of the idea even?
-Definitely.

242
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,477
So all I need is money. Hang on.

243
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,234
Yes. Got the answer.
But before I say "eureka" again...

244
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,039
...do you see any other potential flaws,
holes in my plan?

245
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,479
-No.
-Then, eureka, Ryan. Eu-freaking-reka.

246
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,678
Turn this music off.
It's depressing me.

247
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,118
Come in.

248
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,518
-Hey. Hey, Zach.
-Hi.

249
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,754
You're listening to Boyz ll Men?
This song is so sad.

250
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,279
Yeah, I was waiting
for "Motownphilly. "

251
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,835
Oh, right.

252
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,559
-Thanks.
-Oh, my God.

253
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,432
You're taking all that?

254
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,512
Well, yeah. I don't want the ltalians
to think I have bad style.

255
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,159
I am representing America.

256
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,915
Oh, that's very patriotic of you. I just--

257
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,672
We're gonna be backpacking.

258
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,558
You know, going
from hostel to hostel.

259
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,115
You haven't seen hostile
till you put me in one.

260
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,629
No, it'll be fun. An adventure.

261
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,157
Don't you think it's a little much I'm in
your sister's wedding? I've met her once.

262
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,911
No, I told you. She doesn't have many
friends. She's very alienating and severe.

263
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,313
-Do you not want to come?
-No, l--

264
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,948
Well, no-- Yes, I just--

265
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,558
I have to get a special plug
for my hair dryer.

266
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,676
I already got you one.

267
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,877
Of course you did.

268
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,311
Seth. You here to fight crime?

269
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,799
No, actually.
I'm here to get my job back.

270
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,879
No. No, no, no. What, you were like the
flakiest employee in Bait Shop history.

271
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,429
That's an easy accomplishment?
And Homer, the beer guy?

272
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,870
How long would you be
keeping your job this time?

273
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,469
Until I can make $500,
so however long that is.

274
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,193
Please. Alex, Alex, Alex. Please.

275
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,797
I don't know, Seth. "With great power
comes great responsibility. "

276
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,710
Yes. Oh, thank you. Listen to me,
it's gonna be like no one...

277
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,673
...ever peed in the bathrooms.
The only other thing...

278
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,751
...is I kind of need an advance.

279
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,515
Well, you're lucky today was payday.

280
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,712
Hey, Alex. Should I be getting dressed,
or are we going back to...

281
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,592
...bed?

282
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,032
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

283
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,992
Oh, my God.

284
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,076
Let me get this straight.
You broke up with me for Marissa?

285
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,793
-Want your money?
-Who better...

286
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,315
...than a superhero
understands secret identity?

287
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,754
-Okay.
-Now, hold on.

288
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,354
I just want to make sure
I have the visual.

289
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,750
Okay, I got it. Great. Thank you.

290
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,034
Hey, listen, Alex, thank you. Both
of you, for everything. I mean, keep...

291
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,834
-...doing what you're doing. I like it.
-Okay.

292
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,636
So, what will it be?
Ding Dongs or cheese sticks?

293
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,588
Well, this is a dessert wine,
so I'd say Ding Dongs, of course.

294
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,390
Oh, really?
Well, this is one classy picnic.

295
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,517
We got...

296
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,398
...washed-out road...

297
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,118
...rain storm...

298
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,554
...cheap motel.

299
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,508
Cheap wine. Has all the makings
of a great slasher movie.

300
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,549
-Getting stuck here overnight.
-Well, that's El Niño for you.

301
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,118
Or fate.

302
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,832
Here we are, all alone.
No one knows where we are.

303
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,793
It's like nothing else exists.

304
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,316
Tomorrow we head back to reality.
But, for now...

305
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,311
...it's just us.

306
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,319
Except it's not just us.

307
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,513
It hasn't been just us for 20 years.

308
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,999
I gotta call Kirsten, say good night.

309
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,355
I appreciate you
selling me my boat back.

310
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,193
When I sold it I was
in desperate straits.

311
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,828
Low blood sugar, no snacks.

312
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,310
Listen, just a heads-up.
I made some modifications to her.

313
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,794
Modifications. Terrific.

314
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,350
That's very Melville of you.
Referring to the boat as a she.

315
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,870
Dear God. She's a slut.

316
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,356
-Hello?
-Hey, honey.

317
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,954
Hi.

318
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,434
I tried you last night.

319
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,435
I got your messages.
I passed out early.

320
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,158
It was a long day at the office.

321
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,075
I was hoping the rain
would've stopped by now...

322
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,515
...then they said they'd have
the road opened up.

323
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,236
Right. The conveniently
washed-out road.

324
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,798
Believe me when I tell you...

325
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,678
... I' m walking home if I have to.

326
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,352
Just get home.

327
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,431
One way or the other.

328
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,151
I'll see you soon.

329
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,836
-You got a minute?
-Not really.

330
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,672
I would like to talk to you
about your friend Alex.

331
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,229
-I'm sure you would, Mom.
-Look, Marissa...

332
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,158
...I experimented
when I was your age.

333
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,279
Albeit it involved a little Mötley Crüe
and a lot of Jäger.

334
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,798
-Way too much information.
-I'm just saying...

335
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,316
...I understand that
this is a phase. But...

336
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,311
...I won't make a big deal
if you don't.

337
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,876
Right, this way you avoid
any public embarrassment.

338
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,197
Where are you going?

339
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,232
-I'm moving out.
-What?

340
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,035
You have my cell if Caleb kicks
and you need help counting your cash.

341
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,389
-What's the plan here?
-We get the boat in the pool.

342
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,949
I get Summer to come over, voilà.

343
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,798
You take Summer for a
spin in the pool in the Gimmie Sex?

344
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,359
It's a symbolic gesture, Ryan.

345
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,159
One that'll get Summer
to fall back in love with me, okay?

346
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,313
-Okay.
-Oh, by the way, our exes...

347
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,234
...are dating each other now.

348
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,391
Marissa and Alex, no longer
welcome in the red states.

349
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,835
That I wouldn't have predicted.

350
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,632
-Think it's for real?
-God, I hope so. I just want them to....

351
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,919
I'm not gonna ask why there's
a boat in the living room.

352
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,039
It's an objective correlative, Mother.
I'm getting Summer back.

353
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,475
Lindsay called. The tests are back.
She wants us to go with her.

354
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,437
This is it? There's not another room
full of Samsonites somewhere?

355
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,591
I promise. Thank you.

356
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,670
You know what? I forgot Princess
Sparkle. I can't go without her. Here.

357
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,276
As long as you leave her stable.
I'll meet you in the car.

358
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,396
-Hello?
-Hey, Summer, it's me.

359
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,353
-Why am I not surprised?
-So, what are you doing?

360
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,949
Don't know, leaving
for the airport to go to ltaly.

361
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,196
Listen, Summer, I have
something to show you.

362
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,830
-Okay? And not in a creepy way.
-What you're selling I ain't buying.

363
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,315
Okay, Summer, before
you get on that plane...

364
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,199
...I need you to give me
one last shot, okay?

365
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,959
You had your shot.

366
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,554
Remember when we were dating
and you sailed away?

367
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,638
-That's what I wanna talk about.
-You have no right to do this.

368
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,190
-Not now, okay? I'm hanging up.
-Okay, then just tell me this:

369
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,714
I mean, when you're with him, is it...?

370
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,716
Is it like what we had?

371
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,514
You know, I can't remember
that far back.

372
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,429
Clearly, Cohen, what we had, it wasn't
as awesome as what you had with Ryan.

373
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,239
Otherwise, you wouldn't have left.
So now I'm leaving you.

374
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,789
Okay, Summer, would you please--?

375
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,435
Someone please say something.

376
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,758
There's a lot of rain.

377
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,798
-Yeah, nice to see you, Kirsten.
-Yeah, nice to see you too.

378
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,273
Yeah, I feel much more relaxed.

379
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,877
Lindsay, no matter what happens
you'll always be a part of the family.

380
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,552
I couldn't have said it better myself.

381
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,634
Hello. Thank you for waiting.

382
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,274
Our results demonstrate...

383
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,073
...we have a match.

384
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,153
Caleb Nichol is the father
of Lindsay Wheeler-Gardner.

385
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,318
I knew you were my daughter.

386
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,189
Boyz ll Men, huh?
Guess it didn't go well.

387
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,432
I just hope they get
the sex over with early.

388
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,154
Join the mile-high club
over the Atlantic or something.

389
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,351
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

390
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,676
-What happened with Lindsay?
-Caleb's daughter.

391
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,110
Hey, that's great.

392
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,599
Wait, I don't know. Is it?

393
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,199
She's moving in with him.

394
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,033
She went home to talk with her mom.
Wanna help move her?

395
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,357
-Get your mind off Summer.
-The schlepping of heavy things.

396
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,755
Comfort for the weary soul. I'll pass.

397
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,589
-You can't sit here and mope.
-I've got a plan, got the satellite fired up.

398
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,354
Showing a marathon
of Sherman Oaks: The Real Valley, so--

399
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,630
-What's that?
-Apparently, The Valley...

400
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,156
... has its own reality-show knockoff.
And, you know, why watch angst...

401
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,154
...of fictional characters when you can
watch real people in contrived situations.

402
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,990
Could you turn the music up
on your way out, please? Thanks.

403
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,038
Oh, lay off your brakes.
Can't anyone drive in this weather?

404
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,030
Sandy, relax. Please.

405
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,757
-Can we talk about last night?
-No. We've got nothing to talk about...

406
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,309
...other than your case
and this traffic.

407
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,388
-So, what we had meant nothing?
-lt meant everything to me then.

408
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,635
That was then. Now I've got a family
that I love. I'm not throwing that away.

409
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,749
I gotta get back to Newport,
make sure they know.

410
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,792
Sandy!

411
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,153
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I think.

412
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,439
Hey.

413
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,194
-You guys all right?
-A little bruised and battered...

414
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,311
-...but we're okay.
-I already called 91 1.

415
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,592
Cops are on their way
with a tow truck, ambulance.

416
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,514
-All right, thank you.
-All right.

417
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,474
-What are you doing?
-I can't do this.

418
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,914
I gotta go.

419
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,150
The cops are coming.
They're gonna arrest me.

420
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,874
-Maybe arrest you.
-So we'll talk to them.

421
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,595
I'm gonna chalk last night up to fate.
I gotta do the same here.

422
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,631
You can't run again.

423
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,435
What choice do I have?

424
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,593
Now my father's gone, and you--
l-- You're right.

425
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,912
What we had was a long time ago.

426
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,151
Gotta let it go. Let you go.

427
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,673
See you, Sandy Cohen.

428
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,877
So your father's flight
doesn't leave D.C. until 1 1.

429
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,829
He's lucky he doesn't
have to fly in this weather.

430
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,632
Oh, sorry.

431
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,517
Well, I'm really excited that I finally get
to meet your dad. He sounds really cool.

432
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,676
Did Dad make reservations
at the Uffizi?

433
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,400
He sure did. I can't wait
to see the Botticelli.

434
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,636
The Birth of Venus
is amazing in person.

435
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,513
-Are you a fan of Botticelli?
-Yes, yes, I am...

436
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,830
...although I prefer his earlier work.

437
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,275
You know, the comedies.

438
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,072
I'm gonna go get a magazine.
Would you like People, Us Weekly...

439
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,999
-...In Touch? Anything?
-Oh, I could take an Economist.

440
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,555
I could use a Xanax.

441
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,036
Okay. Okay.

442
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,152
You have one new message.

443
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,949
Hey, it's me. Look, perhaps
you 're screening. Perhaps you 're...

444
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,879
... being screened by security. I just--

445
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,353
I just wanted to say...

446
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,354
...sorry to leave things like that, okay?
I hope you have a good trip. I really do.

447
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,552
And somebody else here
wants to say something.

448
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,996
Captain Oats is a horse of few words,
but he said he 'd like you to travel safe.

449
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,438
And he said we 'll miss you. So okay.

450
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,431
Okay, bye.

451
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,919
-There's no more closet space.
-No.

452
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,275
I know. I' m sorry.

453
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,353
It's okay. I can learn to live
with less shoes.

454
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,592
I've got to get to work. Wanna
walk me? I love walking in the rain.

455
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,354
-Sure.
-Cool. Oh, garbage day's tomorrow.

456
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,071
Do you mind taking out the cans? And
rent is due the first day of the month.

457
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,879
-Okay. Rent.
-I know, it's really real, huh?

458
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,230
-No turning back.
-It's real.

459
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,559
Bet you never did anything
this crazy before.

460
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,637
I'm gonna grab my jacket.

461
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,953
-Hi.
-Hey.

462
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,991
All packed?

463
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,356
-Getting there.
-Call Caleb?

464
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,476
Let him know you were coming?

465
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,679
No.

466
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,032
Because I'm not.

467
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,956
-Okay.
-Ryan...

468
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,317
...I talked it over with my mom.

469
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,835
And I want to go with her...

470
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,192
...to Chicago.

471
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,991
But I thought....

472
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,955
Do I really want to be
Caleb Nichol's daughter?

473
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,480
That's not the life I want.

474
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,073
As hard as it is to leave you,
I can't leave my mom.

475
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,233
She's the only family
I've ever really had.

476
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,591
I get it.

477
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,988
Here we go, buddy.
Hours of mind-numbing escapism.

478
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,833
The satellite's out?

479
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,673
I refuse to be denied
this one small pleasure.

480
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,597
This I can fix.

481
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,678
I need you. The flight's been delayed
because of the weather.

482
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,757
My sister is having an anxiety attack.

483
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,394
-What's the matter?
-She's superstitious and thinks...

484
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,597
...this is a sign she shouldn't marry
Rodolfo. I don't know...

485
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,318
...maybe a girl's point of view?

486
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,790
-Sure. Yeah. Okay.
-Okay, good.

487
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,993
Are you coming?

488
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,914
I can't do it.

489
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,591
-Okay, I'll talk to her myself.
-No.

490
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,155
I mean, I can't go. I can't do this.

491
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,238
The truth be told, I didn't think
you'd make it past security.

492
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,709
I'm really sorry.

493
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,359
Can't fight fate.

494
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,834
-You took the bus.
-I told you.

495
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,632
Nothing was keeping me from you.

496
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,197
Is it over?

497
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,518
I promise you, it never started.

498
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,473
Help. Anyone?

499
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,119
Mom?

500
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,560
Thanks for walking me.
Sure you don't want to come in?

501
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,194
-The band is really good.
-Oh, no, I should get back.

502
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,113
-Dishes aren't gonna wash themselves.
-Okay.

503
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,589
-Bye.
-Bye.

504
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,593
Hey.

505
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,918
Hi.

506
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,157
Are you okay?

507
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,234
Yeah.

508
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,032
Cohen.

509
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,758
-Cohen.
-Help.

510
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,797
Someone.

511
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,230
Anyone.

512
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,555
-Cohen?
-Summer?

513
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,358
Oh, my--

514
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,994
What are you doing here?

515
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,032
What do you think, Cohen?
