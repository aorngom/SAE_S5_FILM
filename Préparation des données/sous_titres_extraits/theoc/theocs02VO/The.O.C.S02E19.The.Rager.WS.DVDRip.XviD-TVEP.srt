1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,912
-Previously on The O. C.:
-Some friends of mine...

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,036
...want to get to know you.
-You son of a bitch.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,838
That's your cue to hand me
the briefcase.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,479
If I've never had sex before...

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,517
... why do I feel so horny?

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,039
My old assistant is the VP...

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,111
...at a graphic-novel company.
I arranged a meeting.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,198
You and Kirsten have been spending
a lot of time working together.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,833
Long hours, late nights.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,228
Sandy, you have a great wife.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,834
Why would Trey steal anything though?
I mean, everything's going great.

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,998
I screwed up. There's no way
Ryan's ever gonna forgive me.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,679
-I don't blame him.
-I'll talk to him.

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,678
In the morning, he's gone.
I don't care where he goes.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,319
--explains that his job is considered
plum duty in the CHP, even though....

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,711
-Good morning.
-Morning, Mr. Cohen.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,716
So today's the big day, huh?
Moving into your new apartment.

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,112
-You got all your stuff?
-Yeah. There's not much to get.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,231
-Sure you don't need anything?
-No, thanks.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,118
You guys have done
more than enough.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,470
You're Ryan's brother.
We're happy to help.

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,399
Still, there's not many people
who'd take in an ex-con.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,194
-He's lucky to have you.
-You're part of this family now.

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,351
So if anything comes up...

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,512
-...we're here.
-Thanks.

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,079
Grab yourself some breakfast.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,748
I'll drop you by your place
on my way to work.

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,718
I'm not really hungry.
But I will take you up on the ride.

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,911
Did you tell Ryan you're leaving?

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,548
No. But it's okay.

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,830
Yeah, I don't know what happened
with you guys.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,798
In fact, I don't wanna know.
It doesn't matter who was wrong.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,309
But someone has to be
the first to reach out.

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,112
There he is. I tell you, the timing
in this household is a thing of beauty.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,114
I'm gonna leave you two to say
your goodbyes. Trey, I'll be in the car.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,874
-Sandy's taking me to the apartment.
-You got everything?

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,113
You know, it's weird being able to fit
your whole life into one bag.

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,236
Look, Ryan, I know
it hasn't been easy, man...

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,789
...but I want you to know
I appreciate everything...

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,679
-...you and the Cohens have done.
-Funny way of showing it.

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,435
Look, I'm sorry, Ryan. Okay?
I screwed up.

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,749
And you and Seth and Marissa,
you guys saved my ass. I know that.

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,269
Will you please
just accept my apology?

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,914
Don't keep Sandy waiting.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,428
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

46
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,589
What's up?

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,311
So, Ryan, doesn't Trey move
into the apartment today?

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,357
Yeah. He left this morning.

49
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,711
Don't you think maybe we should go by,
give him a housewarming gift?

50
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,797
-He doesn't need anything.
-You sure?

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,113
He doesn't exactly seem
overburdened with possessions.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,840
Unless that bag of his
is like Mary Poppins'.

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,237
-I wish I never made that reference.
-Look, he's got his own place.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,960
He's out of our lives. Let him go.

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,789
You know, you think maybe it's time
to forgive him...

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,632
...for the whole yard-sale thing?

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,837
-lt wasn't a thing. He stole.
-Because he wanted to be near you.

58
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,237
I appreciate what you guys are doing.
But he's my brother.

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,311
Just leave him alone.

60
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,835
-Come in. Good morning.
-Kirsten, congratulations.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,833
As of this morning, you are
a bona fide magazine publisher.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,434
I know. The first issue's
on the stands.

63
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,915
-I was referring to our first libel suit.
-What?

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,116
Nick Morton. Newport Beach politico.

65
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,272
Doesn't like the profile we ran.
Thinks it makes him look sleazy.

66
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,034
-You wrote that profile.
-I know. I made him look sleazy.

67
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,152
-Well, what are we supposed to do?
-I thought I'd talk to Sandy.

68
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,470
Yeah. You guys are friends now,
so great.

69
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,078
Julie's on her way over. I have to explain
why she's not on the cover anymore.

70
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,912
Hey, she's been to Europe, you know.

71
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,837
Maybe she's become this unmaterialistic,
humble, sweet person.

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,315
-We're talking about Julie.
-What about her?

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,357
Julie. You're--

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,269
We were just saying
how glad we are you're back.

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,434
-Well, thank you, Kirsten. Carter.
-Julie.

76
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,677
-So how was ltaly?
-Cal is still in Rome. A business thingy.

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,196
But scandal or no scandal,
I had to be back for our first issue.

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,749
Julie, there's something
that I need to tell you.

79
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,838
After the whole....

80
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,190
Porno debacle. You can say it.

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,595
There were letters. Lots of letters.

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,912
And then the advertisers
started threatening to cancel.

83
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,516
So we had to take you
off the cover. I' m sorry.

84
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,832
-You did the right thing.
-I did?

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,429
Absolutely. Don't give it
another thought.

86
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,788
God, it's really good to see you.
Both of you. I really missed you.

87
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,398
I'm just saying that maybe
I should do the talking this time.

88
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,232
Zach, do not worry, okay?

89
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,039
I promise you, this won't be
another WildStorm.

90
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,237
Look, I am calm, I am well rested.

91
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,039
Reed's already read the pages,
and he freaking loves them.

92
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,156
He's driving from L.A. just to meet us.

93
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,436
What do we know about this guy?
What's he like?

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,991
He was Carter's assistant before going
to Bad Science. We've only e-mailed.

95
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,674
I can't believe we're gonna
have our own graphic novel.

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,871
I know.

97
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,676
I can't believe it's 2005. We were
supposed to have personal jetpacks.

98
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,274
-Who dropped the ball?
-What are you talking about?

99
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,193
-Hey.
-Oh, hey. Summer.

100
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,237
We were just-- We were--

101
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,311
Talking about your comic.
Don't lie, okay?

102
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,278
Graphic novel.
It's just a little different.

103
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,873
Right, well, I'm gonna head to class.
And have a good one.

104
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,633
I'm sorry, okay? I know I promised
it wouldn't be weird...

105
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,314
...but I'm telling you this,
from here on out...

106
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,631
...full disclosure. Okay? I'll tell you
everything Zach and I do.

107
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,473
I'm gonna let you know
the ins and outs of whatever.

108
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,629
-No.
-What?

109
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,270
I think you and Zach working together
is a bad idea, but I can't stop it.

110
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,232
-Come on.
-No, so here's the deal:

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,517
Whatever happens, I don't wanna
know anything about it.

112
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,913
Which means, as far as I'm concerned,
your little comic doesn't exist.

113
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,311
Graphic novel.

114
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,837
A surfboard coffee table.
I am in the O.C.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,433
Carter. It's good to see you.

116
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,910
Yep, a little carpentry project
while I'm between cases.

117
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,588
I came at the right time.
You ever do any libel work?

118
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,672
One day on the stand, you already
got a libel suit. Not bad.

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,319
-Who is it?
-Nick Morton.

120
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,268
-Oh, that sleazebag.
-He doesn't like to be called one in print.

121
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,631
I'd be happy to help out.
Libel cases are notoriously hard to prove.

122
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,473
All your quotes are verbatim?

123
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,870
Word for word.
I'll give you the interview tapes.

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,679
-Great. Should be a breeze.
-You know, I used to surf.

125
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,836
Grew up in Long lsland. Montauk Point.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,752
I'm heading out tomorrow.
Come with me.

127
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,837
I don't know.
It's been such a long time.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,911
-I don't have a board.
-I'll lend you one.

129
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,510
And if Kirsten asks
why I'm not at work?

130
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,478
You can tell her we'll be talking
about the case.

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,153
Hey.

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,550
-Marissa.
-I brought you a little something.

133
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,030
I figured this place could use
some sprucing.

134
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,072
That's a lava lamp.

135
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,152
That's-- That's great.

136
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,557
Ryan wanted to come,
but he had this thing after school.

137
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,318
Come in. I still haven't bought chairs
and tables and stuff, but....

138
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,833
-Nice beanbag.
-Yeah.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,150
It's kind of a stupid first thing to buy.

140
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,311
It's an early birthday present
to myself.

141
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,836
-When's your birthday?
-Saturday. Big 21.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,074
Though after being in prison, being able
to buy beer feels a little anticlimactic.

143
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,795
Do you want something to drink?
I've got one glass, but I can wash it.

144
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,111
No, no, that's okay. I should get going.
But I'll see you later.

145
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,788
Sure. Thanks again.

146
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,199
He said he'd have all our stuff
with him.

147
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,071
Seth.

148
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,276
Oh, my God.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,956
He's a she. That's terrible.

150
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,833
Listen, Zach, I love girls,
and I love comics.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,390
The two do not mix, okay? It'll be like,
"Let's make their outfits cuter. "

152
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,949
We're here. Let's give her
the benefit of the doubt.

153
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,873
You must be my two wunderkinds.
Reed Carlson, Bad Science Comics.

154
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,917
It's a pleasure. I'm Zach. This is Seth.

155
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,832
I've been looking forward to this.

156
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,349
That's great.
Let's just get right to the project.

157
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,473
Okay. I think that you have tapped
into something real and compelling.

158
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,031
I think the characters are vivid
and engaging. Especially the lronist.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,111
-Really?
-Yeah. He's smart, funny, hip.

160
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,635
He is unlike anyone else in comics.

161
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,839
Well, can I first just say how great
it is to finally see a woman...

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,673
-...involved in comics.
-Thank you.

163
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,758
We were actually thinking
of expanding the lronist's role.

164
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,791
Who came up with this business plan?

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,433
-I did.
-It's amazing.

166
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,359
-Really?
-I was a marketing minor in college.

167
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,348
But the fact that you put this together
and you're 1 7, I'm in awe.

168
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,030
You're like a Doogie Howser meets
Gordon Gekko, but with dimples.

169
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,674
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

170
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,153
That's my boss. Just a sec.

171
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,512
Oh, hey, genius boy. Zach, right?

172
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,313
Could you order me an iced tea?

173
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,875
God, how great is it
she liked my business plan?

174
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,640
Yeah, it's really very-- It's very cool.

175
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,437
-Hey. What's up?
-Can I come in?

176
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,319
Yeah. What's going on? You hungry?
Want something to drink?

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,038
-I'm fine.
-Yeah?

178
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,113
-I just came by to ask you something.
-Oh, okay. Sure.

179
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,313
Okay. Don't get mad.

180
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,678
But I was thinking it might be nice
to throw Trey a birthday party.

181
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,832
-What?
-We could do it at my house.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,638
By the pool.

183
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,595
-You forgot. Saturday's his birthday.
-No, l--

184
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,639
Yeah.

185
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,879
Yeah, I did.

186
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,032
You went over to see him, didn't you?

187
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,236
-Ryan.
-After I asked you not to.

188
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,675
I brought him a lava lamp.
It was no big deal.

189
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,512
Why are you doing all this?

190
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,114
Going over to see him,
throwing him a birthday party.

191
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,119
-He's your brother.
-Exactly!

192
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,470
He's my brother.

193
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,031
And if everyone had just
let me handle it...

194
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,509
...then none of this
would have happened.

195
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,354
So I'm asking you again,
stop pushing it.

196
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,238
I'm sorry. I thought--

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,991
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,952
Ryan.

199
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,475
Wake up.

200
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,074
Ryan, wake up. No, get your own.

201
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,512
Wake up, man. It's a beautiful day. The
sun's shining. The birds are, you know....

202
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,989
Did I mention to you last night
about meeting Reed?

203
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,509
Beautiful, loves comics,
will make you famous. Yes.

204
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,989
Here's the thing.
I'm a little worried about Zach.

205
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,519
-Zach.
-Yeah.

206
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,473
You should've seen him.
It was, "Reed" this, "Reed" that.

207
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,993
It was kind of disgusting.

208
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,310
And you're sure it's Zach
who has the crush?

209
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,836
I love Summer, okay?
Reed is a colleague.

210
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,355
I just don't want her
to like Zach more than me.

211
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,431
This is actually
our first conversation...

212
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,433
-...in here since Marissa left.
-Let's not talk about her.

213
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
What? Come on, we did me.
Let's go around the horn.

214
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,352
We got in a fight. She wanted
to throw a birthday party for Trey.

215
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,953
It's Trey's birthday?

216
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,439
-Seth.
-No, hang on. I'm just thinking...

217
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,114
...how, you know,
sometimes it takes an event...

218
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,033
...Iike a birthday or a wake,
to bring a family together.

219
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,431
Think about this. Trey is blowing out
his candles on his birthday.

220
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,310
His only wish is that his brother
forgives him. It's a pretty nice moment.

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,911
-Good morning.
-Hey.

222
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,751
It feels so good to be home.

223
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,198
How much do I wish you could have
come to visit in ltaly. It was....

224
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,193
-lt was magical.
-lf it was great, why'd you leave early?

225
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,113
-Everything okay with Caleb?
-Of course. I told you...

226
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,068
...I needed to come home
for the magazine. And I missed you.

227
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,798
Yeah.

228
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,755
Do you have an address?

229
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,316
I should have known.

230
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,234
Honey, I have to go. But let's have
dinner tonight, just the two of us. Okay?

231
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,717
You're out of practice. Everybody
hits themselves with their boards.

232
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,919
-Three times in one wave?
-Well, that was impressive.

233
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,198
Still, surfing the O.C.,
it's a world away from Long lsland.

234
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,920
-Hey, Sandy.
-Erin. How you doing? You going out?

235
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,550
I don't have to make rounds for a while,
so I figured I'd get in the water.

236
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,512
-Hi.
-Erin, Carter Buckley.

237
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,234
He runs Newport Living,
my wife's company's magazine.

238
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,632
Y eah. That came to the office yesterday.
I read the profile on Nick Morton.

239
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,711
-Way to skewer him.
-Carter wrote that.

240
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,273
And now we're being sued.

241
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,914
Erin's an orthopedist in town
and an excellent surfer.

242
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,672
Carter's just getting back into it.

243
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,434
Yeah, today I mastered
hitting myself in the face.

244
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,710
Well, any time Sandy's busy and you
need a surf buddy, give me a call.

245
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,998
-Y eah, thank you. I might do that.
-All right. See you guys.

246
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,120
Yeah, it's world away from Long lsland,
I'll tell you.

247
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,511
And he got mad because you wanted
to throw a party for his brother?

248
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,433
Oh, it's not just the party.
It's been building.

249
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,273
I mean, Trey coming here
has been really hard for him.

250
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,515
Well, you tried.

251
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,911
If he doesn't want a relationship
with his brother, that's his problem.

252
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,310
I'd hate for him to realize
two years from now...

253
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,835
...how important his brother is
and to have lost him.

254
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,998
My God, you are the most supportive
non-girlfriend in history.

255
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,631
If something important was happening
in Seth's life, you'd be there for him.

256
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,631
Right. Of course.

257
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,634
And then when she started talking about
how lron Man's armor, his old armor...

258
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,234
...is actually better
than his Ultimate armor....

259
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,833
-Dude, it--
-l....

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,629
What about when she threw down on
the whole Cyclops-versus-Storm debate?

261
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,633
I never thought talking
about comic books could be so sexy.

262
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,112
A beautiful girl who loves comics.
I didn't even know they existed.

263
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,035
It's like finding a unicorn, Zach.
It's like finding a really hot unicorn.

264
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,839
It's just too bad you have
a girlfriend. Otherwise--

265
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,197
I was thinking you could ask her out,
but now you're working together.

266
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,555
So there's that whole
professional-ethics thing.

267
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,429
Y eah, I was wondering, how did Summer
take the fact that Reed's a woman?

268
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,511
She's not bothered
by a late night's work?

269
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,632
Summer doesn't wanna know anything
about the entire enterprise.

270
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,155
So I couldn't tell her
even if I wanted to.

271
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,918
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

272
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,356
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

273
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,916
Actually, we were just talking
about Reed.

274
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,715
-Who's Reed?
-Seth will tell you. See you later.

275
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,872
Who's Reed?

276
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,991
You don't wanna know.
A comic book rep.

277
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,310
No, I do.

278
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,913
-You do?
-Yeah.

279
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,516
Look, I've changed my mind. I know
this comic book is important to you...

280
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,632
...so it's important to me.
I wanna know everything.

281
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,392
-Everything?
-Yeah.

282
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,439
Jules. How the hell did you find me?

283
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,115
Well, it was easy, Lance. I just looked
for the cheapest, scummiest motel...

284
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,714
...near a liquor store, and voilà.
May I come in?

285
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,791
I guess so.

286
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,876
Listen, Jules, I don't know
what you're thinking, but--

287
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,391
-What the hell is that?
-It's a gun, genius.

288
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,755
You use it to shoot people
you wanna kill.

289
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,592
All right, here's what happened.

290
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,631
What happened. What happened is...

291
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,758
...that you humiliated me
in front of my friends and family.

292
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,633
I've been kicked out of every
organization I belong to.

293
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,712
My own magazine has taken me
off the cover. And at home...

294
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,708
...I have a teenage daughter who sooner
or later will find out that her mother...

295
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,518
...was a pornographer.

296
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,116
-Let's just be reasonable here, Jules.
-I am being reasonable.

297
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,835
In one night, you destroyed a life...

298
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,629
...I spent almost 20 years building.

299
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,079
-So I'm here to kill you.
-Jules, wait!

300
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,870
There's no bullets.

301
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,231
No.

302
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,868
Unfortunately.

303
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,396
But for just a second...

304
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,070
...I wanted you to feel like your life
was being taken away.

305
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,874
Hey. I'm headed out to pick up
some Thai. You wanna come?

306
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,632
Can't. Studying history.

307
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,439
Well, you know what's on the way
to the Thai place?

308
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,512
The apartment
of a certain ex-con I know.

309
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,989
That's quite a sell.

310
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,559
You're just not gonna see him?

311
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,309
People who don't learn from the past
are doomed to repeat it. I've learned.

312
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,715
Yeah, but your great victory's
gonna be what...

313
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,634
...not seeing your brother anymore?
Congratulations.

314
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,913
Look, I'm not even talking about,
like, having him move in...

315
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,198
...or helping him find a job or anything.
I mean, literally mean, "Happy birthday. "

316
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,072
Four syllables.

317
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,198
-Four syllables. That's it.
-Yeah.

318
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,033
Or six. "Hey, Trey, happy birthday. "

319
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,033
Hey.

320
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,715
-You just get home?
-Yeah. I sent Seth out for Thai.

321
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,634
Oh, perfect. Did Carter tell you
about surfing this morning?

322
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,917
You know, he's a little rusty,
but he's definitely got some skills.

323
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,516
Did you two manage to discuss the case
at all during your bonding session?

324
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,591
Well, you know, a little.

325
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,038
Coming out of the water, we ran
into Erin Lee, that young orthopedist.

326
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,112
I think there are definitely some sparks
between her and Carter.

327
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,432
So I was thinking we should have them
over for dinner. You know, set them up.

328
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,716
-Wait, you're serious.
-Yeah.

329
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,111
Carter's new in town.
He doesn't know that many people.

330
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,273
-Fine, sure.
-Great. I'll make the calls.

331
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,956
All right, just in and out. "Happy 21 st,"
then we're at the Thai place.

332
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,556
-This is a mistake. He'll never change.
-Dude, you gotta trust people more.

333
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,711
-There he is.
-All right, great. Let's go.

334
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,911
No, wait, wait.

335
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,516
Would you relax? He's probably
just going to buy cigarettes.

336
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,194
Or getting into
that suspicious-looking Camaro...

337
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,752
...with a guy who looks like Lou Reed.

338
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,397
All right. Hope you like cold Thai.

339
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,912
It's his 21 st birthday.
I'm sure he's just going out for a drink.

340
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,792
Stop it. Pull over.

341
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,554
They're probably just picking up
a friend.

342
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,752
In a dark alley.

343
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,839
Who he owes some money to.

344
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,838
All right.

345
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,638
All right.

346
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,439
Oh, my God,
you have to be kidding me.

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,274
What's up, man?

348
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,635
-What is your problem?!
-You are unbelievable.

349
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,515
I saw you last night. What'd you buy?
Coke? Speed? Get rid of it right now.

350
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,831
-Oh, God, man.
-I am an idiot for ever believing in you.

351
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,634
Here. Why don't you call
my parole officer...

352
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,360
...because it was his car
I got into last night.

353
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,636
-What?
-Yeah. Guy in the alley?

354
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,792
A buddy from prison who got out
a few months ago and disappeared.

355
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,309
I asked my PO to find him
because I was worried.

356
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,153
-You gave him money.
-He asked me for 5 bucks.

357
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,757
The guy's living in a trash can. I was
trying to convince him to go to a shelter.

358
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,589
That's it, Ry.

359
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,278
And you know, it's funny.

360
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,115
Because when I saw you,
I thought to myself:

361
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,795
"My brother's come over to take me
out to breakfast for my birthday. "

362
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,396
You know, maybe I'm the idiot,
for believing.

363
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,550
-Hey.
-Hey. Hope I'm not....

364
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,757
Can l...?

365
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,955
So I'm sorry about the other day.
I was out of line.

366
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,829
He's your brother.
I should've just respected that.

367
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,435
You didn't do anything wrong.

368
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,433
I was taking out my frustration
with him on you.

369
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,714
So does that mean you'll give him
another chance?

370
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,751
Well, if he's willing to give me one.

371
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,952
Last night, Seth and l
kind of followed him.

372
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,797
We hadn't meant to at first.
But we did.

373
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,919
We thought we saw him trying
to buy drugs. So this morning--

374
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,236
-You went and accused him.
-Pretty much.

375
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,038
And no drugs?

376
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,156
He was helping out a homeless guy.

377
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,152
I don't know what to do.

378
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,590
Well, as it happens,
you've come to the right place.

379
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,434
Seth, these new pages are great.

380
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,233
Yeah. They're, you know,
sketches, mostly, but thank you.

381
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,590
I owe Carter big.
You and Zach are a find.

382
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,518
Yeah. Yeah, we're a good team.

383
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,389
I mean, I come up with the stories,
I write the dialogue, I draw the pages...

384
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,233
...and Zach handles
the late-night coffee runs.

385
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,233
Seriously, if you need
a bone-dry cappuccino, Zach's--

386
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,118
He's your go-to guy. So....

387
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,072
Where is Zach?
I thought he was coming.

388
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,629
Is it Saturday?
He's probably getting a haircut.

389
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,519
You wouldn't know it, but he
spends a lot of time grooming.

390
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,990
Let me ask you, did you get, like,
a slight gay vibe from him at all?

391
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,116
-What?
-Excuse me.

392
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,756
Hey, what's up, girl--? Girl--?
Girlfriend?

393
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,190
Hey. Cohen, I need your help.

394
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,358
I'm actually in a meeting right now
with-- With Reed.

395
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,074
Okay. When you're done with him,
meet me at Marissa's.

396
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,716
I love these Little Miss Vixen sketches.

397
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,632
-Who was that?
-The waitress.

398
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,836
I'm gonna call you back in a little bit.

399
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,513
Okay. Bye.

400
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,270
-That's my mom.
-You call you mom "girlfriend"?

401
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,070
-Mrs. Cooper-Nichol?
-Yeah.

402
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,116
-Hey.
-Marissa. What are you doing here?

403
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,038
-Come on. I'm taking you out.
-What?

404
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,714
I'm taking you out. It's your birthday.
No arguments.

405
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,079
Okay. Okay. All right.
Let me get my keys.

406
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,236
Afraid someone's gonna steal
your beanbag?

407
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,231
Yeah, actually.

408
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,799
Come on.

409
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,711
I can't believe I forgot my wallet.
It'll just take a second.

410
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,633
So where are we going to dinner?

411
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,637
Well, actually...

412
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,189
...I was thinking
maybe we could eat in.

413
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,431
-Surprise.
-Surprise.

414
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,312
Surprise.

415
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,111
Well, happy birthday, dude.

416
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,872
Yes, happy birthday.

417
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,471
Happy birthday.

418
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,954
Sorry, bro.

419
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,436
All right, we have hot dogs and
hamburgers and kielbasas for you.

420
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,712
Cohen learned how to use the grill.
It's a major life achievement.

421
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,314
That's right. I grilled some corn,
some veggies.

422
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,233
Found something in Marissa's fridge,
I just grilled it.

423
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,992
Sounds great.

424
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,311
Marissa, I have to go out for a bit.
Can I trust you while I'm gone?

425
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,754
Yes, Mom.

426
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,514
It's only us and maybe girls
from the Charity League.

427
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,036
Well, I don't wanna come home
and find I'm living in Delta House.

428
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,395
-ls that Ryan's brother?
-Yeah.

429
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,115
Okay. Well, since he's 21, I guess
it would be okay if he had a beer.

430
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,035
But just one. See? I can be
a cool mom too. Bye, honey.

431
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,475
We should drive down to Swamis.
It's crowded, but it's got a killer right.

432
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,156
-Count me in. Hey, Kirsten.
-Hey, Carter. You look nice.

433
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,436
Oh, thanks. Sandy told me
to spiff it up a bit.

434
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,398
Yeah, I didn't want him
to embarrass us.

435
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,077
That must be Erin.

436
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,914
I-- I hope this isn't strange or....

437
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,554
No. It's not. It's fun.

438
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,678
You know, because this wasn't my--
I didn't--

439
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,996
-Carter, you remember Erin.
-Yes, I do.

440
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,434
-Hi. Hi.
-Hi.

441
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,238
-My wife, Kirsten.
-Nice to meet you.

442
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,753
-You too.
-I told Carter...

443
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,996
...we should go to Swamis.
What do you think?

444
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,878
Sure. I'd love to.

445
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,317
Come on outside. The best thing
about this place are the sunsets.

446
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,038
Lead the way.

447
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,838
You all go. I'll bring the wine.

448
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,434
Yeah, come on out to the patio.
Watch your step.

449
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,752
We got about a minute and a half
till the sunset is just magic.

450
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,439
-Thanks for coming.
-Just tell me what I'm doing here.

451
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,319
"lf you want the rest, meet me. "
What do you expect to get?

452
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,233
-My life is already ruined.
-Look, I don't want anything.

453
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,595
Here. It's-- It's the rest of the tapes.

454
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,629
Look, just yesterday I got offered
$8500 for them, but I said no.

455
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,156
You want points
for turning down 8 grand...

456
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,676
-...after fleecing Caleb for 500,000?
-I didn't get a penny out of Caleb.

457
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,677
-What are you talking about?
-Yeah.

458
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,396
After he got the master tape, he had me
beaten up. And threatened a lot worse.

459
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,473
But I guess he didn't tell you that.

460
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,238
No.

461
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,031
I thought he would just pay up.
You know, to protect his wife and all.

462
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,113
But I guess a guy like Caleb Nichol
doesn't mind taking chances.

463
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,635
Yeah, when it's my reputation
he's gambling.

464
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,839
Jules, I never meant
to hurt you, honestly.

465
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,469
But after he did that....

466
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,911
Well, you know what I'm like
when I think I'm being cheated.

467
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,913
-Yeah, I remember.
-lf I had the money, I'd give it to you.

468
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,513
Every cent.

469
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,477
But I don't. I got nothing.

470
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,794
Not even the 8500.

471
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,310
Got enough to buy me a drink?

472
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,830
So how many people
would you say you invited?

473
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,433
-Four.
-Me too.

474
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,830
I don't even know four other people.

475
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,230
Looks like word spread.

476
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,118
Yeah.

477
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,750
-Hey, check out Zach and that hottie.
-Hey.

478
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,353
That's....

479
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,913
-She's a very attractive woman.
-She looks a little older.

480
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,315
-Like maybe she's in college.
-Yeah.

481
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,879
Maybe he'll bring her out.

482
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,878
I see somebody doing magic
by the pool. Let's check that out.

483
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,271
Magic tricks.
Definitely somebody you invited.

484
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,478
-You won't get in trouble for this, right?
-No. It's not like I'm throwing a rager.

485
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,717
-Hello.
-ls there a party here?

486
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,753
-Yeah.
-This is it!

487
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,755
-I think the word has spread.
-Yeah.

488
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,112
Chug! Chug! Chug!

489
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,309
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt your drinking.

490
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,597
I'm looking for Zach.
He plays water polo too.

491
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,916
Are you talking to me, geek?

492
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,868
I think the kicking the comic-book
guy's ass, we're probably past it.

493
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,992
Wow, your hand goes all the way
around. Kind of hard to breathe.

494
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,590
Stop it, man. Stop it.
I got a game tomorrow.

495
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,997
Yeah? Then I suggest you go home
and get some sleep.

496
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,231
-You okay?
-Thanks, dude.

497
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,109
It's déjà vu. O.C. party,
attacked by a water-polo guy...

498
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,838
...saved by an Atwood. Hello.

499
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,232
That was amazing. Do you, like,
know aikido or something?

500
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,639
Okay, I'll just go.

501
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,918
-I'm Jess.
-Hi. Trey. Nice tat.

502
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,279
Thanks. It's a buddha smoking a joint.

503
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,914
-That's very artistic.
-I'd show you the rest...

504
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,674
...but my boyfriend's
probably watching.

505
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,717
-We can go somewhere else.
-Sure.

506
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,838
-Zach.
-Seth.

507
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,434
Hey, dude. You wanna
explain yourself maybe?

508
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,232
-What are you talking about?
-Reed.

509
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,556
Remember the professional-ethics
conversation?

510
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,479
Oh, yeah, like not letting me know
there was a meeting?

511
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,394
-You were like, "l have things to do. "
-Why are you telling her I'm gay?

512
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,917
I said "gay vibe. " I distinctly remember
saying "gay vibe. " The two are different.

513
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,430
Okay, then how about me getting
you cappuccinos? Bone-dry?

514
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,990
-What does that even mean?
-God, what is she, a court reporter?

515
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,311
Excuse me. Sorry.

516
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,109
Look, okay? I don't really wanna
get into this right now, okay?

517
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,475
You look for your date,
and I'll look for mine.

518
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,709
Fine.

519
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,760
Finally, somewhere private.

520
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,558
-You don't go to Harbor, do you?
-No. I just moved here.

521
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,312
-From where?
-Prison.

522
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,436
Did you kill someone?

523
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,319
No. I stole a car.

524
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,755
So, what's a car thief doing
at a Newport rager?

525
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,712
Well, actually...

526
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,112
...this is my birthday party.

527
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,392
Well, convict...

528
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,471
...time to open your present.

529
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,234
Oh, my gosh, no. But what was
the name of that other guy?

530
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,312
-Dwight.
-Oh, no! Oh, Dwight.

531
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,311
No, he had that birthmark.

532
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,597
No, I'm talking about the one
who always said-- Oh, what was it?

533
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,399
-"Bottom line. "
-Oh, my God.

534
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,909
Everything was "bottom line. "
"Vegas, bottom line:

535
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,230
-You're gonna get screwed. "
-"Screwed. "

536
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,472
-Or he'd say, "Bottom line, I'm--"
-What?

537
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,431
-Oh, my God.
-What?

538
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,592
-Do you remember this concert?
-You threw your shirt at the band.

539
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,992
-No, no. That was the Ratt concert.
-Oh, you went through a lot of shirts.

540
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,318
This is actually pretty fun. But--

541
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,950
Hold on. Don't go yet.
One more drink.

542
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,869
For Whitesnake.

543
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,193
-For Whitesnake.
-Yes.

544
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,429
Bring it on.

545
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,511
-Sorry.
-Oh, no, come in.

546
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,194
There are already a couple people
in the shower anyway.

547
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,078
Wonderful.

548
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,119
-Aren't you here with Zach?
-Yeah. I mean, just as friends.

549
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,639
-He's a great guy, isn't he?
-Oh, my God. So sweet.

550
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,473
And cute. Can't believe
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

551
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,200
Well, some girls at our school
can be idiots.

552
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,113
I know this sounds crazy, but have you
ever heard of Little Miss Vixen?

553
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,510
Yeah. How do you know about
Little Miss Vixen? Do you know Seth?

554
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,195
Y eah, l' m working with him
on his comic book.

555
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,313
I'm Reed.

556
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,397
You ass! He's a she!

557
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,511
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Reed's a girl.

558
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,073
Okay, l-- I never said--

559
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,669
Don't you dare.
Don't even pretend you didn't lie.

560
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,111
-I knew you would get the wrong idea.
-Oh, right, this is my fault.

561
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,510
I wouldn't wanna know
that my boyfriend met...

562
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,035
...some gorgeous 23-year-old
who loves comics...

563
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,078
...and thinks he's the next Brian Bendis,
whatever that means.

564
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,515
She said that?
She thinks I'm the next Bendis?

565
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,399
-Oh, my God.
-Hey.

566
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,236
Summer, I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

567
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,914
Zach! Zach, hey, are you leaving?

568
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,840
-Yeah.
-Can I get a ride?

569
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,638
Yeah.

570
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,955
-Summer, please.
-Cohen, just shut up.

571
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,918
Because even when you're not lying,
you're lying.

572
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,909
-Poison rocked.
-They did, they did.

573
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,636
Oh, baby, I think it's time
to get you home.

574
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,633
Oh, yeah. Home, great.

575
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,315
Home, yeah.
Caleb's gonna divorce me.

576
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,833
-Jules.
-No, you know...

577
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,992
...he said he didn't judge me
about the whole....

578
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,673
You know.

579
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,633
But all during this trip he didn't even
look at me. I mean....

580
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,509
And when he did, I could see it
in his eyes. He was disgusted.

581
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,954
That's not true.

582
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,430
That's why I came home early.
I couldn't take it anymore.

583
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,115
So yeah, he'll divorce me.
I'll have no money...

584
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,239
...no career, no friends, nothing...

585
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,675
...for me and my girls.

586
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,997
What if something was
to happen to Caleb?

587
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,511
What do you mean?

588
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,832
Nineteen years ago, when you
left me for that guy, Cooper...

589
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,515
...my life just felt like it stopped,
you know?

590
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,069
But seeing you again...

591
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,993
...I feel like I'm finally waking up.

592
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,238
Feels good.

593
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,436
-Lance.
-No.

594
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,637
What's happening to you is my fault.

595
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,439
So if getting rid of Caleb
means you and your daughters...

596
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,511
...will be taken care of...

597
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,873
...I'll do it.

598
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,477
Looking good, pal.

599
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,510
Hey, there you are.
And you're drinking water.

600
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,911
-Someone's gotta be responsible.
-Yeah.

601
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,758
Hey.

602
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,275
Okay, that's it.

603
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,710
I don't even wanna deal with this.

604
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,632
Excuse me.

605
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,869
This is my room.

606
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,473
You want in?

607
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,471
Get out.

608
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,034
Dude.

609
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,156
Your mom would understand,
don't you think?

610
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,709
-lf she came home right now?
-Oh, definitely.

611
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,678
I mean, she did say
Trey could have a beer.

612
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,837
All right, listen, thank you
for everything you've done for Trey.

613
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,989
If it wasn't for you, he and l....

614
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,070
You've been amazing.

615
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,595
I know what it's like to have someone
believe in you when no one else does.

616
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,033
Oh, my God.

617
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,554
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

618
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,551
-ls she breathing?
-I don't know.

619
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,115
Get her out. Get her out.

620
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,437
I remember that article you wrote...

621
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,751
-...about the cheated stockholders.
-I got sued for that one too.

622
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,110
But you were right.
Now look at Tyco and Enron.

623
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,710
-You were years ahead of everyone else.
-Still got sued.

624
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,189
You ever think about holding back,
playing it safe?

625
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,239
You know, at the risk
of sounding pompous...

626
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,752
...if you're not gonna tell the truth,
what's the point?

627
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,110
Just a minute. Excuse me. Yeah?

628
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,078
Kirsten, dinner was....
Dinner was great.

629
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,953
Thank you. I'm glad
you both could make it.

630
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,470
-I'll be right there.
-What is it?

631
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,069
The kids threw a party for Trey.
It got out of hand.

632
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,515
Some girl took drugs.
She passed out in the pool.

633
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,557
-Are Seth and Ryan okay?
-They're okay...

634
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,551
...but I gotta get over there.
I'm sorry.

635
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,631
No, it's fine.
Oh, I should move my car.

636
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,358
Thank you.

637
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,351
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

638
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,796
Well....

639
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,752
Here, let me help you.

640
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,797
I'm so sorry things
had to end this way.

641
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,797
I know. I had a great time.

642
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,516
Carter seems really wonderful.

643
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,954
He is.

644
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,429
Just be careful.

645
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,192
What do you mean?

646
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,475
His divorce was really hard on him.

647
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,675
He's divorced.

648
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,671
And not over her yet, right?

649
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,276
Well, I think he is. It's just
that the wounds are still raw.

650
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,430
But he's a great guy.

653
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,440
-ls she gonna be okay?
-Stand back.

654
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,158
Hey, what's going on?

655
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,191

657
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,713
-What, you know her?
-Seth. Ryan.

658
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,996
Everybody okay?

659
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,952
-What about the girl?
-Don't know.

660
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,519
-Do you live here, sir?
-No.

661
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,194
My name is Sandy Cohen.
I'm responsible for these four.

662
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,839
-Who lives here?
-I do.

663
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,553
-Where's your parents?
-Mom's out.

664
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,073
She's not answering her cell.

665
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,475
Turn around.
I'm gonna have to take you in.

666
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,511
Officer, what are you doing?

667
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,917
We found a bag of ecstasy. I'm betting
somebody gave it to that girl.

668
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,232
Till I find out who supplied the drugs,
I'm arresting the owner of the house.

669
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,758
I gave them to her.
I brought the drugs.

670
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,111
Trey.

671
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,271
I'm sorry.

672
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,237
Keep your mouth shut. I'll meet you
in jail. Officer, I'm his lawyer.

673
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,038
You have the right to remain silent.

674
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,475
Anything you say
can and will be used against you.

675
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,835
You have the right to an attorney.
Understand?

676
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,592
Yeah.
