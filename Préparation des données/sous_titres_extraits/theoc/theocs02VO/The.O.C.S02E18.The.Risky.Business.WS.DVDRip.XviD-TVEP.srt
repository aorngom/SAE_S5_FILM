1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,678
Previously on The O. C. :

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,638
So that's Carter Buckley. I thought
he'd look more like Jerry Garcia.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,916
You, me, Summer, working
on a comic book together.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,638
It's probably not the best idea.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,478
Little brother.
Good to see you, man.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,672
-Trey's gonna be staying with us.
-Just until I can find my own place.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,711
You're Ry's girlfriend.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,350
-Well, no. Well, not anymore.
-Yeah, we're just friends.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,873
Friends.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,550
What are you making?
Mom's hangover special?

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,792
What do you mean, a pack of smokes
and a fresh cocktail?

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,636
Nope. Just something
I picked up in prison.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,434
Oh, yeah,
the old scallion and chiv omelet.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,478
I've seen Lock Up. Stallone's finest work
since Over the Top.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,638
Stallone, huh?
No, I'm more a Van Damme fan.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,392
Are you kidding me? Seagal, man.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,113
Yeah. A divided house cannot eat.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,999
Now, we all got to get together
behind a single action hero.

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,434
Steve McQueen.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,511
Steve Ma-who?

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,398
My own son doesn't know
Steve McQueen.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,994
People like Great Escape.
I gotta go with Bullitt.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,590
He cooks breakfast and a McQueen fan.
I knew I liked you.

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,069
-How was surfing?
-Unbelievable.

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,032
-You surf?
-He surfs, he sings.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,998
He technically fights crime.
He could be our action hero.

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,395
-Just say the word.
-Think you could give me...

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,551
-...a surf lesson?
-Better you than me.

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,832
-He's been trying to get me out there.
-I have tried, I have tried.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,070
I have failed, I have failed.

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,955
Julie Cooper. This can't be good.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,639
Julie is Marissa's mom.

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,469
Oh, so Ryan's mother-in-law.

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,069
What? What, Ryan and Marissa?
What?

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,714
-It's on.
-Really? I am always the last to know.

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,598
-There's nothing to know.
-Oh, really?

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,876
That's not what it looked like
the other night.

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,349
You coming to Marissa's rescue
and all.

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,869
He's chivalrous,
not unlike a young Steve McQueen.

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,310
People say chivalry's dead.
I don't believe it.

41
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,119
-There's nothing going on with us.
-Nothing?

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,151
-Really?
-Ryan....

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,111
-We're taking it slow.
-Yeah!

44
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,679
-Taking it slow!
-All right.

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,956
Good thing
she's no longer your neighbor.

46
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,515
It's hard to take it slow
with her next door.

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,638
So Caleb and Julie
are off on their trip.

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,631
What are we gonna do
without them?

49
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,758
Well, for starters,
housekeeper got deported...

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,270
...and so there's no one to stay
in the house with Marissa.

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,313
So I told Julie that Marissa
could stay here for the week.

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,830
That'll keep things at a snail's pace.

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,510
I can't believe you're moving in
with the Cohens.

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,434
It's just for the week. Besides, this way
I can keep an eye on your boyfriend.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,079
And yours.

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,959
-What? I'm not dating Seth.
-Coop, you know who I mean.

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,991
No, I don't. I don't have a boyfriend.

58
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,079
Right. Yeah, you and Ryan staying under
the same tent drove Alex out of town.

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,078
Can't imagine what will happen
with you under the same roof.

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,637
-Nothing will happen.
-Yeah, nothing will happen in this.

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,114
What? It's cute.

62
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,556
If you think it's cute wearing something
that screams, "Take me now. "

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,230
Look, it's the middle of spring.
It's too hot to wear flannel p.j.'s.

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,632
What's gonna be too hot is you wearing
this and Ryan seeing you wearing this.

65
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,035
He's not gonna see me wearing it.

66
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,318
But just in case....

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,238
No, I know.

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,915
Don't worry, I'll handle it.
I'll find a replacement.

69
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,878
Okay, thanks. Bye.

70
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,073
Hey, honey. What are you doing?

71
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,875
Heading into the office. Start working
on the low-income housing initiative.

72
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,270
-So you're free then?
-No. What's up?

73
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,715
O.C. charity yard sale
I was supposed to chair...

74
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,633
-...but I'm working.
-The O.C. has a charity yard sale?

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,229
The donors keep half the money,
so not just charity.

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,517
-Yards around here are gated.
-It's in a ballroom of a country club.

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,109
A charity event where
donors keep half the profits...

78
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,397
...and a yard sale with no yard.
That's how they do it in the O.C.

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,397
Sandy...

80
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,673
...I was just wondering if you
could do me a tiny little favor.

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,033
No. No way.

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,717
Sandy, it's an honorary chair,
a figurehead position.

83
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,314
You'd be the master of ceremonies,
like an auctioneer.

84
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,833
And you know what an MC has.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,434
An unfair advantage.
You know the opponent's weakness.

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,114
That's right, a microphone. On a stage.

87
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,317
With an audience. A captive audience.

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,710
And a few show tunes perhaps?

89
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,998
No. You just have to go by
the club today and say hello.

90
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,589
Just a figurehead?

91
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,075
With a mike.

92
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,270
Hey, men, I'm chairing the O.C.
pseudo-charity, non-yard sale.

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,311
-That's fantastic.
-Good luck with that.

94
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,436
I need your help. What are you doing?

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,872
Well, I never thought I'd be so happy
to say this, but Ryan and I have school.

96
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,196
T omorrow you're mine.
What are you doing today?

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,318
-Looking for a job.
-I got one for you. Me, you...

98
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,311
...and the Newpsies.

99
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,152
What's a Newpsie?

100
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,794
They're like vultures,
except they paint their talons.

101
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,110
Actually,
they have somebody else paint them.

102
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,397
-Here comes a flock right now.
-Sandy Cohen. Right on time.

103
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,074
We just stopped by to say hello
and test the mike.

104
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,191
-And you brought a friend?
-Y es, indeed.

105
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,989
Trey, meet Newport's finest. Trey came
along in case we needed a little help.

106
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,919
But I see you don't.
My goodness, you guys are pros.

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,908
-We're gonna get out of your hair.
-Actually, it's great that you're here.

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,111
The moving company we hired got
a flat tire.

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,396
And now we have no one
to do the heavy lifting.

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,114
Heavy lifting. I guess l--
I could do that.

111
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,714
Oh, thank God. Follow me.

112
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,270
I'll be back to pick you up
in a couple hours.

113
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,031
I'm glad he could help out.

114
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,593
Sandy, the job of the chair is to choose
table linens, flatware, centerpieces.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,560
All right, okay.
I'll help Trey with the lifting.

116
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,317
We need you, Sandy.
You're the honorary chair.

117
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,391
It's not just a figurehead position.

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,473
It's not?

119
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,440
Let me just paint a picture
of what could maybe happen.

120
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,915
It's late at night,
and you're thirsty. So is she.

121
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,832
So you meet up at the fridge.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,070
"Hey. " "Hey. "

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,916
"Yoo-hoo? " "Maybe just you.
Let's kiss on the mouth. "

124
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,356
"Okay. Oh, let's French hard. "

125
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,879
What are you doing?

126
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,433
Hey, I gotta get going to class.
I'm gonna be late.

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,559
Was Seth talking about me and how
awkward it's gonna be when I move in?

128
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,870
What, you're moving in? I had no idea.

129
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,077
Really? My mom said she called Kirsten
and ran it by you guys.

130
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,199
-No. But you're moving in? That's great.
-lt won't be awkward, right?

131
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,630
Is this awkward?

132
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,598
-No, not at all.
-Great. See you at home.

133
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,874
Don't blame me
for your sexual tension.

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,314
-Hey, Cohen.
-Hey.

135
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,040
-You know what's coming out on DVD?
-I sure do. Elektra.

136
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,760
There's a reason I didn't see that crap
in the theater.

137
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,194
Come on.

138
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,591
Since the whole comic book debacle,
I promised Summer I'd dial it down.

139
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,318
I'm in the same boat.

140
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,189
My mom is making me donate
1 0 of these for the charity yard sale.

141
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,319
-You're a martyr. That sucks.
-Anyway, I'll see you around.

142
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,913
Zach, I've got an idea.

143
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,072
Why don't I donate five of mine,
spare you five of yours.

144
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,838
-You'd do that?
-Yeah.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,116
We should be putting
comic books behind us.

146
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,356
-It's for charity.
-We'll split the profits.

147
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,794
-Absolutely.
-Good stuff.

148
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,831
Easy with that.
That's worth thousands of dollars.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,879
Then why wouldn't they want it?
It seems like a perfectly good stool.

150
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,150
It's an antique ottoman,
and it's hideous.

151
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,510
Now, onto the bas-relief.

152
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,511
What's this?

153
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,037
David Pastor's father-in-law's brother
ran the prop house at Warner Bros.

154
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,753
It's from some Tom Cruise movie.

155
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,717
This is the crystal egg
from Risky Business?

156
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,395
Well, it's not the F-1 4 from Top Gun.

157
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,669
That is so cool.

158
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,711
This thing must be worth a fortune.

159
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,709
Let's see, it's appraised at 1 0,000.

160
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,199
That's a fortune.

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,233
I guess.

162
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,997
Come, Trey.

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,679
Come.

164
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,033
Welcome to casa de Cohen.

165
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,317
We're almost at capacity,
but there's always room for one more.

166
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,119
Well, thanks for letting me stay here.

167
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,078
Well, I couldn't let you stay
at the mansion all by yourself.

168
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,832
So where do you want me?

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,877
Good question.

170
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,714
What are you doing with these things?

171
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,510
Making a grand sacrifice for charity,
Ryan. It's all in a day's work.

172
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,716
When does Marissa get here?

173
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,791
I don't know.
You want another dead arm?

174
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,674
No, thank you.

175
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,434
I'm gonna go see if Trey's back.
I wonder how it went.

176
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,835
I didn't hear about
any Newpsie knifings, so....

177
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,477
-You wanna go at a living room rematch?
-Yeah, yeah. Let's make it a three-way.

178
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,035
What? That came out weird.
I'll meet you downstairs.

179
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,595
Hi.

180
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,473
-You're not Trey.
-Kirsten moved him.

181
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,399
-I'm gonna go find him then.
-Okay.

182
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,478
Right. Sorry. You know, if anyone
should know about knocking...

183
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,393
...before entering the pool house
that'd be me.

184
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,319
Nothing you haven't seen before,
right?

185
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,994
Right.

186
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,919
That didn't take long.

187
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,036
Come on. Trey's inside wearing a shirt.

188
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,074
-Hey.
-Hey.

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,878
-Couldn't sleep.
-Me either.

190
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,799
-Hungry?
-Sure.

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,116
Nice p.j.'s.

192
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,038
Aren't you hot?

193
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,111
I get cold.

194
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,475
Right.

195
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,430
How's the pool house?

196
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,511
Weird. You know, the only time...

197
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,989
...I've ever slept in that bed
I was with you.

198
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,269
You guys are up early.

199
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,514
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

200
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,677
-No, it's cool.
-No, it's fine.

201
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,716
I just gotta get a jump on the day.

202
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,871
Apartment hunting.

203
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,996
You know,
I know a place that's available.

204
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,633
-Yeah?
-lt was my friend Alex's.

205
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,358
You wanna check it out, man?

206
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,239
No, no, I can't.
I gotta help Sandy with the yard sale.

207
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,830
Don't mess with those Newpsies.
But, hey, I did my time yesterday.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,992
Well, I'm free. I could go with you.

209
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,272
-There you go.
-Thanks.

210
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,036
Trey, just so you know, it's cool.
You don't have to find a place.

211
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,430
I love you like a brother, brother.

212
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,915
But we're too old to be sleeping
in the same room.

213
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,354
Yeah.

214
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,796
Besides, I think I'm getting in the way.

215
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,110
All right, buddy. It's catch-up time.

216
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,114
Since the pool house has been occupied,
there hasn't been privacy, so this'll do.

217
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,111
Have there been
any midnight run-ins...

218
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,477
...involving, say,
Yoo-hoo and underthing-ies?

219
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,831
-There's nothing going on, Seth.
-Okay, you be that way.

220
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,911
All right, ottoman, work with me.

221
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,719
You're sexy. Get nasty.
Work with me, you ottoman.

222
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,711
You little-- That's it. You're a cougar.

223
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,394
You're a panther,
and you're in the woods.

224
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,596
-Seth!
-What, what?

225
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,194
Good save. Thing's probably worth
a million dollars.

226
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,675
Ten thousand.

227
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,991
-lt says it's from Risky Business.
-Really?

228
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,873
Hey, dude, turn it the other way.
It's got a crack in it.

229
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,354
All right.

230
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,111
Hello.

231
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,510
Ladies, hey, I hate to say
"l told you so"...

232
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,831
...but these centerpieces
and those tablecloths, they clash.

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
T aryn, I told you.
Get those linens with the hemstitch.

234
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,239
I know, Sandy. I know.

235
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,352
I'm sorry, but you have no one else
to blame but yourself.

236
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,435
Who are you, and what did
you do with my husband?

237
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,352
Well, if it isn't our proud sponsor.

238
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,518
-I brought the banner, and Carter.
-Carter.

239
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,518
Sandy, I had no idea you were
so multifaceted.

240
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,830
Joan, tell me you didn't order...

241
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,549
...those napkin rings.
This is not a Mob wedding.

242
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,631
Gosh, I thought they were kind of fun.

243
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,115
-No.
-Who wants to help me hang the banner?

244
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,790
Ask Taryn. She's screwing up the
tablecloths. Get her off the tablecloths.

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,638
Okay.

246
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,075
-Thirsty?
-Yes.

247
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,473
So you and Kirsten have been spending
a lot of time working together.

248
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,189
Long hours, late nights.

249
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,112
Sandy, you have a great wife.
I'm sorry to keep her from you.

250
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,237
From everything she says,
we should be friends.

251
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,831
Well, here's to being friends.
You, me and Kirsten.

252
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,436
So this chick just split?

253
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,795
Moved back to her parents, yeah.

254
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,236
And didn't get her
damage deposit back, either.

255
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,038
So we got a decision?

256
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,953
I got a tenant in 6A
whose pipes burst.

257
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,754
I gotta get down there
before they drown.

258
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,352
-I'll take it.
-Great.

259
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,916
I'll need first and last month's rent,
plus security.

260
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,112
That's $3000. I--

261
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,555
Hey, you know, what if we
make you a better offer?

262
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,638
I mean, you know those busted pipes?
Trey here is quite handy.

263
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,155
Him with a sledgehammer? Amazing.

264
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,629
I think she means hammer, but--
But yeah.

265
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,112
What if I became your guy?
If anything breaks down, I'll fix it.

266
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,233
I'll call you tonight with an answer.
Just leave your number.

267
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,718
Cohen, I hear you're the guy
to see about the inventory.

268
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,314
Help me.
I gotta take pictures of all this crap.

269
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,636
-Y eah.
-Okay, thanks. All right, hold it up.

270
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,554
-More. More. More. You're naughty.
-Just take the picture.

271
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,438
You're an animal in the woods.

272
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,830
Excuse me. Are you Seth?

273
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,554
Hey. Carter Buckley.
I'm working with--

274
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,877
-Yeah, it's my mom. How are you?
-Your mom. On Newport Living.

275
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,076
She said you were quite
the comics fan.

276
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,068
Oh, was. Was. Zach and I here
are actually moving on.

277
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,157
Yeah, we're auctioning off our comics.

278
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,271
Your mom said you had
your own comic.

279
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,911
We did. We almost sold it to WildStorm,
save for a meltdown during the pitch.

280
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,389
Yeah, but we're putting
that behind us now.

281
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,114
That must be hard to walk away from,
your own comic.

282
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,954
You weren't at the meeting.

283
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,237
Cohen hasn't picked up a pencil
since that fateful Valentine's Day.

284
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,158
Well, I've actually been sort of....

285
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,679
You went on without me?

286
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,916
How many issues do you have?

287
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,071
I probably have enough
for 1 2 or 1 3 stories.

288
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,271
The perfect amount
for a graphic novel.

289
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,119
I always wanted to write
the great American graphic novel.

290
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,793
But we cannot.

291
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,036
Yes, we can. Come on, Cohen,
this is awesome.

292
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,555
It's not even up to me.
You know who it's up to?

293
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
-Who's it up to?
-lt starts with an S.

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,831
Hello, Summer, my dearest.

295
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,195
Okay. What do you want, Cohen?

296
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,271
Thought you were working
at the yard sale.

297
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,914
Can't a guy just show
his lady a little bit of love?

298
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,029
Okay, I was at the yard sale.
And Zach and I got to talking.

299
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,755
Zach was there? I'm glad to hear
you two are putting the past behind you.

300
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,837
Well, about the past....

301
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,877
So Zach and I got to talking...

302
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,790
...and we're sort of chatting
about our passions and our dreams.

303
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,629
That make you think of me?
That is so sweet.

304
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,074
No, actually.

305
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,637
Really? Because the only other passions
you have besides me are Captain Oats...

306
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,712
...whiny music and, well,
I know it can't be comic books...

307
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,599
...because if you bring up
you and Zach and Atomic County...

308
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,069
...I'll kill you both while you sleep.

309
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,429
I hope you approve of the tablecloth
that I have selected for dinner.

310
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,636
I really don't care
about tablecloths, honey.

311
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,030
I just enjoy watching
those Newpsies squirm.

312
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,634
Have I mentioned
how much I like Carter?

313
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,030
A few times, yes.

314
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,239
After Jimmy left, I thought I'd said
goodbye to my last friend. But Carter...

315
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,550
...I think he's a keeper.

316
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,312
Really? Well, that's great.

317
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,318
We're talking about hanging out
next week, get some drinks.

318
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,670
Well, I know he likes drinks.

319
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,035
You are looking at a proud new renter.

320
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,755
-What? Wow, congrats, man.
-Thanks.

321
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,639
-I'll get it.
-Oh, thank you. We are playing....

322
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,038
Cohen residence.

323
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,112
Oh, hi. Yeah, hang on.

324
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,033
Hey, Trey, it's for you.
It's the landlord.

325
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,475
Grab it right there.

326
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,996
-Hello.
-Hey. So bad news.

327
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,072
Your background didn 't check out.
I just can 't risk making you the manager.

328
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,959
But you seem like a good guy,
so I'll hold the place for 24 hours.

329
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,431
I'll come up with the money. Thanks.

330
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,397
You bet.

331
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,193
-Everything all right?
-Yeah.

332
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,351
He just wanted to know
when I'm moving in.

333
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,909
-You sure you can cover the money?
-It's handled.

334
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,117
I'll just do some work around the place
until I can pay him back.

335
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,550
I told you, I'm getting it together.

336
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,829
-I'm proud of you, man.
-Well, thank Marissa. It was her idea.

337
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,996
Where you been?

338
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,557
Don't worry about me, Mommy.

339
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,511
I was over at the new place.

340
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,036
The landlord wanted me to tape down
some drywall, do a little plastering.

341
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,668
-At 6 in morning?
-Plaster's gotta dry...

342
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,070
...before you paint, bro.

343
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,468
Okay.

344
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,199
Come in.

345
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,119
-Hey.
-Hi.

346
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,319
I was making breakfast, and I made too
much. I thought you might be hungry.

347
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,999
-No, thanks.
-Yeah?

348
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,756
Hey, I just wanted to thank you again
for helping me out...

349
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,712
...with the apartment.

350
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,475
But you're probably busy,
so I'll come back later.

351
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,716
Look, I overheard your call.

352
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,993
I know he didn't take the offer.

353
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,030
So when are you gonna tell Ryan?

354
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,079
I'm not. You know,
he really wants to believe in you.

355
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,840
-And why shouldn't he?
-Because you lied to him.

356
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,028
It's not a lie. I've got friends.
I'm gonna come up with the money.

357
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,390
I can help you.

358
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,118
You've done enough. And I don't need
anyone else here worrying about me.

359
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,838
I've got it.

360
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,229
All right. But you should know,
if you do anything stupid...

361
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,197
...it's really gonna hurt Ryan.

362
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,194
-So, what have you got?
-Our new hobby.

363
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,356
-Baseball cards.
-They're really cool.

364
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,393
They come with gum,
and they're worth all different amounts.

365
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,673
But each month, they go up and down
in value like the stock market.

366
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,510
-They come with gum.
-You talked to Summer.

367
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,150
I dipped a toe in the comic book pool.
It was icy, Zach. It was subzero.

368
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,634
So that's it?

369
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,837
All that work, you'll never show
anyone else because of a girl?

370
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,278
She threatened to kill us both,
while we sleep.

371
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,318
Give me one of those pieces of gum.

372
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,838
Who's Curt Schilling anyway?

373
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,433
I don't know.

374
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,637
Dude, I like his uniform, though.
Can I have this one?

375
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,677
Thanks.

376
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,113
My mom already left
for the pseudo-charity, non-yard sale.

377
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,838
Actually, I came to see you guys.

378
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,116
My old assistant
is the VP of development...

379
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,077
...at a graphic-novel company.

380
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,713
I arranged a meeting.

381
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,793
No. I'm sorry. Now, let's go. Zach,
you're driving. Thanks so much, though.

382
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,592
-Seth, do you realize what he's saying?
-Yes. He's offering to kill my relationship.

383
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,677
He's offering us a second chance.

384
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,672
-I promised.
-Dude, technically...

385
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,432
...you're not doing anything wrong.

386
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,277
You said you only floated the comic book
by her, not a graphic novel.

387
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,273
They have nicer paper.
So technically....

388
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,991
-Coop!
-I'm in the basement.

389
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,839
Well, no torture chamber down here.
Lost that bet.

390
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,434
So, what are we looking for anyway?

391
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,628
It's for the auction. I need--
I need money for Trey's security deposit.

392
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,872
Interesting stuff, huh?

393
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,074
Is that pure silver?

394
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,710
Yeah. See that mark right there?
That leopard's head with a "W.E. "...

395
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,914
...wow, it means made in London
by William Eaton circa 1 876, I think.

396
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,838
It could be worth a couple grand.

397
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,356
All that Antique Roadshow
really paid off.

398
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,756
Come here.

399
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,559
Come here.
I've become quite the expert.

400
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,149
-I put one on every week.
-I don't need your help.

401
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,476
Yeah, you do.

402
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,916
You're gonna hang yourself
with this thing.

403
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,993
There, let's see. All right.

404
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,109
You know, these formal things...

405
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,272
...they seem like they're
gonna be pretty boring...

406
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,310
...but usually something crazy
happens, keeps it exciting.

407
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,632
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. All right, there you go.

408
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,473
I am impressed.

409
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,271
Nice.

410
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,638
Ready to rip off some Newpsies?

411
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,513
-Kirsten.
-Hello, Joan.

412
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,638
-We never see you anymore.
-I've been really busy with work.

413
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,916
-Well, you look great.
-Thank you.

414
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,753
-Hey.
-Marissa, where did you get that?

415
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,110
I found this in the basement
with this junk...

416
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,635
...my mom's getting rid of.
I better get in there.

417
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,678
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

418
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,028
When you think about it,
our own graphic novel?

419
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,317
That's like 1 0 times cooler
than the comic book ever was.

420
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,471
-You guys bringing back the comic book?
-No.

421
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,636
-Absolutely not.
-Goodness gracious, no.

422
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,876
It's a graphic novel.
It's totally different.

423
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,793
Oh, okay. So there's no Kid Chino
or no Cosmo Girl?

424
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,434
No you two working together,
ruining our friendships?

425
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,115
-I guess it isn't that different.
-Look, I promise it won't be like before.

426
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,232
-And we already kind of said yes.
-Yeah, but just to a meeting.

427
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,398
Okay. Any trouble...

428
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,313
...no more graphic novel,
no more comics, no more me.

429
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,990
-Pinky swear.
-Okay.

430
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,512
Last-minute addition?

431
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,110
Oh, yeah. Thanks. I'll just take it
in the back and tag it.

432
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,989
Thanks again for helping out my brother.
I appreciate it.

433
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,676
Seems like things
are going pretty good, right?

434
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,593
Yeah.

435
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,679
Well, I'm gonna go see if they need
help inside. I'll see you in there.

436
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,998
Trey.

437
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,917
I'll see you in a bit. What's up?

438
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,156
This glass egg from Risky Business.

439
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,676
It's probably the most valuable
thing here, and now it's gone.

440
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,350
-Trey didn't--?
-Yeah. Yeah, I think he did.

441
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,274
Why would Trey steal anything though?
I mean, everything's going great, right?

442
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,157
No. No, he lied.

443
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,670
He didn't clear the background check
on the apartment.

444
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,597
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because I told her not to.

445
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,150
-So you stole it?
-I didn't steal it.

446
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,669
Don't lie to me, Trey.

447
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,032
What does it matter?
These people think this stuff is junk.

448
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,037
How could you do this, man?

449
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,397
After everything the Cohens have done?
Everything Marissa's done?

450
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,875
Can't you think of anyone
but yourself?

451
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,758
I was thinking about you.

452
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,639
That's why I wanted to get the money,
to get out of the way.

453
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,195
You're gonna be,
because you're going back to jail.

454
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,834
Wait. Stop.

455
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,718
We can still get it back.

456
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,269
I've got the money.

457
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,479
Please.

458
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,314
You've done enough. I'll go.

459
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,668
Good afternoon, Newport Beach.

460
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,197
And welcome to the O.C.
pseudo-charity, non-yard sale.

461
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,436
Yes, exactly, you get it.
I'm Sandy Cohen.

462
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,956
I'll be your host and auctioneer
for this grand event brought to you...

463
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,714
...by Newport Living
and the fabulous team...

464
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,589
...of Carter Buckley and the lovely
and alluring Kirsten Cohen.

465
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,598
Let's give it up for them!

466
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,029
-What will you do?
-Find the egg before anyone notices.

467
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,712
All right.

468
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,159
Last year we raised over $1 00,000.

469
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,518
But only $50,000 went to charity.

470
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,351
-Summer, come on.
-What? The auction.

471
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,557
Without further ado,
let's get the auction started.

472
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,239
What are we doing?

473
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,198
-Stalling until Ryan's back with the egg.
-What egg?

474
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,191
Our first item--

475
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,072
-Hey.
-Hi.

476
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,955
-Can I help you?
-Well, we're your assistants.

477
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,756
Every honorary chair gets assistants.
To assist.

478
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,791
Let's welcome our lovely assistants,
ladies and gentlemen.

479
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,508
-Hey, where you going?
-I'll tell you later.

480
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,752
-Marissa gets to be part of the plan.
-I just gotta do something.

481
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,798
Okay. You're gonna need a wingman.
Marissa and my dad are busy.

482
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,349
-Come on, I never get to go.
-Yeah, there's a reason.

483
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,670
If I go with you,
no one will suspect anything.

484
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,037
We all know if you were doing anything
dangerous I wouldn't get to go.

485
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,838
I'm the perfect cover.

486
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,719
-No comments about me and Marissa?
-You and who?

487
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,319
I didn't know you'd throw it. Next time.
I just need a little bit of a heads-up.

488
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,869
If you're wingman
you'll have to catch the keys.

489
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,119
Okay, folks, here's a beautiful Erté-esque
statue. Y es, indeed, very fetching.

490
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,834
What do we start the bidding at?
Seventy-five dollars?

491
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,639
I guess it's very "esque. "
More "esque" than Erté.

492
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,032
Sold to the lovely young ladies.

493
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,239
The ram's head is going for $300.
Do we hear $300?

494
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,556
Three hundred over here.
$400 over here.

495
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,158
Five hundred fifty dollars over here!
Going once, going twice. Sold for $550.

496
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,157
Imagine what the whole beast
would cost.

497
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,514
Do I hear $2000 for the tea set?
$2000.

498
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,717
Do I hear 2500?
Twenty-five hundred dollars. Wow, okay.

499
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,115
Three thousand dollars?
Three thousand.

500
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,157
Thirty-five hundred? $3500.

501
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,870
Do I hear $4000? Come on, folks,
reach into those deep pockets.

502
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,554
-Five thousand.
-Five thousand dollars?

503
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,159
Five thousand.

504
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,272
Do I hear $5500?
Fifty-five hundred dollars? Anyone?

505
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,600
Fifty-five hundred dollars.
All right, going once. Going twice. Sold!

506
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,869
For $5000 to my lovely bride
who, apparently, is just crazy for tea.

507
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,550
This is it. Must be in the back.
You stay here.

508
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,830
What are you gonna do?

509
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,230
-I don't know.
-Okay, I've got a plan.

510
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,749
The kind that made me
all-camp Capture the Flag.

511
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,831
And it is extremely stealth.

512
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,273
This next one is a very exciting one.
Folks, who here is a T om Cruise fan?

513
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,277
-Do something.
-What? Why?

514
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,232
Trey stole it. Ryan went to get it.

515
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,829
-What do you want me to do about it?
-Ladies...

516
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,072
...please bring, straight out of 1 983--

517
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,796
My shoes! Yeah! Which are vintage.

518
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,116
Your shoes?

519
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,709
-How about we auction these off?
-What are you doing?

520
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,359
Everything's been auctioned off.

521
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,471
-Do we hear $30?
-Other than, you know....

522
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,677
I know, and it's up next.
So think of something else to auction...

523
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,717
...or Summer's gonna be
selling herself.

524
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,480
Thirty dollars! Thirty dollars, anyone?

525
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,318
Sixty.

526
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,310
-Sixty dollars.
-Foot fetish much?

527
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,879
Sold!

528
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,792
-Hello. Pleased to meet you.
-Who the hell are you?

529
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,151
Well, I'm Pippins McGee, and I'm
from the Film Preservation Society.

530
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,239
And what we are doing is we're putting
on a T om Cruise retrospective.

531
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,635
Now, I understand
that you are in possession...

532
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,268
...of the crystal egg
from Risky Business?

533
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,913
Hi. How are you?

534
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,839
What we' re doing is we' re collecting
Mr. Cruise's props...

535
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,798
...from his most memorable films
and putting them on display.

536
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,752
We've got the rum bottle
from Cocktail.

537
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,911
We've got the ceramic mask
from Vanilla Sky.

538
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,116
We've got the little kid
from Jerry Maguire.

539
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,635
He's in the car.
Are you interested in meeting him?

540
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,472
-Yeah, cool, man. Get lost.
-Wait.

541
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,710
How does he know about the egg?

542
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,719
How does he know about the egg?
How do you know? How do l?

543
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,711
-How do you? How do l?
-How do you know?

544
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,075
-How do I know about the egg?
-Yes.

545
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,713
Mr. Cruise had it outfitted...

546
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,635
...with a transmitro pneumonic
transmitter device-tronic.

547
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,513
It's sort of a homing device.
Must be a Scientology thing.

548
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,636
Mr. Cruise does it
to his favorite props.

549
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,116
-Let's kill this guy, man.
-Hey! Hey.

550
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,799
What the hell is going on?

551
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,438
-Seth, go deep!
-This never worked in P.E.

552
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,031
All right. This is unexpected,
but in a good way.

553
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,078
We have a new addition
to the auction.

554
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,829
They clean. They mow the lawn.
They look good in suits.

555
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,958
We're talking about two of Newport's
most strapping young men...

556
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,593
...Zach and Trey.

557
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,712
-Where do we begin the bidding?
-Eight hundred.

558
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,637
-Ryan, I caught it.
-That's great. Run!

559
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,190
And now,
the item you've all been waiting for...

560
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,472
...since there is no thing and no one
left to be auctioned.

561
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:43,237
That's right, folks, finally,
the crystal egg from Risky Business.

562
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,391
Ladies.

563
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,436
-Ladies.
-Yeah.

564
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,672
So you've all heard
of a silent auction.

565
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,838
For this item, we thought it
might be fun to do a blind auction.

566
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,788
Since you can't actually see the egg,
we thought we would describe it to you.

567
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,629
So it's egg-shaped.
And it's made of crystal.

568
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,998
And, well, Tom Cruise touched it,
so that's hot.

569
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,552
That's hot.
Let's start the bidding at $5000.

570
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,589
$1 0,000. Going once.

571
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,879
Come on, we're talking about a major
piece of motion picture history here.

572
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,516
$1 0,000 going twice!

573
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,557
Reach into those deep pockets
of yours.

574
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,072
Come on, folks!
$1 0,000 going three times.

575
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,919
Going. Going.

576
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,271
Yes! Going and sold to the beautiful
young lady right here at the front.

577
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,712
Gentlemen, please present the egg
to the very proud owner.

578
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,159
Ladies and gentlemen, that's it
for today's auction. The bar is open!

579
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,911
Looks like the lronist and Kid Chino...

580
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,029
...with a little help from Cosmo Girl
and Little Miss Vixen, saved the day.

581
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,111
It's like an issue of Atomic County.

582
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,068
Nope, just life with Trey.
Thank you for your help.

583
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,072
I don't know what you were up to...

584
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,834
...but I'm betting it had something
to do with Trey.

585
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,560
He sings, he surfs,
and he reads minds.

586
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,558
And it's still not enough
to get you to talk to me.

587
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,877
The next time something comes up,
come to me.

588
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,430
So I earned $400 auctioning myself off.
I figure that's a start, right?

589
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,790
I got you the money you need.
I sold something from our basement.

590
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,918
I said I'd help you.
I just wish you'd heard me.

591
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,552
I screwed up.

592
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,593
I know.

593
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,596
I just...

594
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,752
-...wanted to do it on my own.
-You don't have to do it on your own.

595
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,040
Yeah, I do. Because there's no way
Ryan's ever gonna forgive me.

596
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,676
And I don't blame him.

597
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,948
I'll talk to him.

598
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,076
Thank you.

599
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,869
And I'm gonna pay you back.

600
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,754
If you told me you wanted that tea set,
I would have just given to you.

601
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,515
Well, my mom would've been proud
to have her tea set auctioned for charity.

602
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,030
It's okay. I thought it was lost.
My dad's not a big fan of tea.

603
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,439
What are you gonna say to him?

604
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,716
Nothing.

605
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,917
In the morning, he's gone.
I don't care where he goes.

606
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,436
Well, he's going
to Alex's old apartment.

607
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,398
I got him the money. Legally.

608
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,394
Thanks.

609
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,836
You cold?

610
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,788
Yep, always.
I do wear flannel pajamas.

611
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,879
Thanks.

612
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,879
Sorry. Hang on.

613
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,838
It's my mom.

614
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,269
Well, is everything okay?

615
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,360
Okay. All right. Bye.

616
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,872
I guess my mom came home early.

617
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,755
She wants to pick me up
in half an hour.

618
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,599
So....

619
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,030
So....

620
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,478
I better go pack my stuff.
