1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,598
Ryan?

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,031
Buddy, come on.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,197
Look, I know you're bummed that
Lindsay left, but you can't live like this.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,353
Hey.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,353
Do you remember when Summer
was leaving for ltaly with Zach...

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,034
...you refused to let me stay
bedridden and depressed?

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,755
No, I didn't. I gave you your space,
said do what you have to do.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,754
True, but right now
what I have to do is help you.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,390
So, what can I do? Level with me.
Ask, and it shall be yours.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,430
Fine. You, leaving right now.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,676
Okay, anything but that.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,798
Hey, what about Captain Oats?

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,509
Seen the way you look at him. Say the
word and your pool house is his manger.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,796
-Seth--
-Speaking of which, are you getting...

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,279
...sick of the pool house?

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,357
We can switch rooms.
You can have mine.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,158
We thought you'd like the privacy.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,590
I like the privacy. I would
like some right now.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,429
What about a nice private booth
at our favorite diner, huh?

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,115
Cup of coffee, short stack,
a little syrup, side of bacon...

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,669
-Seth....
-...extra crispy like the man likes it.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,997
-Maybe those nice little sausage patties.
-Seth, shut up!

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,639
Please.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,514
This thing with Lindsay is...

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,434
...different.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,279
-Different how?
-Different, as in not fixed by pancakes.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,110
And don't ask me how
I feel about waffles.

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,151
Got it.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,518
-I don't mean to take this out on you.
-No, it's fine. That's what I'm here for.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,397
I've just had a lot of people
in my life who just left.

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,315
I thought those days were gone,
but l...

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,398
...guess they aren't.

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,438
Okay.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,198
All right, well, I'm just gonna leave.

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,477
Not leave, but you know
what I'm saying.

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,236
I can get you something to go.
It's stupid. Okay.

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,790
-Hey, honey.
-Hey.

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,912
Oh, right, coffee.

39
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,199
Thanks.

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,517
-Oh, hey, I thought you were--
-No, no, no. It's my fault. Let me--

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,319
Everything's gonna be fine.

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,114
If we act like nothing happened,
then it'll be as if--

43
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,753
Nothing happened.

44
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,279
Where's your ring?

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,471
Two carats, platinum setting, lives
on your left hand, second finger.

46
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,195
I can't find it.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,273
-You never take that ring off.
-That's not true.

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,830
Sometimes when I'm washing the dishes
or gardening I leave it by the sink.

49
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,952
I bet it fell in.
I bet it's stuck in the drain.

50
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,599
I'll call the plumber tomorrow.

51
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,914
I'm sure it's not lost.

52
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,038
-Hey.
-Hi.

53
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,032
-Wait a sec.
-But I've been waiting.

54
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,236
I know. I'm afraid we have
a man down though.

55
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,075
This thing with Lindsay has
just really kicked Ryan's ass.

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,430
It's a good thing we're like the Marines.

57
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,598
-How are we like the Marines?
-We leave no man behind.

58
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,274
Lindsay may have turned
her back on Ryan, but we won't.

59
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,431
You have got to cheer him up.
Semper fi.

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,557
-"Semper fi. " That's so cute.
-Yeah.

61
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,314
Wait. That has to wait.
Plans and action.

62
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,233
I'm gonna ask Marissa to the mall.
Maybe you guys can come.

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,512
-The mall? That would cheer him up.
-Well....

64
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,672
All right, fine, I will ask him
to the mall. You know what?

65
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,196
Now that you and I are back together
and Lindsay's out of the picture...

66
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,715
...maybe Marissa and Ryan
might get it together.

67
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,474
Are you crazy? They were,
like, the worst couple ever.

68
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,278
And besides, Marissa's happy now.

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,835
Okay, and by "happy" you mean--
You mean "gay. "

70
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,874
That's funny.

71
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,548
Our clothes are all pink.

72
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,314
Pink is the new black.

73
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,839
I read it in W.

74
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,433
Well, I mean, separating your whites?
Who knew?

75
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,835
Everyone who's ever had
to do their own laundry.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,797
Look, I'm sorry. We'll get new stuff.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,877
With what? You found
an after-school job?

78
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,433
I'm working on it.

79
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,032
Well, lucky for you,
I look really good in pink.

80
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,038
Maybe today we could do
something fun. It's the weekend.

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,316
Maybe we could go to the beach.
Or the pier.

82
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,199
That sounds great. And I would
love to, but I have to work.

83
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,036
Maybe tonight I can pick up some
takeout, and we can go sit by the water?

84
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,830
-Okay, sounds good.
-Okay, good.

85
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,236
If a big fat guy with
an "l heart NASCAR" tattoo shows up...

86
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,989
...don't answer the door, because he's
our landlord, and we're late on rent.

87
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,673
Bye.

88
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,518
Sanford.

89
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,915
Glad to see you've finally
found your calling.

90
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,038
-Where's Kiki?
-Kirsten's at the office with your wife.

91
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,037
They're working on the magazine.

92
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,835
I must tell you I'm really disturbed
by Lindsay's departure.

93
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,679
Must you tell me? Isn't there
anyone else you can tell?

94
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,231
I lost my daughter.

95
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,510
I'm sorry, Cal.

96
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,872
If you wanna talk, I'll listen.

97
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,996
Hate to admit it, but I really screwed up.

98
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,994
Hand me the pliers.

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,797
Why can't I edit my own magazine?

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,672
You've never edited a magazine.

101
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,670
Yeah, but why this guy? He launched
a magazine called The Ugly American.

102
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,393
I've heard of that.

103
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,438
It's an independent travel magazine.
It won a bunch of awards.

104
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,190
Fine, but our magazine is
about beautiful Americans.

105
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,519
She works here.

106
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,999
She's like the big boss.

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,794
Julie, promise me that
you will make the best of it.

108
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,753
Julie Cooper. Or is it Nichol now?

109
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,918
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cooper-Nichol
is behind closed doors.

110
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,350
Well, tell her Lance
stopped by looking for her.

111
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,873
She knows me.

112
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,991
A little blast from the past.

113
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,319
Julie?

114
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,876
-Did you hear a word that I just said?
-Yeah, of course.

115
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,112
Yeah. I couldn't have said it
better myself.

116
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,191
That girl really got to me.

117
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,828
I worry about her all the time.

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,195
How she is, what she's doing.

119
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,873
I was watching a peanut butter
commercial on television.

120
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,190
I was blubbering like a baby.

121
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,397
Well, there's nothing like
a good cry to release the tension.

122
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,233
-ls the wrench over there?
-What are you doing, anyway?

123
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,271
I'm looking for Kirsten's wedding ring.

124
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,512
Oh, Father, I'm glad to see you
finally found your calling.

125
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,076
-Exactly what I said.
-Nothing like a crack about a plumber.

126
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,840
Plumber, crack. That's funny.

127
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,957
Ryan buddy?

128
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,038
You in the latrine, soldier?

129
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,439
Hey, Summer. I thought you were this
guy with an "l heart NASCAR" tattoo.

130
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,551
Okay, not asking why.

131
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,152
What is that earthy, musky smell?
Potpourri?

132
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,799
No, that's skunked beer.

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,673
Hey, it must be awesome
to get away from your mom, huh?

134
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,518
Be out of Caleb's mansion?

135
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,318
T otally.

136
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,154
I don't miss it at all.

137
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,678
So I'm sure that you have, like, these
really cool, edgy plans with Alex today.

138
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,593
But I have to go to the mall
for the clothing drive.

139
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,678
-Battered women's shelter.
-The mall? Sounds great.

140
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,432
Let me just grab my purse.

141
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,591
Bus 5675, Fort Irwin, now boarding.

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,833
I hope you brought a lot of snacks.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,070
It's a long ride to Chicago.

144
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,113
-I forgot you were an expert.
-Oh, dude, running away?

145
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,272
-That's very Seth Cohen.
-No, I'm not....

146
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,670
I mean, I am, but I'm coming back.

147
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,037
I just thought I'd show up for
the weekend, you know, surprise her.

148
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,753
Yeah.

149
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,878
I don't know, man. I think
Lindsay's had enough surprises.

150
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,713
You should really try
and give it some time.

151
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,393
How?

152
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,999
How am I supposed to do that?

153
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,636
Well, for starters,
you can keep yourself distracted.

154
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,193
Marissa and Summer are heading to the
mall to pick up some clothes for charity.

155
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,836
Think about what's at the mall. There's
a movie theater. There's an arcade.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,638
There's a CPK...

157
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,476
...featuring exotic toppings from around
the world on a seasoned, herbed crust.

158
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,831
And I'll tell you this much.
If by tomorrow morning...

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,833
...you still wanna go to Chicago,
I promise you...

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,275
...I will drive you
to the bus stop myself...

161
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,433
...and I will generate a fantastic
cover story for the parents.

162
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,398
Yeah.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,797
-Yeah.
-Good.

164
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,234
It's settled.

165
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,034
Bus 5675 to Fort Irwin, now boarding.

166
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,276
I' m saving Private Ryan.

167
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,833
-Home, sweet home.
-Sweet, sweet shopping.

168
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,918
Twenty-four hours, buddy.
You' re gonna feel like a new man.

169
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,474
-How's our trooper?
-Oh, our work's not done yet.

170
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,116
Hey. The Tower of Pisa,
that's in ltaly, right?

171
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,754
Ryan and Marissa alone?
It's awkward. Let's go.

172
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,155
So the stuff for
the battered women's shelter...

173
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,515
...is in those boxes and on this rack.

174
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,352
-Thanks.
-As if those poor women's...

175
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,750
...Iives weren't hard enough.

176
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,196
Someone should get a restraining order
against that coat.

177
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,754
Oh, we close early today,
so don't take too long.

178
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,957
Okay. Looks like somebody missed
the sensitivity training seminar.

179
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,869
You guys, this is gonna be
so much fun, though.

180
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,713
It's like we have
a backstage pass to the mall.

181
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,391
"Backstage pass to the mall. "
Summer, come here. That's so cute.

182
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,832
I'll take pants. You take sweaters.

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,230
-Sounds perfect.
-Great.

184
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,399
You think we should put your photo
on the cover every month?

185
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,309
Maybe sometimes we could show
Newport. A house, the beach.

186
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,392
What's the incentive to buy
the magazine? If people wanna see...

187
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,959
...the beach, they can go there.

188
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,712
That would just be wrong.

189
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,480
-Hi, Carter. I'm Kirsten.
-Hi.

190
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,870
-This is Julie.
-A pleasure to meet you both.

191
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,392
Julie Cooper-Nichol, CEO of the Newport
Group and founder of Newport Living.

192
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,434
What Julie meant to say was that
she is also pleased to meet you.

193
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,511
Look, I don't know you,
and l' m not going to lie to you.

194
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,433
-This magazine is about us.
-It's really more about her.

195
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,596
And people who aspire
to be like us.

196
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,196
We don't need some outsider coming in,
telling us what to do. No offense.

197
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,029
None taken. I don't wanna be here
any more than you want me here.

198
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,717
-You don't?
-Why, what's wrong with here?

199
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,514
I don't think the world needs
more proclamations about...

200
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,558
-...how Mukluks are the new Uggs.
-Our bar's not that low.

201
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,994
He's right about Mukluks.

202
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,713
Look, this can be painless.

203
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,037
I know that you resent the publisher
foisting me on your magazine.

204
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,679
I resent being foisted.

205
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,799
May this be the first of many things
we have in common.

206
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,912
We'll sit down a couple of times
a week, you do what you want...

207
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,559
...and I'll go with my paycheck.

208
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,994
Now...

209
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,718
...who wants a cocktail?

210
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,472
-Sorry about the ring, Sanford.
-Starr?

211
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,756
Come, come. Never picked you
for a rum man.

212
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,353
Thank you.

213
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,750
Thank you for your help...

214
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,275
...as much as I resisted it.

215
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,313
Your support
has been alarmingly genuine.

216
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,473
Well, what you're doing is
a nice thing for Kiki.

217
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,035
Guess I figured making
one daughter happy...

218
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,430
...might take the edge off
hurting the other one.

219
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,433
-Oh, I don't know if that's possible.
-How would you know...

220
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,592
...Mr. Self-Righteous-l-Never-
Hurt-People-l-Only-Help-Them?

221
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,119
I hurt Kirsten.

222
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,397
What did you do?

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,355
An old relationship
came back into my life.

224
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,556
-You had an affair.
-No.

225
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,919
But this woman, Rebecca, was
very important to me once...

226
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,470
...and having her around took
a real toll on me and my marriage.

227
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,119
So...

228
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,396
...I'm trying to make it up to Kirsten.

229
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,028
Hence my foray into plumbing.

230
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,673
That ring means a lot to her.

231
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,156
Well, it took me a long time to
save up enough money to buy it.

232
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,069
If memory serves, you proposed using
a prize from a Cracker Jack box.

233
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,872
It wasn't from a Cracker Jack box.

234
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,510
I won that ring from
the Cliff House Arcade in San Francisco.

235
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,829
And my beautiful daughter
walked around for years...

236
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,719
...with a hunk of plastic on her finger.

237
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,437
Marissa?

238
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,478
Hey, it's Marissa. Leave a message.

239
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,076
Hey.

240
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,597
House isn't broken into, so l' m assuming
you haven't been abducted, but....

241
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,190
I guess l' m gonna jump
in the shower. Call me.

242
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,397
Stop. Wait, it's acrylic.
I'm gonna break out.

243
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,120
"Break out. " You're so cute.

244
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,392
-Hey.
-Hey.

245
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,278
So how are you?

246
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,793
With Lindsay and everything?

247
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,194
Honestly, I'm not so good.
How about you?

248
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,832
-Thrilled to get out of the house.
-Yeah? You back to your mom's?

249
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,914
No, Alex's.

250
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,239
I mean, our place, I guess.

251
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,358
-Guys, I think we're stuck in here.
-That clueless sales skank.

252
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,512
-She probably did it on purpose.
-Well, let's just call someone.

253
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,551
-Help!
-On the phone.

254
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,756
Yeah, except there is no phone.

255
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,996
I have--

256
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,069
There's no cell service.
Wait, I have an idea.

257
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,838
Oh, good idea. Here you go, buddy.
Go to town.

258
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,468
Now, why would you assume
I know how to pick a lock?

259
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,552
I didn't. I just thought you'd
wanna give it a try.

260
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,954
Sort of my specialty.

261
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,431
Come on.

262
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,438
-You getting it?
-Talk to me, baby. Talk to me.

263
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,874
-It's going?
-Oh, yeah.

264
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,158
I'm hearing something, all right.
Okay, good news, guys. I almost got it.

265
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,151
But then what happened was
I broke it.

266
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,113
God. This is like the episode
of The Valley...

267
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,875
...where Jake goes to the bank, and him
and April get locked in the vault.

268
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,878
-How'd they get out?
-They had to wait till the morning.

269
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,957
-That's how April got pregnant.
-Sweetie.

270
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,230
There's gotta be a way out of here.

271
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,954
-You guys.
-What's up?

272
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,793
What about over there?

273
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,397
Hey, Ryan, what did I tell you?
Isn't this great?

274
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,071
It's like Goonies meets Die Hard,
by way of Mission: Impossible...

275
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,037
...with, I think...

276
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,191
...a hint of National Treasure thrown in.

277
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,476
Hey, about before,
when I told you to shut up?

278
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,318
Y eah, I know, l' m doing it again.

279
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,999
No, no.

280
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,435
Thanks, man, for getting me
out here.

281
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,999
In here.

282
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,478
-Yeah, not giving up.
-Yeah.

283
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,950
Oh, Ryan, I think I found
a quicker way out.

284
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,918
Unfortunately, it involves
broken bones and broken glass.

285
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,872
Well, I think this is the last of it.

286
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,593
Yes.

287
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,358
So you and Seth seem happy.

288
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,834
Yeah.

289
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,470
Yeah, you know, I just--
I really want it to be different this time.

290
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,313
For better or for worse.
I really feel connected to him.

291
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,076
I mean, do you feel that way
with Alex?

292
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,439
Well, truthfully, I think the only person
I've ever really felt that way with is....

293
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,119
Yeah.

294
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,398
I mean, is it weird being here
with him and me and Cohen?

295
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,913
No, it's fine.

296
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,394
Good.

297
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,949
Because I know you're into chicks
now and everything.

298
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,998
But do you ever think about getting
back together with him?

299
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,509
I mean, Lindsay's gone now, and--

300
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,393
Yeah, Lindsay's gone,
and he's heartbroken.

301
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,397
Do you miss him?

302
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,834
Every day.

303
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,349
-Hey.
-Hey, guys. Where's...?

304
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,391
Hey, Ryan.

305
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,798
So why is no one else here?

306
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,313
The store's closed.

307
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,039
-Let's find an exit and get out of here.
-Good idea.

308
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,236
Wait, wait, we're not going anywhere.

309
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,197
Yeah, because we're trapped. So let's--

310
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,992
Yes, trapped in a department store,
which is my ultimate fantasy.

311
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,839
-Okay, and what if we get caught?
-We'll be stealth.

312
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,113
Come on, what could be cooler? Go to
sleep in a mall and wake up in a mall?

313
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,995
Come on, it's like being
awake but still dreaming.

314
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,794
The mall doesn't open until
1 0 a.m. We'll be out before.

315
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,752
We could get McMuffins.

316
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,350
Yeah, I suppose we could all use
a night to forget our troubles.

317
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,794
By "all," I mean "Ryan. "

318
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,554
-That's true.
-So it's settled then.

319
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,432
Okay.

320
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,676
What happens in the mall
stays in the mall.

321
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,074
Cool.

322
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,918
Sorry to wake you at 8:00 at night.

323
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,230
Can you tell my dad I'm sleeping
at Marissa's?

324
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,712
Sorry I missed your call. I just brought
some laundry over to my mom's place.

325
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,235
I was thinking
I might just spend the night.

326
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,550
Yeah, so anyway, call my cell.

327
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,315
Dad, Ryan and I are trapped in the mall,
and we're gonna spend the night here.

328
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,869
I know the credit card is
just for emergencies...

329
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,474
...but I may have to shell out
for a few supplies.

330
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,711
A little something
I like to call the truth.

331
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,438
So, what do we do now?

332
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,393
I have an idea.

333
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,508
-You're gonna kill us with a chain saw?
-No.

334
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,076
High score gets the bed in the
showroom. Low score takes the tent.

335
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,554
We're playing sports?

336
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,474
-All right.
-Come on.

337
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,756
-Get that over there.
-Hey, Summer, stop it.

338
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,679
-Go, go!
-Seth, quit cheating.

339
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,597
What? Hey, that's not fair.
Come on! Offsides!

340
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,358
What? That wasn't offsides.

341
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,114
-Summer. Block him.
-Yes!

342
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,958
Yeah!

343
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,271
Seth.

344
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,799
Come on, come on, get up.
Get up. Up, up, up.

345
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,714
Don't be a baby.

346
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,480
Get it, girl! Get it! Get it!

347
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,078
No, let me get that.

348
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,719
Oh, my God.

349
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,839
Hey, it's the new body shimmer.
Shimmery.

350
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,874
You guys, enough with the sports.
Let's eat.

351
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,828
-I think I'll go to the bar.
-Great.

352
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,070
I'll have a Pinot Grigio.

353
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,357
No, thank you.

354
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,396
-What the hell are you doing here?
-That's no way to greet your first love.

355
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,751
-You weren't my first love, just my first.
-A girl never forgets.

356
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,077
Maybe she had so much Southern
Comfort she never remembered.

357
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,714
Maybe we should try a reenactment.

358
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,798
I know you, so cut to the chase.

359
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,793
You wouldn't be here if you
didn't want something.

360
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,439
-I have something for you.
-Yeah?

361
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,832
Last time you gave me something,
I drank cranberry juice for a week.

362
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,596
-What did I ever do to you?
-Oh, I've been watching you rise, baby.

363
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,514
Married to the richest man in town,
living in the biggest house.

364
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,114
-You want money.
-Take a look.

365
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,152
Tell me how much it's worth to you.

366
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,237
-I have two daughters now.
-I know.

367
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,994
And aren't they worth protecting?

368
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,078
Guys, I'm--
I'm suddenly not feeling so well.

369
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,193
-Food poisoning or something.
-We haven't eaten.

370
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,632
Cohen!

371
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,677
Cohen!

372
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,593
I was foraging. Here.

373
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,116
What is it? Chicken-flavored soy malt.

374
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,590
-It's kosher.
-It's only 3600 calories.

375
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,678
-Hey, Summer?
-What?

376
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,879
Could you maybe go grab another
papier-mâché log for the faux fire?

377
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,076
That way we can make fake s'mores.

378
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,591
Yeah, sure.

379
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,676
I want to. Dude, don't do it.
Don't do it.

380
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,400
Oh, okay, let's do it.

381
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,115
Hey, I can't--

382
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,034
Cohen? What are you doing?

383
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,633
Hey, I got a pizza for....

384
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,076
You. Didn 't we have sex?

385
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,512
No, I'm a virgin. At least, I think I am.

386
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,513
Why don 't you stay for a slice.
Are you hungry?

387
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,636
Starving.

388
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,553
- You really don 't remember me?
-No.

389
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,718
I have amnesia.
I don 't remember anything.

390
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,473
-Oh, my God.
-Remember that?

391
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,719
It's cool. A little porn
on a Saturday night.

392
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,110
-My lips are sealed.
-What are you doing here?

393
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,834
Looking for Marissa.
She left a message she was here.

394
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,110
Well, she's not.

395
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,795
I guess I'm not the only one
she lies to, huh?

396
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,550
I know my daughter.

397
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,151
I only let her go with you
because I knew...

398
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,959
...it was a matter of time
before she came back.

399
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,875
As much as Marissa likes to complain,
she had a very nice life, thanks to me.

400
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,350
One she'll miss
once the novelty wears off...

401
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,556
...which, I'm guessing, is about now.

402
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,035
Marissa--

403
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,352
Marissa's not happy.

404
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,440
Marissa and happy parted ways
about her 1 6th birthday...

405
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,354
...but have you met her new friends,
"sullen" and "vindictive"?

406
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,954
No, the only ones she's
brought over to the house...

407
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,953
...are "scared" and "overwhelmed. "

408
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,873
Alex-- And...

409
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,388
...I'm not saying this to be mean,
because you actually seem...

410
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,836
...Iike a nice enough girl
and I like your pants...

411
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,834
...but you are this week's yard guy...

412
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,789
...Marissa's latest drama, a weapon
of torture to inflict against me.

413
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,599
-You don't know that.
-Yeah, honey, I do.

414
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,673
Marissa's only been in love once...

415
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,992
...and he looked a whole lot
different in a wife-beater.

416
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,718
-Hey.
-Hey.

417
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,270
-What'd you find?
-Gift basket.

418
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,318
Crackers, Brie, raspberry preserves.

419
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,832
Nice.

420
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,389
Oh, candy counter.

421
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,518
Macaroons. Licorice bits.

422
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,551
-Why are you mad?
-Why were you in my purse?

423
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,598
-Why were you getting cards from Zach?
-When I talked to him...

424
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,591
...I told him to send me a postcard.

425
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,637
-You talked to him?
-Yes.

426
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,673
Am I gonna ditch him at the airport
then not take his calls?

427
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,031
Look, Cohen, he's my friend.
He's your friend too.

428
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,356
Yeah, and friends let
friends read postcards.

429
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,670
-So why can't I see it?
-Can't you trust me...

430
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,752
-...that it doesn't say anything?
-I know it says something hot.

431
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,354
I saw what he wrote.
"Do you remember how hot it was? "

432
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,910
-The rest was covered by a stamp.
-Hey, we brought macaroons.

433
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,513
Spray cheese.

434
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,557
Who's hungry?

435
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,679
That big yellow one there.

436
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,199
Relax.

437
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,396
Relax, you're talking to a master here.

438
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,834
It's all in the wrist.

439
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,591
Blast, another key chain.

440
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,156
I really wanted to win this for Kirsten,
to prove to her....

441
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,709
-Prove to her what?
-That she's the love of my life.

442
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,199
That I cherish her above all.

443
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,273
You don't need a crappy piece
of plastic to do that. Just tell her.

444
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,511
You really want that ring, don't you?

445
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,359
More than anything.

446
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,189
-I'll get more quarters.
-More quarters.

447
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,553
We're really roughing it, huh?

448
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,149
Yeah.

449
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,879
All alone in the wilderness.

450
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,630
We should find Seth and Summer,
watch a movie.

451
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,234
We do have, like, 500 TV screens
all to ourselves.

452
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,158
Yeah, that sounds good, but--

453
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,555
Right, probably want their privacy.

454
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,198
Well, what happens at the mall
stays at the mall.

455
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,876
-I should....
-Yeah.

456
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,833
Hey.

457
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,076
Oh, yeah, I didn't end up
going to my mom's.

458
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,319
Well, I ran into Summer.

459
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,678
I think I'm just gonna hang
at her place.

460
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,796
I'll see you in the morning?

461
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,315
Okay, bye.

462
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,672
-Alex?
-Yeah.

463
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,277
It's not that she's the jealous type.

464
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,311
Right, I mean,
why would she be jealous?

465
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,751
Exactly. She'd just be bummed
to be missing--

466
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,110
All this.

467
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,990
-Tired?
-Exhausted.

468
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,277
Go for it. I'll camp here, keep
an eye out for bears and mall cops.

469
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,552
-No, you take it.
-You're not really the roughing-it type.

470
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,194
It's big enough for two.
It says it sleeps four.

471
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,358
-I'm not mad at you anymore.
-Well, I'm mad at you.

472
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,516
Fine. Then I am mad at you.

473
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,951
I don't get it. Why can't you tell me
what happened that was so hot?

474
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,237
What? Don't-- Don't shush me. Listen.

475
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,674
Company.

476
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,275
What?

477
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,516
-And that means "due south. " Just go.
-Get--

478
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,798
I can't believe Seth and
Summer are back together.

479
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,551
-Now we don't have to hear about it.
-Yeah, I'm sure we'll still hear about it.

480
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,751
They're probably fighting right now.

481
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,318
Remember last year when she went
to his house for Thanksgiving?

482
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,512
-Yeah, and Anna was over there.
-She was so pissed.

483
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,717
Yeah, I wish we could've
been there to see it.

484
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,994
Yeah. Too bad we were busy
driving stolen cars around Chino.

485
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,269
Well....

486
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,119
Yeah, that's my brother Trey.

487
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,072
Though we were almost killed it was--

488
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,679
Kind of fun.

489
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,193
Yeah.

490
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,872
We need to go right now.

491
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,790
You're gonna spend the next six months
devoted to Julie Cooper's vanity project?

492
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,397
What happened to The Ugly American?
That was the hottest travel magazine.

493
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,437
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

494
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,036
Actually, it's a short story
about a long bender.

495
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,236
I was in the middle of a divorce
at the time.

496
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,196
I'm sorry.

497
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,754
Why is it whenever I say I'm divorced,
people act like somebody's just died?

498
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,318
You ever been married?

499
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,040
-I am married.
-You're not wearing a ring.

500
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,758
I lost it.

501
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,037
I mean, I took it off,
and I can't find it.

502
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,273
That's a strong statement,
taking off your wedding ring.

503
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,791
I was potting geraniums.

504
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,910
The night I realized my wife
didn't love me anymore...

505
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,071
...I found her ring by the kitchen sink.

506
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,909
She said she'd been scrubbing
a casserole dish.

507
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,718
Those casseroles can be a bitch.

508
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,070
So could my ex.

509
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,834
I don't think we've said two words
about the magazine since Julie...

510
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,036
...Cooper-Nichol left the building.

511
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,638
I don't think we've accomplished
our goals for the day.

512
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,633
Well, I thought your goal was
getting paid for doing nothing.

513
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,515
Let's just say I'm finding Newport Living
a lot more interesting...

514
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,079
...than I thought it would be.

515
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,029
-She is so into you.
- You think?

516
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,555
I know. April told me herself.

517
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,714
We got them.

518
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,869
It's called playing you hot and cold,
and it's totally working.

519
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,031
April is a genius.

520
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,510
If they gave you points for pulling guys,
she 'd win, like, every year.

521
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,114
That was awesome.

522
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,794
Dude, it's Cole T rickle time, Atwood.
Floor it, man.

523
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,077
Hey, anyone hungry?

524
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,277
I' m sure Summer would like ltalian.

525
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,953
Oh, God, give it up, Cohen.

526
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,190
I will stop with the teasing
when you confess.

527
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,828
Okay, then I'll stop punching you
when you shut up.

528
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,398
-I'm thinking cheeseburgers.
-And chili fries? Perfect.

529
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,549
Come on.

530
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,152
Hello.

531
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,594
Enjoy the show?

532
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,075
I'll write you a check
for $50,000 right now.

533
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,750
Fifty G's? You spend that
much to keep your pool clean.

534
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,956
I was thinking more like 500,000.

535
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,036
Are you crazy?

536
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,073
I could make more than that
selling that tape on the lnternet.

537
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,151
-I can't get that money.
-I think you can.

538
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,595
Without my husband knowing?
What am I to tell him?

539
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,877
The truth. Your mom was sick,
your sister pregnant, and your tips...

540
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,474
... from waitressing weren 't
gonna pay rent that month.

541
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,191
Or...

542
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,351
... make something up.

543
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,550
-Well, why can' t l?
-Because it's not a big deal.

544
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,551
-Well, if it's not a big deal--
-Enough.

545
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,915
-What does it matter, Cohen?
-lt matters to me.

546
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,752
-We'll be inside.
-You guys coming?

547
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,554
We need to stay here so
I don't strangle him in public.

548
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,079
We'll save room in the booth.

549
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,597
How is it that Ryan and Marissa
are now the functional couple?

550
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,074
Oh, my God.

551
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,038
Okay, we cannot be more
annoying than Ryan and Marissa.

552
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,760
-We're monsters.
-I like monsters. But not us.

553
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,757
Do we not work as a couple anymore?

554
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,151
-Are we all setup and no payoff?
-All Preparation, no H?

555
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,356
Okay, pinkie swear.

556
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,557
If I tell you what's on the postcard,
we stop bickering.

557
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,716
About the postcard.

558
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,711
Okay, pinkie swear.

559
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,033
Okay. Look...

560
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,509
...here, right under the stamp.

561
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,318
What's so hot?

562
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,272
It's the weather.

563
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,908
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, right there.
-Yeah.

564
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,877
Yeah, and if you look down here...

565
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,354
...the sign-off, well...

566
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,869
...no "l love you,"
not even an "l miss you," but--

567
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,230
-"Say hi to Seth." It's from Zach.
-Yeah.

568
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,112
Yeah.

569
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,718
Come here.

570
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,555
Well, I definitely think
we work as a couple.

571
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,795
Sorry, I didn't think
I was gonna be so late.

572
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,593
I didn't find your ring.

573
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,073
You were looking for my ring?

574
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,232
Me and your father.
We made a day of it.

575
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,392
He was upset about Lindsay,
and I was upset about....

576
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,114
I was just upset.

577
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,912
Well, we'll find our groove.

578
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,752
And my ring.

579
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,552
In the meantime...

580
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,271
...we're gonna have to do the dishes
in the bathroom sink because l....

581
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,991
I lost the bolt. You know, that keeps
the pipe and the thing together.

582
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,997
But just know this.

583
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,151
I love you.

584
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,476
And I'm so sorry I did anything
to make you doubt it.

585
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,111
You know, it's funny.
Or not funny, really...

586
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,078
...but we've been apart
longer than we were together.

587
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,193
It has been a while.

588
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,597
Yeah, a lot's happened.

589
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,429
I guess you could say we're
kind of like strangers.

590
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,399
Yeah?

591
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,874
So who are you?

592
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,919
Whoever you want me to be.

593
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,838
Look at that, my little Summer.

594
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,278
Seems like the Fantastic Four
is becoming fantastic again.
