00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,555
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,792
- Julie Cooper, will you marry me?
- Oh, my God.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,949
Was I mean to you?

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,838
That would've required
you to speak to me.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,194
Lot's changed in a year, huh?

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,669
- Are we really gonna do this?
- I think we already are.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,719
- He really loves me, Ryan.
- You ran away to get away from him.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,030
- Then you took off without calling?
- Like when you left Chino.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,509
- How'd it go with the liquor board?
- Working on it.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,069
As of today,
I'm the only chance your father has.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,595
You wouldn't want my mom to know
you blackmailed me into living with her?

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,309
You know what we haven't done
in a while?

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,798
- Two weeks.
- Sorry?

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,872
Two weeks. Unbelievable.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,393
Who would believe it? I don't.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,155
It's the Tourette's flaring up again.
Happens now and again, but it's fine.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,880
Julie and Caleb's wedding invitation.
Getting married in...

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,270
- Two weeks.
- Wow, they're really doing it.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,590
An unfortunate image just leapt
in my mind.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,149
I mean, I don't understand.
What is the rush?

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,390
It's the gruesome twosome.
What do you expect?

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,516
It's the shock-and-awe approach
to courtship.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,429
Julie Cooper's getting married
to my father and you're being flip.

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,318
Me, being flip about Caleb?

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,268
No. I'm kind of softening on the guy.
He may not be friendly or ethical...

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,510
...or, you know, a million laughs.
- But he is...

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,956
Generous. Well, either that
or he's in love and delusional...

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,156
...because he threw out
a ballpark figure...

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,039
...for what he's offering Jimmy and me
for the restaurant...

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,873
...it ain't chump change.
- So he's bought your acceptance.

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,553
But at a very high price.

32
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,188
Hey, how's Marissa dealing
with her new stepdad?

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,472
Yeah, is she all right with all that?

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,279
- She's in the wedding. She agreed to that.
- And you two?

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,908
You...
What, are you back to...?

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,673
Yeah, yeah, we're good, actually.

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,193
Really good.

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,920
Really good for you is like singing
from the treetops.

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,390
Now that you and Marissa are good,
does that mean you and Theresa are over?

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,471
Yeah, yeah.
Me and Theresa, yeah.

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,313
Well, now that we've got your
love life straightened out...

42
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,869
...I think it might be time to take
a step back...

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,508
...and untangle this incestuous web
I like to call...

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,910
...the "Julie-Caleb union."
Let's think about this.

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,675
When this bizarro knot gets tied, Julie
Cooper's gonna be your mother-in-law.

46
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,231
Yeah, enjoy.
She's gonna be your stepmom.

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,594
Seth, my head is spinning.

48
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,910
Yeah. Yeah.
Me and Marissa, we could be related.

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,308
I can't even do that math.

50
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,836
But the real kicker is:
Julie Cooper, my grandma.

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,791
My grandma wears Uggs.
Think about it.

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,757
I am thinking about it.

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,474
- Hello.
- Hi.

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,312
It's Theresa, Ryan's friend.

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,869
Oh, hey there. How are you?
Let me get him for you.

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,190
<i>Actually, I'm calling for you.</i>

57
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,109
I was wondering if maybe we could meet.

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,956
- Are you all right?
- I just have a legal question.

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,350
- Can we meet?
- Sure, you name the spot.

60
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,909
I picked up some catering shifts
at the Balboa Bakery.

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,150
I have a break at 1
if you want to stop by.

62
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,550
- <i>And, Mr. Cohen, one more thing.</i>
- Yeah.

63
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,595
Please don't say anything to Ryan
about any of this.

64
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,873
You got it.

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,712
I'll see you then.

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,030
- Hello.
- I need one minute.

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,555
You and me both.
You have no idea how hard it is...

68
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,950
...to plan a spectacular wedding
in only two weeks.

69
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,758
Mr. Lasser, could you repeat that?

70
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,990
I have a caterer
who refuses to serve beef.

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,469
Something about a mad cow
wiping out Newport Beach?

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,949
- Julie, phone.
- Ironically, the minister I wanted...

73
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,635
...is away on his honeymoon. My wedding
planner's a passive-aggressive nitwit...

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,189
...who has the audacity to question
my taste in music.

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,794
Bob Seger is not "so over."

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,838
I'm going to have to call you back.

77
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,834
- How can I help?
- Normally, I would never bother you.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,673
But there is one small thing
you can help me with: A shower.

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,389
- And by "help," I mean "host."
- Julie, I can't host a shower.

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,916
I know it's last-minute, but I thought
as my maid of honor, you'd want to.

81
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,593
Wait.

82
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,034
Your maid of honor?

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,430
You're my closest friend.
Who else would it be?

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,953
Well, I was thinking Marissa.

85
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,437
I'm not Marissa's
favorite person right now.

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,036
Caleb's convinced he can get her to help,
and he's made all the arrangements...

87
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,599
...to have it at the club.

88
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,671
- In that case...
- You're a godsend!

89
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,628
Thank you. And one more thing: Let's not
have one of those tacky, girly showers...

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,678
...with games about making whoopee.
- Don't say "whoopee."

91
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,957
I was thinking a couples shower, elegant.
A cocktail party with gifts.

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,953
What do you think?
Any other questions, just ask Marissa.

93
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,793
Thanks.

94
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,232
A couples shower?

95
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,392
- What is a couples shower?
- Something I'm not throwing for my mom.

96
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,552
That was a message from Caleb
saying that per our arrangement...

97
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,870
...he wants me to help Kirsten
throw a shower for my mom.

98
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,317
What about moving in with them?
Have you told your dad yet?

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,590
No, but I will.

100
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,911
- Today.
- Lf you don't want to throw this shower...

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,755
...then don't. Stand your ground.
- Standing my ground isn't my strong suit.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,036
- That's true.
- Pac-Man. Rematch?

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,397
Hey, I almost, maybe,
might beat you this time.

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,718
What is it with those two?

105
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,713
The Pac-Man and the getting along
and the happy times.

106
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,474
They're playing video games.
It's not a Mandy Moore movie.

107
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,393
She's supposed to be crying
and he's supposed to be brooding.

108
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,869
- That's how it works.
- Hello?

109
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,396
Hi. Yeah, we're still on for tonight.

110
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,591
Fajitas? Yeah, okay.

111
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,034
I'm gonna make the margs.

112
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,395
Kidding. God. Oh, my God, I know.

113
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,551
Oh, my God. No, you're so funny.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,234
No, you are. No, you.

115
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,833
Okay, I'll see you later.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,479
Bye, Dad.

117
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,350
Dad? That's how you talk to your dad?

118
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,155
- How's how I talk to my dad?
- Like he's your friend.

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,880
- He is. He's my best friend.
- Why have I never met him?

120
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,598
I was wondering if you had parents.

121
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,149
I thought you were made
in a lab or hatched in a pod.

122
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,072
We haven't done
a family meet-and-greet.

123
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,676
I know we haven't which is odd,
considering that you've met my dad...

124
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,400
...you've met my mom, Captain Oats,
the list goes on.

125
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,790
I've never introduced a boyfriend
to my dad before.

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,234
It's kind of a big deal.

127
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,388
Well, you're forgetting
one key factor here, Summer.

128
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,788
Parents love me, okay?

129
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,758
I've got this non-threatening,
non-sexual vibe they eat up.

130
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,673
We'll go miniature golfing or hot-tubbing
or something fun.

131
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,876
Well, my stepmom's at Canyon Ranch.

132
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,032
- Drying out?
- No, some stress-management program.

133
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,316
She has anxiety issues.

134
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,993
So?

135
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,431
- We can go to lunch with my dad.
- Nice.

136
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,750
You sure you want to skip the hot tub?

137
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,473
Okay, lunch is good.

138
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,518
We'll do lunch. But your dad's
not going to need a menu...

139
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,116
...because he's gonna be eating
out of the palm of my hand.

140
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,200
The palm of my hand, Summer.

141
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,998
Hey.

142
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,910
Oh, my God.

143
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,595
- Who did that to you?
- Sorry to call you out of the blue like this.

144
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,753
- Was it Eddie?
- He's been under a lot of stress.

145
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,311
He lost his job and his apartment.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,798
The other night,
he had a couple drinks, and he just...

147
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,190
...went off.
- So you're leaving him, I hope.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,194
It's complicated.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,353
I know, it should be simple.

150
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,829
Your boyfriend hits you,
you leave him, right?

151
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,272
It's never simple.

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,152
How can I help you?

153
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,117
I just need to know, you know...

154
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,511
...if he does this again, what would
happen to him if I pressed charges?

155
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,717
It depends, anything from
a restraining order to jail time.

156
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,995
You're not still thinking
about marrying the guy?

157
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,192
Not if you gotta ask
these kinds of questions.

158
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,998
So, you, me, my dad,
lunch tomorrow at the club.

159
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,630
Awesome. By the end of this lunch,
I predict your father and I...

160
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,758
...smoking Cuban cigars. Know
what I'm saying? Trading Viagra yuks.

161
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,115
Maybe I'll put on a little Dean Martin.
I don't know.

162
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,350
- You know he's not 75, right?
- I do know that...

163
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,590
...but male bonding's a very
old-school activity.

164
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,432
We may not make it through lunch.

165
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,716
We may skip straight
over to the Russian baths.

166
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,031
- Okay, tomorrow just sit under a light.
- What?

167
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,270
Sit under a light.
He wants to see you better.

168
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,510
Order steak.
He thinks greens are effeminate.

169
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,114
Celery's gay, got it.
What else you got? I want to prep...

170
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,033
...make sure I lock into
some witty anecdotes, my A material.

171
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,873
- He's a plastic surgeon.
- I know what he does for a living...

172
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,952
...and we can have fun with that,
but let's talk about hobbies.

173
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,633
What do you guys talk about?

174
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,554
Mostly we talk about me.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,150
- You?
- Yeah, it's like our common interest.

176
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,157
- You wanted to meet him.
- I do. I do.

177
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,153
I just was kind of hoping for some...
You know what I mean?

178
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,673
Look...

179
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,550
...my dad really loves me.

180
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,597
And I really like you.

181
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,558
So he's gonna really like you.

182
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,428
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

183
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,353
Yeah.

184
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,832
We should go to the bedroom.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,513
Yeah.

186
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,875
Oh, but Marissa,
she's gonna be home soon.

187
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,589
- Right, right, right. We should...
- Yeah.

188
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,593
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about all this
sneaking around.

189
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,876
It's so incredibly high-school.

190
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,039
Dad. Hailey?

191
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,432
Hey, kiddo. Hi.

192
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,594
Hailey was just over to help me fix my...

193
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,796
- Faucet.
- My faucet, which is...

194
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,909
Remember it was leaking? And, you know,
she's an expert on plumbing.

195
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,634
- I should go.
- Okay.

196
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,109
Now that the faucet is, you know, fixed.

197
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,952
Okay. Listen, thank you so much.

198
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,157
You know, if anything else breaks
then I'll give you a call.

199
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,753
But thank you.

200
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,433
- Bye.
- See you.

201
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,393
Wow. You guys really need to work
on your improv skills.

202
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,074
Look, I wanted to talk to you about it.
I did, but l...

203
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,552
With your mom and Caleb, the last thing
you needed to deal with was this.

204
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,314
Dad, I'm fine with it.

205
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,519
You know what? Better than that,
I'm happy for you.

206
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,872
What's the matter?

207
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,996
It's just with Mom and Caleb
getting married...

208
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,912
...and they're moving
into this new house...

209
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,108
I know a lot is changing, kiddo,
but it's not all bad.

210
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,475
- You know Caleb is buying the restaurant?
- I know.

211
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,631
Yeah. And, you know,
we're gonna be okay.

212
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,030
I mean, like, seriously okay.

213
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,714
We're talking millions of dollars.

214
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,112
We're gonna get out of this place,
move into a real home and start over.

215
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,309
Isn't that great?

216
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,199
Yeah. Yeah, it's great.

217
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,280
- Seth's meeting your dad?
- Yeah, so?

218
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,431
Well, that's gonna go well.

219
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,512
Well, actually, Marissa,
it will go well. Do you know why?

220
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,272
Turns out I'm great
with the parents.

221
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,159
- I'm better with parents than daughters.
- I believe that.

222
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,517
I think we know I'm pretty good
with the daughters. Know what I mean?

223
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,319
This little one right here.
Her daddy's gonna feel it.

224
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,948
- Yeah.
- I can't believe Eddie would hit her.

225
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,432
I know. And Theresa has made it clear
she does not want to press charges.

226
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,478
So unless she changes her mind,
there's only so much I can do.

227
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,756
At least you gave her someone
to talk to...

228
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,956
...somewhere to go. It's a start.

229
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,476
Yeah, until she decides to go back
to Chino and marry the guy anyway.

230
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,518
What about Ryan?
He must be beside himself.

231
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,636
You wouldn't know it
from looking at him.

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,233
- He doesn't know.
- What?

233
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,550
Theresa had me promise
that I wouldn't tell him.

234
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,632
She knows he'd fly off the handle.

235
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,314
He'd go back to Chino
and beat the daylights out of Eddie.

236
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,914
He breaks his probation
and he ends up back in juvie.

237
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,194
Ryan, need something?
More soda?

238
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,635
I got it. What's going on?

239
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,912
Nothing.

240
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,753
Nothing.

241
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,791
Nothing. Okay.

242
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,309
Come on, just pick one.
Marissa's gonna be here soon.

243
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,436
Don't rush me.
I've got a lot riding on this.

244
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,591
You said you were great with parents.

245
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,548
Yeah, I've got so much experience being
introduced to my girlfriend's parents.

246
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,438
Damn it, I'm being sarcastic.

247
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,477
So? Sarcasm's like breathing for you.

248
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,437
Her dad thinks it's a sign of weakness.

249
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,989
- Sounds like a smart man.
- I have to fool him.

250
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,197
Do you understand?
I have to spin an elaborate web of lies...

251
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,669
...smoke and mirrors, for an entire meal.

252
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,717
Only then can I earn his trust.

253
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,953
- I hope you're not like this during lunch.
- This one? Too edgy?

254
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,997
- Too fashion-forward?
- It's a white shirt.

255
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,958
That's a good point.
White shirts make my teeth look yellow.

256
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,556
That's Marissa. I've gotta go find her
before she runs into her mom.

257
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,596
- Hey.
- Hey. Your mom's in there with Kirsten.

258
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,151
- Maybe I'll come back later.
- No, you told Kirsten you'd stop by, right?

259
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,191
I don't want to deal with my mom now.
All I want is to get back at her...

260
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,035
...and here I am throwing her a party.
- It'll be fine. Just take the high road.

261
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,838
- You can't lose.
- This looks great...

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,673
...fruited Israeli couscous.

263
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,359
- Oh, honey, hi.
- Hey.

264
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,794
Thanks for coming.

265
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,030
So you stopped by to help us, huh?

266
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,113
Actually, Kirsten called me,
so I stopped by to help Kirsten.

267
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,639
Well, then I'll let you get to it.

268
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,711
- Kirsten. Ryan.
- Julie.

269
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,436
- You okay?
- Fine.

270
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,113
So, what can I do to help?

271
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,715
Double check the guest list
with the invitations.

272
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,157
I have everyone from The Newport Group,
all the ladies from spin class.

273
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,711
- But there's no one from Julie's family.
- My mom and her parents don't speak.

274
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,233
What about her sisters?

275
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,118
Well, there's always Aunt Cindy.

276
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,758
The caterers. Great.

277
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,309
Aunt Cindy, you'll get in touch with her?

278
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,959
Yeah.

279
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,350
See? Take the high road.

280
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,875
You've never met Aunt Cindy.

281
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,954
Well.

282
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,999
- It's... It's...
- It's more than twice what we put into it.

283
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,197
Caught me at a good time. A man
in love has no right doing business.

284
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,794
- Besides, we're family.
- Right. Are we? I don't know.

285
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,030
- I can't keep track.
- Now, if you'll excuse me...

286
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,998
...my fianc Áe wants help picking out
linens for the reception.

287
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,628
I had no idea there were so many
shades of beige.

288
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,590
All right, we'll see you.

289
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,674
He's up to something.

290
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,752
Either that or he's on some
serious painkillers.

291
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,071
But you know what? I don't care.
Two and a half million dollars?

292
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,278
I can finally breathe again.

293
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,476
I'm happy for you.

294
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,349
- But?
- Well...

295
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,273
...I wish it could have been the place
that did it, not Caleb.

296
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,910
I thought we'd be rescued by meat loaf
and dirty martinis.

297
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,672
That's how it was supposed to be.

298
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,991
Think about it. All that meat loaf
you'd be making? It's off your hands.

299
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,479
Now you've got time for work.

300
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,631
That's what I was trying
to get away from.

301
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,028
No, no. I mean real work.

302
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,792
The stuff that you love.

303
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,155
Like rescuing kids...

304
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,995
...and down-and-out guys who are
millions of dollars in debt.

305
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,709
Come on, right now there's a stray
out there just waiting for you...

306
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,872
...to swoop down and save the day.

307
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,038
Remember, we are off-our-asses wasted
and totally lost in the woods...

308
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,318
...and I gotta go like nobody's business,
so I end up dropping trou right there.

309
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,869
Sure enough, poison oak everywhere.

310
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,110
Julie tells the whole school.

311
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,918
What a bitch, right?

312
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,719
- Charming story.
- Yeah, good times.

313
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,472
Mind if I smoke?

314
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,995
- Actually, l...
- Sorry.

315
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,397
I tried to quit once,
but I ended up putting on 30 pounds.

316
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,949
And who wants to have sex
with that, right?

317
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,075
Aunt Cindy. Look at you!

318
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,356
- Hey.
- Hey.

319
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,317
- So this is my boyfriend, Ryan.
- Hi.

320
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,552
Cindy's been telling me some priceless
stories about your mom.

321
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,794
Yeah, I was telling her about Julie's
Def Leppard phase.

322
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,953
- She drove us to Anaheim to scalp tickets.
- I can't believe she was into heavy metal.

323
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,079
- I can't believe she ever went to Anaheim.
- So where is the belle of the ball anyway?

324
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,470
Doing yoga? Getting Botox?

325
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,390
You and Julie, do you talk often?

326
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,950
Sure, if you call once every
seven years often.

327
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,556
Look, I'll hand it to you straight.
I was shocked she wanted me here.

328
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,073
- You were?
- Yeah.

329
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,279
Last time I saw her, and memory's a little
foggy on account of the Jell-O shots...

330
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,671
...I'm pretty sure she told me to get lost,
for good.

331
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,398
Marissa, can I talk to you in...?

332
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,879
Oh, hi. I'm so sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt, but...

333
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,677
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Well, it's nice to see you too.

334
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,957
I'm here because I was invited
by Marissa.

335
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,228
- Marissa, is this true?
- You guys have tons to catch up on...

336
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,949
...so I'll give you some alone time.
- We should probably get that cake too.

337
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,395
Right. Have fun.

338
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,510
And I decided that I wanted to celebrate
both holidays, so what I did...

339
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,478
...is, basically, I combined them,
and I made Chrismukkah.

340
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,117
Like Christmas and Hanukkah.

341
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,713
- Chrismukkah.
- Chrismukkah.

342
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,918
Chrismukkah.
Well, that must be a lot of fun for you.

343
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,550
Yeah, we have fun with it. But I don't
want you to think I'm all about...

344
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,439
...holiday cheer,
I'm hoarding all of them or anything.

345
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,238
I have interests. I have hobbies.

346
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,628
- Do you?
- Sure, I do, sir.

347
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,155
- Comic books, for one.
- Comic books.

348
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,632
Sir, I think I hear the skepticism
in your tone.

349
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,155
And I understand,
but I just want to tell you...

350
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,154
...I believe the comic book is a legitimate
art form. Frank Miller's <i>Sin City</i>...

351
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,514
...<i>Powers</i> by Brian Bendis...

352
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,069
...arguably one of the best writers
in comics today.

353
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,994
I mean, combines sort of the storytelling
panache of, like, a Stan Lee...

354
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,833
...that old-school vibe,
but mixed with a lyrical...

355
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,753
...you know, sophistication of...
I want to say Alan Moore.

356
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,754
It's probably too inside for you. You're
probably a fan of the classics. Superman?

357
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,080
Batman fan? No?

358
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,998
Iceman?

359
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,155
He freezes things.

360
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,037
- So, Summer...
- Isn't Summer the best?

361
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,232
Little force of nature, just sitting there.
Little live wire.

362
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,358
- Yes, she is.
- I think she's so full of vim and vigor.

363
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,988
What, in your surgical opinion,
does she have more of?

364
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,310
Would you say it's vim or vigor?

365
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,040
- Cohen, what are you talking about?
- Summer. Summer...

366
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,079
...I'm just saying that I think you've been
extraordinarily blessed with vim.

367
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,879
- And vigor too, sir.
- What do you say we order?

368
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,473
Okay. I like food.

369
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,119
Yes.

370
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,240
So we just say that we're very
happy together.

371
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,789
- We hope that they can be happy for us.
- Yeah.

372
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,996
- You know?
- Easy.

373
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,274
Hailey?

374
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,873
The door?

375
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,271
What if it isn't the right time...

376
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,194
...because my dad's getting married to
Julie. And Kirsten's planning the shower...

377
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,794
You know what? We should wait
until the timing's right.

378
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,757
Know what I'm saying?
The timing's wrong.

379
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,273
- Yeah.
- Right. Okay, good.

380
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,032
- Okay, great.
- Excellent.

381
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,633
This is a good idea too.

382
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,711
- I'm so sorry.
- I feel so...

383
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,151
Did you see the look on my mom's face?

384
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,517
- So much for the high road.
- Yeah, this is way more fun.

385
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,480
Hi, we're here to pick up
a cake for Cooper.

386
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,631
- Let me check on that.
- Thanks.

387
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,032
Oh, my God, this is amazing.
You've got to try this.

388
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,471
- You need another piece.
- Stop!

389
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,793
Theresa, what happened?

390
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,792
- Eddie?
- I didn't want you involved.

391
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,272
You weren't supposed to know I was
here. I guess Sandy told you anyway.

392
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,192
Sandy...
Sandy knows about this?

393
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,477
Hey, where have you been?

394
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,234
I couldn't sleep.
I thought watching the sun come up...

395
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,119
...and getting my ass kicked
by some 4-footers would help.

396
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,269
It didn't.

397
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,319
Here's that vanilla half-caf caramel
macchiato on the dry side you love.

398
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,711
It's so good.
It's only 1500 calories per sip.

399
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,917
- Hey, what time is that shower today?
- Why?

400
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,914
- I might be late, depending on traffic.
- We live 10 minutes from the club.

401
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,877
- I'll be coming from Chino.
- What?

402
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,634
I want to pay Eddie a visit,
knock some sense into him.

403
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,790
Metaphorically, of course.
At the very least, give him a good scare.

404
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,392
- I'm taking back the coffee.
- People here need to hear from you.

405
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,870
- Ryan is really upset.
- What can I do?

406
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,235
- He won't talk to me.
- Explain it to him...

407
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,392
...instead of trying to match him glare
for glare. What about Theresa?

408
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,439
The victim, alone, in the motel room.

409
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,557
She'd love to hear from you.

410
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,075
Why don't you call her and invite her over.

411
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,708
- You can keep the coffee.
- Thank you.

412
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,592
I know you're pissed off.
I would have explained things to you...

413
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,955
...but I couldn't
until Theresa gave me the okay.

414
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,951
You guys decided to include me.
Thanks.

415
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,475
I'm a lawyer. She asked for privacy,
she's entitled.

416
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,517
She's getting beat up,
and you keep it from me?

417
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,069
What if I had told you?
What are you gonna do?

418
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,992
I don't know, help her.

419
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,355
How? Go to Chino? See Eddie?

420
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,671
Land in the hospital or jail or worse?
Theresa was protecting you.

421
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,831
- You should have told me.
- Well, I didn't.

422
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,639
Because I knew you'd get
riled up and do something stupid.

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,472
Now that you do know...

424
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,074
...I sure hope you don't prove me right.

425
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,715
- What about Theresa?
- She's on her way here.

426
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,996
If she's around people
that care about her...

427
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,196
...she's less likely
to go back to him.

428
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,196
- I gotta get ready for the shower.
- Do we understand each other?

429
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,071
Hey, is your father around?
I didn't even see him.

430
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,310
- Then I guess not.
- That's cool. I figured...

431
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,948
...he'd maybe want to say hey.
Do you know where he is?

432
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,190
No, didn't say.

433
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,588
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you.

434
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,069
- Did he say anything about the lunch?
- Not really.

435
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,312
No, I didn't think he would.
I mean, it got a little awkward there...

436
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,199
...in the comic-book part.
I think it turned a good corner...

437
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,749
...at, like, the bread basket.
- Bread basket?

438
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,388
Yeah. Yeah, he asked me,
you know, to pass the bread.

439
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,632
I said, "You'll wanna go bread stick
as opposed to dinner roll."

440
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,597
He went bread stick.
Shows he trusts me.

441
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,671
Didn't clock that.

442
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,630
So I didn't even get
a review at all, huh?

443
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,155
Not that I read my own press,
but, I mean...

444
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,519
...nothing involving thumbs or stars or...
- We should go.

445
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,430
You should have told me.

446
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,793
Right.

447
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,118
Because you would have taken
the news so well.

448
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,196
You would have tried to kill him.

449
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,391
He deserves it.

450
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,070
Yeah, well, this is my problem.

451
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,037
Not yours.

452
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,316
I'm the one that has to figure
this thing out.

453
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,630
What is there to figure out?

454
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,676
You're not gonna stay with him?

455
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,793
Right?

456
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,799
I'll take some self-defense classes.

457
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,715
And Eddie and I will live
happily ever after.

458
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,759
- How can you joke?
- Because I'm tired of crying.

459
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,678
Okay?

460
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,114
- I haven't seen you like this in a while.
- What?

461
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,998
Flustered? Upset?

462
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,799
Heading to a Newport party
against my will?

463
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,633
Passionate. Driven.

464
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,836
This is the man I married.

465
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,592
Oh, yeah?

466
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,479
So are you ready
to face the happy couple?

467
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,949
- The gruesome twosome?
- Yeah.

468
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,793
- Hey.
- Hi.

469
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,958
So, Theresa, I hope you've decided
to join us for the shower.

470
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,749
Thanks, but I'm not really
looking my best.

471
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,592
I have some concealer upstairs...

472
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,273
...works like a magic wand.

473
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,398
She's right.
You should see her without the stuff on.

474
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,232
Terrifying.

475
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,109
Hey, are you guys ready to go
to the shower?

476
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,355
- Hey, Theresa.
- Theresa's in town for a while.

477
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,790
Just till I get things straightened out.

478
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,077
Of course. Well, then you
should come to the shower.

479
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,032
Thanks.

480
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,280
- Julie, congratulations.
- Thank you.

481
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,228
- And, Kirsten, what a lovely party.
- Thank you.

482
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,469
Is it too early to start drinking?

483
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,279
I hope not, or I'm in trouble.
Thank you.

484
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,353
After all your mom's been through,
she deserves a man like Caleb Nichol.

485
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,638
You two will never have to worry
about money ever again.

486
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,711
Will you excuse me?

487
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,349
Which way is the ladies' room?

488
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,558
Look at her...

489
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,076
...flirting with her sister's boyfriend
like she's in seventh grade again.

490
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,471
For once, I actually know what you mean.

491
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,629
Wonder which of my past humiliations
she's telling him about now.

492
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,154
Oh, my God.
Did she just say "monster truck"?

493
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,753
You were into monster trucks?

494
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,957
I better get over there
or there might not even be a wedding.

495
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,637
Hey, Juju, your ears must be burning.

496
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,793
I was telling Cal here about
you and me and Knott's Berry Farm.

497
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,193
Cindy, thank you
for entertaining Cal here...

498
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,191
...but you should go. Try the pastries.

499
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,988
Maybe it'll soak up some of that whiskey.

500
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,839
Does anybody want anything?

501
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,116
- Tequila shooter?
- Cindy, go.

502
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,915
I'm sorry about Cindy.

503
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,798
She's got oomph. Spark.

504
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,996
Just like her sister.

505
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,754
Oh, and Julie looks fabulous.

506
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,512
Must be all those Yogalates classes.

507
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,638
Oh, you know,
I've always wanted to try Yogalates.

508
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,631
- Really?
- Me too. Maybe we should...

509
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,268
Maybe we'll take a class together,
you and I.

510
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,193
Needed a break?

511
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,511
Hey.

512
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,638
Yeah. I was just feeling
a little lost out there.

513
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,629
You probably really need Ryan right now.

514
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,749
- Me being here, I'm getting in the way.
- Hey, it's not your fault.

515
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,198
Look, part of the reason I didn't want
to tell Ryan about Eddie is because...

516
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,396
...he seems really happy right now.

517
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,990
And that's because of you.

518
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,998
Look, Cal, a juicer.

519
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,228
- I need one of these.
- How about a game?

520
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,473
Okay, folks!

521
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,399
Has anyone here ever played
"How Well Do You Know Them?"

522
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,597
Cindy, everyone here already knows us.
That won't be much fun.

523
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,637
All right,
I'm gonna be Chuck Woolery.

524
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,438
I'm gonna ask a question...

525
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,433
...and whoever shouts out the most
right answers, wins.

526
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,592
First question:
What is Julie's favorite meal?

527
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,911
Oh, I know this. Chilean sea bass
with roasted baby carrots.

528
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,196
No. No, the answer is:

529
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,555
Double-Double Cheeseburger,
heavy on the sauce...

530
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,553
...large fries and an orange soda.
Okay, next question.

531
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,314
Hi. I've been looking for you.

532
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,750
For both of you.

533
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,514
- Everything's okay?
- Yeah, it's just, at a shower.

534
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,796
Not really what I do.

535
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,996
- Is that him?
- Yeah, he's just calling to apologize again.

536
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,628
- I'm not going to get it.
- You been talking to him?

537
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,952
- Leave her alone.
- What are you doing?

538
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,475
- What are you doing talking to him?
- Stay out of this.

539
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,950
Stay out of it? You came here.
You knew I was gonna find out.

540
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,317
What did you think I was gonna do?
He hit you. You can't go back to him.

541
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,913
It's not that simple.

542
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,594
You know him. He's not a bad person.
He made a mistake.

543
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,637
- You don't really believe that.
- Yes, I do.

544
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,870
- I know that.
- You're an expert on the subject?

545
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,508
What are you gonna tell me?
This isn't the first time?

546
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,557
Has he done it before?

547
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,038
Tell me, Theresa.
Has he hit you before?

548
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,878
Ryan.

549
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,790
Growing up, who was Julie's first love?

550
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,953
Rick Springfield?

551
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,955
Close. The entire defensive line
of our eighth-grade football team.

552
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,793
I refuse to sit here and be humiliated.

553
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,154
Oh, crap.

554
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,436
Hey, you're carrying a purse now?
Not that you shouldn't accessorize.

555
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,874
You stealing Marissa's car?

556
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,996
If I don't do something,
Theresa's gonna marry that guy.

557
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,479
- You can't go.
- Yeah, why not?

558
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,517
It's a horrible idea,
and my dad said not to.

559
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,036
She's taking his calls. She's gonna
go back to him. It's gonna happen again.

560
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,838
- Dude, don't.
- I don't have a choice.

561
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,197
- Hey, man, you do.
- Let go of me. Now.

562
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,713
- Is Ryan leaving?
- Yeah.

563
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,554
Oh, he took your car.

564
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,316
Put down the window.

565
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,715
- Get out of the car.
- He's done it before.

566
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,110
- Well, that's the pattern.
- He'll do it again.

567
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,556
Don't try to fix this thing, kid.
I'm your guardian and I call the shots.

568
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,836
- Get out of the car.
- Somebody has to stop him.

569
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,879
Theresa has to decide on her own
to leave Eddie. We can't force her.

570
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,436
I know about these things.
Theresa, Eddie, Chino.

571
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,113
- You don't get it.
- Oh, yes, I do.

572
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,714
I've seen too many kids just like him,
and I know...

573
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,030
...it will not be you to suddenly
make him change.

574
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,350
- So you want me to do nothing?
- Yes.

575
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,198
I can't do that.

576
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,871
Thank you very much.

577
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,958
That was quite a scene out there, huh?

578
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,435
I'll always love Cindy.

579
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,194
So do you wanna talk about this?

580
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,351
I know it's weird.

581
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,910
Even though it was years ago
you and I dated, she's still your sister.

582
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,914
It's not jealousy. I just don't want to see
my friend make a terrible mistake.

583
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,755
- What makes you think it's a mistake?
- Jimmy, this is what Hailey does.

584
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,876
She uses people to get back at me.

585
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,512
Kirsten...

586
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,476
...this isn't about you.

587
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,229
Hailey and I, you know, it feels real.

588
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,671
Okay.

589
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,472
It's just that...

590
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,278
...you're starting to do well...

591
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,830
...and I don't want to see you...
- Happy? Because that's what I am.

592
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,755
It's the first time since Julie left me
I don't feel completely alone.

593
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,478
So...

594
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,309
...just be happy for me, okay?

595
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,952
Okay.

596
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,472
What do you want, Cindy? Money?

597
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,997
- I don't want your money.
- The hell you don't.

598
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,675
Why else would you come down here
and humiliate me in front of my friends?

599
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,753
Those people aren't your friends.
They don't even know you.

600
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,480
- And you do?
- I used to.

601
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,796
Back when you had big hair
and you wore tight jeans.

602
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,919
We were supposed
to leave Riverside together, remember?

603
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,995
We were gonna move to L.A.
And marry rock stars.

604
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,670
Then you took off.

605
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,918
And you moved to the beach...

606
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,832
...without me.

607
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,198
I couldn't exactly take you with me.

608
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,672
I know.

609
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,313
I just...

610
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,077
I miss you sometimes, that's all.

611
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,669
I'm sorry about what happened out there.

612
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,349
Guess I won't be invited
to the wedding, huh?

613
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,431
Of course you'll be invited
to the wedding.

614
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,750
We wouldn't have it any other way.

615
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,751
Thanks.

616
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,199
I'll be outside.

617
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,071
Well, I'm sure you found Cindy's visit
very revealing.

618
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,911
Julie, there is nothing
I could find out about you...

619
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,559
...that would make me walk away.

620
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,073
Hey, you're avoiding me.

621
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,472
That's cool.
I kind of like it.

622
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,518
It's kind of a throwback.
It feels very eighth-grade.

623
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,873
So I'm guessing
that this has something to do...

624
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,433
...with me bombing with your father.
- It was a train wreck.

625
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,955
- I was nervous.
- You didn't stop talking.

626
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,714
I know. I get chatty when I'm...

627
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,199
...completely terrified.

628
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,195
Look, next time I'll be...
I'll be the strong silent type.

629
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,796
Or I'll just be silent, okay?

630
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,232
Look, my dad and I are best friends.

631
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,868
We've been through everything together.

632
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,948
And he's never been wrong.
I mean, he's my dad.

633
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,554
- And he hated me?
- You just weren't what he expected.

634
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,995
Yeah? What was he expecting?
Someone taller?

635
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,152
- Blonder? Presbyterian? What?
- Just different.

636
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,958
My dad's really protective of me.

637
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,193
Look, I'm sorry if your dad doesn't think
I'm good enough for you. Really, I am.

638
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,796
If that's the way he feels, that sucks.
But you know what? It doesn't matter.

639
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,272
I don't really have to be his type, because
the only thing that matters is me and you.

640
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,919
Right?

641
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,756
I have to go.

642
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,478
I thought you'd be in Chino by now.

643
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,671
I got as far as Corona.

644
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,918
And?

645
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,357
And I realized Eddie wasn't
who I needed to talk to.

646
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,554
- What are you doing going back to him?
- It won't happen again. He promised.

647
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,792
- Like he promised the last time, right?
- What am I supposed to do?

648
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,235
- My whole life is in Chino.
- So was mine.

649
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,119
Right, so I wait for some rich,
perfect family to adopt me...

650
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,919
...and stick me
in their beautiful pool house? Great idea.

651
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,310
- You can stay with the Cohens too.
- No, I can't.

652
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,959
- Why not?
- Because...

653
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,031
...I move in there and then what happens?

654
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,713
I don't know.

655
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,519
I don't know.

656
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,595
I know what happens
if you go back to Eddie.

657
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,358
So do you.

658
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,955
I am never throwing another party again.

659
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,758
Oh, honey, don't tease.

660
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,832
Nothing good happens at our parties.
Have you noticed that?

661
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,914
Yeah, the gruesome twosome...

662
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,550
...never tighter.
- Jimmy and Hailey, officially a couple.

663
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,598
And Ryan's probably heading back
to juvie right about now.

664
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,034
And if he is...

665
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,668
...I know just the guy to get him out.

666
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,275
- Hi.
- Hey, you all right?

667
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,033
How's Eddie?

668
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,431
I decided to take my lawyer's advice
and went to see Theresa instead.

669
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,395
Hi, Mr. Cohen. Mrs. Cohen.

670
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,630
- You can stay as long as you want.
- Thank you.

671
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,313
You can sleep in the pool house.

672
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,948
Ryan, you can bunk in with Seth,
on the air mattress.

673
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,509
Come on.
Why don't we get you settled in.

674
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,393
Thanks for doing this.

675
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,711
Kirsten and I would do anything for you.

676
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,718
Yeah, me too.

677
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,350
Well, I'm glad to hear it...

678
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,033
...because we lost the pump.

679
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,873
So somebody's gonna have
to blow that sucker up.

680
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,679
- Hey, Marissa.
- Hey, Kirsten. Is Ryan home?

681
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,149
Yeah, he's in the pool house.

682
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,676
He's helping Theresa get settled in.

683
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,193
So she's staying?

684
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,433
Yeah.

685
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,391
He loves you, you know.

686
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,312
- I know.
- Then make room for her to be in his life.

687
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,636
He's not going anywhere.

688
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,428
Sorry I bailed on the shower.

689
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,471
Don't you think this apology
should be directed elsewhere...

690
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,153
...like, say, Marissa?

691
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,319
I guess so.

692
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,556
I didn't want to, I had to...

693
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,075
Again, should be directed
somewhere else.

694
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,278
If it makes you feel any better,
things between me and Summer suck.

695
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,273
- Because of her dad?
- Of all the love triangles to sink us...

696
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,351
...it is the least sexy.

697
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,832
Go talk to your girlfriend.
One of us should be able to.

698
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,279
Right.

699
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,552
Hi.

700
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,510
Today I said I was gonna be there,
and I wasn't.

701
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,472
It's okay.

702
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,034
And I know you got a lot
to deal with coming up.

703
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,111
But we're gonna get through it...

704
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,679
...together.

705
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,992
You and me, we're gonna be fine.

706
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,512
I...

707
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,953
What?

708
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,916
I think we are gonna be fine.
