00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,910
Julie and Caleb's wedding invitation.
Getting married in...

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,911
- Two weeks.
- Wow. They're really doing it.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,355
I know it should be simple.
Your boyfriend hits you...

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,590
...you leave him. Right?
- It's never simple.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,389
You're probably a fan of the classics.
Superman? No? Batman?

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,155
You probably really need Ryan right now.
Me being here, I'm getting in the way.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,754
- It's more than twice what we put into it.
- Caught me at a good time.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,151
- He's up to something.
- I don't care. $2.5 million.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,151
You and me, we're gonna be fine.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,032
Ryan.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,714
Ryan, hey. Hey, man, are you asleep?

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,114
Ryan.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,875
Ryan. Are you asleep?
Yeah, I can't sleep either.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,919
I know what you're gonna say. You know,
she hasn't technically dumped me yet...

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,640
...but it's only a matter of time, right?
So, what do I do?

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,155
Do I force a confrontation
or do I just continue...

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,915
...to be whiny and passive-aggressive
until she realizes what a catch I am?

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,034
Ryan?

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,634
- Ryan, Ryan, Ryan. You asleep?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,870
Sorry.
I'm gonna let you go back to sleep, okay?

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,549
As bad as things are for me,
they're worse for you.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,709
What?

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,236
I'm at least in my own bed not sleeping.
You're on my floor not sleeping.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,597
- Because you won't stop talking.
- But also because your ex-girlfriend...

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,752
...is sleeping in your room,
to the dismay of your girlfriend.

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,956
- Marissa's fine with it.
- I'm sure she is.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,237
The same way you'd be fine with it if
Oliver was sleeping on her couch.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,389
It's cool.

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,312
What, you want me to kick Theresa out?

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,677
No. But aren't you just the least bit
curious as to when she's leaving?

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,592
No, I'm not. I'm not worried about it.

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,795
- Okay.
- Okay.

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,396
Good. Night. Go back to bed.
Or the floor.

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,715
- I should talk to Theresa.
- Let me come with you.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,514
- Theresa?
- Housekeeping.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,638
- Hello?
- Maybe she's still at work.

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,314
- Her bag's here.
- Yeah. Apparently, she's been shopping.

39
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,836
Sorry. I didn't hear you guys come in.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,197
Let me know if you ever need anything.
My mom's got lots of toiletries.

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,949
Thanks, but I'm probably not
gonna be here that much longer.

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,117
You're not?

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,113
No, I can't impose
on Seth's parents forever.

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,918
- Sure you can. I intend to.
- Thanks...

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,153
...but I really need to figure things out.
I have some family I can call, so...

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,356
So see you tomorrow?

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,875
No. I picked up a morning shift
at the bakery, so...

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,190
Oh, all right. So maybe after school?

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,391
- Sure. But aren't you and Marissa...?
- Yeah. No, I mean we'll both see you.

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,792
We'll all see you, because my girlfriend's
currently dating her father, which to me...

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,076
- Seth.
- We'll talk about this tomorrow.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,151
- Good night.
- Good night.

53
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,517
All right, good night.

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,108
Night.

55
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,996
So, what's it gonna be, Cal?
The Hyatt Newporter?

56
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,993
The pool at the Four Seasons Hotel
where everybody gets married?

57
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,754
Or the beautiful glass cathedral
overlooking the ocean...

58
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,558
...at the Wayfarer's Chapel?

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,315
I have to get to work.

60
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,994
Whatever you like, Juju.

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,468
Sorry about breakfast, Kiki.

62
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,474
Dad, the only reason we're having
this breakfast is so we can do some work.

63
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,438
You have been so busy with the wedding,
I haven't even seen you.

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,593
Every time I've asked him to help me
with the wedding, he says he's with you.

65
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,797
Really? So, CayCay,
what have you been doing all this time?

66
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,393
Don't you have someplace to be?

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,835
As a matter of fact,
I'm meeting Jimmy for breakfast.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,309
I bet even that sounds pretty good
to you right now.

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,118
The Wayfarer Chapel it is.

70
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,955
Well, are you sure? I mean, these photos
don't really do it justice. You know what?

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,714
I should take you up there this weekend,
you'll love it.

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,598
I wish I could. I'm out of town.

73
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,672
What? Since when? You can't go.
We're getting married next week.

74
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,035
Just one night. Business.

75
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,236
Business where?

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,358
- Nevada.
- Nevada. As in Las Vegas, Nevada?

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,188
- Actually...
- You're going out of town for one night...

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,920
...to Vegas on business? What business?

79
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,229
There is no business.

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,392
You're going to Vegas
because you're having a bachelor party.

81
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,869
- Some of the investors and I are...
- Hiring strippers...

82
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,510
...drinking too much and gambling all
night the weekend before our wedding?

83
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,274
It sounds like a bachelor party to me.

84
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,398
I have to admit,
I feel a little hurt that I wasn't invited.

85
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,994
- Yeah, me too.
- Not that I have any affection for you.

86
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,833
You know that. But I do love the Vegas.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,515
- I didn't know you love the Vegas, Dad.
- I love the Vegas. I love the Vegas.

88
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,352
Ryan, how do you feel about the Vegas?

89
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,829
Never been to the Vegas.
Mom was all about the Reno.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,037
Dad, we should go. You love Vegas.
Ryan and I have never been.

91
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,112
He can use his mutant
card-counting abilities to pay for the trip.

92
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,158
- Sounds like fun for the whole family.
- What about Theresa?

93
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,754
Well, I can take care of Theresa.
You guys should go.

94
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,070
Do I have any say in this?

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,559
No.

96
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,071
Enjoy your bachelor party.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,592
Hey. Ready for breakfast?

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,911
Almost. My realtor is on her way.
I just have to give her the contract.

99
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,229
Contract for what?

100
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,958
Well, with any luck...

101
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,513
...my new house.

102
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,156
Jimmy, it's right on the beach.
It's perfect.

103
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,039
I want to give Marissa a home
she can be proud of. You know?

104
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,350
What are you gonna do
with your half of Caleb's money?

105
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,351
I'm taking some of it
to Vegas this weekend.

106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,751
The boys and I are crashing
his bachelor party. You want to come?

107
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,629
Are you kidding? The man bailed us out,
took Julie off my hands.

108
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,279
I'll buy him his first lap dance.

109
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,270
Hell, I'll give him one myself. Can you
grab that? I just gotta get the contract.

110
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,435
Hi. Gail van Deepen. You must be Sandy.

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,670
- Yeah.
- Congratulations on selling the restaurant.

112
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,114
You must have made a fortune.

113
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,477
I heard Robert Campbell is gonna turn
that area into an outdoor mall.

114
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,234
Robert Campbell?
We sold the restaurant to Caleb Nichol.

115
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,234
Then I guess Caleb is gonna make
a fortune. Well, another fortune, right?

116
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,313
But you and Jimmy must have made good
money. What are you gonna do next?

117
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,038
I wanna kill him.

118
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,589
Then I'd probably go to jail,
but it would be better...

119
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,149
...than having to move in
with him and my mom, right?

120
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,629
That way, I won't have to tell my dad
I'm moving out.

121
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,233
You still haven't told him?

122
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,270
What am I supposed to say,
that Caleb's blackmailing me?

123
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,908
My dad'll kill him
and I'll have to move in with my mom.

124
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,559
So, what are you gonna tell him?

125
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,952
I don't know, but I guess
I have to do it by this weekend, huh?

126
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,190
Your dad might be going
to Vegas this weekend.

127
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,873
How do you know?

128
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,430
Because I might be going
to Vegas this weekend.

129
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,874
For what?

130
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,712
- Caleb's bachelor party.
- What?

131
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,952
With, like, strippers and prostitutes
and showgirls?

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,429
I don't know, I hope so.
What? No. I'm not gonna go.

133
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,397
I can't leave Theresa here by herself.

134
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,471
Theresa? What about me?

135
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,028
You know what I mean.
You got Summer and your sister.

136
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,952
Theresa, she's got nobody.

137
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,958
Well, she's got me.

138
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,517
I mean, I am your girlfriend, right?

139
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,274
So, I mean, any friend of yours
is a friend of mine.

140
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,998
Right?

141
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,638
- You are my girlfriend.
- Glad to hear it.

142
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,278
- Now, about those strippers...
- What strippers? I don't know of any stri...

143
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,829
I don't want Chippendales.
I want strippers.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,878
Full-on, full-frontal male strippers.

145
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,793
Preferably at a place
that serves bottomless margaritas.

146
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,713
Or I could invite the girls over
and I could throw you...

147
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,314
...a lovely,
catered bachelorette cocktail party.

148
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,914
- With strippers.
- Without strippers.

149
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,594
Julie, we are smart, sophisticated women.

150
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,231
We don't need strange, naked men
dancing in front of us to be entertained.

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,957
I'm not as smart as you.
Plus, the boys are getting strippers.

152
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,076
The boys are not getting strippers.

153
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,994
Kirsten, it's Las Vegas. You get strippers
as a side with your entr Áe.

154
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,671
They're getting strippers. Why else
would Sandy go to Vegas with Caleb?

155
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,159
Strippers, huh?

156
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,390
Get all the Newpsies into limos,
drive to L. A...

157
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,835
...have dinner on Sunset,
then head south to Mantopia.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,991
- Or the Stud Farm.
- You've done research.

159
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,835
Todd in Accounting, who also told me
about this place called The Petting Zoo.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,558
It's not exactly legal, but...

161
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,553
Julie, I am not going to a place
called The Petting Zoo.

162
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,358
You don't know where the pets
have been.

163
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,993
We'll be too drunk to care.

164
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,073
- No strippers.
- Just one stripper? Please?

165
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,800
Just one little stripper
who never hurt anyone...

166
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,349
...who's just trying to make his way
in the world?

167
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,512
Naked.

168
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,352
One little stripper.

169
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,994
Yes! You're the best.

170
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,838
But no Chippendales.

171
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,151
And not little.

172
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,714
A bachelor party?

173
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,840
Where really anything could happen.

174
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,714
Good to know.

175
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,791
Yeah. Just kind of
a courtesy thing, really.

176
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,077
Seeing as how, last time I checked,
we're still boyfriend and girlfriend.

177
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,552
Even though you've been ignoring me in
the halls and don't return any of my calls.

178
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,358
I didn't mean for that to rhyme.

179
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,916
- Look, Cohen...
- I just want you to tell me...

180
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,197
...that you're not gonna let
what your dad thinks of me break us up.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,638
- He's my dad.
- So what?

182
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,839
Summer, I don't care about your dad.
Okay? I care about you a lot.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,956
And if that's not good enough for you...

184
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,718
Obviously, that's not good enough
for you, so I'll go to Vegas.

185
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,353
Wait.

186
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,116
- Hi.
- Hey.

187
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,918
How was work? How you feeling?

188
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,073
Good. I'm actually going back.
I picked up another shift tonight.

189
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,118
Marissa and I were kind of hoping
we could all hang out.

190
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,593
Yeah, I can't. I have to make money
if I'm gonna go to Atlanta.

191
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,952
- Atlanta?
- Yeah, my cousin Kim lives in Atlanta.

192
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,839
She said I can go stay with her
as long as I pay my own way.

193
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,077
I mean, she doesn't have
a pool house or anything...

194
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,954
...but that way,
maybe I can get a second chance too.

195
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,597
How much you need?

196
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,229
I can't take your money.

197
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,236
- I don't even... Two thousand dollars?
- I'll ask the Cohens.

198
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,674
No, you won't.

199
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,118
Listen to me.
This is not your problem, okay?

200
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,433
Go. Win. Make money.

201
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,192
That's what I'm gonna do.

202
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,591
Two thousand dollars, huh?

203
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,830
Well, I've got about...

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,515
I'd say I've got about a thousand
in savings bonds, bar mitzvah bucks.

205
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,272
I could throw in a couple hundred.

206
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,919
I can't ask you guys to do that.

207
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,672
You didn't ask. We volunteered.

208
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,872
Thanks, but it's still not enough.

209
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,476
You could make it enough. Take that
money to Vegas and triple it at blackjack.

210
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,279
It's been a while
since I've done the card-counting thing.

211
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,989
Listen, I'm gonna start you off slow.
If you suck, I'm just gonna cut you off.

212
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,477
- How do we get in the casinos?
- I think we'd use our fake IDs.

213
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,438
- You have fake IDs?
- C.D. Sebulski, it's good to meet you.

214
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,034
- Have you met Marty Nayfis?
- Oh, God.

215
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,550
Okay, look, you guys go to Vegas.
I'll take care of Theresa.

216
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,396
If you win, great. If not,
well, then Theresa never has to know.

217
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,752
- What do you have to lose?
- Just $ 1000 in bar mitzvah bonds.

218
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,512
But other than that, nothing.

219
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,518
You in?

220
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,195
Marty, are you in?

221
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,349
I'm in.

222
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,237
- I love the Vegas.
- Reno was never like this.

223
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,599
What is this place?

224
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,231
This is the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.
According to Seth, it's ground zero...

225
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,516
...for aging hipsters like yourself.

226
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,512
I thought we were going to Caesar's.

227
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,194
Caesar's didn't have
a permanent Springsteen exhibit.

228
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,112
Although they do have Celine Dion.

229
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,679
Yet another reason we're here.

230
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,435
- Mock if you must, but she can sing.
- You're gonna regret saying that...

231
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,670
...on your birthday.
- Yeah, really.

232
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,592
Welcome to Hard Rock.
My name is Amy.

233
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,478
Which one of you is Mr. Cohen?

234
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,200
Hi, Amy, we spoke on the phone.
It's good to see you.

235
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,238
Yes, good to see you. We have
the penthouse all ready for you.

236
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,674
If you will follow me.

237
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,831
- Penthouse?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,798
- So whose card did you put that on?
- Oh, please, the old man's.

239
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,791
Oh, I love you, son. I love you.

240
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,473
I love you too, Dad.

241
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,838
Just not as much as I love Vegas.

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,673
The casino, restaurants, pool and spa
are all on this level.

243
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,308
And if you'll follow me,
I'll show you our bowling alley.

244
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,959
God, there's a bowling alley?

245
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,634
Yes, sir. It's in your room.

246
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,154
Did you see that?

247
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,039
I just almost bowled a strike.

248
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,273
In our hotel room, man.
I'm never going home.

249
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,952
It's like a million-dollar frat house.

250
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,509
I know. It's fantastic.

251
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,191
Well, I'm gonna explore the casino.

252
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,998
May I give you gentlemen a tour?

253
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,752
No, I'll find my way. Thanks.

254
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,559
- We're good. Thanks, Amy.
- Thanks.

255
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,270
Actually, you know what?
We'll take that tour.

256
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,315
Sure. I just need to see some ID.

257
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,955
It's just a formality. We have
a lot of kids under 21 using fake IDs...

258
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,352
...to get onto the casino floor. We'd hate
to have to throw them out of the hotel.

259
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,348
You know what? I don't think
we're gonna need that tour.

260
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,431
- But thank you for stopping by.
- Absolutely.

261
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,033
Really sweet.

262
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,557
What are we gonna do? I don't
wanna get thrown out. I love the hotel.

263
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,312
- Me too.
- I wanna marry the hotel...

264
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,391
...and have gambling-addicted,
alcoholic kids.

265
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,835
- We'll find another casino.
- What, a youth casino?

266
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,514
Seth, it's Vegas.

267
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,036
You wanna find some action in this town,
all you gotta do is ask.

268
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,311
Winner. Pay the line.

269
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,078
Yeah.

270
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,117
Where are we doing this?

271
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,555
No, I'm at the Hard Rock, of all places.

272
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,914
Fine.

273
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,399
I'm on my cell.

274
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,599
- So where's the party?
- There is no party, just a quiet dinner.

275
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,228
Hey, have you figured out what
you're gonna do with the restaurant?

276
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,233
Not yet. You figured out
what you're gonna do with that money...

277
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,992
...that I paid you for it?

278
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,230
I'm putting all mine on the hard ways.

279
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,198
Jimmy's gonna buy a house
for himself and Marissa.

280
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,708
Really?

281
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,350
Last time I talked to Marissa,
she was planning on moving in with us.

282
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
- <i>ever gonna stop being mad at me, Ada?</i>

283
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,594
I'm sorry, but does it strike anyone else
as tragic that the boys are in Las Vegas...

284
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,309
...doing God knows what, while we sit
here watching <i>The Valley</i> marathon?

285
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,313
Hey, it's Summ's favorite show, okay?

286
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,913
Right, Summ?

287
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,355
- Are you crying?
- No.

288
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,275
It's a sad episode.

289
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,112
- She broke up with Seth.
- Coop.

290
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,872
- What? Why?
- Her dad doesn't approve.

291
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,314
- Coop.
- Please.

292
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,392
You think my dad approves
of Jimmy Cooper? The man's a felon.

293
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,754
No offense.

294
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,718
Yeah, I know. Anyway,
my mom still doesn't approve of Ryan.

295
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,474
It's like a rule. Your parents almost have
to disapprove.

296
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,790
Otherwise, the sex isn't good.

297
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,674
- Was that an over-share?
- Yeah. He kind of is my dad.

298
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,834
Yeah, I'll get the door.

299
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,873
- Hey.
- Hey.

300
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,712
Can I talk to you?

301
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,519
Alone?

302
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,399
- Let's move.
- Yeah.

303
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,635
- You want me to get you a stripper?
- Not me. Julie.

304
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,995
And I only ask because...

305
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,469
...you were a stripper.
- Can I ask you something?

306
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,029
- How did you get yourself into this?
- I wish I knew.

307
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,475
Does she have a picture of you
wearing culottes?

308
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,039
You don't even like Julie.

309
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,274
Marissa's still here.

310
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,839
And that's not entirely true.

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,353
You let her walk all over you.

312
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,351
You're upset
because she's marrying Dad.

313
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,273
Yeah, for his money.
Same reason that she married Jimmy.

314
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,676
Well, she's not your biggest fan either.

315
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,478
So why am I getting her a stripper?

316
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,517
Because if you don't...

317
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,032
...she's gonna make me take her
to a place called The Petting Zoo...

318
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,078
...which, according to Todd
in Accounting, they pet.

319
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,478
You know what? I'll do it.

320
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,316
If Julie Cooper wants a stripper...

321
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,232
...I know just the man for the job.

322
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,352
Thank you.

323
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,715
We live in an age of miracles. Look at
them frolic. Look how much fun that is.

324
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,313
Bowling alleys in the penthouse.

325
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,314
You know what I'm saying? Hotel rooms?
Beaches in the middle of the desert.

326
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,951
There's so many bikini-clad women,
I haven't thought about Summer since...

327
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,997
Since you left a message
on her machine?

328
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,673
Sure, but that was 20 minutes ago.

329
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,876
I'm feeling liberated now. Confident.

330
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,032
Like I could walk up to any one
of these women and just...

331
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,713
...converse.

332
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,074
Know what I'm saying?

333
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,878
Great, go for it.

334
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,196
The thing is,
I don't want to be rude to you.

335
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,918
- I can take care of myself.
- Yeah.

336
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,755
But I can't. I can't just go up
to a strange girl and say...

337
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,150
Excuse me.
Would you mind if I kissed you?

338
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,753
Are you talking to me?

339
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,957
Sorry. The Hard Rock's kind of exclusive.

340
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,317
You can't use the beach
unless you're with a guest, so I'm Jenn.

341
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,357
- Seth.
- And you are an excellent kisser.

342
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,954
Can I buy you guys a drink? Say thanks.

343
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,829
Yeah, I think we're out, so that...

344
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,911
Could you hold on one second?
It's Summer.

345
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,596
- Hey.
- Cohen.

346
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,076
- Listen, I've been thinking.
- Yeah.

347
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,592
Hey, I have to kiss you again.

348
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,352
- What?
- What?

349
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,995
Cohen? What is going on over there?

350
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,437
<i>You're an amazing kisser.</i>

351
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,914
Hold that thought, please. Hey, Summer.

352
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,516
- Hello?
- He's kissing another girl.

353
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,838
Yes. Right in front of me on the phone.
I can't believe this.

354
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,834
I have been crying actual tears
over that ass, and he's kissing randoms.

355
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,594
Okay, you know what?
We're gonna have a girls' night out.

356
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,069
Theresa's coming over.
We can do whatever you want.

357
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,757
Really? Because all I want to do right now
is go to Las Vegas and kick Cohen's ass.

358
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,638
- She's gonna kick my ass.
- Yeah.

359
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,712
- Was that your girlfriend?
- "Was" being the operative word there.

360
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,438
I'm so sorry. I should go.

361
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,876
I shouldn't even be here. I should go.
I have a paper to write, anyway.

362
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,032
- Yeah, we should probably go too, so...
- Where are you guys headed?

363
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,430
- Can I give you a lift?
- You have a car here?

364
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,472
I live here. I go to UNLV.

365
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,192
English major.
With a weakness for fake beaches.

366
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,634
What about you guys?

367
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,559
- Just visiting.
- Yeah.

368
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,393
- We're looking for a blackjack game.
- It's sort of business.

369
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,834
I don't know about blackjack...

370
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,753
...but a couple of guys from my class
are doing this poker thing.

371
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,353
It's a kind of intense, though.

372
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,479
Wanna go?

373
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,119
- Sure.
- Sure.

374
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,038
- Hey.
- How'd it go with Caleb?

375
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,668
He stonewalled me. I got nothing.

376
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,479
Maybe he's just out here
for his bachelor party.

377
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,073
Yeah, right. A bachelor party...

378
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,390
...where Robert Campbell
just happened to stop by...

379
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,120
...and pay him half a billion dollars
for the coastline.

380
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,397
So he's profiting from our loss.
He's Caleb Nichol.

381
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,916
That's what he does. He paid us a huge
amount of money for that restaurant.

382
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,390
- He's the reason I could bid on a house.
- You may want to retract that bid...

383
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,472
...because according to Caleb,
Marissa's moving in with him.

384
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,228
Summer had to go home,
but she wants us to call if we go out.

385
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,750
I don't feel like going out much,
if that's okay.

386
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,434
Yeah. No, of course it's okay.
We'll just order in.

387
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,239
You want, like, Indian? Chinese? Sushi?

388
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,470
No, not sushi. I can't do raw fish.

389
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,200
Okay. Well, what about
something else to drink?

390
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,113
I think we have, like, juice, soda...
Beer?

391
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,599
No, I can't.

392
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,318
I mean, I shouldn't. Thanks.

393
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,071
You can't drink, you can't have sushi.
What, are you pregnant?

394
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,479
Oh, my God. Are you pregnant?

395
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,750
- We're just playing Texas Hold'em, right?
- Yep.

396
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,275
Last time I was here,
it was, like, a 250 buy-in.

397
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,476
As in $250?

398
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,834
Why, you play?

399
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,149
Yeah, just for fun.

400
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,788
Well, it was fun,
until last time I lost that 250.

401
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,473
These guys, they don't play for fun.

402
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,396
- You do know how to play poker, right?
- Yeah.

403
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,313
I haven't played in a while, but...

404
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,040
- How about I go buy us a drink.
- Okay.

405
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,638
- Look, we don't have to do this.
- Yeah, well, what about Theresa?

406
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,837
- Theresa's not your responsibility.
- Not yours either, yet here we are.

407
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,149
So listen...

408
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,790
...I love the Vegas.
It's time to see if the Vegas loves me.

409
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,674
Howdy.

410
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,468
I haven't told anyone.

411
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,959
Not my mom. Not Eddie.

412
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,476
Especially not Ryan.
You're the only one who knows, so...

413
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,437
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
I promise.

414
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,395
- Do you not want to talk about this?
- I've been going crazy keeping it to myself.

415
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,509
Okay. So do you know
what you want to do?

416
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,798
I don't even have the money
to get to Atlanta...

417
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,034
...so I have no idea
how I would pay for an...

418
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,475
I mean, even if I had the baby...

419
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,314
...I work in a bakery.
You know, what am I supposed to do?

420
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,157
- Well, maybe if you talked to Eddie...
- No, I can't.

421
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,677
He'll try to convince me to marry him
and have the baby.

422
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,477
- Or else he'll say it isn't his.
- Who else's could it be?

423
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,956
All in.

424
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,152
Twenty-five hundred.

425
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,758
Pocket aces.

426
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,116
Hey, how you doing there, buddy?

427
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,078
We got your bar mitzvah money,
Theresa's money. Now we gotta go.

428
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,073
No. What about the Ryan-and-Seth-
going-to-Europe money, my man?

429
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,515
- Get back in there. We can get Vespas.
- Vespas?

430
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,159
Yeah, it's Europe.

431
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,517
Harleys. I don't know. The point is,
why quit when you're ahead?

432
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,797
If we don't, Angry Trucker Hat
over there is gonna hurt me.

433
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,708
Maybe he's not angry at you.

434
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,553
He's angry because he found out
people don't wear trucker hats anymore.

435
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,950
Come on.
I'm doing so good with Jenn, I think.

436
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,758
Invite her back to the hotel room.

437
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,913
It is kind of sweaty in here. I'd like
to do that. But how am I gonna do that?

438
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,034
Hey.

439
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,395
So, Seth and I were wondering...

440
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,711
...if...
- lf you would come to our hotel room...

441
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,440
...and go bowling,
which is not as weird as it sounds.

442
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,431
Are you guys staying in the penthouse?

443
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,593
My girlfriends and I have always wanted to
rent that for a night, but it's so expensive.

444
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,636
Yeah, well, you should call them.
You should bring them over.

445
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,357
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Call them.

446
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,919
Okay. Thanks.

447
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,838
Now, isn't this better
than some seedy Hollywood club?

448
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,353
When's the stripper getting here?

449
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,954
Don't tell me.
I want it to be a surprise.

450
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,755
- Surprise.
- I'll get it.

451
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,992
Maybe I better go with you.
You know...

452
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,072
...in case it's a UPS man
and I have to sign for the package.

453
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,676
Or maybe it's a plumber
and he needs to tighten my pipes.

454
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,276
Or, you know what, what if it's...?
Hailey.

455
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,469
- What are you doing here?
- Kirsten invited me, since you forgot.

456
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,073
My memory's fine.

457
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,832
- Crab cakes.
- I can't stay.

458
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,798
I saw a fire truck out front and wanted
to make sure everything was okay.

459
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,359
Fire truck?

460
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,959
Is it hot in here?

461
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,159
Or is it just me?

462
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,598
Hailey, I said one stripper.

463
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,797
- Hello?
- Hey.

464
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,154
Thank God it's you.

465
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,518
There are four male strippers dressed
as firemen dancing in our living room.

466
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,557
Theme stripping, you gotta love that.

467
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,234
Oh, wait.

468
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,630
Now they're not dressed
as anything at all.

469
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,438
Try to keep them off the furniture.

470
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,556
<i>So how's everything going in Vegas?</i>

471
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,712
Let me ask you something.
Do you find it odd that after your father...

472
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,599
...bought into the restaurant,
as powerful as he is...

473
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,478
...we were still denied our liquor license?

474
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,519
Yeah, but the guy that was on the liquor
board was an ex-client of Jimmy's.

475
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,035
So your dad doesn't know anyone
on the liquor board?

476
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,998
He knows everyone. But why
would he do something like that?

477
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,718
He was a partner in the restaurant.

478
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,190
So he could buy us out cheap, turn
around and sell it to Robert Campbell...

479
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,509
...for 10 times as much.

480
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,039
Sandy, he wouldn't do that.

481
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,590
Honey, when are you gonna realize
there is nothing your dad wouldn't do?

482
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,718
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna talk to your father.

483
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,078
- Hey, Ryan.
- Yeah.

484
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,954
I'm proud of you, man.

485
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,076
Not as proud
as if we were on Vespas, but...

486
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,276
- Right.
- Jenn, we're gonna do strip bowling.

487
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,113
I'm not a very good bowler,
so you'll probably see my tush.

488
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,358
Go ahead.
I'm gonna catch up. All right?

489
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,112
- Yeah. Hurry up.
- Okay.

490
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,471
Hey, I still haven't heard from you.

491
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,757
Just want to make sure you're okay.
Ryan's here. He'd like to say hi...

492
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,798
...so give us a call back, okay?
Love you, kiddo.

493
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,276
Been calling all day.
She hasn't picked up.

494
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,714
Everything okay?

495
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,556
Listen. Do you know anything about
Marissa moving in with Caleb and Julie?

496
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,913
Yeah.

497
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,433
- She finally told you?
- No, she didn't.

498
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,358
Caleb told Sandy.
Is there something I should know?

499
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,158
What?

500
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,039
Nothing. I just don't know why
he'd do that. They had a deal.

501
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,879
Deal?

502
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,996
What kind of deal?

503
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,713
Move.

504
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,953
Hi. The name is Cohen. C-O-H-E-N.
I think that's how you spell it.

505
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,076
You can pretty much see
the entire strip from here.

506
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,840
Yeah. You can see it from here too.

507
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,834
It's very impressive.

508
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,190
Wait till you see what happens next.

509
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,796
I would, actually. I would like that
very much, to see what happens next.

510
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,839
The thing is, I'm kind of in love with
my girlfriend, and that makes it weird.

511
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,912
- Ex-girlfriend. Right?
- That's a good point.

512
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,512
Cohen!

513
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,553
- Summer?
- I tried to stop her.

514
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,631
Get away from him, whore.

515
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,597
She's not a whore, okay?
She goes to UNLV.

516
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,955
Oh, you know, I'm sorry. Skank!

517
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,712
Hello?

518
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,951
Did somebody order more skanks?

519
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,717
Come on in, you guys. Ryan, Seth,
this is Valerie, Shannon and Grace.

520
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,396
Aren't you gonna introduce me?

521
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,517
What are you doing here, Lucas?

522
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,592
This many girls, I'm gonna need
payment before the party.

523
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,830
Wait, no. Payment? Are you...?

524
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,195
- You're a prostitute.
- I knew it!

525
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,035
So four girls till midnight,
plus, you had Jenn all afternoon.

526
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,430
No, man,
I think I've been had all afternoon.

527
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,076
Either way, it's 250 an hour,
which brings us to a grand total...

528
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,594
...of $5000.

529
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,830
So, what will it be, gentlemen?

530
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,672
Cash, check or charge?

531
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,311
I hate the Vegas.

532
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,429
My entire life,
I've never even seen a prostitute...

533
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,239
...now I have four of them taking
advantage of me in my hotel room.

534
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,311
And not in a nice way.

535
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,471
- Way to go, whore-boy.
- Thanks.

536
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,437
All right.
Summer, how much money you got?

537
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,319
I'm not giving you money.
I'm not the one that was worked on.

538
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,835
I wasn't worked on. Okay?
I was entrapped.

539
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,150
This is your fault.
You broke up with me.

540
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,153
- So you hire a call girl?
- What, your dad wouldn't approve?

541
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,788
- This has nothing to do with my dad.
- Right. It doesn't.

542
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,837
Okay. So maybe I overreacted a little.

543
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,195
- Yeah, a little.
- Lf you didn't try so hard with him...

544
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,874
I only did that because I knew
it was important to you.

545
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,155
You swear nothing else happened
with the ho?

546
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,959
I swear. One kiss.

547
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,318
- Maybe four.
- I hope you enjoyed them...

548
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,199
...because if anything like this
happens again, I'll kill you.

549
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,477
You won't have to. If we don't
get 5000 soon, her pimp will.

550
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,391
Between my money and Theresa's money,
it's only 3000.

551
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,631
Three thousand five hundred.

552
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,352
Thanks...

553
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,830
...but that still leaves us 1500 short.

554
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,590
You guys did buy us till midnight.

555
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,991
That's more than enough time
for another game of no-limit Hold'em.

556
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,440
That's a card game, not hooker talk.

557
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,798
Well, that was some performance.

558
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,235
Believe me...

559
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,118
...that was nothing.

560
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,071
- What are you doing after the party?
- Getting married.

561
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,591
Yeah, but not tonight. Right?

562
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,309
Let me get my purse.

563
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,830
- Thanks for the party.
- You're leaving?

564
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,118
I'm exhausted, and the boys
are getting back from Vegas early, so...

565
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,392
Please tell me your sister's
not hitting on that poor stripper.

566
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,798
Oh, they're old friends.
In fact, Hailey set this whole thing up.

567
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,951
She did? Really?

568
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,319
Excuse me.

569
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,399
So, what was the plan, Hailey?

570
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,151
Get your stripper friend to proposition me,
tell Daddy about it, the wedding's off?

571
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,233
Please, I know you'd never sleep with
Jeff. He doesn't make enough money.

572
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,272
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

573
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,638
Well, you married Jimmy for his money,
and now my dad.

574
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,952
You see, Jeffrey here might be a stripper,
but, honey, you're a whore.

575
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,197
- You're going down, bitch.
- Who are you calling "bitch," bitch?

576
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,511
Oh, my God. Hailey! Stop it!

577
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,277
Ladies!

578
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,750
I never liked you,
even when you were a little twerp!

579
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,708
Come on!

580
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,836
Hey, how are you?
I'm meeting someone here.

581
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,992
Caleb! There you are. I'm so glad
you guys didn't start eating without me.

582
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,869
Mr. Campbell, how are you? Sandy Cohen.
Caleb's son-in-law. Former partner.

583
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,871
- How is the food here?
- Filet's excellent.

584
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,837
- Really?
- Would you care to join us?

585
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,230
- Actually, we should just...
- Don't mind if I do.

586
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,995
So I understand that you're interested
in Caleb's Balboa coastline property.

587
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,877
I can see why. It is the perfect location.

588
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,838
You mind? I'm parched.

589
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,673
As a matter of fact, some partners and I
recently tried to open a restaurant there.

590
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,549
Not unlike this one, except we had
two kinds of meat loaf and dirty martinis.

591
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,312
The problem was,
we could not get a liquor license...

592
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,552
...and for the longest time,
we couldn't figure out why.

593
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,109
- Sandy, this is not the time.
- You gonna eat that?

594
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,477
Turns out, one of our partners
went behind our backs...

595
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,349
...to a friend on the city council and
got them to deny us the liquor license.

596
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,476
So he bought us out,
and now he's peddling...

597
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,474
...that piece of property
at a much higher price to someone else.

598
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,155
- Robert, I have to ask you to excuse us.
- The problem is, the joke's on him.

599
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,708
Not only is he guilty of collusion
and fraud, but he and his property...

600
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,633
...are going to be tied up
in civil litigation for months.

601
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,951
Years, if I have anything to say about it.

602
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,155
The bottom line: That coastline property,
it's absolutely worthless.

603
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,592
What do you think of that?

604
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,149
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Hands off! You wanna go?

605
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,949
- We'll go. Come on. I'll take you...
- Sandy, don't. Let me.

606
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,878
You think you can manipulate me?!
Hold my daughter hostage?!

607
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,554
Easy, easy. What are you doing?
You beat me to the punch.

608
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,837
We'll see you back in Newport, Dad.
Come on. Go, go.

609
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,399
Five hundred. You got nothing.

610
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,229
I'm out.

611
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,156
- I need you to lend me some money.
- What?

612
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,756
No. No way. You just lost, like, $3000.
There's no way I'm lending you money.

613
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,433
Then I guess you don't get paid.

614
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,389
Look, this is not a game, okay? You
and your friends could get seriously hurt.

615
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,834
Yeah, whose fault is that?

616
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,514
I was just doing my job.

617
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,478
You guys were staying in the penthouse.
I thought you had money.

618
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,076
I don't understand.
This afternoon you were doing so good.

619
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,834
Now you suck.

620
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,796
So I guess Angry Trucker Hat's
feeling pretty confident right now.

621
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,393
Wouldn't you say?

622
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,913
You lost on purpose?

623
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,196
I won a lot of money this afternoon.

624
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,438
Now I need yours.

625
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,752
Deal me in.

626
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,790
I can't believe he gave you
his angry trucker hat.

627
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,473
He didn't give it to me, I won it.

628
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,039
That's not really winning then.

629
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,397
Be nice, Cohen.
He paid off your pimps and your ho's.

630
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,552
Yeah. I did lose
your bar mitzvah money, though. Sorry.

631
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,678
I lost my bar mitzvah money, okay?
And I also lost Theresa's money...

632
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,957
...which is the only reason you came.
- No, it's not the only reason.

633
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,475
- You don't think the trip's a total waste?
- No, no.

634
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,110
We won some, we lost some. We're
walking out of Vegas pretty much even.

635
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,033
I'd say some of us
are walking out ahead.

636
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,991
I think if it were up to you,
we wouldn't be walking out of here at all.

637
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,357
- Now we have a good Vegas story.
- I don't think you wanna tell people...

638
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,432
...that you lost your bar mitzvah money
on prostitutes.

639
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,196
Yeah, well, you know what they say,
what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.

640
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,875
- I thought that was Tijuana.
- I think that hat should stay in Vegas.

641
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,834
Sorry.

642
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,117
Definitely love the Vegas.

643
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,039
How was Vegas?

644
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,431
Definitely a spectacle.

645
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,397
How were the strippers?

646
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,629
- Surprisingly tame, actually.
- That's good.

647
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,318
Considering what happened next.

648
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,917
- Do I want to know?
- Depends.

649
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,430
- What is it?
- On how you feel about drunken catfights.

650
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,353
Julie and Hailey?

651
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,557
Wow. Even Vegas can't compete
with that.

652
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,594
So how did it go with my dad?

653
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,273
Well, you'll be relieved to know
I did not punch him in the mouth.

654
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,714
That is a relief.

655
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,633
Jimmy did.

656
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,952
I don't think we'll be invited back
to the Hard Rock. But you know what?

657
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,714
I'm not really looking forward
to getting back to Vegas.

658
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,590
- I thought you loved the Vegas.
- I do. I do love the Vegas.

659
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,639
Because afterwards,
it is so nice to come home.

660
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,791
- Hi.
- You told my dad?

661
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,039
Your dad found out. He asked me.
I had to tell him the truth.

662
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,475
Oh, so you'll tell my dad the truth,
but you won't tell me?

663
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,119
What are you talking about?

664
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,071
You know what,
maybe you should just ask Theresa.

665
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,591
Just tell me what's going on, okay?

666
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,593
Theresa's pregnant.

667
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,155
And it might not be Eddie's.

668
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,357
So why don't you tell me
what's going on?
