1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,429
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,830
- <i>Previously on</i> The Valley<i>:</i>
- <i>Stay in Tarzana.</i>

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,598
<i>Previously on</i> The Valley<i>:</i>

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,716
<i>I don 't feel like I fit here in Tarzana.</i>

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,791
You owe it to yourself.
Get out. Get free.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,316
- Why do I need to leave? You're here.
- Exactly.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,789
- Luke.
- Luke came by to defrag my hard drive.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,552
- You look so hot.
- Now, forgive me...

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,792
...this can't possibly be happening, right?
I'm crazy.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,315
I have this whole life to figure out.
And so does Ryan.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,471
Take care of him.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,312
I'll see you.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,677
So then did you take your watch off
during the deed, or what exactly?

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,115
Wanna wait in the car?
I can pick this up myself.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,077
No, I got more questions.
I don't understand...

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,992
...did you take it
off before foreplay?

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,435
- That would seem presumptuous...
- No, seriously...

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,956
I like to leave the watch on. I like
to leave it on to know how I'm doing...

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,519
...if I'm beating my old time.

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,148
It's sort of a sex marathon,
not a sex sprint.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,753
Excuse me. Hi.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,480
I called earlier about the watch
that was left here.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,551
Room 204, right?

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,075
Yeah. Such a nice girl
was staying in there.

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,993
Beautiful too. Your girlfriend?

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,713
- Okay. That's a little awkward.
- No, she's not. But thank you.

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,949
A girl like that?

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,953
- You'd be a lucky guy if you could...
- Thank you for your time.

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,031
Or his time. The timepiece.
Thanks a lot.

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,315
One day, we'll look back on that
and we'll laugh.

31
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,675
We'll laugh, laugh some more,
have a good laugh.

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,274
Not at my timepiece joke,
but at the situation.

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,158
I'm fine.
Theresa's back with Eddie...

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,550
...where she should be. Right?
- Yes. Absolutely.

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,632
This is a good time for Ryan Atwood.
This is "Clean-Slate Ryan."

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,395
Finally, you have no women to protect
from violent, goateed factory workers...

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,676
...or pill-popping manic-depressives.
- You're right.

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,876
- I really do have a clean slate.
- You do.

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,031
Dude, since day one
of you getting here...

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,316
...it's been nothing but lady drama
with you.

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,313
Marissa, Theresa, Luke, Oliver, Eddie.

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,438
- I'm exhausted just thinking about it.
- I am kind of tired.

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,990
Should be. But you know what?
You're gonna get a break. You deserve it.

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,071
Think I'm gonna declare this month...

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,754
...Angst-Free Ryan Month.
- Think it'll last all month?

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,959
Angst-Free Ryan Week. With an option
for an additional week, if you like it.

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,079
- Okay. Thanks, bud.
- Right on.

48
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,194
Hey. What's Luke doing here?

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,510
- Tell him about your watch?
- No. Why would I?

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,319
It didn't even last the night.

51
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,031
I can't believe they were at a motel.

52
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,397
It's just... It's so cheap.
It's so tawdry.

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,757
Yeah. That's the real moral
of the story here.

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,798
You know we're gonna have to see
Luke at school today, right?

55
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,592
How could he do it?

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,079
I mean, I get how he could do it,
it's Mrs. Cooper, but...

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,152
What about her?
It's her daughter's ex-boyfriend.

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,675
- Lf Marissa found out...
- No. She cannot find out.

59
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,229
- She doesn't handle bad news well.
- It's gotta end...

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,834
...before she finds out.
- I agree.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,876
Maybe you should take the reins
on this one.

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,873
I would, but I feel like
it's more your speed.

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,111
Sandy, Jimmy's here.

64
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,474
Hot, hot, hot. Hey.

65
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,710
- How are you, Jimmy?
- We're screwed.

66
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,678
Oh, good. Nothing like a little
optimism in the morning.

67
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,910
I'm serious.
Opening day is around the corner.

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,832
We've got no contractor, no designer.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,912
- When did you last look at the books?
- I don't. That's your job.

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,716
Well, we've basically blown through
our entire budget.

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,914
You're really not so good at
managing the money, are you?

72
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,877
No. I'm really not.

73
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,435
- How did that happen?
- Construction, labor, permits.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,999
Oh, wow.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,195
A letter from Hailey.

76
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,238
She's an aerobics instructor at Club Med
in Turks and Caicos.

77
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,152
Turks and Caicos? Wow.

78
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,675
- Unbelievable.
- That is unbelievable.

79
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,989
Hailey got a job.

80
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,072
So I'm gonna spend the weekend
interviewing designers.

81
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,872
Not that we can afford any of them.

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,837
Julie's gonna take Marissa
so I can work.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,675
I better get to work so I can make
some more money that you and I can lose.

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,071
So you want a designer on the cheap?
How cheap? Like, free?

85
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,992
Free is cheap.

86
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,519
Julie.

87
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,636
No. No way.

88
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,033
- She's good.
- Yeah. At manipulating others.

89
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,753
And backstabbing, pot-stirring...

90
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,229
...generally creating an atmosphere
of hate and distrust.

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,311
Did a nice job on the
Newport Group offices.

92
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,278
They were elegant and tasteful.
It was shocking, really.

93
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,194
This restaurant is supposed to be
my oasis, my happy place.

94
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,830
A place to rebuild after Julie.
Not a...

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,515
She's not doing to The Lighthouse
what she did to my marriage.

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,032
Free is cheap, Jimmy.
I mean, what choice do we have?

97
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,990
You asked me, Coop, and I think it's best.
You need some time off.

98
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,435
Ever since I've known you,
you've had a boyfriend.

99
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,669
You're right.

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,877
You need to be independent.
How else are you gonna find a new guy?

101
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,554
You can't be with someone
until you can be by yourself.

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,551
- I can be by myself.
- And by "yourself"...

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,518
...I mean still hanging out with me.
- Okay, good. Thank God.

104
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,874
What's going on over here?

105
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,551
- Can I have a hug?
- Grady had a late night.

106
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,073
I don't know.
I guess they're filming something.

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,233
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Coop!
- What? What?

108
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,549
Grady Bridges.

109
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,598
- Who's Grady Bridges?
- Jake Needleman, <i>The Valley</i>.

110
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,475
- He is so cute.
- Really? You think?

111
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,200
Yeah. Not in your traditional way,
but he's hilarious.

112
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,114
He's so funny. I hear he,
like, improvises all of his scenes.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,753
Let's go say hi. Be cool, okay?

114
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,229
Hey, Grady, we're your biggest fans.
<i>The Valley</i> is my favorite show.

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,075
- Thank you. Cool. I'm glad you like it.
- I love it. Obsessed. Addicted.

116
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,360
- So, what are you guys doing here?
- We are on what they call "location"...

117
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,192
...which means we're
shooting a scene...

118
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,238
My character starts dating
this girl from Newport.

119
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,470
- No, you'll ruin it!
- Okay. Okay.

120
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,599
- Are you as obsessed as she is?
- Actually, I've never seen your show...

121
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,829
- Coop!
- What?

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,314
- See, now that's funny.
- Oh, that was funny.

123
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,710
That was funny. Funny girl.

124
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,313
Maybe they're not having sex.

125
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,755
Maybe they just
spoon and watch <i>Charlie Rose.</i>

126
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,876
You're right. That's probably it.

127
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,429
Oh, my God, you guys.
We have the craziest news ever.

128
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,433
I mean, nothing you could tell us
could top this.

129
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,551
We met Grady Bridges.

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,875
Star of <i>The Valley</i>, the best show ever.

131
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,232
Okay. Anyway, he invited us
to his birthday party tomorrow night.

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,598
The star of a hit TV show invited you
to his cool Hollywood birthday party?

133
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,149
- That is awesome.
- There's no need for jealousy.

134
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,833
- I'd never date an actor.
- Really?

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,989
Yes.

136
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,313
- I got us a couple of plus-ones.
- Great.

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,914
I have to show everybody
the pictures of me and Grady.

138
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,559
Thank God I had my camera phone.

139
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,631
They're the autograph of
the 21 st century.

140
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,553
Summer, I'd like to see these photos.
Why don't we share.

141
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,195
- So how's Theresa?
- She's good. She's back with Eddie.

142
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,397
- Have you talked to her since she left?
- Yeah, we have...

143
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,472
...but we're taking some time apart.

144
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,676
- Best thing, I guess.
- Yeah.

145
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,160
- Oh, we should go.
- Yeah.

146
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,871
Good light. Exposed brick, it's a bit '80s,
but these trends are cyclical.

147
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,952
South-facing windows.
These floors could be sanded.

148
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,997
And the beams are rather oppressive.

149
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,074
Some white enamel could
lighten it right up.

150
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,192
- I'll do it.
- Now, you know we can't pay you.

151
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,191
Well, everybody has to start somewhere.

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,238
And the value it'll add to my portfolio
alone will be worth it.

153
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,231
It'll be my calling card.

154
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,231
And we should get started right away.

155
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,312
You will have to pay for the floors,
the linens, the silverware.

156
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,472
Unless you want patrons eating
with their hands, like Jimmy does.

157
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,393
Happy place. Happy place. Happy place.

158
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,118
How much, Julie?

159
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,915
What do you think, Kirsten?
Low six?

160
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,958
What? We don't have that money.
Are you skimming off the top?

161
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,156
No, sweetie. That was you.

162
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,711
My oasis is being violated.

163
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,950
My happy place is
very unhappy right now.

164
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,758
Now calm down, Jimbo. Just breathe.

165
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,751
- I could pitch in.
- No. No.

166
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,036
Please. I appreciate it, I do. But don't.

167
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,714
I mean, separation of church and state.

168
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,199
This is my thing.

169
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,716
So, what are you saying?
That this is your happy place?

170
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,914
- No.
- Caleb could help.

171
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,752
No. This is my happy place.

172
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,956
It's my oasis from
the rich and insufferable.

173
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,873
It'd be a good investment for him.
And the best thing for you two.

174
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,110
No. It would be the worst.
It would... No.

175
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,238
- Kirsten, please back me up.
- He could be a silent partner.

176
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,551
A silent assassin.
He would ruin everything.

177
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,199
He'd want goulash on the menu.

178
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,432
I don't think we have a choice.
We can't raise that kind of cash.

179
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,232
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Nothing.

180
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,834
So did you have sex
with Julie Cooper today?

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,833
- What...? What...?
- I saw you at the motel.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,958
What are you thinking, man?
Marissa's mom?

183
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,350
I know. I know what that
must have looked like...

184
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,159
...or seemed like,
but it's not like that.

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,598
- We've got a connection.
- Yeah, not anymore, you don't.

186
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,031
- Lf Marissa finds out...
- She won't.

187
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,760
Just like she didn't find out
about you in Tijuana?

188
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,833
It's a small town. People find out,
then they talk. It's only a matter of time.

189
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,711
I've never felt this way about a girl,
a woman, before.

190
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,474
Yeah, I don't care.
Tomorrow, Marissa's going to L.A.

191
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,598
You, you're going to Julie's.
It's gonna end.

192
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,398
Got it? It's gonna end.

193
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,512
Hey, man. What are you doing?

194
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,591
Watching <i>The Valley</i>.
I picked it up on DVD.

195
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,955
- Yeah? I talked to Luke.
- Would you just give me...

196
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,997
...till the end of
the episode, please?

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,473
- Is that Grady?
- Yeah.

198
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,069
- He's kind of like you.
- What, handsome and charming?

199
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,470
Geeky and sarcastic.

200
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,637
Oh, God. He is like me.

201
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,711
He is like me,
except with his own TV show.

202
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,075
- I was kidding. He's just a character...
- No, no.

203
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,754
He improvises all his lines.
That's totally him.

204
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,114
And he's totally me.

205
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,669
Except on a prime-time soap.
And, Ryan...

206
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,035
...if you could have the real me
or the TV me...

207
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,270
...which would you take?
You'd take the TV me.

208
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,637
We're not going to L.A. I'm gonna
lose Summer to the real-life TV me.

209
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,314
No. We're going to L.A.
We're taking the girls.

210
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,596
Luke's breaking up with Julie
while we're gone.

211
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,988
- You took care of it?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,914
That's good. I told you you'd be back to
"Angst-Free Ryan" in no time.

213
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,472
I'll get it.

214
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,473
Hey.

215
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,757
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

216
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,037
- So I'm not going to L.A.
- What? Why?

217
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,716
You know how you said
sometimes time apart is the best thing?

218
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,639
Well, I think time apart might be
the best thing...

219
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,192
...for us.
- You do?

220
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,388
Since you showed up,
it's been pretty intense.

221
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,669
Good and bad, but intense.

222
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,516
And I don't know, maybe we just need
to be away from each other.

223
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,192
Independent...

224
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,959
...for a little while.

225
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,712
You wanna start this
independent thing today?

226
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,753
We both have clean slates.

227
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,391
This is a good time for us
to be by ourselves.

228
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,191
So you go to L.A., and I'm gonna
spend some time with my mom.

229
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,910
See you.

230
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,354
So that was it?
That's your big plan you had to sleep on?

231
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,114
- Lf I don't go, Marissa will.
- Fine. Except you're going.

232
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,350
- Will your parents let us go?
- I'll handle it.

233
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,511
- You're gonna lie?
- No, that was the old me.

234
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,272
I've evolved. I'm a man of honor.

235
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,829
So I need you to talk to them.
It's your specialty.

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,672
Seems like a lot of things
are my specialty.

237
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,229
Yeah, well, great leadership's
all about delegation.

238
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,630
- So now I'm your employee?
- No. We're partners.

239
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,679
- What do you do?
- I'm working on the business plan, okay?

240
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,273
And that's gonna be awesome.

241
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,352
I just need you to convince my parents,
convince Marissa...

242
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,876
...and I'm gonna supervise.
God, it's so easy.

243
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,076
I should go into business for myself.

244
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,237
We crane up through the bushes.
That's perfect.

245
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,552
I'm sorry, Ryan, is it just me, or do my
parents get better-Iooking every day?

246
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,149
- Here we go.
- What?

247
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,032
- What do you want, Seth?
- Can't a child just admire the beauty...

248
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,988
...of his parents in the morning light?
You don't look a day over perfection.

249
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,878
- Also, there's a party in Hollywood.
- No.

250
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,632
- Why?
- I don't have to tell you why.

251
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,234
- I'm just telling you no.
- See what you're doing here?

252
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,277
- I do.
- I'm trying to tell you the truth...

253
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,510
...and establish trust here.
I could've lied.

254
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,592
I could've easily said I was going
to Comicon or an IMAX movie.

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,116
- All these devices at my fingertips.
- I knew you never went to that movie.

256
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,435
- Tag. You're tagged in.
- Yeah. Okay.

257
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,716
It's a birthday party.
We'll be home by midnight.

258
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,438
No drinking, drugs or fighting.

259
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,637
- See?
- Now that we've covered the obvious...

260
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,199
- Whose birthday?
- Grady Bridges.

261
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,632
- Oh, the guy from <i>The Valley</i>?
- Yes.

262
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,678
- I love him. He's so cute.
- Yeah, and, you guys...

263
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,956
...he can get any girl
in the world he wants.

264
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,317
Right now he wants Summer.
Okay? I have to go.

265
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,318
Please. I have to go.

266
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,548
You call when you get there,
and you're home by 11:30.

267
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,757
Don't spend an extra minute in L.A.
The town will steal your soul.

268
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,480
It's about to steal my girlfriend.
I'm the only thing...

269
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,676
...standing between Summer and
a development deal. Thank you.

270
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,276
Can you get me an autograph?
Your cell phone takes pictures, right?

271
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,358
- Now you have to convince Marissa.
- Gonna make me do that too?

272
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,354
We're business partners.
We serve different functions.

273
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,279
I'm the brains, you're the brawn.
I'm in the ivory tower...

274
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,159
...you're down there on the streets,
making it happen.

275
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,399
- Hey.
- Call you back.

276
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,949
So when I said we needed to spend
some time apart...

277
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,270
...I meant more than a couple hours.
- I know.

278
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,479
- What's that?
- Luke's puka shells. I just found them.

279
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,188
Blast from the past, huh?

280
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,550
Okay. Here's the thing.

281
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,632
Not going to L.A. Because I'm not going,
that's not independent.

282
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,872
To be really independent,
we both need to go to L.A. Independently.

283
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,429
- But together at the same time.
- You sound like Seth.

284
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,592
I know, it rubs off. Look, I gotta go.

285
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,797
- Seth, unsupervised in a big city...
- Okay. No, I get that.

286
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,474
Okay. And I don't want you
to miss out because of me.

287
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,830
And, you know, we haven't had fun
in a long time.

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,549
- This is gonna be fun.
- Usually you don't think anything's fun.

289
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,678
- It's always me talking you into going.
- People change.

290
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,149
And we're gonna be living
in the same town, right?

291
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,471
You know, going to the same school.
And we're friends, yes?

292
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,475
So, you know, we're gonna have to
do things independently.

293
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,870
- But together.
- You're right.

294
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,513
So you really want me to go?

295
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,473
It's not about what I want.
It's about what you need.

296
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,919
Okay.

297
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,598
Maybe, a little.

298
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,597
- All right. Let me just go get ready.
- All right. Cool.

299
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,997
- So you need me, Sanford?
- Here we go.

300
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,197
- Dad.
- Look, you did me a favor.

301
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,755
- It's my turn to do one for you.
- Don't do me any favors.

302
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,070
Let's hear him out. Okay?

303
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,994
- Your chef. What's he done?
- Nothing, really. TV dinners mostly.

304
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,639
He's terrible.

305
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,710
- Look, I know when I'm not wanted.
- And yet you're always at our house.

306
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,758
Marco was a sous chef at Aubergine.
He's fantastic.

307
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,514
- Aubergine, that's a good spot.
- He could prepare...

308
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,035
...some meals for you tonight.
- Good thinking.

309
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,556
I can't, I'm busy. I'm having dinner
with the board of the philharmonic.

310
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,632
Doesn't that include the editor in chief
of <i>Riviera Magazine</i>...

311
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,872
...the owner of the <i>Daily Pilot</i>,
owner of the Mighty Ducks?

312
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,998
Yeah, well, some of them used to be
Jimmy's clients, before...

313
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,957
- Point being there, Julie?
- They're the tastemakers...

314
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,430
...of Newport Beach. Why don't you
have Marco cook for them.

315
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,397
You can't buy free publicity like that.

316
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,279
If you have a restaurant,
you gotta cook for a lot of people.

317
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,795
"If you have a restaurant,
you gotta cook for a lot of people."

318
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,758
- That's our mission statement.
- We need the money, the press.

319
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,751
- I know.
- Good idea, Jules.

320
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,157
We just gutted the place.
There's dust all over. There's no furniture.

321
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,995
We can do it at our house.
The kids are on their way to L.A.

322
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,354
It's perfect.

323
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,953
Oh, my God. We haven't moved in...
It's been forever now.

324
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,236
How do people live like this?
How do you do it?

325
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,631
I don't know. Times like these I wish
we had a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

326
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,597
I always wish we had one.
It's a flying car.

327
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,478
You know, my mom's
never home anymore.

328
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,631
She's always sending Kaitlin
to my grandma's.

329
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,234
Know what it sounds like to me,
as a child of divorce?

330
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,551
- Think she's having an affair?
- When my mom started blowing me off...

331
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,393
Oh, it's a flying car!

332
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,238
No, my bad. Actually, that's a plane.

333
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,358
- She's probably just working a lot.
- She's a professional woman.

334
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,112
- Yeah, busy.
- Getting busy.

335
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,158
- Who you think's gonna be there tonight?
- I hope Orlando Bloom.

336
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,914
- Legolas is so hot.
- Right on. I'm hoping for a little...

337
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,311
...Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley,
maybe Kate Bosworth myself...

338
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,190
What? It's okay for you
to pine over Legolas?

339
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,237
Yeah, he's an Elf.
He saved Middle-earth.

340
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,231
That is a huge part of European history.

341
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,635
Don't worry about it.
Tonight's gonna be fun.

342
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,958
Luke better get it done.

343
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,798
Well, see you soonishly.

344
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,832
What about that date, Juju?

345
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,437
Let's just see how tonight goes, Caleb.
I want you focused.

346
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,069
Bye.

347
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,589
- Hey. We need to talk.
- Luke.

348
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,759
- What if Caleb saw you?
- Yeah, what are you doing with him?

349
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,912
Shouldn't he be washing his dentures?
Are you guys back together?

350
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,752
- Don't start.
- You were just using me...

351
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,956
...until Grandpa came back?

352
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,391
Okay. But I don't have a lot of time.

353
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,438
- Okay, but we'll talk after?
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

354
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,349
- Who let that heavy-set girl in?
- That was a guy.

355
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,635
Hey, girls, what's up?

356
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,074
- I'm glad you made it.
- Hey.

357
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,992
I wanna introduce you to some people.

358
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,993
- Wait.
- How does that guy play high-school?

359
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,309
Hollywood, man.

360
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,477
I thought it was a clich Á, young
Hollywood doing coke with strippers.

361
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,198
I didn't even think they
ate bread anymore.

362
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,918
Can I borrow your phone?

363
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,192
Boys, I want you to meet some people.
This is Summer, Marissa and some guy.

364
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,155
- Are they on the show?
- No. This is Team Grady, right?

365
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,030
This is my agent, this is my manager,
this is my lawyer, this is my publicist.

366
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,634
And then this is my producing partner.

367
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,509
- You have a producing partner?
- We control several properties, man.

368
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,513
- Just got the rights to <i>The Golden Girls</i>.
- Oh, my God. No way!

369
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,355
Yeah. We're gonna make it into a movie,
but we're gonna make the Golden Girls...

370
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,909
...you know, young and hot.
- Oh.

371
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,959
Luke, it's me. I wanted to make sure
you took care of it.

372
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,836
Take care of it.

373
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,834
- Hey.
- Hey.

374
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,679
- So do you want to meet the cast?
- Not really. You?

375
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,592
Yeah. Not really.

376
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,190
- Excuse me.
- Well...

377
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,549
- Oh, my God. What is with you?
- What?

378
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,070
- Relax. All you L.A. Chicks are so lame.
- We're not from L.A.

379
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,389
We're from Orange County.

380
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,437
Orange County?

381
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,955
- She said, "Ew."
- Glad we're not the ones fighting.

382
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,076
Yeah, glad we're not
one of those couples.

383
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,914
Or any kind of couple.

384
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,469
- Right. It's definitely better.
- Yep.

385
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,193
Hey there. Having fun yet?

386
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,512
- Hailey?
- Ryan?

387
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,231
- What are you...?
- What are you...?

388
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,790
Hailey, keep it moving.
Couples pay extra.

389
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,313
Gotta go.

390
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,472
- Is that...?
- Kirsten's sister, Hailey.

391
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,790
- Does Kirsten know she's here?
- I doubt it.

392
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,032
This is Kirsten's worst nightmare.
All she does is worry about her.

393
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,874
I'm late. I thought
we were only gonna do it once.

394
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,396
- Can we talk now? Because I really...
- Can't, gotta go be with the adults.

395
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,993
I'll talk to you later.

396
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,071
Newport used to be a glamorous town.

397
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,755
An escape for Hollywood stars
like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum.

398
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,879
The Lighthouse could be our chance
to bring those people back.

399
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,237
Wait, Cal. I don't think even
The Lighthouse can bring back the Duke.

400
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,598
What I mean is, we think
The Lighthouse is step one...

401
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,479
...in the renaissance of Newport
for destination dining...

402
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,995
...a magnet for glitz and glamour...

403
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,196
...and, well, cash.

404
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,873
Look, Jimmy and I view
The Lighthouse as a chance...

405
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,634
...to restore the restaurant
to its former glory.

406
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,360
It's just something from Newport,
for Newport.

407
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,149
We think it can be a bit of both.
An icon of the past.

408
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,438
- A beacon for the future.
- A bridge from the past to the present.

409
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,070
From Newport to the rest of the world.

410
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,952
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey, Julie.

411
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,393
So sorry I'm late.
I hope I didn't miss anything.

412
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,869
- Hey.
- You are glowing.

413
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,396
Well, I'm just so excited.

414
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,199
<i>You have one new message.</i>

415
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,069
<i>Luke, it's me. I'm just calling</i>
<i>to make sure you took care of it.</i>

416
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,798
<i>Take care of it.</i>

417
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,832
Hey.

418
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,035
Are you happy, Coop?

419
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,556
These the kind of people we want?
Because we're gonna be stuck with them.

420
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,915
I know, Sandy.
It's not what we wanted exactly.

421
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,837
It's exactly not what we wanted at all.

422
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,878
Look, we need the money.
Without Caleb, we've got nothing.

423
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,268
Maybe nothing is better.

424
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,035
That's an easy position to take if you
have another job. This is all I have.

425
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,475
- Hello?
- Sandy, hey, it's me.

426
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,871
- Ryan? Is everything okay?
- Not really.

427
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,838
- We found Hailey.
- What do you mean, you found Hailey?

428
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,190
- Hailey?
- Well, she got a job...

429
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,918
...as a stripper.

430
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,918
- There are strippers at this party?
- Strippers?

431
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,672
I never should've agreed to this.

432
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,513
- What do you want us to do?
- <i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

433
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,355
- Hailey is not your responsibility.
- Where are they? Is she okay?

434
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,717
- What club are you at?
- It's Luna Chicks.

435
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,714
Luna Chicks? Well, that's just great.

436
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,233
- What are you gonna do?
- I will deal with Hailey tomorrow.

437
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,994
Meanwhile, I want you guys home.
Pronto.

438
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,718
All right.

439
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,111
- What's going on?
- They found Hailey.

440
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,078
- Working as a stripper at this party.
- Is she okay?

441
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,878
No, of course not, no.
She's Hailey.

442
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,268
Should we do something?

443
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,558
You know what? We should not let
Hailey ruin another evening.

444
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,235
We got enough to contend with,
and if Kirsten finds out about this...

445
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,470
- I don't know...
- We'll deal with it tomorrow.

446
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,155
- Everything is going so well.
- Everyone seems really excited.

447
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,880
What the hell is that smell?

448
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,837
- What are we cooking here?
- Meat loaf. It's my mother's specialty.

449
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,594
I have the most important people
in the county in there...

450
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,352
...the most sophisticated palates
in Newport...

451
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,590
...and you offer them Nana Cohen's
meat loaf?

452
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,955
- Dad. It's their menu.
- The menu of lunatics.

453
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,192
This is a disaster. I'll have to
call Catherine Zeta-Jones' people.

454
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,237
I was trying to get her for the opening.

455
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,233
How quickly can you get to the
Crab Shack and pick up some fresh tuna?

456
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,709
Whoa. No, Marco. This is our restaurant.

457
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,395
You don't have a restaurant without me
and you don't have me with meat loaf.

458
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,152
Well, then, maybe we're better off.

459
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,709
A man's life comes down to
a few decisive moments...

460
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,509
...and maybe this meat loaf
is one of them.

461
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,280
This restaurant was supposed to be fun.

462
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,557
If you wanna go and ruin everything
that this restaurant is about...

463
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,718
...then go ahead. Fine.
I don't want any part of it.

464
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,953
Good night. Good luck.

465
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,469
That's why the man is bankrupt.

466
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,710
Do what you like. Sink the ship.

467
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,472
But make it quick. I'm starving.

468
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,788
Hey, Marco, there's a lot
riding on this meat loaf.

469
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,595
- Julie, is that a...?
- Curling-iron burn.

470
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,318
Yeah.

471
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,198
I'm gonna go check on Cal.

472
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,518
- This place is too crowded.
- Soon as we find Seth and Summer...

473
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,636
...we're out of here.
- And Hailey.

474
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,873
- I don't know. It's none of my business.
- Yeah, it is. It's your family.

475
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,473
We need to find her and get out of here.

476
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,037
All right, you wait here.
If you see Seth, don't let him move.

477
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,873
- And I'll just go try to find her.
- Not without me.

478
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,634
Come on.

479
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,633
Cheers, cheers.
To me, in all my glory...

480
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,552
...and a second season.

481
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,709
- Hey.
- Hi. Hi. How's it going?

482
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,871
- I'm so exhausted.
- Yeah?

483
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,235
I've been up all night working
on my thesis.

484
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,470
"Magical Realism in
American Literature."

485
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,551
Familiar with the works of
Thomas Pynchon?

486
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,792
- I've only read <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>.
- <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> is his masterpiece.

487
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,438
- Don't tell anyone I'm in grad school.
- Okay.

488
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,269
So I've got a new episode that
hasn't aired yet. You wanna see it?

489
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,716
- No way. You have a new episode?
- Yeah, on tape. Yeah?

490
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,189
Yeah. Hold on, I just have to...

491
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,353
Oh, yeah, no.
I'm not armed or anything.

492
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,196
- Yeah, that's a...
- Camera phone.

493
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,157
It's the autograph of the 21 st century.

494
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,436
Yeah. That's what they say.
That's what they say.

495
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,428
Let's go.

496
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,238
Call me sometime.

497
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,239
I will.

498
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,634
There you are.

499
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,793
- I thought you'd flown the coop as well.
- Just trying to get a little peace and quiet.

500
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,349
Wax philosophical about why
your partner up and quit.

501
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,954
He hasn't quit.
He went after Hailey.

502
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,350
What are you talking about?
Hailey's in Club Med.

503
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,717
Oh, she's in a club, but in Hollywood,
working as a stripper.

504
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,480
Ryan just called. They found her.

505
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,992
Anyway, that's where my partner went.

506
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,232
And that's why he's my partner.

507
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,950
This is so cool. You're here, and here.
It's awesome.

508
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,669
- <i>I'm out of here. "La-tro."</i>
- Oh, my God. I bet that was improvised.

509
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,070
- Listen, I'm really glad that you came...
- No, wait. I wanna watch.

510
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,955
Why? I'm not in this scene.

511
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,315
It's just so good.

512
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,913
I wish I was from the Valley.

513
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,071
- Hey, where's Summer?
- I don't know, off with Grady somewhere.

514
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,879
I talk about Pynchon for two seconds,
suddenly she's gone.

515
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,712
- I got something else for you.
- Dude.

516
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,468
You have a clean slate now,
so if I was you...

517
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,154
...I'd procure a little
private dance time with...

518
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,069
- Oh, my God. That's Hailey.
- Yeah. That's what l...

519
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,631
Hey, hey, what the hell are you doing?

520
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,110
I thought you were an aerobics instructor
in the Caribbean or something.

521
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,191
I figured the truth wouldn't
go over so well.

522
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,998
My mom will freak
when she finds out.

523
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,639
Don't tell her.
Not that she'd care.

524
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,119
She would if she knew
what you're doing.

525
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,874
What's wrong with it?
I make good money, I'm on my own.

526
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,792
You look terrible.
You work here?

527
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,394
Let me just grab my girlfriend,
and we'll go figure it out.

528
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,676
What, tired today?
Didn't do enough coke?

529
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,068
Hey, take it easy, man.

530
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,595
- Get back to work.
- Don't tell her what to do.

531
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,309
- Excuse me? You got a problem?
- Yeah, yeah.

532
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,993
- I do.
- No, he doesn't. I'm sorry.

533
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,435
We're gonna grab my girlfriend
and grab my aunt...

534
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,433
...more gently than you, and we'll leave.
- You're leaving now.

535
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,672
Get them out of my club.
Out, out, out.

536
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,278
Bye. Nice meeting you.
I don't wanna see them in my club again.

537
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,997
- Are we gonna just leave Hailey here?
- I don't think we have a choice.

538
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,391
- We can't leave without her.
- I can't get ahold of Summer.

539
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,676
I think we should split up.
Let's scale a wall.

540
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,274
Find a fire escape.
Climb through a window. The usual.

541
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,996
I was all-camp "Capture the Flag,"
Camp Tuckahoe. I'm very stealth.

542
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,274
That's kind of dewy.
I'm gonna go around.

543
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,391
- We're going to the VIP entrance.
- We're not VIP.

544
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,312
This is Hollywood.

545
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,516
Meet me in a minute. I have an idea.

546
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,638
This meat loaf is fantastic.

547
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,155
This is what we had planned.

548
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,078
Back to basics. Comfort food.

549
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,589
What's old is new again.

550
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,671
I couldn't have said that better myself.

551
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,673
- Even though I already did.
- So glad that you like it.

552
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,149
- I'm going to get more wine. Anyone?
- Oh, terrific.

553
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,158
Juju.

554
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,469
Bring the wine, dear.

555
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,356
This one's empty.
I'm gonna get another.

556
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,518
What the hell are you doing here?

557
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,557
- We need to talk.
- Wait outside my house.

558
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,314
Go hide in the bushes or something.
Go! Go!

559
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,954
Back to work.

560
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,793
I told you, VIPs only.

561
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,358
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

562
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,389
I love you so much!
You are my favorite character.

563
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,034
- Do you watch <i>The Valley</i>?
- No, I have a job.

564
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,838
It's only, like, the best show ever.

565
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,356
You are actually a little shorter
than I imagined, but still, so hot.

566
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,998
- Thanks.
- You here for the party?

567
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,435
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. Wait, can I come with you?

568
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,916
Seriously, it would mean so much to me.
It really is my favorite show.

569
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,752
Take advantage, kid.
You're only a teen idol once.

570
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,718
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thanks too.

571
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,590
I can't believe we're watching dailies.

572
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,115
But, seriously, which take
did you like better?

573
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,670
Because I kind of like the acting
in that one, you know.

574
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,434
But the lighting wasn't as good
as the one before.

575
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,831
Okay, I don't know. Could we go back
to the party? This is boring.

576
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,390
Well, how about some music?

577
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,197
That'll liven it up. Little party in here.

578
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,157
Party in my Caddy.

579
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,392
- What's this?
- This is my band.

580
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,154
- It's our first CD.
- No kidding.

581
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,114
I like you. I don't know why,
but you just... You've got...

582
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,479
You just got something, you know?
I'm a big fan of yours.

583
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,517
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?
- What...?

584
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,079
- Cohen.
- Summer.

585
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,959
- Hi.
- Hi. I heard really awful music...

586
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,317
...and I knew it could only be
self-indulgent actors with instruments.

587
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,152
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

588
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,039
- Grady, there you are.
- April, hi.

589
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,191
Oh, my God. You're on the show.

590
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,238
- You're the best thing on the show.
- What are you doing with her?

591
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,712
- I...
- Wait. You two are dating? Oh, God.

592
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,472
Don't you think that's a bad idea?

593
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,029
What if things don't work out
and you guys break up?

594
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,395
- Isn't that bad for the show?
- Guess we're about to find out.

595
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,916
Whoa... April! Hey, lock up
the car for me, please.

596
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,513
April, wait.

597
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,748
Hey.

598
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,239
I'm sorry. Let's go home.
Someplace with real people.

599
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,234
Think we'll find that at home? We live in
Newport Beach. Let's just get out of L.A.

600
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,879
<i>I love her, and she loves me.</i>

601
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,871
Is that a new episode?

602
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,679
- Oh, Grady's probably ad-libbing.
- I already saw it.

603
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,071
- What are you guys doing?
- Come with us.

604
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,232
Your whole "save the stripper" campaign
is sweet, but I'm fine.

605
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,435
- Oh, you're fine?
- Yeah.

606
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,556
Get out of here quick,
before he sees you.

607
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,312
No, not without you.
Look, we came...

608
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,630
- What you doing in my club?
- Get your hand off me.

609
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,109
Gonna have a problem now. Out.
You too, Hailey.

610
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,514
Goodbye. Goodbye, Hailey.

611
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,352
What are you gonna do now, big shot?
What are you gonna do now?

612
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,112
What are you gonna do, hit a kid?

613
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,954
Dad?

614
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,875
- What are you, the dad?
- What are you?

615
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,759
The guy who's my age
and still thinks he's 25?

616
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,316
You keep your kids out of my club.

617
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,676
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

618
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,549
- Look, Sandy got held up, so...
- That's okay. Thank you.

619
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,477
Why don't you guys head back.
I'm gonna give Hailey a lift.

620
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,630
Okay, we'll just go find Seth and Summer.

621
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,199
All right.

622
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,392
Drive safe.

623
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,315
I wish you would've called first.

624
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,277
I would've washed my hair.

625
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,149
Are you okay?

626
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,959
I'm fine.

627
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,159
I just was supposed to get a job
managing this other bar...

628
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,469
...and it fell through...

629
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,949
...and I needed money...
- It's okay. It's okay.

630
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,035
It's all right. It doesn't matter.

631
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,508
It doesn't matter.

632
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,553
So you wanna come home?

633
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,669
Yeah.

634
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,510
And could we have parked
any further away?

635
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,434
Hey. We get to look forward to a little
Saturday-night rush hour.

636
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,909
You know, I think we did
pretty good in there, man.

637
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,072
I told you we make a good team.
I'm the brains, you're the brawn.

638
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,674
How come you're the brains?
I talked us back into the club.

639
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,512
I'm sorry. I'm the brains.

640
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,432
- You can be the beauty.
- Okay, thanks.

641
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,989
You're the beauty, he's the brawn,
I'm the brains.

642
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,435
Great. And what am I, Cohen?

643
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,393
- The boobs? The bitch?
- Okay.

644
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,472
- I'll take "the boobs."
- Hey, so will I.

645
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,470
I've never seen so much meat loaf
in my life.

646
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,278
It was a beautiful sight.

647
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,557
Hey. Where were you? It went great.

648
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,792
I have a surprise.

649
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,989
Oh, my God.

650
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,151
Yeah. I just picked her up
from the airport.

651
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,880
- Fresh from Turks and Caicos.
- I hear that's the best Club Med there is.

652
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,871
I can't wait to hear the details.

653
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,031
Thanks, Jimmy.
For bringing her back.

654
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,433
- Why don't I draw you a bath.
- Yeah.

655
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,117
Well, we should wrap this up.

656
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,710
- Do some business.
- And there is my cue.

657
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,158
You boys discuss the money.
Call me when you want to discuss linens.

658
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,393
Okay, fellas, I'm in.

659
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,198
- And we'll do it your way.
- It's the only way we could do it.

660
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,269
You guys were right.
At the end of the day...

661
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,829
...it's good food, good people
coming together.

662
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,594
- Tonight was a good start.
- Apparently.

663
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,039
Thanks.

664
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,113
- Luke, what is so important that...?
- We can't do this anymore.

665
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,508
Excuse me?

666
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,516
You're breaking up with me?

667
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,955
It's just...
It's not a good idea.

668
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,350
And it never could've worked.

669
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,759
You're right.

670
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,638
Well, okay.

671
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,798
Right.

672
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,389
Okay.

673
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,388
Hi, Cal. It's me.

674
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,313
When you're ready for that date,
let me know.

675
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,114
Can't believe they're watching
<i>The Valley</i> after all that.

676
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,396
Hey, Summer says it's addictive.

677
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,393
So is it okay if I hang out in here?
Not watching TV?

678
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,993
Yeah, sure.

679
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,912
So did you have fun tonight?

680
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,833
Watching you get kicked
out of a club? Twice?

681
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,231
- Yeah, actually, I kind of did.
- You were pretty good with the bouncer.

682
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,719
- Impressed?
- I kind of was.

683
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,599
- See, I think I should be the brains.
- No. Seth's the brains.

684
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,752
- Well, you're clearly not the beauty.
- And now someone's the bitch.

685
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,394
- Oh, really? Okay.
- Yeah.

686
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,119
Hey, hey.

687
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,039
- Come on, fight back.
- All right.

688
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,316
- I win.
- Yeah. Yeah, you win.

689
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,391
I'll be right back.

690
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,235
- Hey, Mrs. Cohen. Is Ryan around?
- Yeah. He's in the pool house.

691
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,039
- Luke.
- It's over.

692
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,270
- I'm done having sex with Julie Cooper.
- Okay.

693
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,992
Marissa.

694
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,119
- You...
- Okay. Wait, wait. Just stop.

695
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,429
Marissa.

696
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,991
- So that's why you took me to L.A.?
- I didn't want you to find out.

697
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,718
Not like this.

698
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,831
I've gotta go.
