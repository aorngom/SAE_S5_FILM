1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,036
I'm your big brother.
If I don't teach you this, who will?

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,428
- I don't know, Trey.
- Quit being a little bitch! Get in!

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,559
Yeah! Let's go!

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,639
Get in!

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,755
Come on, let's go, Ryan!

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,429
You know, you should
see your face, man!

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,995
No! No!

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,709
Let me see those hands! Let's go!

9
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,358
Hands up! Get them up! On the dash,
where I can see them. Let's go.

10
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,074
Ryan. Sandy Cohen.

11
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,152
The court's appointed me
your public defender.

12
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,077
You could do worse. You okay?
They treating you all right?

13
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,390
Where's my brother?

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,358
Trey is over 18. Trey stole a car.

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,796
Trey had a gun in his pants, an ounce
of pot in his jacket, a couple of priors.

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,713
I'm guessing right now
Trey is looking at three to five years.

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,438
But Trey's not my concern.

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,192
This is your first time in lockup.

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,635
I'm assuming you don't plan
on coming back.

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,473
Your grades are not great.

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,110
Suspended twice for fighting,
truancy three times.

22
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,317
Your test scores.
Ninety-eighth percentile on your SAT I's.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,158
Ryan, 98th percentile.
If you start going to class...

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,880
Are you thinking about college?

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,679
Have you given any thought at all
to your future?

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,196
Dude, I'm on your side.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,713
Help me out here, give...

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,159
Modern medicine is advancing to the point
where the average life span will be 100.

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,553
But I read this article which said Social
Security is supposed to run out by 2025...

30
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,794
...which means people are gonna
have to stay in their jobs until they're 80.

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,590
So I don't want to commit
to anything too soon.

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,435
Look, I can plea this down
to a misdemeanor. Petty fine, probation.

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,160
But stealing a car because
your big brother told you to...

34
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,639
...it's stupid and it's weak.

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,756
Those are two things
you can't afford to be anymore.

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,592
- Two more things.
- Want to change that?

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,479
Then get over the fact
that life dealt you a bad hand.

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,200
I get it. We're cut
from the same deck, Ryan.

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,638
I grew up with no money, my father
was gone, my mother worked all the time.

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,030
I was pissed off, I was stupid.

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,838
Look at you now.

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,151
Smart kid like you, you gotta
have a plan, some kind of a dream.

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,958
Yeah. Right.

44
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,198
Let me tell you something, okay?

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,875
Where I'm from, having a dream
doesn't make you smart.

46
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,270
Knowing it won't come true?

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,039
That does.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,792
My office will contact you
to remind you of your hearing date.

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,871
I'll remember.

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,751
Unbelievable.
What kind of family I got, huh?

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,879
What the hell did I do to deserve
this family? You want to tell me that?

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,112
Mrs. Atwood? I'm Sandy Cohen.
I'm Ryan's attorney.

53
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,350
You should have let him rot in there.

54
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,672
Just like his dad's doing,
and just like his brother's gonna.

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,071
Let's go, Ryan.

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,592
Now, Ryan!

57
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,477
I'm gonna give you my card
and my home number.

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,156
You know, if you need somebody,
if things get to be too much...

59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,709
...call me.

60
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,469
- Let's go!
- All right.

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,353
I can't do this anymore, Ryan.

62
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,272
I can't.

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,353
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I want you out of my house.

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,669
- I want you out.
- But, Mom, where am I gonna go?

65
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,798
- You heard your mother, man. Get out.
- This isn't your house, man.

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,716
- Oh, you a tough guy now?
- A.J., don't. Ryan, just get out.

67
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,634
You should worry about your own kids
instead of freeloading off my mom.

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,756
Hey. Can I crash with you tonight?

69
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,475
Yeah, all right. Fine.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,028
I need a place to crash tonight.
I already tried it. I already tried it!

71
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,878
I told you. You could do worse.

72
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,192
This is a nice car. I didn't know
your kind of lawyer made money.

73
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,828
No, we don't.

74
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,592
My wife does.

75
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,834
Good evening, Mr. Cohen.

76
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,634
You know, why don't you
wait here for a minute. I'll be back.

77
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,913
It's no fun if the key's in the car.

78
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,239
- <i>T- shirt and bumper stickers</i>
<i>from the radio station.</i>

79
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,036
<i>You brought him home?</i>

80
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,115
- This is not a stray puppy, Sandy.
- I know that, Kirsten.

81
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,989
It was only a matter of time before
you started bringing home felons.

82
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,913
- Ryan's not a felon.
- Did you not meet him in jail?

83
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,073
Yes, technically.
But it wasn't for a felony.

84
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,390
It was, but it won't be when I'm done.

85
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,870
You're endangering our home.
Did you even think of Seth?

86
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,918
It's only for the weekend.
Till Child Services opens on Monday.

87
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,595
What if this is all a scam?
What if he's using you to case the house?

88
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,637
He's not a criminal mastermind.

89
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,155
He's a kid who has no one,
and nowhere to go.

90
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,835
- When did you become so cynical?
- When did you become so self-righteous?

91
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,310
I've always been self-righteous.

92
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,550
- You used to find it charming.
- He sleeps in the pool house.

93
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,996
- Where you going?
- To put my jewelry in the vault.

94
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,915
Where do you think I'm going?

95
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,789
The boy's gonna need fresh sheets...

96
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,838
...and towels and a toothbrush.

97
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,672
- Who are you?
- Whoever you want me to be.

98
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,153
Okay.

99
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,630
Hey, can I bum a cigarette?

100
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,115
So, what are you doing here? Seriously.

101
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,039
Seriously?

102
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,791
I stole a car.

103
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,349
Crashed it.

104
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,595
Actually, my brother did.

105
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,196
Since he had a gun and drugs on him,
he's in jail.

106
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,912
I got out, then my mom threw me out.
She was pissed off and drunk.

107
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,558
So Mr. Cohen took me in.

108
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,673
You're their cousin from Boston, right?

109
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,879
Right.

110
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,634
- Hi, Marissa.
- Hey, Mr. Cohen.

111
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,234
I was just meeting your nephew.

112
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,510
My favorite nephew, Ryan.

113
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,796
All the way from Seattle.

114
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,119
- Seattle.
- Dad lives there. Mom lives in Boston.

115
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,396
So we're all really excited about your
fashion show fundraiser tomorrow.

116
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,516
Really? You are?

117
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,917
No.

118
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,837
Come on, let's go.

119
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,114
Hey, you should come by, check it out.
If you don't have other plans.

120
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,679
- See you.
- Good night.

121
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,438
Who's that kid?

122
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,676
Let's go inside.

123
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,388
There's no smoking in this house.

124
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,116
So this is where you'll be staying.

125
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,953
And this is the queen
of the manor herself, my wife, Kirsten.

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,078
Hello, Ryan. Welcome to our home.

127
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,835
If you need anything,
Rosie here can help you.

128
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,989
Thank you. Thanks very much.

129
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,148
We'll see you in the morning.
Make yourself comfortable.

130
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,198
Hey.

131
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,432
Hey.

132
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,231
Do you wanna play?

133
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,352
Looks like someone's trying to be
a hero, but he got a little cocky.

134
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,830
What happened to your head, dude?
Where did it go?

135
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,274
I'm sorry. Did someone die?

136
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,718
Hey, want to play "Grand Theft Auto"?
It's pretty cool. You can steal cars and...

137
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,277
Not that that's cool.

138
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,079
- Or uncool, I don't know...
- I see you two have met.

139
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,550
Seth, what are you doing inside
on this beautiful day?

140
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,632
- Why don't you show Ryan around?
- Because it's so great around here.

141
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,028
There's so much to do, Dad.

142
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,191
I don't know,
what do you want to do?

143
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,995
What do you guys do around here?

144
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,594
I have this plan.
I don't know what you'll think.

145
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,116
But next July the trade winds shift west,
and I want to sail to Tahiti.

146
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,352
I could do it in 44 days,
maybe even 42.

147
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,033
Wow, that...

148
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,317
- That sounds really cool, man.
- Yeah.

149
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,392
You just hit the high seas...

150
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,189
...and catch fish off the side of the boat,
grill them right there.

151
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,791
Just total quiet.

152
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,793
Solitude.

153
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,512
- You won't get Ionely?
- Well, I'll have Summer with me.

154
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,550
You're gonna take this to Tahiti?

155
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,589
No.

156
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,993
It's the girl the boat's named after.

157
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,151
She must be pretty stoked.

158
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,956
Yeah. She has no idea.
I've never talked to her before.

159
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,079
Hey, fellas.

160
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,676
I thought we'd head over
to the fashion show at 7.

161
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,239
Yeah. Have fun.

162
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,871
- Come on. It's a whole new school year.
- It's also the same kids, Dad.

163
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,157
Why do they need a fashion show?
Every day is a fashion show for them.

164
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,993
Ryan has to go. Marissa invited him.

165
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,548
Marissa invited you?

166
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,678
I've lived next door
to Marissa since, like, forever.

167
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,796
Her dad almost got married to my mom.

168
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,315
And she's never even invited me
to a birthday.

169
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,155
That is not true.
They did not almost get married.

170
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,515
Maybe Summer would be there.

171
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,752
That's interesting.
She is Marissa's best friend.

172
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,030
- Seven?
- Seven.

173
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,511
- Hello again.
- My dad's not here.

174
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,797
- When can we expect him?
- I don't know.

175
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,232
Well, when you see your father...

176
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,949
...please remind him again
how much we'd like to talk.

177
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,590
Let me leave you another one
of my cards.

178
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,352
Have a good day.

179
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,112
Hey.

180
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,398
Thanks, kiddo. I just didn't have time
to deal with those guys right now.

181
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,431
Who are they?

182
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,472
Suits.

183
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,631
Bureaucrats.

184
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,195
The Man.

185
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,837
But, I mean, everything's okay, right?

186
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,993
Yeah. It's just a...
Just a thing with a client.

187
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,354
Nothing for you to worry about, okay?

188
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,909
Wow, look at that.
It fits you beautifully.

189
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,752
Where's your tie?

190
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,435
I'm not gonna wear one.
Open collar, it's a good look.

191
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,798
I didn't know how to tie a tie till
I was 25. Come on, give me your tie.

192
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,436
Button your top button.

193
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,439
All right. Collar up.

194
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,479
The skinny side has got to be shorter
than the fat side.

195
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,393
How much shorter,
it changes tie to tie.

196
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,233
Sometimes it's just a mystery.

197
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,558
All right.

198
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,994
So you got to hang out with Seth.

199
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,513
How was that? Was that...?

200
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,875
Was that all right?

201
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,191
He's an interesting kid
if you get to know him.

202
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,152
He's cool.

203
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,958
Cool, huh?

204
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,111
All right.

205
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,752
There we go. Turn around.

206
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,558
Look at you.

207
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,231
Beats a jumpsuit.

208
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,191
Oh, Mom, do you like my nails?

209
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,639
I love them, Kaitlin. Do you like my hair
this straight, or is it too Avril Lavigne?

210
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,518
No, it looks good, Mom.

211
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,636
Marissa, you look...

212
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,473
Oh, honey, I thought
you were gonna wear your hair down.

213
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,108
Pulled back like that,
it's harsh on your angles.

214
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,077
Okay. Let's go.

215
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,719
It's gonna be so amazing tonight.

216
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,678
Are you gonna wear the Donna Karan,
Mariss? It's very forgiving.

217
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,592
You look beautiful, kiddo.

218
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,554
Mushroom-leek crescent?
Crab-and-brie filo?

219
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,749
Welcome to the dark side.

220
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,709
So you must be the cousin from Boston.

221
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,317
I don't know how you do it. I could
just never live there. I hate the cold.

222
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,069
Do you like Seattle? I mean,
all that rain. Isn't it depressing?

223
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,959
Did I hear you were from Canada?

224
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,836
Yes, you did.

225
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,554
- Hi. Can I get a 7 and 7?
- Sure.

226
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,512
Thanks.

227
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,477
Thank you.

228
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,636
I want my husband
to be right about you.

229
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,030
- What's up? Lock it up, Nordlund.
- Lock it up, Luke.

230
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,079
Hey, Luke. What's up?

231
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,470
- Hey.
- Hey.

232
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,078
Suck it, queer.

233
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,353
My vacation was great too.
Thank you for asking about it.

234
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,311
Summer's right over there. Don't look.

235
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,358
You can look,
but don't look like you're looking.

236
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,238
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, guys.

237
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,436
Who is that?

238
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,309
The cousin? The pool boy?
I don't know.

239
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,835
Well, I'm gonna find out.

240
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,831
Is that Summer?

241
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,560
I'm gonna... I'm gonna sit.

242
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,320
Way to salt his game, Mr. Cohen.

243
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,510
Hello, Chester. Are these seats taken?

244
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,234
Okay.

245
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,353
So are you looking forward to your next
sailing lesson? You're making strides.

246
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,670
Okay. I'm glad we had
this little chance to catch up.

247
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,389
Thank you. Thank you.

248
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,795
Thank you all so much for coming.

249
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,509
Every year we do this to raise money
for the battered women's shelter.

250
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,716
It's such a good cause, you guys.

251
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,996
We couldn't do any of it
without your support...

252
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,197
...and the support of Fashion Island
and all their great stores.

253
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,920
All right, enjoy the show.

254
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,668
She's got Tahiti written all over her.

255
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,796
Has anybody seen
my Betsey Johnson dress?

256
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,112
All right. Oh, no.
Much too much makeup. Let's go.

257
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,874
What are you doing
putting my daughter in Calvin Klein?

258
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,598
She was supposed to wear
Vera Wang.

259
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,753
She would if she had the chest to hold
it up. It's called puberty. It'll happen.

260
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,797
Okay, girls, chop-chop, showtime.

261
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,357
Marissa, you're next.

262
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,357
Look what I stole!

263
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,272
Look what I stole!

264
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,830
- All right! Here.
- Thanks.

265
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,830
She's so beautiful, you guys.

266
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,719
You spent more on that dress
than I make in a year.

267
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,998
That's why we trust him with our money.
I expect to die a very rich man.

268
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,549
You're bound to be half-right.

269
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,599
You okay, Jimmy?

270
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,197
Yeah. It's just...
It's a little stuffy in here.

271
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,079
Honey, I'm gonna get
some fresh air, okay?

272
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,595
Marissa wanted to wear
these Prada Mary Janes...

273
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,638
...but I told her she had to wear
the stiletto Manolos.

274
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,911
Hey, where are you going?

275
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,433
My friend Holly... Well, her parents are
letting us use their beach house...

276
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,558
...as a gift because of all our hard work
for charity.

277
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,914
If you need a ride...

278
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,753
...or anything...

279
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,751
...I'm Summer.

280
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,993
- Hey, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

281
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,879
We should go to that party
at that girl Holly's place.

282
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,759
- No, that's not really for us.
- Summer invited me.

283
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,476
Really? She did?

284
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,631
Us. She...
She asked for you, actually.

285
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,510
Really? She did?

286
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,192
Come on!

287
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,710
That makes absolutely no sense,
but, yes, we should go.

288
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,871
We're gonna go with them.
Thanks, guys.

289
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,629
If it sucks, we can always bail.

290
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,590
Welcome to the dark side.

291
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,198
Oh, hey, cocaine. That's awesome.

292
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,478
- Is that a new purse?
- Yeah.

293
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,949
- So cute.
- Does your dad ever say no?

294
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,317
Hey. Look who I brought.

295
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,070
He's cute.

296
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,433
I'm gonna play him hot and cold.

297
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,551
You wanna pee? I've gotta pee.

298
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,593
Isn't it, like, so beautiful?
The sand and the water.

299
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,752
Yeah. Hey, you want to go check it out?

300
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,556
But what about Marissa?

301
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,870
Oh, no worries.

302
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,556
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey.

303
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,358
Hey, Dustin.

304
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,431
Dustin, look who's here.

305
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,199
- Are you really okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

306
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,955
- Because you can always...
- I've just been working really hard.

307
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,279
So who was that kid
that you brought tonight?

308
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,034
You have a cousin from Boston?

309
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,992
One of Sandy's clients.
He brought him home for the weekend.

310
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,911
Jimmy? Honey, did you get my fro-yo?

311
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,636
No. I forgot.

312
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,316
All right, I'll go back.

313
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,274
Pistachio. Thanks, sweetie. Hi, Kirsten.

314
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,838
Fro-yo.

315
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,633
Did you ever think
this would be our lives?

316
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,830
- Is Marissa back yet?
- Well, she usually stays out pretty late.

317
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,236
Well, Seth never goes out.

318
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,273
Don't worry.

319
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,759
I'm sure they're not
doing anything we didn't do.

320
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,873
That's comforting.

321
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,913
I'm sorry. I should really learn to knock...

322
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,398
...in case there's a threesome
going on in the bathroom.

323
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,196
Fresh keg! Everybody get naked!

324
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,313
Hey.

325
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,999
- Hey.
- So, what do you think of Newport?

326
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,437
I think I can get in less trouble
where I'm from.

327
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,677
Hey, Coop, it's your turn to deal.

328
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,950
You have no idea.

329
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,790
I fixed the keg. Fine, more for me.

330
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,117
Look who I found.

331
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,551
I'm wasted.

332
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,638
- So, what's your name anyway?
- Ryan.

333
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,189
Ryan.

334
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,233
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me.

335
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,675
What are you doing?
I named my boat after her.

336
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,638
What? Who are you?

337
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,677
It's not what you think.
She's drunk.

338
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,478
Come on.

339
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,354
- Seth, Seth.
- Don't touch me!

340
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,715
You know what,
why don't you just go back to Chino?

341
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,350
I'm sure there's a really nice car
in the parking lot that you could steal.

342
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,077
Chino?

343
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,395
- Go home, geek.
- Who invited you, suck-ass?

344
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,355
You guys really wouldn't hurt me,
because that would be so clich Ád.

345
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,750
- I guess you're fans of the clich Á.
- Shut up.

346
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,276
Hey, put him down! Put him down.

347
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,079
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

348
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,594
Put him down.

349
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,354
Hey, what's up, dude?
You got a problem?

350
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,717
You tell me.

351
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,149
Welcome to the O.C., bitch.

352
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,914
This is how it's done in Orange County.

353
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,674
Well...

354
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,875
...I don't know what to say...

355
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,719
...except that you totally
had my back out there.

356
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,999
You were, like, out of <i>Fight Club</i>
or something. I don't know.

357
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,071
You know what I think?

358
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,152
Ryan, I think that if you were
to teach me some moves...

359
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,437
...I think that we could
totally take them next time.

360
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,070
A little bit of that, you know what
I mean? And a little bit of that, that.

361
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,550
What do you think about that? Yeah.

362
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,317
Oh, also, that wasn't exactly the way
that I first planned to talk to Summer...

363
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,040
...but I'm now on her radar.

364
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,590
Do you think I should tell her
about Tahiti? Do you?

365
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,911
- Not yet.
- That's what I thought.

366
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,198
That's what I was thinking. I wanted
to make sure we were on the same page.

367
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,748
What a little night we had there.

368
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,351
I'm not gonna forget it.
Ryan, I'm not gonna forget that one.

369
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,669
- I can't believe her!
- She's so retarded sometimes.

370
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,355
Shouldn't her boyfriend be doing this?
He's so worthless.

371
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,030
Coop! Where are your keys?
How are we gonna find her keys?

372
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,878
I can't find her keys.

373
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,310
We can't wake her parents.
Her dad will go ballistic.

374
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,118
I know.

375
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,072
Bye, Coop.

376
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,551
Call us.

377
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,798
Hey.

378
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,271
Get your keys.

379
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,473
Thank God.

380
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,596
- What happened to your face?
- I got into a fight.

381
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,311
- With who? Why?
- I don't really know. I don't remember.

382
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,711
I was really drunk.
I think I still am a little bit.

383
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,792
Let's go. House. Now.

384
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,076
You should have seen the waves coming
in. Six foot, and it was going off.

385
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,515
- Seth got into a fight.
- He did?

386
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,514
This is what happens when you let
our son hang out with criminals.

387
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,309
At least he has someone to hang out
with. Don't salt his game, honey.

388
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,518
- What the hell does that mean?
- It... I don't know.

389
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,148
I just know I'd rather have Seth
hanging out with Ryan...

390
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,594
...than some trust-fund kid...

391
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,149
...who only cares about getting
a new Beemer every year.

392
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,471
There's a whole world outside
this Newport Beach bubble.

393
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,596
You don't seem to mind
living in this bubble.

394
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,991
I know there's something else
out there.

395
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,957
Remember when we were 22?
What'd you say?

396
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,078
That you'd never be like your parents,
you'd never have their life.

397
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,199
I was 22. I stank of patchouli
and lived in the back of a mail truck.

398
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,396
And you were fun.

399
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,790
And rebellious and...

400
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,991
You married me.

401
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,718
I can't. I'm sorry.

402
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,078
I don't want this kid
in my house anymore.

403
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,269
Where's he supposed to go?

404
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,908
He has a family, Sandy.

405
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,595
It's not up to you to decide
whether or not they're good enough.

406
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,875
Look, Ryan, I don't mean to play bad cop.
It's nothing personal.

407
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,952
Is that bacon?

408
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,714
I usually make breakfast at my house.

409
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,074
My mom's not much of a cook, so...

410
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,309
- I'm sorry. You seem like a really nice kid.
- It's okay.

411
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,198
I get it.

412
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,310
You have a really nice family.

413
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,072
Hey, man.

414
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,668
- Hey.
- Hi. So I gotta jet.

415
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,911
You're leaving?

416
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,033
So...

417
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,113
So, what's up?

418
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,514
I gotta go back, try to figure
some stuff out back home.

419
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,193
Okay, well...

420
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,758
Cool.

421
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,954
Not cool, but,
you know what I think I mean.

422
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,871
Come here.

423
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,511
I'll come down to Chino. I'll visit you,
and you can show me your world...

424
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,716
...or, you know, "'hood" or...

425
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,631
All right.

426
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,712
Wait a second. Just wait one second.

427
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,996
Maybe there's someplace
you'll want to go.

428
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,271
It's pretty good for ideas.

429
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,393
Okay.

430
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,635
So thanks...

431
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,199
...for everything.

432
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,796
I'm gonna make sure
everything works out, Ryan.

433
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,113
It's okay. I can take it from here.

434
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,474
Come on. Let's go.
