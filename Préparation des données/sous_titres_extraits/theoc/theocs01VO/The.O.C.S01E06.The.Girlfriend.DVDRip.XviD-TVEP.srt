00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,316
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,833
My dad is in real-estate development.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,228
You guys built the mall?

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,877
I'm in charge of residential development.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,759
- Ryan and I aren't here together.
- We're done.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,876
Go after her, tell her how you feel.
It's easy.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,632
Do you want to do something tonight?

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,028
I'm taking you with me.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,237
You can start over.
You can start a new life.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,834
Or I see you and the girls
in about eight to 10 years.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,353
Who's the bitch?

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,192
Call an ambulance, somebody!

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,914
You're gonna be okay.

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,989
Are we worried your dad won't love us
if we don't feed him enough?

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,754
All right. Starting now,
no more digs at my dad.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,797
Honey, that wasn't a dig. Seth?

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,157
No. When you called him
a heartless bastard, that was a dig.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,470
You sold me out.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,919
See, they're like puppets
and I'm the puppet master.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,310
World domination to follow.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,711
Maybe you guys can make peace
this weekend.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,199
Okay.

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,033
Oh, no, wait. We can't.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,668
- Why?
- I'm still Jewish.

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,912
Just getting it out of my system,
I promise.

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,108
- I wonder what his new girlfriend's like.
- I am sure she is very well-paid.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,235
I am on fire.

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,072
Look at you, you're wired.

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,959
Seeing your parents should make
you feel guilt, not terror.

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,156
Don't forget, I'm also her boss.

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,469
Dad.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,997
Speak of the devil, and the devil,
he doth appear. <i>Shalom</i>, Sandy.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,030
- How long have you been here?
- Not long.

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,634
The Learjet got here quick.
I used my key to get in.

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,597
So, Caleb, where's your new girlfriend?

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,433
She's taking a swim.
Where's my grandson?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,595
So your grandpa,
he basically owns Newport, right?

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,753
Yes. And, like you, he comes from humble
beginnings. You'll probably hit it off.

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,592
I burned down one of his homes.

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,673
But it was an accident. He owns a million
of them. It's not even on his radar.

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,513
Hey, seriously, do not worry about it.
Okay, look.

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,559
He lets Mom run the company, he's got
a brand-new girlfriend, he's very mellow.

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,153
- Seth.
- Hey.

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,912
Hey.

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,959
How you doing?

46
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,111
You're still not a football player.

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,989
Yes. No. But thank you.
Grandpa, meet my friend Ryan.

48
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,594
This is the kid that
burned down my house.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,557
Come on.

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,438
So you gotta see my pictures
from Spain.

51
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,593
And you've got to promise me to go
to Barcelona while you're still young.

52
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,877
You wanna take those
and put them around by the grill?

53
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,473
Hey.

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,194
- Hi.
- Hi.

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,873
I'm Gabrielle.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,154
I'm with Caleb.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,229
Oh, my God,
that could be my grandma.

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,229
Is it twisted to find
my potential grandma really hot?

59
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,520
Not when she looks like that.

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,432
- Gabrielle.
- Yeah?

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,239
We're gonna sit, drink some wine,
catch up.

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,958
Okay. Do you want me to...?

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,238
Hang out in the sun. Get some color.
Try to stay out of trouble.

64
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,636
Can I join you guys?

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,109
- Yeah. No...
- Yeah, come on...

66
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,118
It's warm.

67
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,237
So, what's up?

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,119
- We were... We were talking about the...
- You were...

69
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,157
He was telling me about the thing.

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,995
So this birthday party for Caleb,
it's, like, a who's who of Newport?

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,071
Should be wild, huh?

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,314
- I'm being sarcastic.
- We don't get a lot of that around here.

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,833
So who are you guys bringing?

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,230
- I would say no one, really.
- Yeah. The same.

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,710
You're kidding, right?
There are no girls you wanna bring?

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,791
Two young, hot guys like yourselves?

77
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,396
- Are you still being sarcastic?
- No.

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,189
- Her name is Summer.
- And? Did you invite her yet?

79
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,716
- It's not that simple, I mean...
- She can't say yes if you don't ask her.

80
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,554
That is very wise, Gabby.

81
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,469
- What about you?
- Did you ask Marissa?

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,995
I haven't talked to her.
I don't think she'll want to.

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,957
And why not?

84
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,556
Her family's kind of falling apart...

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,996
...she's got this boyfriend she may be
back with. It's a long story.

86
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,674
- They've been going out since fifth grade.
- Fifth grade?

87
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,753
Okay, she needs to change it up. She's
known that guy since he was eating paste.

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,473
I think he still does.

89
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,196
Hey, babe. You decent?

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,430
Hey. What are you doing here?

91
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,956
I just came from the doctor's,
got my stitches out.

92
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,599
Thought we could hit the beach.

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,957
Don't you think it's too soon?
You should probably go home and rest.

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,112
No, no. That's all I've been doing.

95
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,032
Luke, you got shot.

96
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,633
Yeah, I know.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,719
I know how lucky I am
to have a second chance.

98
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,792
That's why I don't wanna
waste any more time.

99
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,752
What do you mean?

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,954
I've been an idiot. I never should have
broken up with you in the first place.

101
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,554
And now, with everything
that's going on with your dad...

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,632
The thing is, you were there for me
when I was in the hospital.

103
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,439
And now I wanna be here for you.

104
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,832
It's all just been so crazy.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,197
I just wish we could be together,
like it was.

106
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,037
I... I don't know.

107
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,713
You don't have to.
I mean, we can take it slow.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,117
Tell you what.
Let's just hang out here today.

109
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,239
We'll sit by the pool or
watch a movie or something.

110
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,111
Whatever you want.

111
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,873
Okay.

112
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,909
Gabrielle, she seems...

113
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,957
She's 24.

114
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,553
I'm sorry?

115
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,473
Oh, she seems so mature for her age.

116
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,119
These birthday festivities,
we're keeping them small, right?

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,592
- It depends what you mean by "small."
- Just the family, the four of us. Gabrielle.

118
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,716
Right. The four of us.

119
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,952
Gabrielle, Ryan
and 150 of your closest friends.

120
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,192
Cal, she's been working overtime on this.
The menus, the invitations.

121
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,112
On top of all her other work.

122
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,236
- Is it too much?
- No. Work is great.

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,995
- The new development's back on track.
- After your boy nearly burned it down.

124
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,991
We've had setbacks, but the insurance
more than covered the damages.

125
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,472
I hear you've commissioned an architect
I've never approved to do the redesign.

126
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,279
Yes, but I would never build
without consulting you.

127
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,715
Honey, you don't need my approval.

128
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,312
After all, you adopted the boy
without consulting me.

129
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,112
I would have called you about Ryan,
but there wasn't enough time.

130
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,477
I'm pushing you too hard.
Things are slipping through the cracks.

131
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,713
Which is why I've decided to
scale back your responsibilities.

132
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,633
- You're demoting me?
- I wanna get more involved.

133
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,475
Give you a chance to spend a bit more
time with your new family, your new son.

134
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,996
Now, then.
Tell me all about Jimmy Cooper.

135
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,310
Son of a bitch lost $4 million?

136
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,077
I took Kaitlin by the stables
to say goodbye to China.

137
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,915
Guess she won't be
needing these anymore.

138
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,040
You know, I think China
was her best friend.

139
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,794
- China's a horse.
- Maybe to you.

140
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,030
Hey, you know...

141
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,438
- I don't feel good about this.
- Well, you shouldn't.

142
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,037
What do you...?
What do you want from me?

143
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,272
I think I want a divorce.

144
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,199
I'm sorry, honey.

145
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,476
I just don't see any other way.

146
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,998
- Hey.
- I was on my way to work.

147
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,469
- We hadn't talked in a while.
- I was gonna call you.

148
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,519
No, it's cool. So Kirsten's dad's
in town, they're having this...

149
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,159
Hey.

150
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,950
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing, man?

151
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,599
Fine.

152
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,471
Yeah, I never got a chance to
thank you for taking me to the hospital...

153
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,870
...and giving Marissa a call.

154
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,671
Yeah, no problem.

155
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,673
Do you have some aspirin?
My arm's killing me from the stitches.

156
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,755
- Yeah, check in my parents' bathroom.
- All right, thanks. Hey, take it easy, guy.

157
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,273
So, what's going on?

158
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,031
I was gonna see if you wanted to...

159
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,518
I was gonna see how you were doing.

160
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,069
You seem to be doing good...

161
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,555
...so I'm gonna get to work. Later.

162
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,193
Hey.

163
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,872
Hi.

164
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,871
Seth and Caleb are sailing.

165
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,515
I've never seen two people
more excited about boats.

166
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,951
Seth said you worked here,
and I could use a cocktail.

167
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,190
- I can't serve you.
- Right. You're not legal.

168
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,156
- How about a cranberry juice?
- That I can do.

169
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,590
From the flight. I hate flying.

170
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,469
- You?
- I've never been on a plane.

171
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,278
My first time, I was 15.

172
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,512
My mother sent me to Japan
all by myself to do some modeling.

173
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,713
She figured it was easier
than her having to get a job.

174
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,713
- I can relate.
- I've heard.

175
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,870
So how'd the modeling thing turn out?

176
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,828
Well, when you're a teenager and you're
living in a house with a bunch of girls...

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,992
...with no parents,
things can get a little insane.

178
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,155
By the time I got clean, I was 22,
retirement age.

179
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,275
You must think it's weird,
me with an older guy.

180
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,111
I live in a pool house.

181
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,469
So how did it work out with your girl?

182
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,874
- Paste-eater?
- They have a past.

183
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,192
Excuse me? More water.

184
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,990
Oh, Kirsten, come on, honey.

185
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,152
You could not have
done more or done better.

186
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,995
I just don't understand. I've worked
so hard for him. I've killed myself for him.

187
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,950
Well, the man is a bottomless pit of need.
You think you can fill it? You can't.

188
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,790
You're amazing.

189
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,155
If he can't appreciate you, screw him.

190
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,914
Quit. Quit.

191
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,709
You've never supported me working
for him. You've never liked him.

192
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,668
You're right. Not since our wedding day,
when you walked yourself down the aisle.

193
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,910
He was in Singapore.
There was a monsoon.

194
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,469
Baby, we changed the date three times
for his schedule.

195
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,074
He makes the world revolve around him,
including you.

196
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,196
Sandy, he's my dad.

197
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,636
He's ruining your life. Quit.

198
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,637
I can't.

199
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,592
So you're living in a pool house.
And then? So, what's next for you?

200
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,433
What's next for you?
Learjet to London, Paris in the fall?

201
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,828
Perhaps.

202
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,637
I'll be right back.

203
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,272
- Hi.
- Hey.

204
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,069
Got a minute?

205
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,878
What's up?

206
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,519
- I wanted to talk to you before, but...
- Luke was there.

207
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,159
Right.

208
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,675
He wants to get back together.

209
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,913
- What did you tell him?
- I told him I needed to think about it.

210
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,079
I don't know what I should do.

211
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,396
I don't know either.

212
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,474
I know. I just...

213
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,029
Look, if you came here for me
to help you choose...

214
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,078
- Of course not...
- Good.

215
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,758
Why don't you just let me know
when you've made up your mind. Okay?

216
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,793
Okay.

217
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,350
If he'd just said something.
I mean, I just wanted him to say anything.

218
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,397
Well, you can't expect him
to choose, Coop.

219
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,518
He comes from a place where they have
knife fights, drag racing...

220
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,717
...and sex on the hood of a car.
- That's from <i>Fast and the Furious</i>.

221
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,599
- That movie was based on a true story.
- No, it wasn't.

222
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,594
Whatevs. All I'm saying is you have
to do the choosing, not him or Luke.

223
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,678
It's fate. It's destiny.
Look, we both like burritos.

224
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,831
You wanna eat somewhere else?

225
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,639
Who's winning right now,
me or my hair?

226
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,837
I'm gonna get us some salsa.

227
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,870
Hi, Summer.

228
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,712
Seth Cohen.

229
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,953
Could you give me a hand...

230
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,111
...over here?

231
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,118
Okay.

232
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,192
I... I know you gotta figure
some stuff out. I get that.

233
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,831
But in the meantime, there's this party
at... Well, it's for Seth's grandfather.

234
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,911
I know. I'm going.

235
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,196
Luke asked me this morning.

236
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,516
Cool. Well, I'll see
you and Luke tomorrow, then.

237
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,351
Yeah. See you.

238
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,599
Two salsa verdes. Aggressive.

239
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,796
Pico de gallo, that's a classic.

240
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,793
Holy jalape Ío. Somebody came to play.

241
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,599
Are there any napkins?

242
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,592
No.

243
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,671
- Lick it.
- What?

244
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,115
I just got my nails done.
It'll ruin the polish.

245
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,114
- You lick it.
- I don't like picante. It's for Marissa.

246
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,679
- Thanks.
- It's good.

247
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,718
Now, aren't you gonna invite me
to your grandpa's party?

248
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,190
I'm sorry, Summer,
could you please repeat that?

249
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,750
Your grandpa's having this
awesome party. It's at your house.

250
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,275
And I thought we were friends.

251
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,876
Wait a second. Do you want me to ask
you because you wanna go with me...

252
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,077
...or just because you wanna go?

253
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,072
Fair enough. I'll see you at 8.

254
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,640
- Hey.
- Hey. How was court?

255
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,475
I was distracted all day. I was thinking,
if you quit, know what we could do?

256
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,392
- I'm not quitting.
- Hear me out.

257
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,313
We could buy back our old house
in Berkeley.

258
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,516
You loved that house.
Seth loved that house.

259
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,875
That house had bad plumbing
and termites.

260
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,110
It was a fixer-upper we never got
to fix up.

261
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,269
I know.

262
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,637
We moved here because your mom
got sick. We never planned to stay.

263
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,349
If you quit, we could do anything
we want. We could go anywhere.

264
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,078
No, we can't.

265
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,552
Why not? Seth has been planning
his exodus from this place since he was 6.

266
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,994
Ryan wouldn't care.

267
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,357
You could get that little gallery
in Sausalito you've always dreamed of.

268
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,273
Or the Mission. You could put
your art history degree to use.

269
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,317
I haven't thought about
that gallery in years.

270
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,232
So...

271
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,191
...think about it.

272
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,599
Think about it.

273
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,672
Is this too slutty to wear
to an old guy's birthday party?

274
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,592
I don't want the dude
to have a coronary.

275
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,115
I can't believe
you're actually going with Seth.

276
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,159
Aloha? Caleb Nichol is, like,
the Donald Trump of the West.

277
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,753
Do you know how many hot, rich...

278
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,957
...twenty-something banker-brokers
are gonna be there?

279
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,953
A lot. And now I have someone
to introduce me to them.

280
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,793
- Isn't that a little mean to Seth?
- To who?

281
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,473
Kidding.

282
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,712
That was delicious, Kirsten.

283
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,030
Well, thank you.
I order from them all the time.

284
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,236
Less time at work,
more time for cooking.

285
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,790
Because there's no place Kirsten feels
more comfortable than in the kitchen.

286
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,599
- What? Mom can't even make cereal.
- Thanks, Seth.

287
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,035
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

288
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,235
You have a quick wit, Seth.
Amazing you're not better at skirt-chasing.

289
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,350
Well, if by "skirts" you mean girls,
in your outdated cowboy-speak...

290
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,274
...I have a little news for you. Turns out
somebody has a date to your party.

291
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,352
And it's not a big deal or anything,
but if you must know, Summer asked me.

292
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,957
- Summer. Summer's hot.
- You did not just say that.

293
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,680
- Say what?
- Just go, please.

294
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,432
You go.

295
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,231
What about you, Ryan?

296
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,948
Nope. Going by myself.

297
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,355
Caleb seems to be in good spirits.
He just finished a second bottle of merlot.

298
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,069
- Now would be a good time to talk to him.
- I'm not ready for that conversation.

299
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,832
What conversation?

300
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,911
- Got any grappa?
- Yeah.

301
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,548
- Are you adopting another kid?
- It's nothing.

302
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,473
- Actually, it's something.
- I've never known my daughter...

303
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,598
...to need someone to speak for her.
- Maybe you've never gotten to know her.

304
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,752
If you did, you'd know she's the best
thing that ever happened to your company.

305
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,309
You'd support her,
not demote her so she wants to quit.

306
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,596
- Is that true? You wanna quit?
- No...

307
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,955
- Kirsten.
- We were talking...

308
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,113
About selling this house and moving back
to Berkeley, like we'd always planned.

309
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,875
You're not serious. You're still
smoking the weed, aren't you?

310
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,678
- Dad...
- Dad, you smoke weed?

311
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,912
- Out, now. Private conversation.
- Ryan, guess who's a stoner.

312
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,752
Honey, don't be afraid of him.

313
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,310
You keep your mouth shut.
No one here cares what you think.

314
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,596
Don't talk to me like that
in my own house.

315
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,275
Whose house is this? Who built it?
Who paid for it?

316
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,158
- Dad.
- This is between you and me, Kiki.

317
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,958
You're gonna do what you want anyway.

318
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,715
- Should we maybe go?
- Adopting juvenile delinquents.

319
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,552
- Maybe let's just...
- Yeah, let's.

320
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,518
You're making a big deal of this.
It was nothing.

321
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,830
Doesn't sound like nothing.

322
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,757
In fact, thanks, Sandy,
for letting me know how she feels.

323
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,469
She would never tell me that.
She never tells me anything.

324
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,996
If you wanna quit, that's fine.
I'll expect your resignation tomorrow.

325
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,397
Now, then. The grappa.

326
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,029
So, Gabrielle, I heard Grandpa's taking
you on the helicopter tour tomorrow.

327
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,591
Yeah. He wants to show me
his Orange County empire.

328
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,036
- This game sucks.
- Let me see it.

329
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,674
Ryan, you've been playing
the pirate game?

330
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,796
That's a little bit minty.

331
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,236
- What else do you have?
- I'll go get you "Pro Skater 3." It's good.

332
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,476
Hey. We gotta go searching
for my dad's bong later, all right?

333
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,719
So...

334
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,598
...does he always yell like that?
- Pretty much.

335
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,470
He's the boss, and every relationship
is a business relationship to him.

336
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,632
Even yours?

337
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,470
He'll only ever really love one woman.

338
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,677
And she passed away years ago.

339
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,549
For now, he's just looking
to stay entertained...

340
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,594
...keep from being bored.

341
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,793
But aren't we all?

342
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,356
I am so bored.

343
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,429
- Do you think...?
- Don't think.

344
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,073
Gabrielle.

345
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,356
We're leaving. Now.

346
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,756
Back to the office.

347
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,871
- How's Gabrielle?
- I don't know.

348
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,792
Oh, really?

349
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,589
Okay, Ryan, let me present
exhibit A to you.

350
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,593
She opted to forgo sailing
to go to the Crab Shack?

351
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,838
So? Not everyone likes sailing.

352
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,434
Okay. Let's take it to exhibit B here.

353
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,991
Intense, some would even say smoldering,
eye contact at the table.

354
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,913
She was mad-dogging you.
And finally, the clincher...

355
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,548
...last night in the pool house,
she chose to sit on your bed...

356
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,517
...even though there was an empty chair.

357
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,229
Come on, boys, out of the pool.
Caterers are here. Time to get ready.

358
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,076
I would like some answers.

359
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,916
Yeah, okay, we hooked up.

360
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,080
- What?
- Isn't that what you were asking?

361
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,994
I noticed some heavy flirting, yes...

362
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,798
You hooked up with my grandma?

363
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,879
- Actually, that's kind of hot. How was it?
- No one can know about this.

364
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,031
I agree completely. How was it?

365
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,872
It was good.

366
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,988
Weird, but good.

367
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,993
- What about Marissa?
- What about her?

368
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,717
'73 Dom. Yes, that's his favorite.
Thank you.

369
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,958
Is there cilantro in that?

370
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,553
Great, he hates it.

371
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,230
I can't believe
you still went through with this.

372
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,393
I had no choice, even though you tried
to sabotage the entire weekend.

373
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,155
Honey, I'm sorry I jumped the gun
last night. Ready?

374
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,193
- Hello.
- Hi.

375
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,271
- Dad, you made it.
- How you doing?

376
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,431
- Disappointed?
- No.

377
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,636
- Sandy.
- Hey, happy birthday, Caleb.

378
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,314
- Can I get you a drink?
- Absolutely.

379
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,999
- Dad, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

380
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,118
- Look, about the other night...
- Just forget about it.

381
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,238
Just make sure that you let me know
when you plan to give notice...

382
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,198
...so that I can hire your replacement.
- Caleb.

383
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,118
Quite a party.

384
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,031
You look...

385
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,751
You clean up good.

386
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,516
Are you trying to get caught?

387
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,357
Find me later.

388
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,918
I wish Dad had come.

389
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,038
Why, so you could break up
another brawl?

390
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,031
Hi, how are you?

391
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,633
Hey, Summer.

392
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,630
You look... Yeah.

393
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,552
Hey, Marissa. Hi, Luke.

394
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,188
Cohen, how you doing?
It's good to see you.

395
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,796
- It is?
- So this is your place. It's beautiful.

396
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,190
- Thank you.
- Mariss, something to drink?

397
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,509
Sure.

398
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,874
Okay, he got shot in the arm,
not the head.

399
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,508
Come on.
Don't you wanna show me off?

400
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,873
I'm in private equity
and portfolio management.

401
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,838
Really? Private equity
and portfolio management.

402
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,639
Sounds fascinating.

403
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,557
It's a great party. Everybody seems
to be having a good time.

404
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,199
Almost everybody.

405
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,590
Look. Look, I...

406
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,389
I wish I could tell you I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

407
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,438
- Okay, worst apology ever.
- You know I'm no good at those.

408
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,797
Look, the important thing is,
it's out there. You spoke your mind.

409
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,871
No. You spoke my mind.

410
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,192
I thought we had an understanding.
I thought this was what we both wanted.

411
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,396
It is. It was.

412
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,994
You're backing down.
He's been doing this to you for years.

413
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,038
My dad isn't the reason we stayed here.

414
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,111
We are. We chose this.

415
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,079
If you're telling me that all this time
you've been unhappy...

416
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,708
...that this isn't what you want...

417
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,633
...then this is a much bigger conversation.

418
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,473
I've got Pilates.

419
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,915
- How's that going?
- It's great.

420
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,712
It's Jimmy.

421
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,557
Excuse me.

422
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,549
I told you not to come.
What the hell are you doing here?

423
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,393
I've got a plan, okay? Just take it easy.

424
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,312
A chance to go back to the way it was.

425
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,995
- You built a time machine?
- Caleb employs thousands of people.

426
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,792
None are more qualified than me.

427
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,078
How big a leap can it be from investing
in stocks to investing in real estate?

428
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,357
- You are not asking him for a job.
- Why not?

429
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,909
This whole community thinks
you're a criminal, Jimmy.

430
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,753
Caleb Nichol owns the community.
He'll feel the same.

431
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,673
The guy's loved me since I was a kid.
He taught me how to sail.

432
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,515
When I was a junior in high school, he
tried to convince me to propose to Kirsten.

433
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,638
Please. Don't even think
of talking to him.

434
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,273
Look, I'm sorry. But if there's a chance
that I can save this family...

435
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,317
...I'm gonna take it.

436
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,234
This party rocks.

437
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,960
- I cannot believe David Manperl's here.
- Who?

438
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,430
Senior vice president of the
wealth-management division at McKenna.

439
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,591
You know, the venture capitalist firm.

440
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,196
He manages wealth as a job.

441
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,271
I've been reading <i>Forbes</i>.

442
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,759
I see.

443
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,230
So you chose Luke, huh?

444
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,868
Chino didn't stand a chance.
I told you Luke was the one.

445
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,393
No, you didn't.

446
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,118
Well, I meant to.

447
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,595
You guys are all over each other.

448
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,354
- Did you...? Did it happen?
- No.

449
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,078
Well, his willpower is amazing.

450
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,515
- The fact that you two haven't had sex...
- Summer!

451
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,557
Coop, what more do you want?

452
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,838
He's beautiful, sweet,
totally crazy about you.

453
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,036
What are you waiting for?

454
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,431
I don't know.

455
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,559
Well, you better figure it out, because
he's not gonna be able to wait forever.

456
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,229
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

457
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,833
Somebody's hiding.

458
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,877
No, I'm just...

459
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,632
Bored.

460
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,229
Me too.

461
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,913
I've heard.

462
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,871
- She's just a girl.
- I know.

463
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,431
- So why are you hiding from her?
- I'm not.

464
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,150
I don't believe you.

465
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,068
- Still bored?
- Not so much.

466
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,831
Sorry. I... I thought...

467
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,232
Sorry.

468
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,036
I've just been surfing...

469
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,236
Hey, babe, I was looking...

470
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,312
- Let's go.
- Yeah, okay.

471
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,077
We could go to my place.
My parents went to Palm Springs.

472
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,310
Yeah, sure. Great.

473
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,676
Pharmaceuticals. Isn't that the
largest-growing industry in North America?

474
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,598
Remember the old days, Jimmy?
Where's the time gone?

475
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,479
Great to see you again, as always.

476
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,674
Hey. Congratulations.
Looks like you got yourself a job.

477
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,717
Oh, yeah.
Caleb couldn't have been nicer...

478
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,314
...when he said there was no way
he could hire me.

479
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,709
- Well, hate to say I told you so.
- No, you don't.

480
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,591
Where are you going?

481
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,032
To finish what you started.

482
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,232
- Happy birthday, Cal.
- Julie. Thank you.

483
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,277
I'll call you next week.

484
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,113
- How are you?
- Well, I'm sure you've heard.

485
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,319
- Kirsten's brought you up to speed.
- I'm really sorry. About everything.

486
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,791
I really liked your husband.

487
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,791
Soon to be ex-husband.

488
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,469
Can't expect me to stay with him, not
after he's lied to me, left us with nothing.

489
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,275
- Nothing?
- Yeah.

490
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,159
I suppose I'll have to get a job now,
doing God knows what.

491
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,311
It's not like I have
any marketable skills.

492
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,993
Well, I'm sure that's not true.

493
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,517
You know, if there's anything
that I can do for you or the girls...

494
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,638
You're very, very sweet.
And very busy.

495
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,470
I just wanted to say happy birthday.

496
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,710
I'm never too busy for you.

497
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,553
We'll have dinner,
figure something out.

498
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,278
I'd like that.

499
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,833
Thank you.

500
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,352
Hey. What are you doing?
I need you to introduce me...

501
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,671
- Okay. You know what, Summer? No.
- What?

502
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,877
This whole night, all you've done
is use me to meet rich older guys.

503
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,430
That's not true.

504
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,992
Okay. Maybe a little.

505
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,630
Do you have any idea how pathetic it is
to listen to you talk about mergers...

506
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,394
...while some guy
just stares at your boobs?

507
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,552
- Which guy was staring at my boobs?
- Who cares?

508
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,872
The point is, if that guy doesn't know you,
he doesn't care about who you really are.

509
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,271
He has no idea that every day
of third grade you shared your lunch...

510
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,352
...with a skinny squirrel whose nuts
were stolen by a fat squirrel.

511
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,714
I hated that mean squirrel.

512
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,997
None of those guys were there
when you read your poem aloud in class...

513
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,152
...and your hand was shaking
because you were nervous.

514
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,550
Poem? What poem?

515
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,990
"I Wish I Was a Mermaid."

516
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,956
You remember that?

517
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,190
That was, like, sixth grade.

518
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,831
<i>I wish I was a mermaid</i>
<i>And...</i>

519
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,676
<i>Was friends with all the fish</i>
<i>A shiny tail and seashells, that's</i>...

520
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,228
<i>What I would wish</i>

521
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,316
Oh, I gotta go.

522
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,359
There's that investment banker
from Woodward and McDonnough.

523
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,309
It's okay. I'll introduce myself.

524
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,559
The greatest party ever.

525
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,509
- She has no intention of quitting.
- Doesn't sound that way to me.

526
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,150
Well, I wish she would,
so we could get the hell away from you.

527
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,878
- Lf you're looking for a fight...
- Save it.

528
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,715
We both know you're punishing her
because she's doing so well without you.

529
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,669
You're afraid she won't need your help
to run the company or her family.

530
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,229
And I got news for you.
She's better than you at both.

531
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,437
If you don't wanna lose her,
let her keep doing what she's been doing.

532
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,151
You'll stay rich, she'll be happy,
and I'll figure out a way to make it work.

533
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,511
I need a corkscrew.

534
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,358
Have a nice time.

535
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,912
Great party, Kiki.

536
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,238
Your mom would have loved it.

537
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,829
Birthdays, holidays.
She always loved a good party.

538
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,319
She did.

539
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,869
I miss her.

540
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,275
I know. Me too.

541
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,078
Your sister, do you ever hear from her?

542
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,674
I wanted to invite her,
but I couldn't reach her.

543
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,990
The number I have
is no longer in service.

544
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,396
- And then there were two.
- You could look at it like that.

545
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,792
You're all I got, Kiki.

546
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,872
And then I'm running you so ragged
you haven't got time to talk to me.

547
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,591
That's not true, and you know it.
I love working for you.

548
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,876
I just want you to be proud of me.

549
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,395
Taking in a stray kid.

550
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,310
That's the sort of thing your mom
would've done.

551
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,392
Yeah, except she would have done it
just to piss you off.

552
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,792
Don't be late Monday.

553
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,956
- Hi.
- Hi.

554
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,155
So I guess she likes you.

555
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,751
I guess she did.

556
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,594
You look so sad. I...

557
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,152
I'd give anything to be that miserable.

558
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,155
Because if I remember correctly,
that's what it feels like to be in love.

559
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,637
I love you so much.

560
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,313
Do you...?

561
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,277
I mean, are you...?

562
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,273
Okay.

563
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,351
Yeah, you're sure?

564
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,793
Yeah.

565
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,072
I want to.

566
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,831
Should I grab a...?

567
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,434
Yeah.

568
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,317
- Do you want me to walk you in?
- No. Thanks.

569
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,952
I love you.

570
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,832
Love you too.

571
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,358
You're too late.
