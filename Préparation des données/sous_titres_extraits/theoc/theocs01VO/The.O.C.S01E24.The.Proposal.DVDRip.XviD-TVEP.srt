1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,317
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- What about that date?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,710
- You're breaking up with me?
- It never could work.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,792
- Cal, when you wanna date, let me know.
- It was an accident.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,077
You accidentally slept with Marissa's mom
or accidentally told Marissa?

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,673
- I just...
- Get out of here, Luke.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,752
- I don't wanna see him again.
- What about your dad? Kaitlin?

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,592
What am I supposed to do without you?

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,358
You are not leaving this house.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,195
Or what? You're gonna call the police or
Dr. Milano? You know what? Go ahead.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,396
In fact, why don't you call up
Dad and Caleb?

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,516
I'd really love to tell them
why I ran away.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,591
You okay?

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,796
Yeah, it's just really sad.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,712
It's just the movie, right?
That's the reason for the tears?

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,437
Yes. I'm emotionally stable.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,068
Besides, I'm not the only one crying.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,232
I'm sorry, what? I'm allergic, okay?

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,153
And there's so much pollen
in here right now. It's ridiculous.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,433
- Tomorrow we're watching football, okay?
- Football season is five months away.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,070
ESPN Classics, okay?
We'll watch old games.

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,630
Maybe next time
we should see a comedy.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,678
What? No, no. I can see sad movies.

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,876
Yeah. No, I know you can.

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,877
I can't, Ryan, I'm sensitive.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,873
- Okay, so, what now?
- Whatever Coop wants to do.

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,077
- Yeah, what do you wanna to do?
- I don't know. It's getting late.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,913
- So you wanna go back?
- Why don't we have a slumber party.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,355
- I'll stay over.
- We all will. We'll sleep in shifts.

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,080
- That way, one of us'll be up at all times.
- Doing what?

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,117
Hey, whatever you need us to do.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,555
- Look, okay? Guys, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah. We know.

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,948
Why wouldn't you be?

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,591
I don't know, because the guy I lost
my virginity to had sex with my mom.

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,115
- Oh, yeah, I remember that.
- Look, guys, it's really not that big a deal.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,792
- Why don't we go to Jamba Juice?
- That's a great idea. I love juice.

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,032
- Remember that thing with vitamin C?
- The boosts. Free boosts.

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,198
Sit down.

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,839
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Well, it's not like I had any choice.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,549
All your phone calls and e-mails.
I had to block you from my Buddy List...

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,188
...you were so incessant.
- Blocked me?

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,032
I thought you were off-line.
You want something?

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,191
- The Razzmatazz is...
- Luke...

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,273
...I told you, I'm not staying.
So tell me, what is it that's so important?

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,955
If you drink it too fast,
you can get a brain freeze.

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,031
- So sip it slowly.
- That's good advice.

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,350
Okay, guys, I can drink a cold beverage.

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,909
I'm telling you, I'm really...

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,588
...so not okay.

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,390
I guess we'll skip the Razzmatazz.

50
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,077
Hey.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,278
Sorry. I'm surprised that hasn't
happened before.

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not saying I'm disappointed
it hasn't happened before.

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,357
- I'm saying the mathematical probability...
- Crying during chick flicks.

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,909
- Walking in on me getting dressed.
- What's your point?

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,991
I'm not seeing what you're getting at.

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,510
- Do you work out?
- Not really.

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,557
Me neither.
I'm gonna go watch some hockey.

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,915
- Hockey season's over.
- Damn it.

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,356
- Where you going?
- To find Luke. Beat the crap out of him.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,474
- Where'll the can of whup-ass be opened?
- I'll go to his house, check the pier.

61
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,949
Have you considered our back yard?

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,951
- What's up, guys?
- Why don't you tell me?

63
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,918
- Calm down. I didn't come to fight.
- You told me it was over.

64
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,834
It is. Believe me.
I just... I had to talk to her.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,231
Next time you wanna talk to somebody,
talk to Seth, me. Anyone but her.

66
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,879
No one will talk to me.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,112
Sleeping with your ex-girlfriend's mom
kind of yields that result.

68
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,669
- I thought you were my friends.
- You got no friends.

69
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,838
I know.

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,520
- But I need your help.
- I'm not gonna help you.

71
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,512
- I'm leaving.
- Thanks for stopping by.

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,238
No, I mean, I'm leaving town.

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,831
Now that the divorce is final,
my dad just wants to get out, so...

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,799
- We got family in Portland.
- You're going with him?

75
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,078
Don't tell anybody.
But that's what I was trying to tell Julie.

76
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,915
And that's what I wanna tell Marissa.
But I wanna tell her myself.

77
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,152
- Look, I don't know, Luke.
- Come on. Please, please. Five minutes.

78
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,880
It's not that much to ask,
to say goodbye.

79
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,632
Then I'm gone.

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,833
Please.

81
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,191
- You okay?
- Yeah, just checking the paper...

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,672
...for any impending natural disasters
before tomorrow's grand opening.

83
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,149
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No, why be nervous?

84
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,629
If our pre-celebration tonight
goes badly...

85
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,519
...there'll be no time
to fix it before tomorrow night.

86
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,114
I like to anticipate the worst at all times.

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,555
It's a Cohen family trait.

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,393
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

89
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,509
- Yes!
- What is that?

90
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,433
- We're business partners.
- We needed our own secret handshake.

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,433
- Secret handshake?
- It's a guy thing.

92
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,478
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Is this okay?

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,149
Or is it putting the "ho" in hostess?

94
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,357
Hailey, it looks great.
But it's not my restaurant.

95
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,272
Jimmy?

96
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,314
Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean...

97
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,153
...we should ask Sandy because...
- I don't have shoes.

98
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,473
It'll serve to distract the customers, which
is good, since they won't be drinking.

99
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,234
The Liquor Board is reneging
on our liquor license.

100
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,598
- They can't. They gave us a permit.
- Must be a mix-up. I'll call the inspector.

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,117
See, that's why we Cohens
are always right.

102
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,589
Because the worst always happens.

103
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,395
Come on, Hail. I'll go get your shoes.

104
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,511
So you like the dress?

105
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,910
It's definitely a keeper.

106
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,435
So you'd sit in my section?

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,632
How do you even make waitress-speak
sound so...?

108
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,358
Dirty?

109
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,957
I was gonna say "untoward," but, yeah.

110
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,593
Hail, it's your feet, not mine.

111
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,358
Can you believe this?

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,429
Okay, Coop. So...

113
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,511
...what's it gonna be, a little salt glow?

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,956
Little Tahitian body wrap?
Or maybe a lotion boot?

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,270
Okay, not really into exfoliating
right now.

116
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,557
Besides, I promised Ryan
I'd meet him for lunch at the pier.

117
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,508
Lunch at the pier. Corn dogs and pizza.
You know, I read an article in <i>Stuff</i>.

118
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,752
It says carbs send endorphins
to your brain and that makes you happy.

119
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,356
Oh, that's probably Ryan.
I gotta go grab it.

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,068
Where'd you leave your phone?
Your dad's room?

121
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,514
No, my room.

122
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,557
You have a room?

123
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,672
Wait.

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,273
Hello?

125
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,670
Yeah, Coop.
Like what you've done with the place.

126
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,996
Yeah, I guess I didn't really get around
to unpacking.

127
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,113
How can you live like this?
Your T-shirts touch your sweaters.

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,512
I figured that if I didn't hang anything up
then it wouldn't be so permanent.

129
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,839
Anyway, I gotta go meet Ryan.
So do you wanna come or...?

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,231
You know what? Do you mind
if I hang out here and watch TV?

131
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,870
The step-monster got her wisdom teeth
pulled. She's whacked out on Percocet...

132
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,160
...leaving drool all over the house.
- Okay, sure. Go ahead. I'll see you later.

133
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,397
- I can't believe they're seeing each other.
- They're not.

134
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,678
- That's not what it looked like last night.
- Last night wasn't what it looked like.

135
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,630
I talked to Luke.

136
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,599
What? You guys are still hanging out?

137
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,230
No, he showed up.
He wants to talk to you. Apologize.

138
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,913
No.

139
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,152
There's no way I could forgive him.

140
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,949
- Maybe for Holly. But not for this.
- I know...

141
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,156
...but it would mean a lot to him.

142
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,718
What's important to him
is really not so important to me.

143
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,673
That's a whole part of my life
I'd just rather keep separate...

144
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,400
...from this part of my life.

145
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,311
You know what we haven't done
in a while?

146
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,039
Listen, I'm all for getting it on
in exotic locales.

147
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,909
But I think your best friend's
bedroom's just really disheveled.

148
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,992
Wow. I like what she's done
with the place.

149
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,674
The cardboard boxes, it feels very...

150
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,717
I'm getting like a garage-sale vibe.

151
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,158
Yes, I know. See, they say your
external life influences your internal life.

152
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,390
- Who says that?
- I read it in <i>ELLE Decor</i>.

153
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,710
- Your favorite magazine.
- You read?

154
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,077
No wonder she's so depressed.
We need to surprise her and fix it up.

155
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,232
Do you think giving her a little
feng shui will help her forget...

156
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,960
...her mom slept with her ex-boyfriend?
- It can't hurt.

157
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,793
Right. Well, that's very sweet.

158
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,354
But if you put a mirror on that wall,
it'd open up the energy flow in this room.

159
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,114
- I know where you're going with this.
- The hardware store.

160
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,310
The hardware store? With, like, the bolts
and the grouting and the Skil saws?

161
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,517
You don't like hardware stores
and you cry during chick flicks.

162
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,434
Next thing you're gonna tell me,
you walk in on Ryan changing.

163
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,429
Come on. That's crazy.
Hey, let's go to the hardware store.

164
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,032
Peter Johnson, from the Liquor Board.
Am I right?

165
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,272
You came here about a month ago
and granted us a liquor license.

166
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,195
Craziest thing. I open my mail, and I read
that our liquor license had been reneged.

167
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,554
Yes.

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,719
- Yeah, crazy?
- Yes, your license has been reneged.

169
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,873
Without a liquor license,
this place can't turn a profit.

170
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,634
This is Newport Beach.
Everyone's a borderline alcoholic.

171
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,075
I'm sorry, but your temporary license
was issued...

172
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,437
...before your file landed in front of
the newly appointed commissioner.

173
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,434
- So?
- The name Steve Peiser mean anything?

174
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,113
No.

175
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,794
Well, it might to Jimmy Cooper.

176
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,236
Turns out Mr. Cooper was
Commissioner Peiser's financial advisor...

177
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,960
...before he stole a quarter
of a million dollars from him.

178
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,109
You're kidding me.

179
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,598
It was that financial loss that forced my
boss out of retirement and back to work.

180
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,513
He saw Cooper's name on the file
and said "no way."

181
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,593
Want my advice?
Have Mr. Cooper step down.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,956
So, what do you wanna do for lunch?

183
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,192
I can do mac and cheese
or mac and cheese.

184
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,112
Tough choice.

185
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,549
- I forgot how fun this was.
- Pretty fun.

186
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,516
You know, lunch could wait.

187
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,148
We are having a pretty big dinner.

188
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,319
- Not your dad, is it?
- No, he has a key.

189
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,148
- Mr. Nichol.
- Call me Caleb.

190
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,470
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

191
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,711
No. Yeah, come in.

192
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,955
- Ryan.
- Mr. Nichol.

193
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,475
Would you mind if Marissa
and I had a word, privately?

194
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,591
- Sure.
- Actually, Ryan and I don't have secrets.

195
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,592
It's important.

196
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,432
Well, then I definitely want him here.

197
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,111
What follows doesn't leave
this room then, okay?

198
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,872
Sit down.

199
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,708
Marissa, your mother's
a wonderful woman.

200
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,108
She is?

201
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,951
You're important to her. You and I
haven't spent a lot of time together...

202
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,317
...but it was important to me
to come and get your blessing.

203
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,795
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

204
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,233
- You wanna marry my mom?
- I love her very much.

205
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,039
- You don't know her.
- You should give Marissa some time.

206
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,714
- This is kind of a big deal.
- Impossible.

207
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,028
I intend to propose to her
tonight at the restaurant...

208
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,919
...with our friends and family
in attendance.

209
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,111
Well, then I guess I can't stop you.

210
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,077
I'll see you both tonight.

211
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,515
Thanks for your time, dear.

212
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,319
And again, this is just between us.

213
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,630
I want it to be a surprise.

214
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,909
If my mom marries him, she's gonna be
the most powerful woman in Newport.

215
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,588
Not if you tell Caleb the truth.

216
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,874
- Hey.
- Hey.

217
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,235
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.

218
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,789
- And?
- I don't think it's gonna happen, man.

219
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,794
- What do you mean?
- She's dealing with a lot of stuff now.

220
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,520
- Family stuff.
- She won't even see me for 30 seconds?

221
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,036
Her dad's restaurant's having its
private opening tonight. She's busy.

222
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,952
- I'm leaving town.
- She doesn't know.

223
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,954
- That's because she won't talk to me.
- Why don't you just write her a letter?

224
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,191
Write her a letter?

225
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,679
- I had your back with Oliver.
- You had sex with her mom.

226
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,638
I didn't just have sex with her, okay?!
I'm in love with her!

227
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,791
- I was... I am in love!
- Don't need to hear it.

228
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,633
But Marissa does. I have to talk to her.
I have to explain.

229
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,792
- Luke, I wouldn't.
- I can't go without making it right.

230
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,998
I won't.

231
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,390
Okay, the plan is, we go to dinner
for, like, 10 minutes, right?

232
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,870
Then we sneak out, come back here
and make magic happen.

233
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,670
Excellent. I'm extremely stealth.
1996, All-School Hide-and-Seek champion.

234
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,913
I do believe Joel Gordon
is still looking for me. The fool.

235
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,197
Hey! Last year's yearbook.

236
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,669
- God, I love yearbooks.
- Listen, let's put it away...

237
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,876
...because we've got
a lot of work to do.

238
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,474
- Stop it!
- Let's just put it back.

239
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,876
Hey, it's you.

240
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,758
- We had a sailing team?
- Yeah. It never got off the ground, but...

241
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,199
- You were in the Comic Book Club?
- I was the president and only member.

242
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,868
Let's see.

243
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,877
- We had a Film Preservation Society?
- Yeah, but it was a long time ago.

244
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,634
So you know, we don't have to...

245
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,392
It's not fun.

246
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,754
Was I really mean to you?

247
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,032
No.

248
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,953
That would have required you
to speak to me.

249
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,995
Or anyone to speak to me.

250
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,239
A lot's changed in a year, huh?

251
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,638
Hey.

252
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,193
"Marissa, you're the greatest.
This summer will rock.

253
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,796
- Love you forever, Luke."
- Yeah.

254
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,599
A lot's definitely changed.

255
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,999
Marissa's gonna need
a whole lot of feng shui.

256
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,791
Hey. You look beautiful.

257
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,598
Thank you.

258
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,916
You look sad.

259
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,630
I thought this would be
a moment to celebrate.

260
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,153
So did I.

261
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,470
You know that mix-up
with the liquor license?

262
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,790
- It's not such a mix-up.
- You're kidding.

263
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,157
It turns out the new commissioner
is a former client of Jimmy's...

264
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,470
...with a quarter-million dollar
score to settle.

265
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,790
Without that license,
there's no point opening.

266
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,635
I've been on the phone trying to call in
favors. I got nothing. The guy is serious.

267
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,634
The only way he'll reconsider is if
Jimmy steps down. Leaves the business.

268
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,917
- You're not considering...
- No, of course not.

269
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,556
Well, there is one last option.
You're not gonna like it.

270
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,517
My dad can be very...

271
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,477
He can be very persuasive.

272
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,269
I may have to throw a few more of these
back before you start bringing up Caleb.

273
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,557
Desperate times.

274
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,676
This is that.

275
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,829
Hey, man. What's going on?

276
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,831
- Where you been?
- What?

277
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,911
- What?
- What's going on?

278
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,548
- Nothing. Not one thing, okay?
- All right.

279
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,430
I'm gonna go pee, okay? So if anyone
asks, that's where I am. For a while.

280
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,033
Right.

281
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,831
- He's getting weirder.
- Didn't think that was possible.

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,638
Marissa.

283
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,358
Mom.

284
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,600
That's the warmest conversation
I've had with her in weeks.

285
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,990
I'll have a word, see if I can't help.

286
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,151
I have been known
to be quite persuasive.

287
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,311
So I've heard.

288
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,911
What's with Dad these days?
He's all warm and mushy.

289
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,479
Don't know.

290
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,837
Maybe it's the new
blood-thinning medication he's on.

291
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,989
What about you?
How's your romantic life?

292
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,679
Oh, you know me. Not much.

293
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,514
Vince, thank you so much.

294
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,992
How excited is Jimmy?

295
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,959
He's like a totally different person.

296
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,196
It's so great.

297
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,833
Let's hope tomorrow night
goes as well as tonight.

298
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,310
- Pat. Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.

299
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,792
Though I gotta say, Nana Cohen's
meat loaf, trouncing Grandma Cooper's.

300
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,316
- She would expect no less.
- How'd it go today with the Liquor Board?

301
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,597
- All sorted out?
- Working on it. Working on it.

302
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,718
Enjoy it, Jimmy. Moments like this
don't happen every day.

303
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,233
I know.

304
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,711
It's fantastic.

305
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,709
- Hey.
- How you doing?

306
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,312
I'm just happy you're here,
so I don't have to do this alone.

307
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,914
You know me.
Can't get enough of this stuff.

308
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,680
Excuse me, everyone.
I have something I'd like to say.

309
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,558
I hope you're all enjoying yourselves
tonight as much as I am.

310
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,508
Though my enjoyment of life over the last
few months goes beyond this restaurant...

311
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,989
...to a very special lady, Julie Cooper.

312
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,032
What's he doing here?

313
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,636
Julie did a fantastic job
on the d Ácor, didn't she?

314
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,233
Hey, come on, let's go.

315
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,628
And...

316
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,270
- It's here on this opening night...
- Nobody'll talk to me or even look at me.

317
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,149
- Had a little bit to drink?
- I'd like to show her how special she is.

318
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,517
I gotta tell Marissa it wasn't just sex.
I love her mom.

319
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,035
Okay, I don't think that's a good idea.

320
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,759
Julie Cooper...

321
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,639
...will you marry me?

322
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,751
Oh, my God!

323
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,799
Yes, of course I will, Cal.

324
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,029
Kiki!

325
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,597
Luke. Hey. Luke. Hey!

326
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,558
- Look, Luke...
- Don't make me!

327
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,950
Just give me your keys.
Let me drive you home.

328
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,719
What home?

329
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,997
I can't believe he just showed up here.

330
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,754
- I need your car. I need to go after him.
- No.

331
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,196
It's like you're saying
he did nothing wrong.

332
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,510
I'm not taking his side.
I'm not taking any side.

333
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,193
You know what? Maybe you should.

334
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,749
He should have time alone
to think about what he did.

335
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,912
- Feel bad about it.
- He does feel bad...

336
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,640
- That's why he's leaving.
- What are you talking about?

337
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,312
His dad's moving to Portland. He's moving
with him. Because of what happened.

338
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,310
Can I have your keys?
He's had a lot to drink.

339
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,199
- That's cool. I didn't want any, anyway.
- My dad is marrying Julie Cooper.

340
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,999
Julie Cooper is my stepmom.

341
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,196
- Maybe we'll get you another bottle.
- Drink up.

342
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,797
This is an unholy alliance, two storm
fronts colliding. It's the apocalypse for us.

343
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,515
- Maybe you wanna lay off the sauce.
- Think of it.

344
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,478
All the time we were growing up
and you'd come over for dinner...

345
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,031
...you'd go sailing with my dad, did you
ever think he would marry your ex-wife?

346
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,758
- Yeah, give me a glass.
- Never.

347
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,799
Jimbo, the way I see it, this might be
the best thing that could happen to you.

348
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,872
There is nothing good about it.
This marriage is an asteroid...

349
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,918
...that hit the Earth. Now we
have to see what species survives.

350
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,710
I did it. Look.

351
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,475
Wow, you hit a nail!
Bob Vila's your bitch, Cohen.

352
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,876
What?! Why?!

353
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,873
- This is not supposed to happen.
- You have to find the stud.

354
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,317
- You mean like you did, Summer?
- Just get me the stud finder.

355
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,631
Oh, Summer,
I think you are the stud finder.

356
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,837
- See this hammer in my hand?
- What does the stud finder look like?

357
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,433
- And the level.
- What is a level?

358
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,353
- Don't you know what a level is?
- What you advance to in a video game.

359
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,479
That's funny. Yeah.
The tool doesn't know about tools.

360
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,553
My people, we don't really build.
We're not what you would call "handy."

361
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,917
We hire people to do it.
Why don't we just get a contractor?

362
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,308
Or I can paint.

363
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,670
And here I thought
you could only paint the ceiling.

364
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,511
Marissa, hey, listen, l...

365
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,874
No, no. It's me, man.

366
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,228
- I'm fine, man.
- You don't sound fine.

367
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,196
Well, you know, I'm just having
a few beers up at the park...

368
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,271
...rocking out to Seger.
You know the drill.

369
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,668
Not really.

370
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,189
Hey, do me a favor, Ryan.

371
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,953
Tell Marissa I get it.

372
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,476
<i>Okay? I don 't deserve her forgiveness.</i>

373
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,039
I'm...

374
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,430
I'm scum. I'm...

375
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,592
All I ever did was let her down.
Tell her that.

376
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,354
No, just tell me where you are, all right?

377
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,670
You can't leave
without saying goodbye, right?

378
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,353
Right.

379
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,518
Goodbye.

380
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,916
Damn it!

381
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,115
<i>I'm not here. Leave a message.</i>

382
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,872
Julie.

383
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,598
I'm...

384
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,398
I'm leaving tomorrow.

385
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,754
I need to see you.

386
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,350
I'm coming... I'm coming to see you.

387
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,194
You owe me a goodbye!

388
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,239
<i>Without a liquor license,</i>
<i>we'll be belly-up in no time.</i>

389
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,437
- Really? Cal, I had no idea.
- There's no point in opening the place.

390
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,068
That's why I was hoping
I could ask you to do me a favor.

391
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,356
- What?
- Wait, did you not hear me?

392
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,351
I just wanted to hear you say it again.

393
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,349
If it was up to me, I'd rather take the hit
than talk with you. But it's Jimmy.

394
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,354
- The Lighthouse is all he's got.
- Lf you drop him, they'd issue the license.

395
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,997
But you're too much of a martyr.
Listen, Sanford...

396
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,515
...never mix business with friendship.
- You're right.

397
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,875
From now on,
I'm doing all my deals with you.

398
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,357
When you came to me about Uncle Shaun,
I said yes. You owe me.

399
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,988
I don't wanna owe you.
I wanna hold it over your head.

400
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,029
Need water. Tried to lie down,
got the spins.

401
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,475
Well, I better get back to my bride-to-be.

402
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,438
Oh, yeah. Definitely might vomit.

403
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,590
Luke, call us when you get this.

404
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,198
Ryan.

405
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,672
When I saw him at the party last night...

406
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,116
...I wished for something like this
to happen.

407
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,998
It's not your fault.

408
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,468
- How is he?
- Well, he's out of surgery.

409
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,309
He's pretty much out of commission
right now, but the worst is behind him.

410
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,516
I should call my parents.

411
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,599
You guys...

412
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,196
...he's gonna be asleep for a while.
You should go home.

413
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,150
- Maybe we should, so we could finish.
- Or we could sleep.

414
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,756
You know, I'm really glad
that Luke's gonna be okay.

415
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,672
We'll come back.

416
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,035
Actually, I'm gonna stay.
You know, just in case.

417
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,392
Okay.

418
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,876
Then I'll stay too.

419
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,673
<i>I heard he'd been drinking...</i>

420
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,392
...which makes one less inspired
to go after our liquor license.

421
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,790
- Can I get you something to eat?
- No, no, I'm good.

422
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,794
Don't worry about going to city hall. I'll
deal with them. You hold down the fort.

423
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,952
That's not necessary.
You hang at the Lighthouse. Man the ship.

424
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,556
Are we gonna refer to the restaurant
as a ship or a fort?

425
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,517
Well, right now it's a sinking ship.

426
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,753
Okay, not the most inspiring metaphor
on our opening night.

427
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,714
Why don't you sit down?

428
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,395
I can't. I gotta go see what the holdup is
with the liquor license.

429
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,314
You're the holdup, Jimmy.

430
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,838
Does the name Steve Peiser
mean anything to you?

431
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,750
When he went back to work, after his
financial advisor lost his life savings...

432
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,836
...he got a job
as commissioner of the Liquor Board.

433
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,834
This restaurant was supposed to be...

434
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,911
...a chance for me...

435
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,035
...to escape from my past.

436
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,191
I guess there is no escaping, huh?

437
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,751
Well, we do have one possible
Houdini-esque escape left.

438
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,958
Caleb.

439
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,519
I asked him for help.

440
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,630
- You hate asking him for help.
- This was no exception. I had no choice.

441
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,712
You did. You could've told me
the truth and asked me to bow out.

442
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,634
Like I said, I had no choice.

443
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,314
<i>Satellite Pharmacy to room 607.</i>

444
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,677
<i>Satellite Pharmacy, room 607.</i>

445
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,590
Hey, guys. He's up.

446
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,551
You should go home.
And thanks for waiting, all right?

447
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,392
Wait.

448
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,672
Will you tell him that I'm here...

449
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,713
...and I'd like to see him?

450
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,356
I'll start auditioning bands right away.

451
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,432
I need to start soliciting
recommendations for the videographer...

452
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,990
...and the photographer, the engravers.
You know, I should ask Diane Kahn.

453
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,879
She's been married, like,
at least a half a dozen times.

454
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,917
Why aren't you more excited?

455
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,835
Oh, Julie, it was a rough night.

456
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,115
Hey, where are you going?
Why aren't you asleep?

457
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,998
Because Summer's a slave driver.

458
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,116
Is Ryan back from the hospital yet?

459
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,840
- Hospital?
- Oh, didn't you hear?

460
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,276
Luke wrapped his truck
around a telephone pole last night.

461
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,354
- He did?
- Just a few blocks from here.

462
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,956
He was drinking. So unlike him.

463
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,830
Well, I guess he just...

464
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,912
...never really recovered
from everything with his father.

465
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,717
You know, the humiliation,
his family being torn apart.

466
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,031
Yeah, that must be it.

467
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,559
Pour me a bloody mary, will you, James?
Since it'll be the last drink we serve.

468
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,110
- What? That's it?
- Hook, line and sinker.

469
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,430
No license. No opening. No restaurant.

470
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,750
- No comeback.
- That's the best you could do?

471
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,948
- As big a badass as you are?
- Didn't have an effect on this Peiser fella.

472
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,397
You know how to piss people off.
You could teach me a thing or two.

473
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,438
- You seem awfully glib.
- Everything happens for a reason.

474
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,633
Could you at least feign
a little sensitivity at our misfortune?

475
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,554
You know what they say: One man's
misfortune is another man's fortune.

476
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,595
- Who says that?
- I do.

477
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,708
- I've never seen him smile.
- I didn't know he had teeth.

478
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,997
Make yourselves a couple of drinks,
fellas. We should talk.

479
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,388
Cheers.

480
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,916
Are you okay?

481
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,477
I'm so sorry.

482
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,029
I didn't mean for this to happen.

483
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,271
Any of it.

484
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,152
I just...

485
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,515
I didn't have anyone.
I had no one. Not my family.

486
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,149
I don't know, you know?

487
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,953
But...

488
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,279
...I'm gonna go away.

489
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,636
Give things a chance
to go back to normal for you.

490
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,988
Because I know
as long as I'm here, they won't.

491
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,431
But I need to know one thing
before I go.

492
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,710
Can you forgive me?

493
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,638
Yeah.

494
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,474
Yes.

495
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,392
Luke...

496
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,154
...I'll miss you.

497
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,997
Who would've thought
when you moved to town...

498
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,435
...that I'd be the one who had to leave?

499
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,637
I thought I was gonna live in Newport
my whole life.

500
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,916
So you'll start a new life.

501
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,279
Yeah, maybe I'll show up in Portland...

502
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,316
...and fall for the chick dating
the captain of the football team.

503
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,311
And he can kick your ass.

504
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,471
Yeah.

505
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,551
Welcome to Portland, bitch.

506
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,552
Well, I'll e-mail you.
Maybe I'll drop back in...

507
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,438
...say hey.

508
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,114
Good luck, man.

509
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,751
Want me to take you home?

510
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,433
I hate her so much.

511
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,628
I mean, she tried to drive you out.
She almost destroyed my dad.

512
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,360
She nearly killed Luke.

513
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,030
I have to do something.

514
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,353
Okay.

515
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,351
So where we going?

516
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,959
Marissa. Hello.

517
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,234
Come in. Is everything all right?

518
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,910
Actually, no, it's not.

519
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,717
We need to talk about my mom.

520
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,998
I was just thinking the same thing.
Sit down, please.

521
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,358
I know things between you
and your mom have been rocky this year.

522
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,957
- Can you both put the past behind you?
- You have no idea what she's like...

523
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,315
...or what she's done.
- I know.

524
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,159
I know.

525
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,958
Everything.

526
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,829
We should use this occasion
as a chance to heal.

527
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,556
Make a fresh start.

528
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,639
Family is very important to me, Marissa.

529
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,189
I want us all to be a real family.

530
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,352
- Your sister deserves that, so do you.
- We already have a dad.

531
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,035
I'm well aware. I'm not trying
to replace him, push him out.

532
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,714
Quite the opposite, in fact.
As of today...

533
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,714
...I'm the only chance your father has.
- What are you talking about?

534
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,599
This morning I offered to buy
the Balboa Lighthouse...

535
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,070
...from both he and Sandy
for several million dollars.

536
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,788
Considering the fact that the restaurant
will never open, make a cent...

537
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,397
...I'd say it was a pretty good deal.
However, if I were to change my mind...

538
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,791
...decide it was a bad investment,
lose my checkbook...

539
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,636
...your father would be ruined.

540
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,472
Penniless.

541
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,112
Run out of town.

542
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,078
Which is where I come in.

543
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,197
You are very important to your mother.

544
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,069
She is very important to me.

545
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,957
- Be part of our family.
- Which means what, exactly?

546
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,430
Well, you're already part of the wedding.
When your mom moves in...

547
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,273
...you come and live with us too.
- You're joking, right?

548
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,919
It would mean everything to her.

549
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,957
And if I do this, then you'll
definitely buy the restaurant?

550
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,714
This conversation would have
to remain confidential.

551
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,959
You wouldn't want my mom to know
you blackmailed me into living with her?

552
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,112
So do we have a deal?

553
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,636
Wonderful. Now, was there something
else that you wanted to ask me about?

554
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,558
- You okay?
- I'm a prisoner in my own life. I'm great.

555
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,280
- Well, you did what you needed to do.
- Yeah.

556
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,877
- I guess I just need some sleep.
- Yeah, okay. I'll call you...

557
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,913
I told you, no touching anything, ever.

558
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,394
- You're such a dandy, Cohen.
- You're a dandy, woman.

559
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,198
- Fine, take it.
- No. I don't want it.

560
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,351
Oh, my God!

561
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,955
Those are tears of joy, yes?

562
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,598
I...

563
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,833
I don't even know what to say.

564
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,756
Summer did all the building.

565
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,596
And the heavy lifting. And the wiring
of the electronics. But I painted.

566
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,671
I know you're a Paris fan.

567
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,876
It's amazing.

568
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,110
This is so cool.

569
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,352
We looked through your toys
and couldn't find any plastic horses...

570
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,432
...but we did find this.

571
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,034
Share Bear! Wow!

572
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,668
Yeah, she'll watch over you
with her Care Bear stare.

573
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,671
How do you know
about the Care Bear stare?

574
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,397
- I painted that.
- Yes, you did.

575
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,152
I did.

576
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,437
Thanks, you guys.

577
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,273
- I really needed this.
- Yeah, it was nothing.

578
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,673
For you.
You should see Cohen with a power saw.

579
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,671
How do you know about
the Care Bear stare?

580
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,910
- Dude, leave it alone.
- No, I'm just curious.

581
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,231
- Isn't he cute?
- It's like... It's kind of...
