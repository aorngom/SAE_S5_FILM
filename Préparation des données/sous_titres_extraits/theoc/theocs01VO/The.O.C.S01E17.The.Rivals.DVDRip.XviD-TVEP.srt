1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,032
I know you. Oliver Trask.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,349
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,193
Next time you wanna be alone
with my girlfriend, I can stay home.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,716
Everybody who knows me
for more than five minutes hates my guts.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,757
- I'm so stupid!
- Take it easy.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,878
So in theory, Julie Cooper
could become your stepmother.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,314
Don't even say it.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,198
I can start over, have a new life.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,272
I never really wanted to be
a financial planner. Or a thief.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,670
I think Jimmy and I might've
gone into business together.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,991
- You are drunk.
- You guys are like brother and sister.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,434
You guys could be related.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,875
- What's wrong?
- I just took a whole bunch of pills.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,838
- We're leaving. See you soon.
- What if he didn't try to kill himself?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,070
- What?
- He wouldn't go to the hospital.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,878
I can't leave him alone tonight.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,156
Just go home,
and I'll see you in the morning.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,835
You did accuse the guy
of faking a suicide attempt.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,309
- No, I didn't. I just didn't believe him.
- Oh, okay.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,710
Hard to believe such blind compassion
upset Marissa.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,029
You should work for UNICEF.

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,475
I don't trust him.
Something about Oliver is off.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,790
Yeah. He tried to kill himself.

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,554
Or he faked it, man.
Either way, it's pretty off.

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,439
Every day it seems Marissa and I
are fighting about this guy.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,511
- I don't even know why.
- Ryan, I'm no girl...

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,309
Although I did spend several summers
at Camp Takaho being called such.

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,070
- Maybe your jealousy's getting in the way.
- Yeah, except I'm not jealous.

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,878
Jealous? Why would I be jealous?

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,555
Because Oliver is insanely wealthy
and well-traveled. He's a Dapper Don.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,478
- And I'm not.
- But on the other hand...

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,916
...he's also clinically depressed
and chemically dependent. So you know...

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,036
...it all comes out in the wash, really.

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,910
You want my advice?
Just embrace the friend, man.

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,833
- You should make peace with this guy.
- Maybe you're right.

36
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,436
Or, I don't know, you could enjoy
the arguing with Marissa.

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,830
Sparks flying. Her yin to your yang.

38
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,351
Could be nice for your relationship.
I'd imagine.

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,989
- Why, you and Anna don't fight?
- We're all yang, Ryan.

40
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,516
What would we fight about? We like
the same things, have the same interests.

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,636
- It's ridiculous.
- That sounds terrible.

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,030
- We're sharing the same brain.
- Not me and Marissa.

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,909
Let me ask you something. Am I dating
the female me? Like me, but as a girl?

44
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,672
I don't know. That's disgusting.

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,513
True.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,230
- I gotta go.
- Catch you later, Marissa.

47
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,318
- Go what?
- Gotta go embrace the friend.

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,277
Hi. Hey.

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,191
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,550
- How's Oliver?
- You really want to know?

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,473
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,598
He feels bad. He doesn't understand
why he took a bunch of pills...

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,116
...and you and I got in a fight over it.
By the way, I don't get it, either.

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,713
Right. I know.

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,078
And I know I've been
a little weird about everything.

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,033
But he's your friend. So he's my friend.

57
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,236
I know. I'm not saying I might not
get weird about it again...

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,954
...but I wanna try.

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,554
You wanna hang out with him,
you want me to, it's okay.

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,871
It's better than okay. It's... It's great.

61
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,878
- Great?
- Yeah, well...

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,713
"Great" is probably pushing it a little.

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,635
- But definitely good.
- Thanks.

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,516
Ryan. Marissa. I want you to meet
our new transfer student.

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,398
He says you're all friends.

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,999
Hey. So I was thinking...

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,357
...maybe after school we could
go play a little bit of Jenga. Yeah?

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,119
No.

69
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,955
Or we could go get some comics.
We haven't done that in a while.

70
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,678
Okay. We could go to South Coast Plaza
and quietly mock people.

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,274
Or why don't we try
and do something different?

72
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,034
Like... Check it out. I got some ideas.

73
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,952
- Muscle-car racing.
- What?

74
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,874
Or we could learn Israeli self-defense.
They call it <i>Krav Maga</i>.

75
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,598
- Seth. Come on.
- <i>Krav Maga</i>.

76
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,830
- What?
- Why don't we go to the IMAX theatre...

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,470
...and see the movie on migrating birds?
- IMAX, Anna? We're cooler than that.

78
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,871
I think we're past that. Why don't we
take Luke's Sea-Doo out for a spin?

79
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,508
I'm looking to
branch out into different water sports.

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,558
- Okay. I'll support that.
- Good. If not, we can argue about it.

81
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,473
No, I think it's good.
It's important that we change things up.

82
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,359
- We don't want to get boring.
- Good. I think it's important...

83
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,798
...for us to not always do the same stuff
or dress the same, or whatever.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,877
- Damn it.
- Wow.

85
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,199
You take Israeli self-defense.
I'll take muscle cars.

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,311
- Got yourself a little deal there.
- Partner.

87
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,359
- Hey.
- Hey. Oliver, what's up, man?

88
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,909
- You visiting Harbor?
- Actually, Oliver goes here now.

89
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,433
Never too late for a new start.

90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,318
What a surprise.

91
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,830
- You didn't tell anyone?
- I didn't think you meant it.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,992
Of course. I have more friends here
than I did at my last school.

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,674
Anyways, I'm gonna go wash up.
It's tuna-melt Monday.

94
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,432
- And we love tuna melts.
- Yes, we do.

95
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,158
I was looking forward, though...

96
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,754
...to sampling some of the other items
on the menu.

97
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,349
- Good. That's good. That's great.
- Bye-bye.

98
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,074
I was gonna take Oliver to the bookstore,
since we both have free periods now.

99
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,834
Marissa and I have, like,
the exact same schedule.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,228
- What are the odds?
- Crazy.

101
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,794
Have fun.

102
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,154
Okay. Come on.

103
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,639
Later on.

104
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,196
There it is, man. Tuna melts, Ryan.
What am I gonna have to give up next?

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,429
Oliver goes here.

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,114
I was trying to talk about myself,
but I did notice.

107
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,477
- You don't find that completely...?
- Embrace the friend, okay?

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,792
- I'm sure there's a good explanation.
- Seth. Come on.

109
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,038
I gotta go.

110
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,799
And my 12:00? Right.
The 16-year-old with his third DUI.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,356
What do I have at 6?
The travel agent who falsely advertised...

112
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,433
...the Bahamian beach house. What a day.
All right. Thanks, Cory. Bye.

113
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,995
Four years at Berkeley Law,
15 as a public defender...

114
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,312
...so I could become Judge Judy.
- I like her. She's tough, but fair.

115
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,074
I watch a lot of daytime TV.
What's going on?

116
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,755
- Tomorrow, we're going to lunch.
- You couldn't have told me on the phone?

117
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,029
At the Lighthouse.

118
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,077
Yeah, except for
the Lighthouse is closed.

119
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,356
- Forever.
- Well, I got them to open it up again.

120
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,590
So we could take a look,
make sure we wanna buy it.

121
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,399
- Are you serious?
- I sure am. You can thank me later.

122
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,792
We were five martinis deep, we were
joking. There was singing involved.

123
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,996
I remember.
You alienated several waitresses.

124
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,237
- Well, that one liked me.
- You were drunk.

125
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,960
That's my point.
We cannot open a restaurant.

126
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,509
- That's crazy.
- Why? Why is that so crazy?

127
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,477
We don't know anything
about running one.

128
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,551
You managed the Lighthouse
for two years.

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,994
Two summers.

130
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,470
And I was stoned and drunk, in college.
It was the '80s.

131
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,596
You might wanna keep that
from the investors.

132
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,558
- Restaurants fail.
- Not all of them.

133
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,790
- I don't have the capital.
- I'm working on that.

134
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,873
- Look, it's not a good time for me.
- That's exactly my point.

135
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,998
If you don't find something soon,
the next stop for you is Phoenix.

136
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,469
The way I look at it,
you got nothing to lose.

137
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,232
And we both have everything to gain.

138
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,472
So, come on.
Am I gonna see you tomorrow?

139
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,150
- I'm sorry. I can't do lunch today.
- But what about tomorrow?

140
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,719
It's a little hectic right now.

141
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,111
The Fred Segal sale is happening.
I was thinking maybe Nobu. A road trip.

142
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,918
That's even less likely than lunch.

143
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,399
- Movie?
- No.

144
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,999
Coffee?

145
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,637
Julie, I really appreciate your desire
to be such good friends...

146
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,270
...but the thing about good friends
is that when they want something...

147
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,953
...they just ask.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,594
The interior design job.
I know it's available. I want it.

149
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,351
I thought you wanted me
to water your plants or babysit Kaitlin.

150
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,830
Because you don't take me seriously
as a working woman, as a designer.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,230
You're not really experienced, qualified.

152
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,231
Before I had Marissa,
I did lots of design work.

153
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,709
You had Marissa when you were 18.

154
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,520
I know your usual home designer
fell out at the last minute.

155
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,272
I know you have no one.

156
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,112
Caleb. Pillow talk.

157
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,590
- He thought the idea was inspired.
- Well, it's thinking outside the box.

158
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,070
He told me he's staying out of it, though.
That it's up to you.

159
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,870
Look. One house, one shot. If I screw up,
you can fire me yourself. It's a win-win.

160
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,157
Hi.

161
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,517
- What's so funny?
- Danny. He's, like, the funniest guy ever.

162
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,752
Yeah? Hey, man. I'm Seth.
Good to meet you.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,117
Your yellowtail is not as fresh as mine.
Dare to taste my albacore?

164
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,476
He's, like, straight out
of a Bruce Lee movie.

165
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,478
Hey, who took the jelly
out of your doughnut?

166
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,995
Somebody call <i>CSI</i>,
we got ourselves a cold one here.

167
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,794
- <i>CSI</i>!
- Hey, tag that toe.

168
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,038
All right, well, somebody call <i>ER</i>.
I think Luke's gonna bust a gut.

169
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,954
- I don't get it.
- Hey. Looks like we both got tuna.

170
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,277
Mine's just raw and missing cheese.

171
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,109
Time for class.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

172
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,078
Hey, don't fall in.

173
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,714
Hey.

174
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,634
Is this seat available?

175
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,753
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wow.

176
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,559
- I'm so behind already.
- I know the feeling.

177
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,235
Does junior year ever get easier?

178
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,634
I thought you were a senior.

179
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,198
Not a good one. And Harbor,
being as competitive as it is...

180
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,476
...not all my credits transferred.

181
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,513
- But you still wanted to come here?
- Wasn't up to me.

182
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,275
My parents insisted.
Put the paperwork in a while ago.

183
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,353
Why transfer at all,
a little over a semester from graduating?

184
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,633
It just wasn't working for me at Pacific.

185
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,599
Because?

186
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,430
Because there was an incident.

187
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,033
What kind of incident?

188
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,311
Look, I've made some mistakes in my life.

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,835
I don't think that's a surprise.
Or a secret.

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,390
But if you could just
give me a chance, Ryan.

191
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,393
Just let me in,
like I know people let you in.

192
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,153
I could finally start over.
That's really all I want.

193
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,518
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

194
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,874
Hey.

195
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,395
I thought maybe we could
go to Oliver's after school.

196
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,199
- Order in some room service.
- Yeah. You wanna come?

197
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,954
- I was gonna help him with his French.
- French?

198
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,955
- Didn't you live in Paris a couple years?
- A year. When I was 13.

199
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,678
And you need Marissa to help you?

200
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,632
Well, sweet-talking my way
into a club...

201
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,792
...isn't the same
as conjugating the infinitive.

202
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,796
Right. You guys go ahead.
I told Seth I'd meet him back home.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,515
- You sure you don't wanna come?
- Yeah. I trust you.

204
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,918
You should.

205
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,359
- I don't trust him.
- Trust who?

206
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,160
Summer's new boyfriend or whatever.

207
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,118
- Something sort of seems off about him.
- Off how?

208
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,748
I don't know. He's just not funny.

209
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,832
You know what I'm talking about.
He's big.

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,833
But big isn't necessarily funny. It's cheap.

211
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,872
He said there was an incident.

212
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,237
- Big funny guy did?
- No. Oliver.

213
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,520
Can we forget Oliver for five seconds
and talk about me?

214
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,830
It's the reason he left Pacific.
What if he's violent?

215
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,433
New guy shows up. Violent. Angry.

216
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,192
Prone to punching people.
That'd be weird.

217
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,669
He needs help with his French?
He lived in France.

218
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,832
We should call the cops.
Oliver lost his grasp on the subjunctive.

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,638
Fajitas are served.

220
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,675
Nothing adds up.
And if I try to say anything to Marissa...

221
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,556
- Maybe there's somebody I can talk to.
- Yeah.

222
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,474
Or you could break into the file room and
steal his bio. Or you can be a grownup...

223
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,394
...forget about it and move on. Okay?
Like I am. To the fajitas.

224
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,951
Hey, can I help you?

225
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,397
I forgot a book in my locker.

226
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,190
All right. It's open. Make it quick.

227
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,118
Hey, what are you doing?

228
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,431
I don't think I need to explain
what a serious offense this is.

229
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,751
We understand, and believe me
when I tell you, Ryan will be punished.

230
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,239
I'm afraid it won't end there.

231
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,039
This matter will be presented
to the disciplinary committee.

232
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,272
Suspension, even expulsion,
are not out of the question.

233
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,510
The school must do
what it deems appropriate.

234
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
But understand that this
is very uncharacteristic of Ryan.

235
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,996
Indeed. Mr. Atwood and Harbor
seem like a remarkably good fit.

236
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,470
Which leads me to wonder,
why would you do this?

237
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,873
I just... I don't trust this kid.
Oliver. He seems suspicious.

238
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,996
- Suddenly he's going here now.
- I assure you...

239
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,879
...Oliver went through the same
screening process as any student.

240
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,395
He has a history of instability.

241
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,913
I was concerned.

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,270
- For Marissa.
- Has he made any threats to her?

243
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,873
Anything to warrant your suspicions?

244
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,508
No, but he's been spending
a lot of time with her.

245
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,318
And there's this letter in his file...

246
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,516
- A confidential letter.
- Says they found him...

247
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,956
...in the men's bathroom at Pacific,
having cut his wrists...

248
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,117
...over a girl.

249
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,595
She filed a restraining order.
That's why he left.

250
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,512
- Is this true?
- Two years ago.

251
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,750
Since then he's been institutionalized.

252
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,753
And everyone involved
in Mr. Trask's rehabilitation...

253
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,753
...believed his best chance
was a change in his environment.

254
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,434
And the school was receptive to him
despite his history?

255
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,589
Harbor is known to make exceptions
for students with troubled backgrounds...

256
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,236
...but who show extraordinary promise.

257
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,470
- I'm sorry.
- We are too.

258
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,479
We will see you at 3 p.m.
For detention...

259
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,599
...which you will attend every day
until the committee reaches its verdict.

260
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,998
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

261
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,868
Thank you.

262
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,916
- Seth. Hey.
- Hey.

263
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,638
- I have a surprise for you.
- Really?

264
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,872
Two tickets to see Bright Eyes.

265
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,679
We've never seen them before.
I thought it'd be different.

266
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,956
- Bright Eyes, really?
- Yes.

267
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,230
- Summer, you got... Right there.
- Where?

268
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,038
- Hey.
- Hey, you guys.

269
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,111
- Hey, Summer. Hi, Danny.
- Hey. Oh, Seth.

270
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,794
You got a little nasty there.

271
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,359
- Okay.
- No, seriously.

272
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,556
You got a tuna stain or something.

273
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,235
- Well, I'll be sure and get it washed.
- Seth, seriously. All kidding aside...

274
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,676
...you've got something there, and
I think you're gonna wanna clean it up.

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,231
- Seth, you do have something there.
- What?

276
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,275
- You got me.
- God, isn't he, like, the funniest guy ever?

277
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,158
- Yes.
- Hey.

278
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,072
You wanna come over later?
I TiVo-ed Leno.

279
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,878
Sure.

280
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,915
God. Who watches Leno?
That explains everything.

281
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,355
- Explains what?
- Why that Danny guy is so not funny.

282
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,351
- He's funny.
- No, he's not funny, okay?

283
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,715
- He's big. Big is not funny.
- Whatever.

284
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,668
- Seth. Friday night. Bright Eyes?
- Anyone can be big. That's my point.

285
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,638
Right? Being obvious,
there's no accomplishment in that.

286
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,037
- What?
- You're jealous.

287
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,873
Of Danny's comedy?
No, sweetie, I'm not.

288
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,635
No, of Danny. If you weren't,
you'd be happy for Summer.

289
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,597
You'd embrace the friend.

290
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,674
I love this place. All it needs
is a little nip and a tuck.

291
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,671
But are we the right doctors for the job?

292
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,832
Hands of a surgeon. Come on, Coop.
Get excited. Get involved.

293
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,116
We'll blow this wall out,
make it all one room.

294
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,510
Big leather booths.
Keep it dark, but not too dark.

295
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,875
You know, just like it was
for Bogie and Bacall.

296
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,873
- You're serious about this, aren't you?
- Yeah. What do you got?

297
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,438
- They used to have great live music here.
- I like it. Cabaret?

298
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,397
- Actually, jazz.
- Jazz works. That's good.

299
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,478
- How about a raw bar?
- Okay.

300
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,437
- As long as it feels timeless.
- It will.

301
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,354
Gary Cooper was a big oyster man.
And a big drinker.

302
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,476
Okay, so no frou-frou drinks.
No umbrellas.

303
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,835
No fruit wedges.
Nothing Gary wouldn't approve of.

304
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,709
- Only one kind of martini.
- Thank you. And only the finest Scotch.

305
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,190
Now, we're gonna have
to have meat loaf on the menu.

306
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,032
My mother makes
the greatest meat loaf.

307
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,236
- I can get the recipe.
- No, my mother makes...

308
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,709
...the greatest meat loaf,
and I have the recipe.

309
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,752
There can be two meat loafs
on the menu.

310
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,558
We'll make restaurant history.

311
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,553
Hello, Lighthouse. Your ship has come in.

312
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,069
Now, you know where you're going
for the slate, yes?

313
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,915
Brenda Antin has the seagrass mats, and
Betsie von Toff is going to do the flowers.

314
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,310
Hydrangeas only, people. Okay.

315
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,232
We have 72 hours
to make this open house.

316
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,311
I want a full progress report
and POs today.

317
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,550
Let's get it done. Go.

318
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,279
Hey. Sorry about your office, Kiki.
I needed a base camp...

319
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,357
...for Operation Model Home.
- Okay, Julie.

320
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,433
I think maybe a little bit
you've lost your mind. This is a disaster.

321
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,068
Kirsten, if you stopped open-heart
surgery halfway through...

322
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,514
...it would look like murder.

323
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,037
You have 72 hours.
I gave you a list of the usual vendors.

324
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,111
See, there's that word, "usual."

325
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,829
What I'm doing is special. It's inspired.

326
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,709
- You're never gonna get done in time.
- Good attitude.

327
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,757
Thanks for putting that out
in the universe.

328
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,391
All you need is a few accent rugs,
a couch, maybe a potted plant.

329
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,393
- We're selling a space.
- Well, I'm selling a lifestyle.

330
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,916
Kirsten, the Newport Group
should be an aspirational brand.

331
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,196
"Aspirational"? Is that even a word?

332
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,909
I know it seems ambitious.
And it'll be expensive, but sometimes...

333
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,469
...you gotta spend money to make money.

334
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,389
Hey, are you hungry? I'm starved.

335
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,357
Why'd you do it? If they vote to expel
you, there's nothing we can do.

336
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,035
You will have taken this opportunity
and tanked it. And why?

337
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,716
- Are you jealous of this Oliver kid?
- No. No, I'm not jealous.

338
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,839
Look, you guys may not believe me.
No one may believe me.

339
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,754
The first time I met the kid, he was in jail.
He has a medical history. You're right.

340
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,798
Okay. He's trouble. Now you're
the one who might be expelled.

341
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,952
- Lf only you had come to us.
- I wanted to deal with it myself.

342
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,792
- Well done.
- Do you know how hard we...?

343
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,633
- You worked to get into that school?
- You can't help Marissa.

344
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,156
- You can't even help yourself.
- Okay. I screwed up, yet again.

345
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,038
So now what?

346
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,874
You gonna kick me out?

347
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,552
You think you can mess up so bad
we'll just give up on you? You can't.

348
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,349
You are part of this family now, and
you're gonna feel the full weight of that.

349
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,909
You're gonna wish we threw you out.

350
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,159
Hey, man.

351
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,152
I couldn't help but overhear.
Actually, I was eavesdropping.

352
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,072
They're pretty pissed, huh?

353
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,118
- Yeah, well, I deserved it.
- Yeah?

354
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,309
Well, good. So this is over then, though?
I mean, lesson learned and all that?

355
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,788
Today I saw Oliver give Marissa a letter...

356
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,791
...which she put in her locker.

357
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,189
And seeing Oliver do this inspired you
to write a letter of your own?

358
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,990
So this is Oliver's letter.

359
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,716
That Marissa asked you to mail?

360
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,040
- I took it from her locker.
- Dude, what is wrong with you?

361
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,713
- You haven't read it?
- No, not yet.

362
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,348
Not ever. You can't read it.
You have to put it back.

363
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,670
What if he's after her? He's a sick kid.

364
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,229
Oliver has not done anything to Marissa
except be her friend.

365
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,795
Okay, stop it.
You're in enough trouble already.

366
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,753
And honestly, you're starting
to freak me out a little bit.

367
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,950
Just... Will you promise me
that you will put it back?

368
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,994
Will you promise me
that you will put it back?

369
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,951
- Put it back.
- I will.

370
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,314
Put it back.

371
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,359
Come in.

372
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,399
Hey, man.

373
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,197
Okay, I know everything you said
last night, but I need to talk to you.

374
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,191
- You read it?
- It's worse than I imagined.

375
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,828
- No, please don't.
- He says he can't live without her...

376
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,230
I don't wanna hear it.
That letter's like <i>The Ring</i>.

377
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,198
Anyone who reads it is gonna die.
Plus, it's a federal offense.

378
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,749
- Okay. I'm being serious.
- So am I. Okay?

379
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,390
That is Marissa's letter
that you stole from her locker and read?

380
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,471
- Lf she finds out, you guys are done.
- Okay.

381
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,596
- I get that. Oliver...
- Oliver might be crazy.

382
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,036
You might be right. But right now,
you're giving him a run for his money.

383
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,479
Hey, Seth. Is Ryan in there?

384
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,433
Yeah. Hey.

385
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,997
Hey. What are you guys doing?

386
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,310
Ryan was waxing my back.
Could you give us a sec?

387
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,909
Sure. I just wanted to know
if after school today...

388
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,548
...you wanted to take
that cooking lesson with Oliver?

389
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,151
I can't. I'm helping Kirsten move furniture
in the new model home.

390
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,594
Julie?

391
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,154
It's a disaster.

392
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,072
What was all that
about open-heart surgery?

393
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,514
I lost the patient.

394
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,557
- What happened?
- It's what didn't happen.

395
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,028
No slate. No bubbling fountains.
No seagrass.

396
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,433
Hydrangeas are out of season.

397
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,478
We have 48 hours until the open house,
and we have nothing.

398
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,312
- We can fix this.
- No, we can't.

399
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,438
Way to put that into the universe.

400
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,270
I'll call my vendors.
It may not be anything special.

401
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,158
It may not be "aspirational."

402
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,437
God, I don't give a rat's ass.
If Caleb sees that house empty...

403
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,195
He won't. But you gotta be ready
to work. Get your hands dirty.

404
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,959
Manicure's not till Friday.

405
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,952
Can I have an orange-peel smoothie
with a splash of pineapple, please?

406
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,872
I'll have the same.

407
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,231
Except with some strawberry and banana.

408
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,036
Mr. Palmer totally looks like a pterodactyl.

409
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,958
God, he does impersonations?

410
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,592
Hey, why you all up in my Kool-Aid
not even knowing the flavor?

411
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,074
- Hey, Summer.
- What?

412
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,832
- You know who wants a smoothie?
- Who?

413
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,276
- Mr. Chuckle!
- No! Oh, my God.

414
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,951
Danny. Hey, what are you
doing after school?

415
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,350
You wanna maybe come over
and hang out at my house?

416
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,909
I've TiVo-ed some Leno.
Seann William Scott's on.

417
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,356
Oh, Leno. Sean William Scott. Nice.
Double the comedy.

418
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,873
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it.

419
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,992
Hey, man. I thought you were in court.

420
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,720
No, it's a settlement.
I almost never go to court anymore.

421
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,759
So order up some martinis and meat loaf.
We got ourselves a restaurant.

422
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,160
Well, I thought you'd be
a little more excited.

423
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,231
- What'd you do?
- I put a down payment on it.

424
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,833
Tomorrow we go sign the title.

425
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,719
I haven't had a chance to come up
with my share of the money.

426
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,917
No, I covered it. We can work out
a get-even scheme once we're afloat.

427
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,117
- So, what? I work for you?
- Jimmy, come on.

428
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,635
You were one click away
from manning the mechanical bull...

429
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,835
...at the new cowboy bar.

430
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,151
I wanna pull my own weight. You've
already done enough for me as it is.

431
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,753
I'm not doing it just for you.

432
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,230
This could mean freedom for both of us.
You could stay at a job you like...

433
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,029
...and it'd give me a break from all
my rich clients and the office politics.

434
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,668
- We could work for ourselves.
- I don't know, Sandy.

435
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,638
- I think I need more time to...
- How much more time do you need?

436
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,432
It's too fast. It's too soon.

437
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,757
Okay. Great. Great. I got an idea.
Let's wait till we're dead.

438
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,232
I gotta go settle.

439
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,317
That is so cool
that you know Marissa's combo.

440
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,799
Shows a lot of trust.

441
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,273
- Yeah, for emergencies.
- Oh, yeah?

442
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,309
What's the emergency? Ran out
of erasers? No more ink left in your pen?

443
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,994
No, it's a book I forgot.

444
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,628
Just kidding around, man.

445
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,589
Last class of the day
is so tough to get through.

446
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,478
- Feel you on that one.
- What's up?

447
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,400
Hey, Marissa and I were
talking about a camping trip.

448
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,710
Santa Monica mountains?
Bring the whole gang?

449
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,113
- Sure. Yeah.
- Sounds awesome, man.

450
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,430
All right. I'll let her know that you are in.

451
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,879
Long bathroom break.
I should go. See you.

452
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,118
I do not like that kid at all.

453
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,272
Yeah? Don't you think that...?

454
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,829
He's here for Marissa. Hell, yeah.

455
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,039
You gotta let that guy know, "back off."

456
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,799
I'll do it for you, if you want.

457
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,758
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Just give me the word...

458
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,673
...and I will drop the Great Gatsby.

459
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,678
Did your mama teach you
how to play this game?

460
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,070
You didn't think I'd pack the heat,
did you?

461
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,516
Think you can just get me here, huh?
Home court advantage. Guess what.

462
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,353
Who's got the secret codes? Danny does.

463
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,997
Guess what, buddy. You are <i>Punk'd</i>.

464
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,958
There's a camera there, camera there
and a camera right there.

465
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,269
- Who's your daddy?
- Hey, kid.

466
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,954
Settlement happened sooner
than I thought.

467
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,430
- Good. This is my friend Danny.
- Hey. How are you? I'm Sandy.

468
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,279
Why don't you take a shower?

469
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,875
- Pardon me?
- Just kidding. I like you dirty.

470
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,632
Sandy. Dirty. Sandy. Dirty.

471
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,991
- That kid is not funny.
- Thank you. I know.

472
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,749
- He makes Ryan look funny.
- He makes Marissa look funny.

473
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,438
Gentiles. I love your mother
more than words, but not funny.

474
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,989
Get yourself some funnier friends.

475
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,393
- There you are.
- Thanks, man.

476
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,711
- Sure.
- I'm so parched.

477
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,996
Oh, dude. Have you seen
my impression of Mr. Parker?

478
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,310
Yes. Pterodactyl. Seen it. It's good.

479
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,117
- Hey, listen, man. Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure.

480
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,840
Whenever you're around Summer,
could you...?

481
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,675
This is weird, but could you try
and be a little less funny?

482
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,752
Man, all I ever hear from her
is how funny Seth Cohen is.

483
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,480
How he's the funniest guy
she's ever met.

484
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,838
I mean, I like her so much, and I'm just...
I'm killing myself to hang in there.

485
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,076
She said that about me,
that she thinks I'm the funniest guy ever?

486
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,198
Yes. You and some dude
named Captain Oats.

487
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,033
Who the hell is Captain Oats?

488
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,473
Well, chin up, Danny.
Because you know what?

489
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,793
I think you're funny. I just think,
and if you don't mind me saying so...

490
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,999
...that you could go a little bigger
with your comedy. I think you're small...

491
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,912
...a little under the radar.
- Yeah?

492
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,877
- Yeah, big's hilarious.
- Big.

493
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,837
- Yeah.
- All right, man. Thanks.

494
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,718
- I'll give that a shot.
- Give it a shot.

495
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,552
I'll give it a shot!

496
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,268
Thanks for making time for me
after school.

497
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,228
- I know how busy you are.
- Of course. What's going on?

498
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,476
Why don't you have a seat.

499
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,069
So I know this is a little outside
my job description as dean.

500
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,472
I felt I had a responsibility
to have an honest conversation with you.

501
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,831
- What is it?
- I need to talk to you about...

502
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,231
...one of our transfer students, with
whom I know you have a relationship.

503
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,552
- And who I worry might not be so stable.
- I appreciate it, Dr. Kim.

504
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,075
But I'm well aware of Oliver's issues.

505
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,356
It's not Oliver I want to talk about.

506
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,197
Detention's over, gentlemen.
See you tomorrow.

507
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,236
I thought you were helping Kirsten.

508
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,152
- I got detention.
- I see that. What for?

509
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,233
I failed this chemistry quiz,
slacking off on some homework.

510
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,834
That's a lie.

511
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,758
- What are you talking about?
- I heard what happened, your break-in.

512
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,235
- I did it to protect you.
- What? What are you talking about?

513
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,233
I don't trust him. He has a history
of girls he's obsessed with.

514
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,719
He's not obsessed with me.

515
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,913
You know, ever since he showed up,
you never trusted him.

516
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,196
And okay, that's who you are...

517
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,920
...but you have to trust me.
- The kid has serious issues.

518
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,514
- Who doesn't?
- He's in love with you.

519
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,074
We're just friends.

520
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,114
Yeah.

521
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,917
Then what's this?

522
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,793
Where did you get this?

523
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,678
You stole it from my locker?

524
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,591
I've been looking everywhere for this.

525
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,519
So you know what this is?
What this says?

526
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,874
I can't believe you.

527
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,435
I can't believe you stole it. You read it.

528
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,591
How can you say
he's not in love with you?

529
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,957
Because he didn't write it to me.
He wrote it to Natalie.

530
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,272
He wants to get back together with her.
And he just wanted me to read it first.

531
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,952
- Look, I'm sorry.
- I can't do this anymore.

532
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,438
Because now...

533
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,236
...I don't trust you.

534
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,434
- Morning.
- Morning.

535
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,554
You okay?

536
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,518
Well, I'm supposed to sign
the title on the Lighthouse today.

537
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,511
I can't believe
you're buying a restaurant.

538
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,717
Funny. That's what Jimmy said
just before he backed out.

539
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,438
He did?

540
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,477
I know the whole idea seems crazy,
but I thought that was part of the appeal.

541
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,355
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna have to buy a little time...

542
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,714
...and not lose the place.

543
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,714
Well, you can always hire Julie
as a partner. I think she'll be available.

544
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,348
I have to show my father
the model home this morning...

545
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,750
...and we had no time to pull it together.

546
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,276
- I believe he will be underwhelmed.
- The Coopers keep things unpredictable.

547
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,590
No. I predicted that Julie would be fired.

548
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,591
Top of the morning to you, son.

549
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,316
- You talk to Ryan last night?
- No, he just came home and went to bed.

550
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,273
Hey. Do you want something to eat?
You missed dinner, you must be hungry.

551
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,874
- I'm okay. Thanks.
- What time's Marissa picking you up?

552
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,157
- I was gonna maybe go early with Anna.
- Marissa's not picking me up.

553
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,678
He hasn't called yet.

554
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,629
- I know.
- Is it bad that he hasn't called yet?

555
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,870
It doesn't mean anything.

556
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,317
Here you go, Mr. Nichol.

557
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,434
- Hello.
- Hi, Cal.

558
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,919
Hey, Dad.

559
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,877
I just got back
from the new development.

560
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,153
Look, it was short notice and
Julie did the best she could, considering.

561
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,838
You're preaching to the converted.
I loved it.

562
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,150
The d Ácor was simple, classic.
The way I like it.

563
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,120
It allows the architecture and views
to sell themselves.

564
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,588
- You're happy?
- You're happy?

565
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,753
Pleased as punch. How Julie here
hit one out of the park on her first swing.

566
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,840
What can I say? It's my true passion.

567
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,238
Well, now your passion's your job.

568
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,233
Kiki, stop looking for a new decorator.
We've found our girl.

569
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,549
- We have?
- We have?

570
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,757
The fact that you two are such close
friends makes the decision easier.

571
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,276
Be fun. You two working together,
side by side.

572
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,229
Have you lost your mind, Kiki?
That thing is unsightly.

573
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,828
Well, who could have predicted this?

574
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,312
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, Cohen.

575
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,674
How are you?

576
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,910
- Okay.
- Yeah?

577
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,235
It's just Danny.
I mean, he was, like, really funny, right?

578
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,798
- Yeah.
- And now, all of a sudden, he's gotten...

579
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,828
...big.

580
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,912
Hey, Seth. Check it out!

581
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,237
Get off me!

582
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,757
- Now, that's funny.
- Yeah.

583
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,473
Well, that's the end of him.

584
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,839
I guess I really will end up
bitter and alone.

585
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,793
Hey.

586
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,791
I'm sorry.

587
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,590
And I thought he was a good one.

588
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,877
But I guess people can be
really unpredictable.

589
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,634
You know?

590
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,597
- Hey.
- Hey.

591
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,751
- Nice scarf.
- You too.

592
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,433
- So it's <i>croque-monsieur</i> Thursday.
- Yes, it is.

593
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,717
- I was thinking fish sticks.
- I was gonna have peanut butter and jelly.

594
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,395
That's great.
Well, I'm gonna just go wash up.

595
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,754
- We'll go eat?
- Okay.

596
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,388
All right. Bye.

597
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,792
- Well, I'm gonna go.
- Yeah, well.

598
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,759
I have to go ice Big Funny Guy, so...

599
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,037
Well, if you're ever feeling, you know...

600
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,913
...too bitter and Ionely,
I TiVo-ed some <i>Daily Show</i>s.

601
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,674
I know Jon Stewart's no Leno.

602
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,079
Thanks.

603
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,196
My dad died and left me this place.
I never thought I'd have to sell it.

604
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,272
It was such a magical spot,
when I was a kid.

605
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,954
Don't sell it. Just give me
more time to find a partner.

606
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,317
Sandy, I got two other offers
on the table. I can't wait any longer.

607
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,993
I understand.

608
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,357
I'm not too late, am I?

609
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,158
Who's this?

610
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,117
My partner.

611
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,393
I found him.

612
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,189
That conversation we just had about not
wanting to buy the place? Forget it.

613
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,638
Look, you know, this could fail.
I mean, you know...

614
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,917
...I could fail again. I pretty much
only have a legacy of failure.

615
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,152
I could be responsible for ruining
this place, ruining our friendship.

616
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,992
Jimmy. Just sign it.

617
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,513
Okay.

618
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,309
I heard what happened
between you and Marissa.

619
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,953
Yeah.

620
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,598
I'm sorry.

621
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,274
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

622
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,717
I was wrong about you.

623
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,870
Well, I mean, did you think I came here
because of Marissa?

624
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,954
What, because I'm in love with her?

625
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,997
Yeah. No. I...

626
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,998
It was crazy.

627
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,714
Here's the deal, Ryan.
And it's nothing personal.

628
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,798
But Marissa and I, we just connect.

629
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,991
She understands me, gets me.

630
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,549
I don't know if there's only one person
on the planet...

631
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,153
...you're supposed to be with...

632
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,790
...but when she and I are together,
sure feels that way.

633
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,597
I'm sorry, but you and Marissa?
Come on, man.

634
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,194
- You're from different worlds.
- You stay away from her.

635
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,749
You can't fight fate, man.

636
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,156
I didn't even have to lift a finger,
and look what happened to you guys.

637
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,118
Because you're not supposed
to be together.

638
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,595
I'm not saying
you didn't serve your purpose.

639
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,638
If it wasn't for you,
she would've never gone to therapy.

640
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,395
- She never would've met me.
- I am not gonna let this happen.

641
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,393
At this point, who's gonna believe you?

642
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,639
Walk away...

643
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,030
...you have a chance
to make something of yourself.

644
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,869
Don't blow it over some chick
you're not gonna care about in 10 years.

645
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,674
Okay?

646
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,119
I really am sorry.

647
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,876
Hey! Hey! Back off!

648
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,518
