1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,317
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- What? You're driving.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,118
Yeah, because you're drunk.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,949
- Stop, okay? You're scaring me.
- Good. You're scaring me.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,314
I called the therapist.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,959
- Mom.
- She's right, kiddo.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,316
Therapy was part of the deal
of you moving in.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,277
I know you. You go to Harbor, right?

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,839
- Marissa Cooper.
- What's wrong with you?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,150
Your sister,
do you ever hear from her?

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,151
The number I have
is no longer in service.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,072
I like you. So does she.

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,557
- Lf we don't put an end to this soon...
- Someone's gonna get hurt.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,751
So maybe next time
we go see a movie...

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,229
...it won't be a three-hour
period piece about boats.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,152
They call them ships. And I liked it.

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,153
I don't know. Russell Crowe,
he just doesn't do anything for me.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,595
I mean, people say
he's good-Iooking...

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,512
...but I don't see it.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,557
- I never really thought about it.
- Hey.

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,790
Only one more day left in 2003.

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,030
It's been a good year.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,673
Yes. My parents got divorced,
my dad went bankrupt...

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,237
...and I OD'd.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,355
I meant...

25
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,635
...for me.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,912
I know. I can't wait to celebrate
the new year...

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,672
...with you.

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,630
So, what do you wanna do?
I heard of some parties...

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,236
Maybe we should take it easy
after what happened at Christmas.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,674
What happened at Christmas?

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,039
It's all kind of a blur, actually.

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,355
Kidding.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,672
Funny.

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,273
I thought we could hang here.

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,877
You know, maybe rent a couple
Russell Crowe movies.

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,157
Stay in...

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,158
...so I know you'll be safe.

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,471
I love you.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,428
I mean...

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,318
l... I didn't mean... I...

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,314
Thank you.

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,511
You're welcome.

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,469
Midnight. Curfew.

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,279
I love you.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,429
I love you.

46
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,238
How hard is that to say?

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,949
Saying it's easy.

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,113
Meaning it?

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,118
That's the hard part.

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,474
- Who the hell are you?
- It's a long story. Who the hell are you?

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,108
It doesn't work that way, dude.
It's my pool house.

52
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,191
Actually, dude, it's my pool house.

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,793
So this is yours.

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,879
You want it back?

55
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,190
I got plenty, thanks.

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,317
You're Kirsten's sister Hailey, right?

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,836
So you've heard of me. I guess
Kirsten remembers I actually do exist.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,275
- She didn't say you were coming.
- She doesn't know.

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,352
Look, we'll get it all
sorted out over breakfast.

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,795
The living room couch
is pretty comfortable.

61
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,559
And...

62
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,795
...Iove you too.

63
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,433
Hey.

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,670
What happened to you?
Lady kick you to the curb?

65
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,638
The pool house was occupied.
Your aunt.

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,836
- Hailey's here? Awesome.
- Yeah, she's...

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,197
Nine across, seven-letter word for...

68
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,158
Separate seats, you guys.
There's no sex in the champagne room.

69
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,709
- Good morning to you too.
- Morning. Where's Hailey?

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,510
- I don't know. Thailand. Morocco.
- I think she's planting trees in Tacoma.

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,398
Costa Rica, building churches.

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,716
I think it was Nicaragua,
and they were hospitals.

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,156
- She's in the pool house.
- What are you talking about?

74
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,920
Did you not notice Ryan
sleeping on the couch?

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,877
Your sister's here.

76
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,871
Wait, wait. You saw her...

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,749
...you were talking to her, or...?
Did she say why she was here?

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,798
I have two guesses.
Either she's run out of money...

79
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,313
...or she's run out of money.

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,391
Three-letter word for hilarious?

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,039
"Dad." Write that down.

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,714
- She is probably out of money, though.
- Hailey's here.

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,673
Hey, guys. Guess who's back.

84
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,193
Hello, Hailey.

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,920
Aunt Hailey.
Later, when you're dressed, we'll hug.

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,152
Seth. Robe. Her. Now.

87
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,951
There you are.

88
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,838
- Happy New Year, everyone.
- Happy New Year.

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,553
Hi.

90
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,271
We would have come
and picked you up...

91
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,352
...at the airport or the train station.
- Or the border.

92
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,159
Yeah, well, it was late,
and my cell phone got shut off.

93
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,799
When you ran out of money?

94
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,396
So you're gonna stay with us.
For some time?

95
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,278
I'm gonna make up the guest bedroom.
Bedding, sheets, now.

96
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,433
Married 17 years, the first things that go
are the full sentences. Welcome back.

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,079
Thanks.

98
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,357
Looking good, nephew Seth.

99
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,078
Thank you. Puberty happened.

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,834
- It's been that long?
- It sure has. Be glad you missed it.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,718
Check this out though.

102
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,315
Chest hair. And a new friend.

103
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,357
Yeah, that's Ryan. He's...

104
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,999
He's kind of a long story.

105
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,753
So now that you're a man,
what are the New Year's Eve plans?

106
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,229
Got any girls to kiss?

107
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,789
I had two. And now I have none.
But it's cool.

108
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,349
- Because I swore off women.
- Right.

109
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,557
I took myself off the market.
I'll do whatever Ryan and Marissa do.

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,358
Marissa. The short chick next door?

111
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,670
No. Puberty happened. She's a Laker.

112
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,751
Sounds like Ryan and Marissa
won't do much...

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,957
...because of three little words
Ryan couldn't say.

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,633
- Where's the Frosted Flakes?
- That's four.

115
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,916
"I love you."

116
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,355
Shut up.
Ryan, Marissa said that to you?

117
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,713
- Okay, what did you say?
- "Thank you."

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,434
Well, guess we'll be
staying in tonight.

119
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,591
Carson Daly and a ball dropping.

120
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,079
There's two images that should
never be said in the same sentence.

121
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,439
Nice of the doctors to keep
the offices open today...

122
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,592
...with all our resolutions to analyze
before they're broken.

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,359
Yeah, it was nice of them.

124
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,239
So, what are they?

125
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,153
Your resolutions
that you're never gonna keep.

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,469
Give me one. At least one.

127
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,312
I'm gonna eat more vegetables.

128
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,552
Wow. You and the doc
really went deep.

129
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,838
- What about dairy? Grains?
- Actually, we feel good about the grains.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,673
And tonight, New Year's Eve,
you're a social chair.

131
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,717
I'm sure you've organized
several events.

132
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,792
- Ferris wheels, balloon animals?
- Done that.

133
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,916
So, what's the deal?

134
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,833
You ask a lot of questions.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,115
One of us has to.

136
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,349
What are you doing?

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,476
Well, now that you've asked...

138
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,915
I'm having a party at my place.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,592
You live in the Four Seasons?

140
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,196
Come by and I'll explain everything.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,149
Yeah, maybe we will.

142
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,198
"We," as in you and your friend?

143
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,035
My boyfriend, Ryan.
He wants to stay in. He's not as social.

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,191
My girlfriend's the same way. Natalie.

145
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,397
But she'll be there.
I can meet him, you can meet her.

146
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,313
- It's a party.
- Yeah. Hopefully I'll see you there.

147
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,996
There'll be veggies. No painkillers.
But crudit Ás<i>,</i> some celery, dip.

148
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,151
Well, as long as there's dip.

149
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,510
Can we focus for a moment?

150
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,557
On the fact that you've gotten matronly
in the last two years?

151
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,278
Two years is what I want to focus on.

152
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,070
What am I gonna wear tonight?
A little Ann Taylor, little Ralph Lauren.

153
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,274
Oh, my God. Is this from Talbots?

154
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,591
It was a gift. Haven't you been living
in hostels, out of a backpack...

155
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,910
...wearing hemp clothes?
- That was last year, Kiki.

156
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,392
Don't call me Kiki. Only Dad calls me Kiki.
And only because he won't not.

157
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,196
- You do remember Dad, don't you?
- I have a vague recollection.

158
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,237
Well, wait till he hears you're back.

159
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,231
You know,
I was gonna tell him in due time.

160
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,312
You have two weeks
before he gets back from Paris...

161
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,708
...with Julie Cooper.

162
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,438
Dad and Julie Cooper?

163
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,155
At least he's dating somebody my age,
not yours.

164
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,151
How does Jimmy Cooper feel about this?

165
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,958
Pretty good...

166
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,998
...now that they're getting a divorce.
- Things have picked up.

167
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,798
You know, I should come back
more often.

168
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,155
Hailey, what are your plans exactly?

169
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,312
- Ladies. So I'm gonna go...
- Surfing? Fun. Where?

170
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,677
- At the spot by the place.
- Four-footers. I heard that too.

171
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,236
- Sunglasses?
- Yeah, I was just gonna ask you.

172
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,038
Kitchen. So tonight?

173
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,430
Yeah, what time should I make
the reservations?

174
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,589
- Eight?
- Eight.

175
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,990
- Perfect. Table?
- The usual.

176
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,113
- I love you.
- You too.

177
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,717
What?

178
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,757
You guys are like...

179
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,717
...married.
- Well, that was the idea.

180
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,519
- When we had our wedding?
- No, I mean, like...

181
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,679
...deeply, deeply married.

182
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,390
Forget it.
Anyway, so tonight you guys...

183
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,994
Are going to dinner at the Arches.
We do it every year.

184
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,515
Home in time to watch Dick Clark
and the ball drop.

185
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,955
Two images that shouldn't be used
in the same sentence.

186
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,192
It's too bad you're busy tonight.
I know this really great party...

187
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,510
...where you guys would have,
like, actual fun.

188
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,148
But I understand. You're boring now.

189
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,916
I am not boring.

190
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,435
- Hey, baby, I can't find...
- Keys?

191
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,194
- Check your...
- Pants. You're good.

192
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,237
Gucci. Now we're talking.

193
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,154
- And I will be wearing this.
- To the Arches? That's kind of fancy.

194
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,757
Hey, Sandy, after our annual dinner,
how do you feel about a party?

195
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,751
We're not going to a party.
We made plans.

196
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,196
- To do nothing.
- Who's Oliver?

197
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,669
A guy from therapy.

198
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,957
Hey, there'll be crudit Ás. And dip.

199
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,550
Sorry. I guess it's more
of an inside joke.

200
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,394
Between you and Oliver?
You guys have inside jokes?

201
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,551
It'll be fun. There'll be people.

202
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,631
As opposed to here,
where it'll just be us.

203
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,912
I thought you wanted to do nothing.

204
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,995
- Yeah, well, that was before...
- Right. Before I...

205
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,635
- What?
- Because I didn't say...

206
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,553
- What?
- When you said...

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,833
- What?
- Never mind.

208
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,832
So are you going?

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,150
I'm staying here, watching movies.
Like we agreed.

210
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,471
- Okay. Well, if you change your mind...
- So you're going?

211
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,916
Like I said. Yep.

212
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,238
Happy New Year.

213
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,271
Happy New Year.

214
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,558
You know what you did?

215
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,075
You know what you did?
You blew it, buddy.

216
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,595
Almost as bad as I did.
But you know what?

217
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,318
We're both single now,
it's a new year.

218
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,789
We should join Friendster,
meet new people.

219
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,190
We didn't break up.
It's just New Year's Eve.

220
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,033
Only the most important chick holiday
besides Valentine's Day.

221
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,988
- Why don't you just go to this party?
- Because we had plans, and...

222
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,712
Because, I mean, who's Oliver?

223
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,318
Okay. As long as you're clear
on your motivation.

224
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,710
- Okay, we're gonna go.
- Do you guys need anything?

225
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,836
Yes. Ryan needs a tear
in the space-time continuum...

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,072
...so he can go back and say
"I love you" to Marissa.

227
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,912
She said "I love you"?

228
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,597
- So what did you say back?
- "Thank you."

229
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,910
- Thank you.
- Well, that was polite.

230
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,196
That's what I said.

231
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,519
- You guys have fun.
- See you.

232
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,875
- I love you guys.
- Thank you.

233
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,069
- You guys look hot.
- Hey, don't sound so surprised.

234
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,994
Let's go. Move it out. I don't want to see
you crazy kids back here before 2.

235
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,672
Thanks for this.

236
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,229
When we get back,
we'll talk about your plan...

237
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,233
...and how long you're here. And why.

238
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,348
You're okay about tonight?

239
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,432
I'm just gonna catch up with
some friends. Don't worry about me.

240
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,639
- You guys deserve to have some fun.
- I couldn't agree more. Let's go.

241
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,597
- Happy New Year.
- Thanks.

242
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,879
What are you guys doing here?
You're not even dressed.

243
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,589
I know. I told you.
We're not going out. Carson Daly. Balls.

244
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,797
- I thought you were being sarcastic.
- Usually a safe assumption.

245
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,793
- Where's your lady friend?
- Out at a party.

246
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,599
Your girlfriend's at
a New Year's Eve party alone?

247
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,955
She's not alone.
She's with some guy named Oliver.

248
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,350
- You've gotten really glib.
- You guys broke up.

249
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,715
We're just not spending
New Year's Eve together.

250
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,314
You know what they say,
the way you spend New Year's Eve...

251
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,232
...is the way you'll spend
the rest of the year.

252
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,075
So, at the countdown to midnight,
when she's looking for someone to kiss...

253
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,435
...and you're playing video games
about pirates...

254
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,754
- Ninjas.
...and it's like, 10, nine, eight...

255
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,276
...and she's all alone,
when she sees this guy Oliver.

256
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,432
Seven, six, five.

257
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,194
Fireworks start, music swells.

258
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,191
Four, three.

259
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,272
People are pairing off.
Who's she gonna kiss?

260
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,394
Two, one.

261
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,118
- You guys look hot.
- Too hot?

262
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,669
Because I'm trying to keep
a low profile these days.

263
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,196
- Thanks for getting me out of the house.
- Hey, you're part of the family...

264
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,477
...and we look out for our own.
Now, let's go. Come on.

265
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,834
Out.

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,797
- You wanna come?
- No.

267
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,279
I'm gonna...

268
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,839
...hang out.

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,069
Take it easy, lay low.

270
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,593
All right.

271
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,832
Hailey Nichol!

272
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,398
- Taking it easy?
- Laying low?

273
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,391
Just a couple of friends.

274
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,675
This is gonna be totally fun.

275
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,593
We're at the penthouse
of the Four Seasons.

276
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,830
I know. It's just...

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,115
...you know?

278
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,794
Coop, the way you spend
your New Year's Eve...

279
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,997
...is the way you're gonna spend
the rest of the year.

280
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,434
- It is?
- Yeah.

281
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,477
And you're not gonna think of Ryan.

282
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,631
And I am so not thinking
of Seth Cohen...

283
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,155
...and how pathetic it is
that he's staying home...

284
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,675
...probably playing, like,
a stupid video game about...

285
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,515
...like, pirates or ninjas
or something.

286
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,909
Oh, right. The Four Seasons.
Penthouse.

287
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,710
It's undeniable.

288
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,357
- Hey, people I know.
- Where?

289
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,078
Hey, Anna. What are you doing here?

290
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,277
My parents are friends of the parents
of the guy who's throwing this.

291
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,873
- You know Oliver?
- Who?

292
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,270
Hey, you made it.
Come on, I'll show you around.

293
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,078
Okay.

294
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,278
So where's Seth?

295
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,160
I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

296
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,709
I don't know, and I don't care.

297
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,509
Me either.
Seth Cohen is, like, so 2003.

298
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,037
And in, like, 74 minutes,
I'll never have to think about him again.

299
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,953
- Seventy-three.
- Even better.

300
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,552
Skinny-dipping!

301
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,552
Oh, God, dudes.
Okay, that's a lot of genitalia in my pool.

302
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,835
- We should go.
- We can't.

303
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,991
What about the Marissa-Oliver
countdown thing?

304
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,752
That was before
I took a faceful of Dom.

305
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,718
I can't leave Hailey.
The place will get trashed. She's insane.

306
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,996
- You said she was awesome.
- Insanely awesome.

307
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,948
- So tell her. Party's over.
- Right. Except I don't want to be the dad.

308
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,351
Listen, telling my aunt she can't have
a party is embarrassing. You do it.

309
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,990
- It's your house.
- Right. And it's your girlfriend with Oliver.

310
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,798
I'm helping track your motivation.

311
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,509
- She's part of your family.
- Cohens are known for conflict avoidance.

312
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,194
But Atwoods, they thrive on it.
You're the man for this.

313
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,157
- I'm not gonna win this argument.
- No.

314
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,833
Right.

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,594
Hey, no ball dropping
till midnight, okay?

316
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,116
Thanks. That's what
I was talking about.

317
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,510
Wait for me.

318
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,789
<i>In one quarter of a mile, turn left.</i>

319
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,313
What's going on?

320
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,033
Nothing.

321
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,591
Are we in a rut?

322
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,874
That's nothing?

323
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,918
No, we're not in a rut.
We're in a marriage.

324
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,229
It's just...

325
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,198
We finish each other's sentences,
we know what the other's thinking.

326
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,555
- That's my favorite part.
- I own a sweater from Talbots.

327
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,709
That was a gift.

328
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,196
Look, I don't think anybody
would think we're boring.

329
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,157
But do we need to take more chances?

330
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,390
<i>In 400 feet, turn left.</i>

331
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,911
Yes, we do need to take
more chances.

332
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,990
GPS lady says turn left...

333
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,109
...I'm going right.

334
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,229
Sandy, don't.

335
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,552
No, you can't stop me. No one can.
Hang on. Here we go.

336
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,830
<i>When possible, please make a U-turn.</i>

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,514
No. No, I won't. I will not.

338
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,871
Sandy, please.

339
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,112
Baby, we're living on the edge, honey.
We're living on the edge.

340
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,191
We're not living on the edge,
we're getting lost.

341
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,316
Would you just listen
to the GPS lady?

342
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,675
<i>When possible, please make a U-turn.</i>

343
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,796
Thank God. Because you know I...

344
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,555
I hate to defy the GPS lady,
because she gets so cross.

345
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,919
- Do you think we're fun?
- Yeah, I do.

346
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,312
Come on. Your sister is so
up inside your head, it's nuts.

347
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,278
No one's as fun as Hailey.
I mean, that's her calling in life.

348
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,317
She's 10 pounds of fun
in a 5-pound bag.

349
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,630
- What does that mean?
- It means she's fun.

350
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,998
You know, she's a Nichol. She's a pot
stirrer, a ball buster, a button pusher.

351
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,958
- She is pushing your buttons.
- That she is.

352
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,430
We're going to a party where we don't
know anyone. Anything could happen.

353
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,034
- That's true.
- That's fun.

354
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,029
Why don't we skip dinner
and just go to that party?

355
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,953
<i>When possible, please make a U-turn.</i>

356
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,912
You are dangerous.

357
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,796
Hey, so this is a cool place
to have a party.

358
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,554
Yeah? Well, my parents own
a bunch of them.

359
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,234
- Hotel rooms?
- Hotels.

360
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,279
I've never had these before.

361
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,113
They are excellent.
Of course, these are virgins.

362
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,272
They won't take the edge off,
they won't numb the pain.

363
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,193
- But they're fun to say. Mojito.
- Mojito.

364
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,920
- Mojito.
- Mojito.

365
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,513
Hey, you know, just because I'm not
drinking doesn't mean you can't.

366
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,389
Yes. But then my sponsor would be
so disappointed in me.

367
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,598
Clean and sober 11 months.

368
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,279
You did meet me in therapy.

369
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,631
So where's Ryan?

370
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,110
He's not here.

371
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,117
I can see that.

372
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,353
So when do I get to meet Natalie?

373
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,996
Yeah. She's not here.

374
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,791
- What happened?
- Long story.

375
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,794
Long-distance relationship. You know,
those are always so fraught with peril.

376
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,757
Anyway, she's a freshman at Arizona.

377
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,150
- An older woman?
- Not really.

378
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,359
She had the benefit of not getting
kicked out of three schools in three years.

379
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,114
Makes it a whole lot easier
to graduate on time.

380
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,759
But as for me,
now I'm doing senior year, again.

381
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,993
And she's doing her freshman thing.
You know, having fun, partying.

382
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,470
And I don't think she wants to be
in a serious relationship anymore.

383
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,113
And you love her?

384
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,353
- Have you told her?
- Of course. All the time.

385
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,952
- To Ryan?
- To Natalie.

386
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,988
- We can have fun without them, right?
- I hope so.

387
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,436
Not the inspiring answer
I was looking for, but I'll take it.

388
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,351
Look, I get it.
I get that you're upset, okay?

389
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,550
- One minute.
- I need to talk to you.

390
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,358
I said, one minute.

391
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,556
- Just hear me out.
- I don't know why you're back.

392
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,393
- You still owe me $3000.
- I know. I'll get it back to you.

393
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,391
That's what you said two years ago.

394
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,757
- What, did your trust fund run out?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.

395
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,390
So you're back to make a withdrawal from
your dad. Then you'll split again?

396
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,869
I don't need this.
You're supposed to be my friend.

397
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,838
You don't have any friends left.
You burned all those bridges.

398
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,877
It doesn't look like it from tonight.

399
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,112
Or everybody knows no one throws
a rager like Hailey Nichol.

400
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,510
You're looking for some good blow,
clean speed...

401
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,955
This conversation is over.
You want to go, then go.

402
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,758
Not without my three grand.

403
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,230
You better hope that Cameo doesn't
show up, after what you did to Alex.

404
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,471
Goodbye.

405
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,036
Hey. Do you think it's time
we end this?

406
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,792
No, I don't.

407
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,837
Well, maybe the cops will.

408
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,309
So what? You're, like, a narc now?

409
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,639
Fine.

410
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,360
Let's just talk about this.

411
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,512
This place isn't so rocking. I mean,
we're way more fun than these people.

412
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,598
This is Hailey's big party?

413
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,069
I just hope there's a deviled egg.
I'm starving.

414
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,753
Kirsten.

415
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,434
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you're here.

416
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,239
I had no idea you were so much fun.

417
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,716
Yeah. Hi, Taryn.

418
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,757
- You know my husband, Sandy.
- Hi.

419
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,037
- Well, if I don't now, I might at midnight.
- Hello.

420
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,511
Go ahead, Sandy.
Put your watch in the bowl.

421
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,392
Whoever ends up with him
is gonna be one lucky lady.

422
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,352
- Oh, my God.
- I think we're at a swingers party.

423
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,954
I'm gonna kill Hailey.
We can still make dinner, can't we?

424
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,671
- Oh, yeah. We're leaving.
- We can't stay here, can we?

425
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,229
We're not in this big a rut.

426
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,790
- You think we're in a rut. You just said it.
- Where is that deviled egg?

427
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,269
I mean, we don't have
the nerve to stick this out.

428
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,479
- No, we don't. So let's go.
- We couldn't possibly stay, could we?

429
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,073
Hey, we can stay.

430
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,914
- I dare you.
- Don't dare me unless you mean it.

431
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,798
- I dare you. Double dare.
- Okay.

432
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,679
- Go ahead.
- You got three seconds to stop me. <i>Uno.</i>

433
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,717
<i>Dos.</i>

434
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,512
<i>Tres.</i>

435
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,874
- We'll be chlorinating for weeks.
- Let's just go somewhere private to talk.

436
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,076
Without getting the cops involved.

437
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,549
I know your mom's gonna kill me...

438
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,030
...and I'm really sorry...

439
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,156
...but it's New Year's Eve.

440
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,719
And we're having a party.

441
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,591
Hey!

442
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,189
Great. This is just great.

443
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,600
- Oh, God. This isn't good.
- You think?

444
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,878
- I can't breathe.
- What?

445
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,076
- I'm claustrophobic.
- Seth, this place is huge.

446
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,152
- It has a kitchen and a bathroom.
- Don't use up all the oxygen.

447
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,756
- Want a sandwich? A shower?
- We're gonna die, and I'm the glib one?

448
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,070
I sleep here.
Three of the walls are windows.

449
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,879
Yes, looking out on naked dudes.
We're trapped like rats.

450
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,270
Rats in a pool house!
By the way, your aunt's cool.

451
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,396
Yeah, I know.
She's a little unpredictable.

452
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,150
My shirt's strangling me.

453
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:44,199
Great. My girlfriend's kissing some guy,
and I'm stuck here with a lunatic.

454
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,716
I know. The first one of these
can be a little challenging.

455
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,677
The key? Drink a lot.

456
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,434
I'm just easing into it.

457
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,158
It's worth it.

458
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,438
New Year's Eve 1998,
this party saved my marriage.

459
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,239
My marriage doesn't need saving.
We're not in trouble.

460
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,597
Sure. Not trouble. Just a rut.

461
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,955
I know. I was there.

462
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,269
We're not in a rut.

463
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,512
So many of us just sleepwalk
through our own lives.

464
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,275
We don't even know we're asleep
till somebody wakes us up.

465
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,953
I'm up.

466
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,680
Take a chance.
What's the worst that could happen?

467
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,559
One evening of crazy sex
with a total stranger.

468
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,280
In college, that was a Thursday night.

469
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,078
For you, maybe.

470
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,190
You ask me, your husband's having a lot
of fun for someone who's not in a rut.

471
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,552
Here's to you.

472
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,990
Feel like drinking?

473
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,597
No. Not really. You?

474
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,512
No.

475
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,110
I'm sorry.
He was probably smiling at you.

476
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,158
No, your eye lines totally matched.
You should go.

477
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,711
No. No, no.
He's clearly interested in you.

478
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,995
You think?

479
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,834
That was all you.

480
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,152
No. Too close to call. We're not
ringing in '04 the same way we spent '03.

481
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,471
- I'm on the case. Come on.
- No, you can't just go up to him.

482
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,679
Hi. We were wondering,
who were you smiling at? Me or her?

483
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,470
- You're both cute.
- No, not happening. Okay?

484
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,359
One or the other.
You have to choose between us.

485
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,110
Someone has to choose between us.

486
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,790
You know what, Summer? It's okay.
You can have him.

487
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,679
Anna, look. Seth Cohen
just wants to be our friend.

488
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,512
I don't know anything about this guy...

489
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,990
- Hi. I'm Allan, from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
- Yeah, don't care.

490
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,435
All I know is, this guy doesn't
want to just be my friend.

491
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,750
He's really not my type. Go for it.

492
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,319
What's your type? Seth Cohen?

493
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,356
I'm through.

494
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,919
Right.

495
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,355
And we have crudit Ás...

496
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,437
...as promised.

497
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,272
So now I have to eat them?

498
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,351
Not until midnight.

499
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,832
So, question. When you asked me
if I ever told Natalie I loved her...

500
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,560
...it struck me as
an interesting question. Revealing.

501
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,790
- You should be a therapist.
- So, what...

502
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,633
...you said it to him,
and he didn't say it back?

503
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,439
He said:

504
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,999
"Thank you."

505
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,476
At least he's polite.

506
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,069
I'm getting another mojito.

507
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,071
- You want one?
- Yeah.

508
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,237
Maybe I just overreacted, you know?

509
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,790
I mean, maybe he didn't say it
because he just wasn't ready.

510
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,030
Yeah, or because, you know.

511
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,952
Because he doesn't love me.

512
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,156
Oh, hey, no. No.

513
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,788
What do I know?
I don't even know the guy.

514
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,551
Don't listen to me.

515
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,388
I traveled to see
the Alaskan blue heron.

516
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,120
I had no idea that
that involved so much travel.

517
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,316
An ornithologist. That's fascinating.

518
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,677
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Hey, I'm ready to go.

519
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,558
Was this fun or what?

520
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,029
Sandy Cohen.
Pleasure swinging with you.

521
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,555
We're leaving?
I'm just starting to have fun.

522
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,156
Did you know Bob studies birds?

523
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,550
Birds? Bob, that's great.

524
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,757
Listen, if we hurry,
I think we can still get our table.

525
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,592
I wanna stay.

526
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,718
- Bye, Bob.
- Maybe I'll see you later.

527
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,071
- What are you doing?
- I'm having fun.

528
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,390
What, discussing the pigeon with Bob?

529
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,951
Hailey has so gotten under your skin.

530
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,873
- No. This is not about Hailey.
- Oh, no?

531
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,713
No. Maybe we needed to do this.

532
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,632
Maybe we need to do
something dangerous.

533
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,236
Maybe we are in a rut,
and we didn't even know it.

534
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,551
- So you want to swing?
- I'm swinging.

535
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,912
Heidi.

536
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,958
You have got to finish telling me
about the Galapagos Islands.

537
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,519
What a wild place.

538
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,790
Forty-five minutes to midnight.

539
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,797
If I ever get out of here,
your aunt is dead.

540
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,668
- Hey, Ryan.
- Yeah?

541
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,157
I have to ask you.
Why didn't you just say it?

542
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,113
I don't know.

543
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,758
Because I never have.

544
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,594
But you do, right?

545
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,315
I guess. I don't know.

546
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,031
How do you know?

547
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,589
I just think you know. I don't know.

548
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,796
Yeah, I do.

549
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,635
Why didn't you choose? I mean, you had
to like one more than the other, right?

550
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,910
But now I don't deserve either,
because I blew it.

551
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,752
Me too.

552
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,478
I'm optimistic about this
Friendster thing, though.

553
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,959
Forty-three minutes.

554
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,388
- Hi.
- Hailey...

555
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,677
...mad good party once again.
- Thanks for coming.

556
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,159
Happy New Year.

557
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,475
Where is that bitch? I can't believe
she'd even show her face in Newport.

558
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,358
Cami, I don't know, okay?

559
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,479
- I need help.
- Fresh oxygen.

560
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,240
So you locked us in,
and now you want our help?

561
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,791
- Pretty much, yes.
- No. I'm leaving.

562
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,269
Wait, there's a girl out there
that wants to kill me.

563
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,509
Just one?

564
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,638
There's a girl who will kill me
if I don't get there in 39 minutes.

565
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,598
- Okay, but please help me shut this down.
- I'm not helping you.

566
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,194
Fine. Then she's gonna tear
this house apart.

567
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,118
Do it for Sandy and Kirsten.

568
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,237
Let's go. We gotta clear this party out.

569
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,992
It's what I do best.

570
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,078
- Good night.
- Thanks for coming.

571
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,718
What did you do?

572
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,997
- We shut off the power.
- Told them the cops were coming.

573
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,477
- I gotta go.
- Go ahead. I'll clean up.

574
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,993
- You sure?
- Yes. Go.

575
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,071
Thirty-one minutes.
I hope I can make it.

576
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,468
Me too.

577
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,231
Come on, everybody. It's 11:30.

578
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,879
We need to make our selection...

579
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,669
...so we have someone new to ring
in the new year with.

580
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,470
Since this is Evelyn's house,
we'll let her pick first. Evie?

581
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,791
Way to go, Bob.

582
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,115
Okay.

583
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,398
I hope you have some better luck.

584
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,356
I don't get it.

585
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,229
Everyone else got picked.
What happened to my watch?

586
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,636
It better be in your pants.

587
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,557
Come on, swinger.

588
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,039
Let's go home.

589
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,835
<i>Traffic is looking pretty bad</i>
<i>on the 73.</i>

590
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,437
<i>New Year's Eve is always ugly</i>
<i>on the road. Luckily it's almost over.</i>

591
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,958
Hey. I'm gonna take off.

592
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,111
You are? So close to midnight?

593
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,795
Yeah, yeah. I don't wanna be here.
It's too depressing.

594
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,070
- Happy New Year.
- Thanks.

595
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,908
Hey. How you doing?

596
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,198
I know it sounds stupid, but I keep
looking back at the door thinking...

597
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,999
...maybe he'll show up...

598
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,549
...in time.

599
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,554
Yeah. I keep hoping to see Natalie.

600
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,512
Sadly, I think it's just us tonight.

601
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,356
But, hey, at least we have each other.

602
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,960
- I think we're in the wrong house.
- I don't.

603
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,029
What the hell happened?

604
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,555
I don't know enough people
to cause this much damage.

605
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,836
So how was the party?

606
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,555
- What did you do?
- Nothing that can't be undone.

607
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,837
A little Palmolive, some elbow grease.
Seth and I have it covered.

608
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,592
Nobody mentioned elbow grease.

609
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,069
Seth. Garbage. Out. Now.

610
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,076
I look forward to waking up
to a clean house tomorrow.

611
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,513
Good night, Sandy.

612
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,559
I'm gonna get back to the dishes.

613
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,472
You don't walk away from me.

614
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,677
You're not Mom.
You can't talk to me that way.

615
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,276
This is my house,
my upside-down couch!

616
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,193
I will talk to you any way that I want.

617
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,151
I should really learn to knock...

618
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,516
...in case there's a threesome
going on in my bedroom.

619
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,796
You can't keep living your life like this,
like you have no responsibility.

620
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,279
Like you're still a child.

621
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,715
What used to be cute
is now embarrassing.

622
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,519
I'm sorry. The party got
a little out of hand.

623
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,511
People your age,
they have finished college...

624
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,716
...they have jobs, they're married.

625
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,713
Look. In the morning I'll take off.

626
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,077
I am not asking you to leave.
I just want you to grow up!

627
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,432
It's a new year.
You can make a new start.

628
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,277
Why? So I can grow up
to be just like you?

629
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,510
Working for Dad,
selling McMansions...

630
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,557
...planning charity events
with the Newpsies?

631
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,188
Hey. I love my life...

632
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,555
...my family, my rut.

633
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,710
You spend so much time...

634
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,192
...putting energy into having fun,
your whole life is dedicated to having fun.

635
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,391
Are you even having any?

636
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,673
- I'll help you clean up.
- I don't want your help.

637
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,957
I'll finish in the morning.
I'm going to bed.

638
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,558
Anna? Hey.

639
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,755
I didn't want you to be alone
on New Year's.

640
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,992
Actually...

641
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,958
I didn't want to be alone
on New Year's.

642
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,832
Well, I'm not alone.

643
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,511
I have Captain Oats
and Carson Daly, so...

644
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,468
Oh, wow. That's an unbeatable
combination. I'll go.

645
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,235
Wait. Captain Oats
had too much champagne...

646
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,472
...and Carson Daly's
kind of a ginormous tool.

647
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,393
So I could use the company.

648
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,279
Twenty seconds.

649
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,799
Ten. Nine. Eight.

650
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,679
Seven. Six. Five.

651
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,357
You're not Seth Cohen.

652
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,351
Who's Seth Cohen?

653
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,475
I wasn't... I wasn't talking to you.

654
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,477
I gotta go.

655
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,551
Happy New Year.

656
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,914
- I love you.
- What?

657
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,273
I love you.

658
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,358
Thank you.
