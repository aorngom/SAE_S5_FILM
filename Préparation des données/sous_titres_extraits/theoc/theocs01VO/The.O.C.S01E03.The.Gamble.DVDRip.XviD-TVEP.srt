1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,396
- <i>Previously on</i> The O. C:
- I want you out of my house.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,552
- Mom's kind of a train wreck.
- What kind of mother abandons her child?

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,950
- She has to come back, right?
- What happens if they don't find her?

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,633
In the morning I'll take him
to Child Services.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,392
- Are you running away?
- Got a better idea?

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,028
- Where are we?
- One of my mom's housing developments.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,792
- How much do you need?
- It's $100,000.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,838
- What are you doing with my girlfriend?
- Kill me and quit talking about it.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,156
Dude, this place is on fire.
We gotta go.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,594
- I'm sorry.
- Ryan Atwood?

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,149
- We got some questions for you.
- It was an accident.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,072
Then we got some questions
for you too.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,750
We gotta stop meeting like this.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,356
Some good news. Kirsten's company
has dropped all arson charges.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,195
Which means, pending your probation
hearing, you'll be out, no problem.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,199
When's that?

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,510
Thirty to 60 days.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,232
I could have you out sooner...

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,836
...if I could release you into the care
of a parent or a guardian.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,592
- He gets to leave?
- Who, Luke?

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,990
According to both of you,
the fire was an accident.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,391
He's got no priors. His record's clean.

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,475
And he has someone to take him home.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,309
Ryan, you know, if I could...

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,714
It's gonna be okay.

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,835
My mom ditched me, I burned your wife's
house down, how is this gonna be okay?

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,755
- We'll find your mother.
- And what if we don't?

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,195
- We will do whatever it takes.
- I mean...

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,669
...what if I don't want to find her?

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,638
If only you'd come to me
instead of running away.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,109
So I could end up
in Child Services and foster care?

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,633
- You could have died in that fire.
- Look...

33
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,510
...you've done more than enough.
I can take care of myself.

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,398
Won't be that different
from how it's been.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,911
We'll talk again before your hearing.

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,958
Tell your wife thanks.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,554
Already did.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,517
Step back.

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,472
Sorry.

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,518
You ain't now, but you will be.

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,910
Now all we need are the Bellinis.
And can you make mine a double?

42
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,878
Wow. You're all set up for
your Newpsie convention.

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,917
Hey, when do these vultures land?

44
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,959
Soon. And I'm sure that I have
a doily out of place somewhere.

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,872
Good. Gives them something
to talk about.

46
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,554
I don't know why you have them over.
You don't like them.

47
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,711
I don't don't like them.
I grew up with them.

48
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,519
They're my oldest friends.
Besides, it's for charity.

49
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,830
What's on the agenda?
What are you dragging me to?

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,355
Casino Night.

51
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,193
This home-from-the-office
housewife thing, it's really...

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,271
- Disturbing?
- Hot.

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,749
Disturbingly hot.

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,470
Hey. What you doing?

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,392
Nothing. I'm grounded.

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,879
Well, you're handling it well.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,230
You're lucky you're only grounded.

58
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,473
You gonna see him?

59
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,279
Ryan? No. There's nothing
I can do for him right now.

60
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,396
Yeah? You think he's okay?

61
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,152
There's a reason why I like to try
to keep kids out of those places.

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,675
You can't get him out?
You're just not a good enough lawyer?

63
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,355
- My hands are tied until we find his mom.
- So then why can't he stay here?

64
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,954
I will not have this conversation again.

65
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,156
Rosa, can you make sure
that the scones go inside?

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,517
If anything happens to Ryan, it's on
you, so I hope you can live with that.

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,229
What I can't live with is if something
was to happen to you because of him.

68
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,119
- Like I meet someone who doesn't suck?
- We're not his parents.

69
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,475
- I am not his mother.
- Good thing.

70
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,074
Hey. Get back here. Apologize.

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,911
- Ladies.
- Sandy, hi, how are you?

72
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,150
Are you holding up okay?
That poor boy.

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,197
- He's locked up, yes?
- Yeah, temporarily.

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,909
Well, nobody blames you for bringing him
into the community. You're so trusting.

75
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,316
Hey, Julie. Their house looks good.
I thought you said it burned down.

76
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,519
Not this one, one of Kirsten's
developments. Luckily, she has so many.

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,549
Well, I should be off.

78
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,314
Gotta find the next kid
to jeopardize the community.

79
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,119
Maybe a black kid. Or an Asian kid.

80
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,429
Bye, ladies.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,674
- How about a Bellini?
- Yes!

82
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,193
Look at this food!

83
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,875
Who's sorry now? You got a problem?
You disrespecting me?

84
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,032
As long as you here,
you best watch out for me, man.

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,876
I think it's an embarrassment that we still
don't have a theme for the fundraiser.

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,759
- Well, it's Casino Night.
- I thought it was Monte Carlo Night.

87
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,832
- No, it's Vegas Night.
- See, this is a travesty.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,992
It can't be Monte Carlo Night.
Cotillion is coming up.

89
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,755
Don't you remember our amendment? No
two black-tie events in the same month.

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,433
I'll be right back.

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,511
I have to go...

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,877
...check on the thing.

93
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,594
She's been through so much.
Her son was friends with that boy.

94
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,316
Where do you think you're going?

95
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,396
- What are you doing out here?
- I'm taking a break. Where are you going?

96
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,949
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Seth.

97
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,153
I'm going to juvie to visit Ryan.

98
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,231
No. No, you're not. No way.

99
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,790
- Okay. Bye.
- Seth.

100
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,713
I know that I am not the
perfect Carol Brady mom...

101
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,189
...but I love you,
and I am trying to protect you.

102
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,591
I have dropped all the charges. I have
hired somebody to find his mother.

103
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,194
What more do you want?

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,034
I would like you to go with me.

105
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,350
Kirsten? Oh, there you are.

106
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,750
We're talking about the bunting.
Is acetate okay?

107
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,479
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

108
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,473
Give me 15 minutes to lose the ladies.

109
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,268
Can I try this on?

110
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,032
Summer, my dad's home, you know.

111
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,792
You say that like it's a bad thing.

112
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,359
Oh, gross!

113
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,476
Your dad's always home these days.
What's up?

114
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,590
Hey, Luke, it's me. I just...

115
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,513
...wanted to talk. So call me.

116
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,548
Please.

117
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,392
Still hasn't called you back?

118
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,551
He was in lockup.
Maybe he's into dudes now.

119
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,476
God, he loves you. He got in a fight
and burnt a house down over you.

120
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,631
That's hot. What more do you need?

121
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,756
- How about talking to me?
- He'll get over it.

122
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,590
He can't really think
you're into that Chino kid.

123
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,954
So how's your mother?

124
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,475
Just... married.

125
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,669
Marissa, you've got company.

126
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,114
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

127
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,829
Hi, Summer. I'm... I'm... I'm Seth Cohen.
I live... I live right next door.

128
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,159
What's up?

129
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,593
What?

130
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,512
Yes, what is up.

131
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,195
I'm going to visit Ryan. I thought maybe
you'd like to come. He'd love to see you.

132
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,956
What's that, Seth? Did you say you need
a ride to a <i>Star Wars</i> convention?

133
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,159
<i>Star Wars</i>? I'm sorry, her top was off.
You couldn't have at least said <i>X- Men</i>?

134
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,351
I can't go with you. I can't see Ryan.
I mean, Luke's not talking to me as it is.

135
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,954
So what? Ryan's in jail.
I thought we were all friends.

136
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,271
It's just... It's too complicated.

137
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,873
- To visit him?
- I can't, okay?

138
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,912
Yeah, fine. Whatever.

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,230
Let's just make this quick, okay?

140
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,750
Kirsten and Seth Cohen.

141
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,639
Hey.

142
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,031
- What happened to your neck?
- It's nothing.

143
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,792
- You okay?
- Great.

144
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,038
So I'm sorry the plan didn't work.

145
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,190
I thought I had it figured out.
I thought you were safe. I was wrong.

146
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,193
What's the matter? Give me a smile.

147
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,069
So Marissa seemed pretty weird
when I tried to talk to her.

148
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,710
- What happened between you guys?
- You got a nice swerve on you. You fine.

149
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,189
- Hey, leave her alone.
- Ryan, it's okay.

150
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,918
Are you joking? Is this your honey?

151
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,991
Come here, bitch,
I wanna get a look at you.

152
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,720
- Seth, let's go, now.
- I only need two minutes.

153
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,154
- Leave her alone.
- Seth, now.

154
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,753
- What you gonna do?
- Guards!

155
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,029
Guards!

156
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,952
I'll kill you, punk!

157
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,679
You're dead! You hear me?
You're dead!

158
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,875
Seth, what did we say?
No video games.

159
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,271
I never knew you
to be an impulse shopper.

160
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,839
I didn't know what else to do.

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,434
- Did you tell him it was permanent?
- No, of course not.

162
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,309
We can't jerk him around, pulling him
out of juvie, sending him to foster care...

163
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,994
...giving him hope and taking it away.

164
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,630
They were gonna kill him in that place.
He couldn't stay there.

165
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,349
But he can't stay here.
We've got to find his mother.

166
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,511
- He doesn't want to find her.
- He's a kid.

167
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,352
He doesn't know what he wants.

168
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,476
So I guess I won't unpack.

169
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,678
Hey.

170
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,479
Help yourself to a wide assortment
of breakfast cereals.

171
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,950
So, Ryan, what...?

172
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,036
What exactly happened that night with
Marissa before Luke showed up?

173
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,191
- She came to see me.
- And?

174
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,874
- And I told her to leave.
- You asked her to leave?

175
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,358
That's it? You two were up there
all alone and you expect me...?

176
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,954
I thought I was taking off
in the morning.

177
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,313
- It didn't seem right.
- You're still here. She's next door.

178
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,599
I don't know. I said some things.

179
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,637
So now's your chance to take it back.

180
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,638
Hey. I'm off.
They're waiting for me in the ballroom.

181
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,870
Those ladies can't do anything
unless I'm there.

182
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,758
Hey, you should come. It'll be fun.

183
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,354
Well, not fun, but it's for charity.

184
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,313
No, thanks.

185
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,835
Marissa, honey, enough moping.

186
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,231
It's sweet that you're so concerned about
this boy, but he's in the system now.

187
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,913
He's being taken care of.

188
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,878
And he's not your responsibility
because he's in love with you.

189
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,951
He's not in love with me.

190
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,998
Why not?
He thinks he's too good for you?

191
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,038
Actually, he thinks
I'm too good for him.

192
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,714
Well, he's right. But that's the past.

193
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,919
And you need to focus on the future,
which means Luke.

194
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,196
You've invested so much
with Luke, honey.

195
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,669
Your relationship has
too much potential...

196
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,957
...to be squandered by
some silly misunderstanding.

197
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,989
So finish your hair, put on a nice top
and please come join me at the club.

198
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,874
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

199
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,158
That's what I'm here for.

200
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,795
I have to make some calls, so if you
could finish up, that would be terrific.

201
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,757
Where are you going?

202
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,754
I've got an early court date,
then I'm in and out of the office.

203
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,718
I have to set up for Casino Night.
What about Ryan?

204
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,515
I called the private investigator
about his mother.

205
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,750
Yeah, but what am I
supposed to do with him?

206
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,391
Take him with you.
Spend some time together.

207
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,757
- With all those women there?
- Sure. They'll love him.

208
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,559
- Hi, Julie.
- Kirsten, Seth.

209
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,073
Julie, this is Ryan.

210
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,355
I'm Julie Cooper.
I've heard so much about you.

211
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,793
- Nice to meet you too.
- There he is.

212
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,115
Hey, Mrs. Cooper. How you doing?

213
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,033
- Hey, Luke.
- Hi, Luke. Thanks for coming.

214
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,954
You know, anything I can do to help
make amends for what happened.

215
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,553
Luke, it's good to see you.

216
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,598
Ryan, I forgot that he was coming.
If you wanna...

217
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,830
No, I'm here. How can I help?

218
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,671
Well, now that we have our big, strong,
strapping men, time for heavy lifting.

219
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,680
Hey. I was hoping maybe we could talk.

220
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,076
Which one of us did you want to talk to?

221
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,514
Luke, come on.

222
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,831
Sorry. I feel like ever since I've
gotten here, I've screwed everything up.

223
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,594
No, I'm sorry. It's my fault too.

224
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,433
I mean, I never should have left Luke
to see you that night.

225
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,309
- And those things you said before...
- I didn't... What I said...

226
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,438
You were right.
We're from two different worlds.

227
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,911
I'm glad you're okay.

228
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,638
Okay. What happened
up at that house with me and her...

229
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,509
I don't want to hear about it. You and I
have nothing to say to each other.

230
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,873
I don't know who you are
or what you're doing here.

231
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,679
All I know is, you and me, we're done.

232
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,799
Okay, boys. Ryan, why don't you
come with me. New project.

233
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,633
- Thank you.
- How dare they?

234
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,950
This boy is violent. He's a menace.

235
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,352
They may forgive and forget, but I don't.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

236
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,511
You're right. You are right.

237
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,955
The police are taking
criminals off the street...

238
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,350
...and Sandy Cohen is putting them
in my back yard.

239
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,636
- How does she put up with it?
- Who, Kirsten?

240
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,917
She's never home. She's always
working, building her empire.

241
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,399
I feel sorry for her.

242
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,949
Dr. Phil did a show on mothers
who avoid home life...

243
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,509
...by becoming workaholics. So sad.

244
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,798
I just hope she has a vault and she keeps
her jewels locked up. She has expensive...

245
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,428
Hey, ladies. Care if I join you?

246
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,793
You mind?

247
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,235
So I couldn't help but overhear.

248
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,234
- I... Well, I hope that you're not...
- Mad? Offended? No.

249
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,349
I am disappointed.
And frankly, I'm a little surprised.

250
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,114
This is supposed to be a community
that welcomes outsiders.

251
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,432
I mean, me, I'm all the way from the
Bronx. And you're from Riverside, right?

252
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,956
Which is not that different from
where Ryan's from. Excuse me a minute.

253
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,033
Hello?

254
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,437
Yeah. Dawn. That's her.

255
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,517
Good job.

256
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,352
Okay. Bye.

257
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,638
Thanks for the muffin.

258
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,678
Can I have a napkin? Now?

259
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,118
What am I supposed to do
with 120,000 pounds of concrete?

260
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,916
Get a new mixer.

261
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,314
Just call me when you know.

262
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,989
What do you do exactly?
Real estate or construction?

263
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,354
Dude, don't ask.

264
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,115
I tried to explain it to Seth once,
and he fell asleep halfway through.

265
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,397
Okay. But...
Yeah, that's pretty much true.

266
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,473
Try me.

267
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,996
My dad is in real-estate development.
He owns the Newport Group.

268
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,957
Wow. You guys built the mall?

269
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,475
Civic auditorium? Baseball stadium?
Stuff like that?

270
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,437
I'm in charge of residential development.

271
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,117
So you deal with contractors, architects,
planning and zoning commission?

272
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,748
- How'd you know?
- I worked construction a couple summers.

273
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,388
And I used to want to be an architect.

274
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,434
- And what do you want to be now?
- Seventeen.

275
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,514
Me too.

276
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,433
Hey. I thought you were setting up at...

277
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,268
You will not believe
what Sandy Cohen said to me.

278
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,069
He basically called me white trash.
He said I was from Riverside.

279
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,231
Honey, you are from Riverside.

280
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,193
It was his tone.

281
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,158
Compare me to that boy,
and to bring him to our function...

282
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,835
Kirsten is out of control.
She thinks the rules don't apply to her?

283
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,992
I know you were young, but how you ever
dated that woman, I can't understand.

284
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,311
- I have half a mind to call and tell her...
- Leave Kirsten alone.

285
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,392
She's the one paying our bills.

286
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,751
What are you talking about?

287
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,790
You know that problem
I was having at work? Well...

288
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,713
...she solved it.

289
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,159
You went to Kirsten for a handout?
How do you think this makes us look?

290
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,074
- I wouldn't really call it a handout.
- Oh, really? What would you call it?

291
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,956
A hundred thousand dollars.

292
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,313
That machine ate my change.

293
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,278
Okay, okay. That one's always broken.

294
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,829
Here you go. Try the next one over.

295
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,593
Dawn Atwood?
Sandy Cohen, Ryan's attorney.

296
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,917
- I'd love to talk to you.
- I can't talk.

297
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,756
- This stupid thing's stuck.
- It'll only take a couple of minutes.

298
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,231
Damn it!

299
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,354
How is he?

300
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,557
Why don't we grab a cup of coffee
and talk about it?

301
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,839
There's some historical homes in the area.
We can go on an architectural tour.

302
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,629
- Yeah, those things are awesome.
- Yeah, I'd like that.

303
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,038
Hey, Ry.

304
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,078
Thank you, Rosa.

305
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,358
Thanks.

306
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,953
No, thank you.

307
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,239
So, Dawn, how long you been
working at the Laundromat?

308
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,595
Not long. Just a couple weeks.

309
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,116
- What happened to the restaurant?
- They were making cutbacks.

310
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,713
You got fired.

311
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,478
Well, it was for the best.

312
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,349
They had rats, cockroaches. Disgusting.

313
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,832
You seen Trey?

314
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,231
I went to visit him at the prison.
He wouldn't see me.

315
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,632
- Where are you living these days?
- With friends. I'm between places now.

316
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,160
- Why don't you stay here tonight?
- What about A.J.?

317
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,468
No. I broke up with him.

318
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,792
We're through.

319
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,439
No more.

320
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,913
I put up with too much.

321
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,436
He laid his hands on me
and Ryan too many times.

322
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,194
- Mom.
- What?

323
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,078
I'm just saying...

324
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,870
...he was a bad influence, you know.

325
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,429
- With his drinking...
- Because A.J. Was the problem.

326
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,349
Hey, I haven't touched a drop
since I dumped his sorry ass last week.

327
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,592
The scum he used to bring
into the house, his whole coke thing...

328
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,756
- Where you going?
- It was bad enough living it the first time.

329
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,672
Ryan. Wait, sweetie.

330
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,434
Sorry.

331
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,999
- Will you at least talk to me?
- What are you even doing here?

332
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,879
I came for you.

333
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,270
Why? What do you want from me?

334
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,239
You left a note.

335
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,199
- A note.
- Let me explain...

336
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,715
You abandoned me.
You threw me out. You just took off.

337
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,189
I know, honey. I was...

338
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,436
And A.J. And the drinking and...

339
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,234
It's gonna be different now.

340
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,792
That's what you said when we moved
from Fresno after Dad got arrested.

341
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,871
I'm gonna be different now.

342
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,474
We have a chance to start over, babe.

343
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,349
We've never had people like them,
you know, who wanted to help us.

344
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,589
Right.

345
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,150
Someone offers you a nice place to stay,
suddenly you're all about the mom thing.

346
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,638
I didn't know what I was doing
when I married your dad.

347
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,439
I was too young
when I had your brother.

348
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,472
But with you...

349
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,519
You were always the smart one,
you know?

350
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,632
The good one.

351
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,989
When you got arrested...

352
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,475
...I knew I'd failed, and...

353
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,795
...you were my last hope.

354
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,318
I should go.

355
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,959
Wait.

356
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,510
You ever gonna forgive me, kiddo?

357
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,630
Let's just go slow, huh?

358
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,388
Okay.

359
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,152
Whatever you want.

360
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,152
I'm not gonna lose you again.

361
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,789
- So where did they go, anyways?
- I don't know. Out.

362
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,315
All right. So we'll just
wait for happy hour to end.

363
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,756
Seth, we need to be supportive.
She seems like she's trying.

364
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,638
Yeah, but how do you know?

365
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,475
I mean, this woman abandoned him,
and now all she has to do is show up?

366
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,552
Come on. She should be the one
that's on probation, not Ryan.

367
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,075
You want me to invite her to stay
so we can watch her?

368
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,629
Yes, that is exactly
what I want you to do.

369
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,151
What a beautiful walk.

370
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,912
The water's so warm.

371
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,991
Not that Ryan would know.

372
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,709
- You used to love going in the water.
- Not with all my clothes on.

373
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,359
I'm an embarrassment to my son.

374
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,431
Welcome to my world.

375
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,711
Well, we should probably
head out soon.

376
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,992
Actually, I was thinking. You just
got here, you have nowhere to stay.

377
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,237
We're all just getting to know
each other.

378
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,038
- We're having a party tonight.
- Right.

379
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,191
Not for me. But thanks, though.

380
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,272
- Vegas Night.
- Vegas, huh?

381
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,276
It's very kind of you to offer,
but I don't have anything to wear.

382
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,112
We'll find something.

383
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,392
Kirsten does the same thing.

384
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,472
Washes the dishes before
putting them in the dishwasher.

385
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,359
I never know whether
they're clean or dirty.

386
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,476
We never had a dishwasher.

387
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,072
- So how's everything going?
- Okay, I guess.

388
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,152
We had a good day.

389
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,275
You being with your mother doesn't mean
we're not gonna still see each other.

390
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,158
She really likes it here.

391
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,710
She talked about finding
someplace small nearby.

392
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,791
In the numbered streets.

393
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,948
So...

394
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,679
...how do I look?

395
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,036
All their parties like this?

396
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,077
Pretty much.

397
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,755
Well, let's clean them out, kid.

398
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,192
- Kirsten.
- Excuse me.

399
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,191
Another perfect event.

400
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,510
So business is good?

401
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,033
Yeah, it's good.

402
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,919
- I love your dress.
- You do? It's yours.

403
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,151
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you?

404
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,311
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

405
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,397
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

406
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,997
- It's all fabulous. Just fabulous.
- Thank you.

407
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,515
How much did you get for the hug?

408
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,278
Betting kind of big, Mom?

409
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,512
It's for charity.
Besides, the count's way positive.

410
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,558
You're counting?
It's not a single deck.

411
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,029
Oh, honey, if I teach you
anything in this world...

412
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,555
...the count goes way higher
with multiple decks.

413
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,151
Blackjack.

414
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,278
See, honey?
My luck's turning around already.

415
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,759
Yes!

416
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,759
That's beautiful.

417
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,912
I told you we could do it. I told you too!

418
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,190
Excuse me.
Tonic water and lime, please?

419
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,198
My boy.

420
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,079
Lucky for him, he's got my brains.

421
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,993
Go.

422
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,435
Have fun with your friend.

423
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,319
I'll be fine.
You don't have to babysit me.

424
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,270
- Hi.
- Hi.

425
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,512
So is that your mom?

426
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,193
Yeah.

427
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,316
She came back, so I guess
that means you're going home.

428
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,752
Yeah, I guess.

429
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,470
Well, good luck with everything.

430
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,029
You too. Have a nice life.

431
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,352
You should go.

432
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,117
Hi, Summer. Seth Cohen.

433
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,236
I'm superstitious. Blow on these.

434
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,757
- What?
- Blow.

435
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,278
We're good! Do it again.

436
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,190
- You're not going anywhere, Syd.
- Seth.

437
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,759
- Whatever.
- Okay.

438
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,558
Blow.

439
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,910
You can't just not talk to me.

440
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,273
Watch me.

441
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,112
It's not like you're innocent in all this.
I mean, you didn't have to attack him.

442
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,510
What was I supposed to do?

443
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,360
You left me to go up there for him.

444
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,278
It's not like that.

445
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,351
It was a mistake.

446
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,833
Hell, yeah.

447
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,398
- Hi, Sandy.
- Hey, Julie.

448
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,678
I came to apologize and say thank you.
The check that you guys gave Jimmy.

449
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,999
You never know who your friends are
until you're in need.

450
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,593
And we needed that 100 grand.

451
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,748
It was our pleasure.
You can't take it with you.

452
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,035
- Hi.
- What do you want?

453
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,760
Nothing happened
with Marissa and me.

454
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,673
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Listen.

455
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,595
She chose you.
You're the one she wants.

456
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,956
Can I get a 7 and 7, please?

457
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,872
Nerves. Tough game of poker.

458
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,472
Thank you.

459
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,553
- Want some dessert?
- Yeah, we could have a little piece.

460
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,516
Always does the trick.

461
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,875
You rock, Stanley.

462
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,353
Hey.

463
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,192
Let's try again.

464
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,598
Oh, crap. My damn luck, huh?

465
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,633
Well, pony up, honey. Don't be shy.

466
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,474
My new best friend. Thank you.

467
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,911
Don't you think you've had enough?

468
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,952
You're right.

469
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,749
Just gotta learn to celebrate
without the sauce.

470
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,869
Well, no one said it was
going to be easy.

471
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,399
Could we talk? It's important.

472
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,391
Of course. Excuse us.

473
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,788
Sure.

474
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,998
- You want to hear something so funny?
- Always.

475
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,516
Sandy Cohen had no idea
Kirsten wrote you that check.

476
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,958
Imagine being so rich you don't tell your
husband you're giving away $100,000.

477
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,270
Right. You know what?

478
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,795
Who needs chips? You got Kirsten.

479
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,919
What did you say to him?

480
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,514
You don't care how this makes me feel,
that you went to her.

481
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,910
I had no choice.
You didn't want to talk about it.

482
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,832
I was trying to save us.

483
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,355
Our family was in trouble.

484
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,713
Looks like we're not the only ones.

485
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,839
A hundred thousand dollars!
That's more than I make in a year.

486
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,995
It's just a loan...

487
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,513
...of my money.

488
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,989
It's not the money.
It's that you never told me.

489
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,312
I know.

490
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,550
- I don't know why.
- I got a couple of ideas.

491
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,917
Let me take you on a journey through
my neuroses for the past hour or so.

492
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,958
Sandy, I promise. It was just a loan,
there's nothing more to it.

493
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,998
He was in trouble,
there was no one else he could tell.

494
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,752
So, what's your excuse?

495
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,549
Sandy, I don't know
what Julie said to you.

496
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,792
I'm trying to have a private
conversation with my wife.

497
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,831
Two Mountain Dews, my good man.
Thank you. Ryan, greatest night ever.

498
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,437
It's like those nights when the stars
and the cosmos and the moon align...

499
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,398
...and it's just, like, wow.
Thank you. How's your mom doing?

500
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,355
- High rolling. She was made for this place.
- Yeah?

501
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,239
- Well, then maybe this could work.
- Yeah, maybe.

502
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,428
Rabbit's foot? <i>V Àmonos.</i>

503
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,433
By the end of the night,
she might know my first name.

504
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,592
Duty calls.

505
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,318
Look, I'm sorry.

506
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,159
Hold up.

507
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,110
- Oh, God.
- What the hell is your problem?

508
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,636
What's my problem?
What's your problem? Back off.

509
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,031
Ryan, I must have tripped.
It's these damn shoes.

510
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,719
Hello?

511
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,198
Here, good luck.

512
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,356
- Dude, that lady is wasted.
- I bet you could bang her.

513
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,033
Hey, shut up.

514
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,790
Why don't you just quit staring
and help me up, okay? Get me up!

515
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,392
Help me up!

516
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,391
Finally. Jeez.

517
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,869
Hey, Seth,
why don't you go get the car.

518
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,110
- What, maybe you had one too many?
- No, I...

519
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,475
What are you looking at?

520
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,232
Where's Ryan? Ryan?

521
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,356
Thanks, man. I'm right here, Mom.

522
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,750
Ryan, honey, I'm so sorry.

523
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,239
I ruined it, huh?

524
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,678
- It's okay. We're almost there.
- No, no, I've ruined everything, huh?

525
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,353
- You hate me.
- No, I don't.

526
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,351
I love you, Mom.

527
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,911
It's okay, everyone.
It's just a... It's a little accident.

528
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,276
She's with us.

529
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,111
You mind?

530
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,157
So... You caught me.

531
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,710
- You can't do this. You're his mother.
- I'm a mess, not a mother.

532
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,599
- You have a responsibility.
- I'm being responsible.

533
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,557
I'm not wired for this.

534
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,393
I can't care for anybody else.

535
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,798
I don't have what you got.

536
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,756
The way your husband looks at you
and your kid looks at you.

537
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,117
Even my kid.

538
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,833
Like no matter what,
you're gonna make everything okay.

539
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,350
You hold your family together.

540
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,516
I tear mine apart.

541
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,435
You can't walk away.

542
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,113
Why?

543
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,996
This will be the first good thing
I ever did for him.

544
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,758
This way...

545
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,359
...he ends up with a real mom.

546
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,791
Take care of him, okay?

547
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,632
He deserves it.

548
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,273
Thanks.

549
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,836
- Hey.
- Hey.

550
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,159
- Where's...?
- Ryan's gonna stay with us now.

551
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,317
That's awesome.

552
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,839
I mean, that's...
That's awesome, right?

553
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,151
Let's go talk about stuff. Come on.

554
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,470
I'll unpack later.

555
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,030
Well, there's a no-return policy now,
you know that.

556
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,915
I love you. You know that?

557
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,318
Are we okay?

558
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,913
Yeah.

559
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,833
Good.

560
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,436
Because we just got in
way over our heads.

561
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,073
So then she says, "Blow on these."
And clearly, she's talking about...
