1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,237
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Looks like I'm dateless.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,311
- We'll be your date, right?
- Yeah, right.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,118
The guy seems cool, right?

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,271
- We don't have a lot in common.
- Besides your girlfriend.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,556
- So you chose Anna?
- Kind of, yeah.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,280
- Can we still all hang out?
- Sure.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,954
All this talk about plans,
about growing up, it's a routine.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,998
You're not even nice to Kirsten.
She's the reason we put up with you.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,678
- Hey!
- I'm a cop. He tried to buy coke from me.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,832
- You must like me to get me out of jail.
- That was Sandy.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,150
- You gonna tell her?
- You are.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,998
- Howdy.
- Hey.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,549
Sorry to just pop in.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,109
Is it okay if I come in?

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,669
Yeah, sure. Of course.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,519
It's just temporary.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,392
The place. It's just temporary.

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,235
- My dad lost his job, so my parents...
- I don't judge.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,437
I do, however, apologize.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,791
- The other night, Marissa, was...
- It's okay. Really.

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,678
No. No, it's not.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,276
I hit rock bottom.
A new low, even for me.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,715
But it was eye-opening.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,634
A call to arms. I called my parents.
I came clean about everything.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,153
And they were so supportive.

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,039
I talked to my sponsor.
I'm going to meetings again.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,830
And I totally was honest with Natalie
about all our issues.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,070
We're getting back together.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,470
Wow. That's amazing.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,871
And it never would've happened
if Ryan hadn't come to my rescue.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,792
He called Mr. Cohen.

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,918
I mean, busted trying to buy coke?

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,389
I should still be in jail.

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,233
Ryan helped me get a second chance.
I want to say thanks.

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,231
Oh, so do you want his number?

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,109
I want to take you and him
to Palm Springs.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,358
My family has a place there, right on
PGA West. It'll be great. It'll be great.

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,830
We can bring all your friends.
Seth, Anna, Summer.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,514
Even Luke.
You can meet my folks, meet Natalie.

40
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,669
Palm Springs?

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,990
Oh, it's so much fun.
The weather there is perfect.

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,071
- Do you golf?
- No. Not really.

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,595
I'll teach you. Ryan too.

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,308
Well, I do really want
to meet Natalie.

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,869
She's dying to meet both of you guys.

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,237
A little getaway, just the gang.
On me.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,870
- It's the least I can do.
- It sounds amazing.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,793
You know, let me
just call Ryan and ask him.

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,838
All right, knees bent.
Not quite that much.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,037
Back straight,
eyes right over the ball.

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,272
Feet a little closer together.
Just off your left foot. There you go.

52
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,637
Not quite that close together,
but that's okay.

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,712
All right, just let it hang
like a pendulum.

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,110
Nice and easy.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,350
Nice and easy. Keep breathing.

56
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,034
Nice and easy.

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,792
Nice...

58
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,918
I'll stop.
I'll just go right over here.

59
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,514
I got it.

60
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,711
- All right, one more.
- No. No more.

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,269
Come on, you were so good
at the driving range.

62
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,829
- I don't play golf.
- Not true. You just don't play well.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,673
You know, there's more to do
in Palm Springs than play golf.

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,193
- You can spa.
- I don't spa.

65
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,193
You don't play golf, you don't spa.
What do you do?

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,478
What exactly do you do,
besides musicals and punching people?

67
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,438
- Well, he's very good with the ladies.
- The ladies.

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,433
- He's very good with the ladies.
- Very good with the ladies.

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,115
- He's right here holding a golf club.
- Yeah, but you don't know how to use it.

70
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,157
Which is why I'm not going
to Palm Springs.

71
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,878
Hey. Yes, you are going
to Palm Springs.

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,315
Listen to me.
You did something nice for Oliver.

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,756
Now he wants to repay you by taking us
to his mansion in Palm Springs.

74
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,434
Without you, there is no deal.
Why can't you understand?

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,239
- He has a mansion on a golf course?
- And a ski chalet in Mammoth.

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,638
- I guess sometimes it's good to be Oliver.
- Sometimes it's great to be Oliver.

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,073
But you or I don't care
about those things, do we?

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,198
- Or Marissa. I don't think she cares either.
- You think?

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,830
I don't know. But even if she's
a little bit impressed, look over there.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,228
Who's got himself a pool house?

81
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,198
With ocean views.
Here, take another shot.

82
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,588
Nice and easy.

83
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,514
- So Oliver's parents are gonna be there?
- Yeah.

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,557
- Have you met them?
- No.

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,156
But, if they're anywhere
near as cool as Oliver...

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,473
I don't do nice and easy.

87
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,790
- Do we trust this Oliver kid?
- No. Not at all.

88
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,793
But we trust our guys,
and his parents are supposed to be there.

89
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,713
- And Seth knows to call hourly?
- Yeah, and...

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,871
...we're just gonna worry
all weekend.

91
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,718
They're golfing.

92
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,438
When we gonna get you
on the golf course?

93
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,034
Not today.

94
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,589
Do you know
who's coming home today?

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,389
God, the ugly Americans are coming back.
When do your father and Julie get in?

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,232
They arrive from Paris
this afternoon.

97
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,472
After confirming Europe's worst
suspicions of Americans, I'm guessing.

98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,235
Well, I'm guessing that this means
that Hailey will be on the way out.

99
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,756
What's she gonna do? Hit your dad up
for a blank check and then take off?

100
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,273
Was there ever any doubt?

101
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,195
I mean, last time she was gone
for two years. This time it could be three.

102
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,590
Who knows what trouble
she can get into.

103
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,150
- Morning.
- Hey, Hailey. Can I get you anything?

104
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,469
I got those pumpkin muffins.

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,518
And there's coffee
and there's orange juice without pulp.

106
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,514
- Dad comes back today, huh?
- Right. Yes, he does.

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,553
- So, what time will we be seeing him?
- Dinner. Seven.

108
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,154
I'm sorry, I'll have to miss that.

109
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,273
Julie Cooper's not coming, is she?

110
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,755
I can't believe Dad's with her.
She's only with him for his money.

111
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,990
And that is such
an unattractive quality.

112
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,275
- Pumpkin muffin?
- Yes, darling?

113
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,118
- I think it'll be fun.
- You do?

114
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,068
What could be more fun than joining
you guys for Couple Fest 2004?

115
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,791
You and Ryan, Oliver and Natalie,
Anna and What's-His-Face Cohen.

116
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,871
Me and Luke.
God, it should be all-time.

117
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,919
It won't be like that. It'll be a chance
to get out of town, hang out. It'll be fun.

118
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,196
What's more fun than watching
some nerdy neurotic bat...

119
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,430
...his eyelashes at his pixie chick?

120
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,478
So clearly you're okay
with being just friends with Seth.

121
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,071
- Clearly.
- I was being sarcastic.

122
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,593
So was I.

123
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,594
Which we never were before Cohen
showed up and taught us all irony.

124
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,115
- Jackass.
- Hey, Summ.

125
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,717
Look, if it's too hard to be around him,
then why go? Why do this to yourself?

126
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,235
Because I told them
that I was fine with it.

127
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,868
I told them I was cool
just being their friend.

128
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,519
I have a reputation.

129
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,150
- And I can't sabotage the trip from here.
- Summer.

130
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,518
Okay, what do you think about
laxatives in his coffee, huh?

131
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,993
No. Okay, dead frog
in his <i>X- Men</i> Underoos?

132
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,149
That's good. No.

133
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,117
No. I've got it.

134
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,158
While he's sleeping,
I slip his hand in warm water.

135
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,392
It makes you pee your bed.
Anna wakes up, sees he's a bed wetter...

136
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,120
...and that is awesome!
That is just...

137
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,236
...awesome.

138
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,799
- I've lost my mind, haven't I?
- Yeah, little bit.

139
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,430
And over Seth Cohen.

140
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,359
Jimmy. Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.
We're still on for dinner tonight, right?

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,592
Dinner? Yeah.

142
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,193
You okay?

143
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,028
No, I'm not really.

144
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,079
I just got turned down
for a manager's position in this place.

145
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,391
Apparently, that kid is better suited
to the rigors of the job than I am.

146
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,278
We should reschedule.
I'm not feeling social.

147
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,668
We can't reschedule.

148
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,831
The Lighthouse closes down
tonight forever.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,798
It's the last chance to get
the best chicken parmigiana around.

150
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,509
First The Lighthouse leaves Newport
and then me. How poetic.

151
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,910
- What do you mean?
- There's nothing here for me.

152
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,196
There's no opportunities,
no second chances.

153
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,592
I got a brother in Phoenix.
He called me this week and...

154
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,716
- You can't leave.
- Well, I can't stay.

155
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,314
I'm headed to work.
I know we have positions available.

156
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,436
No, Sandy, you can't. You've done...

157
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,229
It'll be nothing glamorous, just entry-level.
Paralegal work, that kind of thing.

158
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,030
Thanks. I mean, whatever it is.
Just as long as I can stay with Marissa.

159
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,476
I can't afford to support
the both of us much longer.

160
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,677
- We'll figure it out.
- Thanks.

161
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,310
You can't bail on me tonight, because
I'll be stuck with Hailey and Caleb.

162
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,835
- It's the least you can do. All right.
- Yeah. Thanks.

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,270
- Hey.
- Hi.

164
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:32,308
All right. And so it begins. Guess I'm
just gonna have to get used to this.

165
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,716
Seth's in his room.

166
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,590
It's upstairs to the left, right?

167
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,275
I'm just gonna make sure he's packed,
so he doesn't hold us up.

168
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,150
You know, we need
to be nice to Summer.

169
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,552
She's afraid this weekend is just gonna be
a bunch of couples doing couple-y stuff.

170
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,392
And it's not?

171
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,433
So we'll be hanging out with,
say, Oliver?

172
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,194
Oliver and Natalie. They made up.

173
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,158
- Do you have a problem with Oliver?
- No.

174
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,197
I mean, a guy shows up
out of nowhere...

175
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,351
...and suddenly he's hanging
around all the time.

176
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,035
Yeah, a guy shows up out of the blue,
knows no one, abandoned by his family.

177
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,873
Sound familiar?

178
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,234
A little bit.

179
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,756
Look, you did something nice for him,
and now he wants to repay you.

180
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,388
- By playing golf?
- Yeah. Well, it'll be fun.

181
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,198
You've never seen me play golf.

182
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,238
Then I guess
it'll be especially fun for me.

183
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,032
I love Palm Springs.
A little golf, a little <i>shvitz.</i>

184
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,518
I don't know.
It all sounds kind of old.

185
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,830
Yes. Anna, it does sound old.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,231
And somewhere inside me there's
an old Jewish man who's very excited.

187
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,231
- That came out a little disgusting.
- Kind of.

188
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,311
But, seriously,
there's the geriatric part of me...

189
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,153
...that actually loves
a good early-bird special...

190
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,311
...a little bit of shuffleboard,
some mahjong.

191
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,869
Well, when you put it that way.

192
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,598
Seriously, think about it.

193
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,196
Most old people are too actually old
to enjoy being old.

194
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,148
Not me, though. I'm ready to retire
right now to a life of leisure.

195
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,915
- Palm Springs is my Mecca.
- Well, what I'm looking forward to...

196
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,755
...is a weekend alone
without our parents.

197
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,549
I see where you're going with this.
We can have dinner as early as we want.

198
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,834
It'll be a couples' weekend.
We can have our own room.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,231
- Be still, my pacemaker.
- You dirty old man.

200
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,153
Hey, if the orthopedic shoe fits...

201
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,198
Hello, friends.
Are you guys almost ready to go?

202
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,998
- Yeah, totally.
- Hey, Summer.

203
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,469
Well, that is just great, you guys.

204
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,797
Sorry. God, Anna, it looked like
you were doing so well too.

205
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,473
- Don't worry about it.
- Thanks for being so forgiving.

206
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,236
We are gonna have so much fun
this weekend. All of us hanging out.

207
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,674
As friends.

208
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,996
- Did you rob a liquor store, Luke?
- You can't play golf without a buzz on.

209
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,230
Hey. Good tip, Bagger Vance.

210
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,591
A blender. Nice thinking, Cohen.

211
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,069
Yeah, no. It's actually a humidifier.
I get nose bleeds.

212
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,350
- How romantic.
- I think it's sweet.

213
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,795
- It'll make our room a tropical paradise.
- It will.

214
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,397
You know, it is so nice how you find all
of Cohen's weaknesses so adorable.

215
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,120
I'm not weak, okay?
I'm just delicate.

216
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,319
Well, looks like you and I
are the only ones without anyone.

217
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,199
Okay, I'm just gonna lie down
in the driveway.

218
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,396
Just back your truck right up over me.

219
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,829
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,312
- What's the matter?
- It's Natalie. It's over.

221
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,596
I don't know. Sorry.
Maybe we shouldn't go.

222
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,159
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't.

223
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,952
- What happened?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

224
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,237
No, you need to. And, you know what,
we need to get out of town.

225
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,039
I mean, maybe we could talk
about it on the ride down.

226
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,998
Well, is that okay?
If I ride with Oliver?

227
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,790
- Or maybe we could all go together?
- No, you guys go. I'll see you down there.

228
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,070
Hey, Chino!
Why don't you ride with me.

229
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,190
- Can I ride with you guys?
- Yeah, sure.

230
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,759
Shotgun.

231
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,956
Thanks for understanding.

232
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,318
Dad. Julie. You're early.

233
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,198
<i>Bonjour,</i> Kiki.

234
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,233
- Cheese wheel? It's brie.
- Oh, thanks.

235
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,517
- How was France?
- Aside from the French...

236
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,313
Where's Hailey?

237
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,950
She's showering, I think.
I wasn't expecting you guys so soon.

238
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,430
He couldn't wait to see his precious
Hailey. Couldn't even let me shower.

239
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,670
How is she? How's she looking?
Too thin?

240
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,432
She looks good. Her spirits are high.

241
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,875
- She's high?
- No, her spirits. Her mood. She's up.

242
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,759
- So she's on uppers?
- No, she seems balanced.

243
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,117
- You changed your hair.
- Do you like it? Isn't it <i>Fran Ìais</i>?

244
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,840
- Cal says he doesn't like it.
- Hey, Dad.

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,433
Hailey.

246
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,718
It's great to see you.

247
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,557
- Julie. Your hair.
- Hailey. You're here.

248
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,637
I haven't seen you since...
How long has it been?

249
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,155
Dad, are you gonna
start with me already?

250
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,834
Fair enough. Just tell me
what you been up to.

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,117
- All your adventures.
- I thought we could swing by the house...

252
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,510
Kiki, could you make us some lunch?
I'm starved.

253
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,875
So tell me about Costa Rica.

254
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,474
How about lunch? We have brie.

255
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,915
- Brought enough beer?
- Oh, you never know, buddy.

256
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,798
You never know.

257
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,028
- Hey. You made it.
- Yeah.

258
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,839
We tried following you,
but it was hard to keep up.

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,073
Sorry. I guess I got all wrapped up
in my saga. I got a little distracted.

260
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,952
This place is awesome.
Where's the fridge?

261
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,999
- I don't want these to get skunked.
- Yeah, I'll show you the kitchen.

262
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,557
- Think you brought enough beer, man?
- Everybody keeps saying that.

263
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,110
- How was it?
- It was okay. We talked.

264
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,194
He talked mostly.
He just wanted someone to listen.

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,870
How's he?

266
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,028
He's a little fragile. But, hey,
I think getting out of town will help.

267
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,477
Hope you guys weren't talking
about me when I was gone.

268
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,269
Sorry for taking your girlfriend away from
you. But don't worry, she's all yours.

269
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,318
- I wasn't worried.
- Right.

270
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,073
Okay...

271
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,874
I was trying to give you
some culture, Cohen.

272
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,395
The audio version of <i>The</i>
<i>Da Vinci Code</i> is not culture.

273
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,677
- Yeah, well, it's a true story.
- Hey.

274
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,717
God!

275
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,479
Hey, Dad. How are you doing? Six calls
in two hours. That's a new record.

276
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,198
Yeah. No. We...

277
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,511
We're still fine,
believe it or not. Okay.

278
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,116
Okay, what I can do, then,
is call you from every hole. Cool?

279
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,113
Okay, great. Bye.

280
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,871
Where are your folks?

281
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,154
Yeah, their plane got delayed
in Zurich.

282
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,917
I don't think they're
gonna make it this weekend.

283
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,629
- Welcome to their humble abode.
- Thanks, man.

284
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,678
Now let's get everyone settled
before we hit the links, huh?

285
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,355
I set up two tee times. I figured Seth,
Summer and Anna could be a threesome.

286
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,073
Let me show everyone to their room.

287
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,789
And last but not least...

288
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,153
Oh, I forgot this is the room
with the two twins.

289
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,437
Do you want to switch rooms?
Or we could push them together?

290
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,556
Oh, no, this is fine. It's great.

291
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,439
- I'm just gonna go change.
- Okay.

292
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,079
I'll help you with the beds.

293
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,751
Hopefully it won't be
too uncomfortable.

294
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,751
All right, thanks.

295
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,516
I really appreciate you being so cool
about Marissa and I being friends.

296
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,873
Well, yeah, no problem.

297
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,512
I mean, with everything you two
just went through with Luke...

298
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,877
...the last thing you need
is another guy not to trust.

299
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,834
- With Luke?
- Yeah.

300
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,276
You thinking that maybe he and Marissa
were getting back together.

301
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,192
That was a while ago.

302
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,434
I'm not judging. I mean, if anyone
should have trust issues...

303
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,034
- What does that mean?
- Just your background.

304
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,113
Marissa was filling me in
on some of the details on our ride down.

305
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,759
- She was?
- Yeah.

306
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,072
But, I mean, just in terms of how amazing
it is that you're so healthy.

307
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,193
Well-adjusted. Considering.

308
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,388
Considering?

309
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,436
- So how do I look?
- Perfect.

310
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,715
Yeah, great.

311
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,675
Sandy Cohen working on a Saturday.

312
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,718
Tom Wellington, how are you?
Playing catch-up, huh?

313
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,836
Buying some time
away from the wife and kids.

314
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,036
How touching.
Listen, I got a question for you.

315
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,954
Celeste in Records is going on maternity
leave, and we haven't found anyone yet.

316
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,554
- You know Jimmy Cooper, right?
- Jimmy Cooper?

317
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,995
- Yeah.
- Are you out of your mind?

318
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,038
This is one of the most
reputable firms in the county.

319
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,033
What's it gonna do for our profile,
hiring a notorious criminal?

320
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,316
There's no such thing
as bad publicity.

321
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,994
Before he went down,
there was no one smarter than Jimmy.

322
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,799
- Everyone in this town loved him.
- Till he ripped them off.

323
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,316
He made a mistake, he's paying it off.
He doesn't deserve a second chance?

324
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,074
Not in our firm.
Not in this lifetime.

325
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,994
The best thing you can do around Jimmy?
Stand upwind. Don't get his stink on you.

326
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,149
He's a good guy, Tom.

327
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,039
Yeah? Well, then, why don't you
go into business with him?

328
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,798
She so looks like Mom, it's scary.

329
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,475
He takes one look at Hailey
and he can't say no.

330
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,948
And right now,
she's telling him of her plan...

331
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,749
...to help the indigent population
of some depressed country.

332
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,151
And all she's looking for
is some all-expense-paid bender...

333
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,390
...to Amsterdam or Thailand.

334
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,836
It's amazing he can't see it. She's only
being nice to him for his money.

335
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,592
Every time she vanishes,
it's for a little while longer.

336
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,113
The trips get wilder and wilder.

337
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,355
One of these days,
I don't think she's coming back.

338
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,035
You know you're the only one
he listens to, Kirsten.

339
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,078
If you're really scared
she's gonna disappear again...

340
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,708
...you need to stop him
from letting her.

341
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,879
- How's this?
- Pretty good.

342
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,669
You just gotta get your hips
into it a little more.

343
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,159
You know, you gotta go:

344
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,397
I think she's got the idea.

345
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,238
Rock and fire.

346
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,189
For a beautiful girl,
that is one ugly swing.

347
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,316
Got to follow that, huh?

348
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,833
Don't suppose you were using
creative visualization?

349
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,594
My face as the golf ball?

350
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,557
Can't wait to see
your short game, buddy.

351
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,871
- I think your ball's in the trees.
- That's bad, right?

352
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,716
Thanks for carrying my golf bag,
Cohen. I really think I threw out my back.

353
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,314
If your back hurts,
why don't we take a golf cart?

354
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,357
What? Are you, like, against nature?

355
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,318
- This isn't nature. This is a golf course.
- I have a hernia.

356
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,314
You guys, this way we can spend
more time together as friends.

357
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,357
How come when she says "friends,"
it sounds like a threat?

358
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,317
It's her inflection.

359
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,115
What? We did say we'd try and be
friends. Who's she gonna talk to? Luke?

360
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,158
The guy only recently
learned how to walk upright.

361
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,519
Cohen...

362
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,318
...could you help me find my ball?

363
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,040
Anna, stay back.
There might be poison ivy.

364
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,193
- Summer, I don't wanna get poison ivy.
- Cohen, I thought you were my friend.

365
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,078
Okay.

366
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,398
Looks like Summer's not
the only one who lost their balls.

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,878
- Too bad.
- I could hurt that guy.

368
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,156
So could I.

369
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,870
Am I trying too hard with him?
All I want is to be friends.

370
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,031
I just feel like he hates me.

371
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,230
No. I mean... He likes you.

372
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,517
- He just...
- Right. Trust issues.

373
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,036
- Can't win them all, I guess.
- Hey, nobody's looking.

374
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,748
Oh, nice shot, buddy!

375
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,957
Okay. I think we've torn up
the course long enough.

376
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,998
Last guy back buys the first round.

377
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,917
Come on.

378
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,756
Step on it. Come on.

379
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,031
Come on, they're gaining on us.

380
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,834
You better run!

381
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,750
Look out! Ryan, stop, stop!

382
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,078
Dude, nice driving.
You made that thing dance.

383
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,832
What the hell is your problem, man?

384
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,194
Hey, man...

385
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,715
- I thought we were just joking.
- Yeah. Good joke.

386
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,236
- Come down here, tell me another one.
- Oh, sorry, man.

387
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,516
See you back at the house, okay?

388
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,798
Are you okay?

389
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,030
You know, he was just playing.

390
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,194
Fine.

391
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,990
That guy was not playing.

392
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,716
- Hey.
- You look nice.

393
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,235
You look like you're not
having dinner with your father.

394
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,358
I'm gonna give them one-on-one time.
It's not a dinner I want to be at.

395
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,990
I feel the same way about my meal.
Jimmy's right. He is done here.

396
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,594
His best shot is starting over
somewhere else.

397
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,197
So we'll have a nice meal, a couple
of drinks and talk about his next move.

398
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,999
Alcohol? Yes. Inspired.

399
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,230
How do you think
I got you to marry me?

400
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,790
So you were drunk.
Explains everything, Kiki.

401
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,279
Hey, Dad.

402
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,671
It is always such a pleasure.
You two have the time of your lives.

403
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,998
- You're not dressed.
- I'm not going.

404
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,869
- We both know why Hailey's here.
- She wants to catch up...

405
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,316
...with her family.
- Dad, you honestly don't believe that.

406
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,472
Don't be jealous of your sister.
I love both my daughters equally.

407
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,278
You don't, but that's okay.

408
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,955
What's not okay is that she wants to take
advantage of how much you love her.

409
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,351
- You want me to cut her off?
- I know you do too.

410
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,274
Dinner at 6, in bed by 8.

411
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,115
Anna, my old Jewish man
is very happy right now.

412
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,038
It's pretty humid, Seth.
I think you could stop futzing.

413
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,829
No. No, I can't. Futzing's what I do,
my darling. Besides, I almost have it.

414
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,158
And there we go.
She's purring like a kitten.

415
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,795
So, Cohen.

416
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,873
You and me, alone in a bed.

417
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,753
Polyfill. It's not as comfortable as down,
but it's good for our allergies, our sniffles.

418
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,514
And this bed, huh?
It's Posturepedic for my back.

419
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,113
And your back.

420
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,151
- Yes?
- My catheter fell out.

421
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,712
Hey, guys.

422
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,595
Hey.

423
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,796
Luke's hogging the remote,
and it's either football or porn.

424
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,871
So could I watch TV with you guys?

425
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,350
- We're not watching TV, Summer.
- Yeah, we were about to go to bed.

426
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,875
- But it's 8:00. What are you, 70?
- On the inside, yes.

427
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,952
I thought this was a weekend
where we could hang out as friends.

428
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,992
- It is.
- Totally.

429
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,310
Oh, I get it.

430
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,438
It's, like, specific friend hours, right?
Whatever works for you?

431
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,034
A friend on-off switch.
A friend appointment book.

432
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,112
- Do I schedule friend time in advance?
- No, that is not it at all.

433
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,316
- It's not it.
- Great. You guys.

434
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,591
That's great.

435
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,277
That Enrique is so hot.

436
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,955
I mean, can you imagine
being with a guy with abs like that?

437
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,870
Yeah, apparently not.

438
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,316
You don't have to do that.

439
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,357
I don't mind.

440
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,950
Well, at least let me help.

441
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,799
- Where's Marissa?
- Getting changed for the hot tub.

442
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,317
You going in?

443
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,352
Right.

444
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,515
Can...? Can we just start over?

445
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,914
Start over?

446
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,514
Yeah, I feel like
we got off on the wrong foot.

447
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,391
And I wanna make this right. Get this
thing straight, so we can be friends.

448
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,308
What can I do?

449
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,514
Next time you wanna be
alone with my girlfriend...

450
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,830
...let me know so I can stay home.

451
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,470
This always happens.

452
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,554
Natalie. My friends at Pacific.
And now you.

453
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,599
I'm so stupid!

454
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,990
- Take it easy.
- Damn it!

455
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,156
Everybody who knows me for more
than five minutes ends up hating my guts.

456
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,880
- That's not true. Nobody hates your guts.
- What's going on?

457
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,031
We were... We were talking.

458
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,515
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm...

459
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,875
I'm gonna go get some
fresh air and...

460
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,031
- I'll get some stuff for breakfast.
- I'll go too.

461
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,113
No, just... Just stay with Ryan.
I'll be back soon. Just...

462
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,511
Just leave the kitchen, man.
Everything's okay.

463
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,316
You managed to drive him
out of his own house?

464
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,710
I don't know.
We were talking, and he went off.

465
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,395
What were you talking about
that was so upsetting?

466
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,551
- You.
- Me?

467
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,553
You and him.

468
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,030
You know what? Oliver's got problems,
but you're the one who's paranoid.

469
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,356
- What's your problem?
- I don't know.

470
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,829
Maybe that you spent the ride
telling him about me.

471
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,515
I wasn't. I was talking about my life.
And you're part of my life.

472
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,437
You know what? I don't understand
what's going on with you.

473
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,638
- There's gotta be more I can do.
- Sandy, you've done everything you can.

474
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,915
- No, no.
- You know what?

475
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,196
You're right, it's for the best.

476
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,669
Like you said, I can start over,
have a new life.

477
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,957
I never really wanted to be
a financial planner. Or a thief.

478
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,998
Okay, so figure out right now.
What is it you really wanna do?

479
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,119
What I really wanna do is not be
40 years old, divorced, with two kids...

480
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,589
...and trying to figure out
what I really want to do.

481
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,990
- What is it you used to want to be?
- A pilot.

482
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,994
You know, I always liked
stewardesses. You?

483
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,470
I always wanted to be left fielder
for the New York Yankees.

484
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,915
It was that dream that
carried me through law school.

485
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,313
The most enjoyable job I ever had,
actually, was working here.

486
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,110
Yeah. I managed this place
the summer I married Julie.

487
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,716
- And look at it now. It's closing.
- I mean, John Wayne used to come here.

488
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,949
- Gary Cooper.
- Yeah.

489
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,829
This is the real deal, you know.
This is the last bit of old Newport.

490
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,515
Look at it, all it needs
is just a little facelift.

491
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,355
The land value alone would be enough
to secure a decent renovation loan.

492
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,469
You know, you update the menu a little
bit, you bring back happy hour, it'd be...

493
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,518
- It would be fun.
- The kids would come in. It'd be fantastic.

494
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,750
I mean, a lot more fun
than whatever...

495
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,718
...high-priced nuisance lawsuit
I got waiting for me on my desk.

496
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,077
A lot more fun than moving
to Phoenix without my kids.

497
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,111
What?

498
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,474
Katie!

499
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,558
Two more martinis, please.

500
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,711
Egg McMuffins.

501
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,348
- Sounds so good.
- Why can't they serve those all day?

502
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,672
Totally. Like, what technological
innovation is preventing that?

503
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,671
They can put a man
on the moon, correct?

504
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,513
And they can't serve
an Egg McMuffin past 10:30 a.m.

505
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,352
Can't figure it out.
It doesn't make sense.

506
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,431
Cabbage Patch Kids.

507
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,720
They still sell those? I don't get the legend
of the cabbage patch. It freaks me out.

508
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,075
What? Babies harvested
from the heads of cabbage?

509
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,071
- Exactly.
- What's so freaky about that?

510
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,992
It's all about
some child-slavery ring.

511
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,230
It's disgusting.
It makes me want to vomit.

512
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,793
<i>Smurfs</i>, dude.

513
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,394
Do you know how tall they were?
Three apples.

514
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,835
- Really?
- Three apples.

515
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,198
There should be a channel on television,
I think, of us watching television.

516
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,475
- We're that good.
- Yeah.

517
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,349
Yeah, you are. You're so that good.

518
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,274
Your whole witty-banter thing
is so cute, you guys.

519
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,273
You guys are like brother and sister.

520
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,000
Yeah, you guys could totally
be related.

521
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,628
I'm gonna go to bed.

522
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,836
I'm going to bed too.

523
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,511
Hey.

524
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,676
- He's not back yet?
- No. And he still hasn't called.

525
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,876
I'm really worried.
It's been two hours.

526
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,591
- What's wrong with him, exactly?
- He's been battling depression for a while.

527
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,754
And he's had some
substance-abuse problems.

528
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,433
I'm sorry.

529
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,354
I just hope he's okay.

530
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,916
It's him.

531
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,230
- Hey.
- Marissa...

532
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,118
...something happened.

533
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,838
What's wrong? What is it?

534
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,353
- I messed up real bad.
- Where are you?

535
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,558
- <i>What did you do?</i>
I just drove back to Newport...

536
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,439
...and took a whole bunch of pills.

537
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,635
Whole bunch.

538
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,473
- Call an ambulance.
- No, no. No doctors.

539
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,474
- Please. Just...
- I'm so scared right now.

540
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,518
Maybe I could throw them up.

541
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,398
Do that.
Just get them out of your system.

542
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,556
I'll try.

543
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,119
But...

544
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,952
...do you think you could...

545
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,473
...come back?

546
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,359
I'm sorry, but I am so scared.

547
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,029
Okay, we're leaving right now.
See you soon.

548
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,033
- He's not okay.
- He just took a bunch of pills.

549
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,678
- He's not picking up.
- It's okay. You just talked to him.

550
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,159
That was 20 minutes ago.

551
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,436
Hi. Marissa Cooper
for Oliver Trask, please.

552
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,113
- I thought you said he was okay.
- He said he was.

553
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,032
He said he spent the last hour
in the bathroom...

554
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,634
...getting the pills
out of his system.

555
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,836
- But if that's true...
- What?

556
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,991
Why isn't he picking up?

557
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,911
What the hell did you say to Dad?
I know you're behind this.

558
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,796
Hailey, we had a conversation
and we both agreed...

559
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,431
How convenient that the one thing you
two agree on is how to screw me over.

560
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,429
- Hailey, you don't have to do this.
- I thought this is what you wanted.

561
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,990
Me not taking Dad's money
or taking up room in your house.

562
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,276
I never said that you couldn't stay.

563
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,069
No. You said you wanted me to live my
own life, be on my own, be independent.

564
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,800
Then you went and sabotaged
my relationship with Dad.

565
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,669
What relationship with Dad? You take
his money and then you take off.

566
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,594
My relationship with Dad
is between me and Dad.

567
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,877
- Was between me and Dad.
- I just don't wanna see you in trouble.

568
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,315
Well, now you won't have to.

569
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,351
There's my cab.

570
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,912
Oh, Hailey, where are you gonna go?
You don't have any money.

571
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,993
Yeah, well, whose fault is that?
I'll find another way to get by.

572
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,879
- You could stay here and work for Dad.
- Why?

573
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,758
So I can be as independent as you are?

574
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,515
Living off his money
in the McMansion he built you?

575
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,272
I'm sorry...

576
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,432
...but you were right.
I need to have my own life.

577
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,831
And the only way that I can do that
is to get as far away from Dad...

578
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,355
...and as far away from you as I can.

579
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,953
I'll see you.

580
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,678
Oliver. Open up, please.

581
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,671
It's me.

582
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,952
- We have to call security.
- I'll go.

583
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,873
Oliver. Oh, my God. You're okay.

584
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,996
Yeah, kind of.

585
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,794
- You all right, man?
- Yeah. A little embarrassed.

586
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,317
- When you didn't pick up the phone, l...
- I was in the shower. Sorry about that.

587
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,916
I got kind of messed up,
but I'm good now.

588
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,399
Yeah.

589
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,630
You guys should go,
enjoy the rest of the weekend.

590
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,237
What are you talking about?
We're not going anywhere.

591
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,913
So, what did you take exactly?

592
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,833
I don't know.

593
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,834
A bunch of sleeping pills,
some painkillers.

594
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,351
Well, how many?

595
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,877
I don't remember. But I got them
all out of my system, I promise.

596
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,715
Well, did you drink any water?
Because you're probably dehydrated.

597
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,236
You know, we should call room service.
You want any ginger ale or Gatorade?

598
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,868
Maybe we should take him
to the emergency room. I mean...

599
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,076
...he swallowed all those pills.

600
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,549
If they were in my system,
I'd have felt them by now.

601
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,077
Yeah, but why take any chances?
We can take you now.

602
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,153
The thing is, if we go
to the emergency room...

603
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,118
...they'll put me under suicide watch
for 72 hours.

604
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,590
They'll call the cops, and then
they'll call my parents in Zurich.

605
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,069
I mean, the truth is that I'm fine.

606
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,791
Really. I just want to just crawl into my
bed and forget this day ever happened.

607
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,192
- Sandy.
- Hey, you're awake.

608
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,032
Oh, shoot!

609
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,317
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

610
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,595
Are you drunk?

611
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,156
- Don't worry, I took a cab.
- Yeah, so did Hailey.

612
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,880
Dad cut her off, and she cut me off.

613
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,598
Oh, I'm sorry.

614
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,591
So how was your night?

615
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,478
That good, huh?

616
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,835
You know, I'm not sure, but...

617
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,072
I think Jimmy and I might have
gone into business together tonight.

618
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,039
Really?
And what kind of business is that?

619
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,269
The restaurant business.

620
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,149
- Oh, you are drunk.
- In an adorable way, I think. Yeah?

621
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,469
- And what about the firm?
- They'll have my body.

622
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,677
And so will you, by the way.

623
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,197
But the restaurant will have
my soul and my income.

624
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,397
- And my savings.
- How can you do that?

625
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,755
Look, I'm making more money
than I ever made in my life...

626
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,512
...and I'm having way less fun.

627
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,274
I used to help people for a living,
you remember that.

628
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,671
I'll tell you, your buddy Jimmy Cooper,
man, he needs some help.

629
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,515
Oh, man, if he doesn't get a job,
he's gonna have to leave town.

630
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,511
I don't want him to leave town.

631
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,514
You know, it's been a long time
since I've had a friend in Newport.

632
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,355
I don't want to have to find
another friend in Newport. Am I crazy?

633
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,349
Oh, I'm crazy.

634
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,637
You have to be crazy
to be in the restaurant business.

635
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,950
But I think it's great
that you wanna help Jimmy.

636
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,235
Well, you know...

637
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,871
And be friends after all this time,
it means a lot to me.

638
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,352
Sandy?

639
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,269
They're sleeping.

640
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,394
Hey, we're home.

641
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,995
Thanks for the ride, buddy.
Great weekend, huh?

642
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,639
- Bye, Summer.
- Bye.

643
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,439
See you guys. Have fun. Drive safely.

644
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,758
So you're into Cohen, huh?

645
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,876
It must be kind of weird
to see him with somebody else.

646
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,316
- It was for me with Marissa.
- Whatevs.

647
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,109
I'm over it. Moving on.
Ready for my next victim.

648
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,392
Well, just for the record...

649
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,358
...whoever he turns out to be,
he's a lucky dude.

650
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,080
You're looking pretty hot
these days, Summer.

651
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,878
Real hot.

652
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,072
Thanks.

653
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,156
Oh, my God!

654
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,313
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Luke. You're cute
and everything, but there's just no way.

655
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,112
No worries.

656
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,794
What are you doing?
What are you looking for?

657
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,598
Nothing. Is he gonna be all right?

658
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,149
Yeah. I think so.
I told him I'd stay tonight.

659
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,751
- What?
- Well, I can't leave him alone.

660
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,831
What if he tries it again?

661
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,197
- Lf he tried it the first time.
- What?

662
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,154
What if he didn't try
to kill himself tonight?

663
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,231
- What?
- He wouldn't go to the hospital.

664
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,119
Maybe he didn't want to be
shipped off to an institution.

665
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,590
Maybe he belongs there.
I mean, what kind of person does this?

666
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,473
- No, not... I didn't mean...
- You should go.

667
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,552
- You weren't trying to kill yourself.
- Maybe Oliver wasn't either.

668
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,554
But he's my friend,
and I can't leave him alone tonight.

669
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,077
So, you know what, just go home,
and I'll see you in the morning.

670
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,397
Sorry to interrupt.

671
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,874
I just want to say thanks, Ryan.
For everything, man.

672
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,674
Sorry for ruining your weekend.

673
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,917
Good night.

674
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,910
I'll call you tomorrow.
