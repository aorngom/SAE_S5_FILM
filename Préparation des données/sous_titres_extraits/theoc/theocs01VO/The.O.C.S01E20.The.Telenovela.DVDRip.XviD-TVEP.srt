1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,439
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Can we just start over?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,594
- Wait.
- Don't you want to?

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,193
No.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,068
- Ryan.
- Theresa.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,310
- You ever think about coming home?
- Sometimes.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,118
I know I shouldn't be here.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,668
Would you like to come in?

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,513
It's always been you, Summer.
You're undeniable.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,032
I'm a man now. I had sex with a girl.
Summer, to be more specific.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,918
Hi, Marissa. Theresa.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,551
Okay. Bye.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,718
So you and Marissa, you guys broken up?
You guys taking a break? What's the deal?

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,838
I don't know.
We're just not seeing each other.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,879
Except you will see each other, at school
every day for the next couple years.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,794
Right. Well, we'll just
go back to being friends.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,030
When were you guys ever friends?

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,352
Was it when you were beating up her
boyfriend? Or spooning in a Tijuana motel?

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,432
- Is that when you were friends?
- Doesn't mean we can't be friends.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,919
I don't know.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,588
Think I'll see her today?

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,909
Friends, Coop?

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,789
What are you guys gonna do together?
Lift weights? Try on wife-beaters?

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,474
Sorry. Guys like Ryan
aren't friends with girls.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,712
I don't wanna just be his friend.
But after the whole Oliver thing...

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,838
...I guess I need to show him
he can trust me.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,520
Who knows if he'll
even wanna be friends.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,911
- So how goes it with Seth?
- Weird.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,719
In public, he's like this huge geek
who mumbles.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,236
I don't even know what he's saying half
the time. But behind closed doors...

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,312
...underneath the sheets,
he's like the anti-Cohen.

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,198
You think I'll have to see him today?

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,999
I think me and Summer are finally
over the hump, by the way.

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,435
So to speak. I just hope, man...

34
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,319
...that she can keep it in her trousers
when she sees me today.

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,153
She'll probably have her little paws
all over me.

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,359
That's probably her now,
a little phone sex.

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,916
Who do I know from the 909?

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,832
Nobody.

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,554
- Hello?
- <i>Ryan?</i>

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,517
Hi, it's Theresa.

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,434
- Yeah, Seth's mom gave me this number.
- Hey. How are you? Everything okay?

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,397
Yeah, fine.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,632
- I'm actually coming out there today.
- You are? How come?

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,758
- I mean, for work?
- Yeah...

45
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,150
...but they can't make us
work all the time, right?

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,995
- I was thinking we could hang out tonight.
- Tonight? Sure.

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,512
- Don't sound so excited.
- I am. I'm just a little surprised, that's all.

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,831
Oh, you know me, full of surprises.
So I'll come by after dinner.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,956
Yeah, sounds good. See you then.

50
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,879
Hey, baby. Who's that?

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,871
Wrong number.

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,556
That was Theresa.
She's in town, wants to hang out.

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,631
As a friend.

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,350
Well, first Marissa, then Theresa.

55
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,511
Who knew Ryan Atwood was so friendly?

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,792
- Summer.
- Cohen.

57
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,757
- Ryan.
- Hi.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,358
- Summer. Can we talk?
- Hey, Brad, what's up?

59
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,714
Brad.

60
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,519
Dude, I didn't recognize you
out of the Speedo.

61
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,473
Not that I'd recognize you
in a Speedo, but...

62
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,949
Okay. Come on.

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,118
Jeez.

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,392
- So how are you?
- I'm...

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,715
I'm late. See you.

66
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,550
So we're doing a fundraiser for the team,
a kissing booth.

67
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,154
I'm gonna be the guy,
and we're looking for a girl...

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,153
...who's comfortable being paid
to make out with a bunch of guys.

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,471
- Naturally, I thought of you.
- Really? You thought of me?

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,632
God. Totally. I mean, why not?

71
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,313
- Thanks, Summer.
- Sure.

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,637
He talked to you like I wasn't there.
Does he know we're going out?

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,518
It's not like he wants to kiss me.

74
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,513
He just wants me to kiss
a bunch of other dudes for money.

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,671
I'll see you tonight. My place?

76
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,239
You can help me practice.

77
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,871
- Anna.
- So you guys are together now?

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,918
Well, that didn't take long, did it?

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,513
Yeah, Summer and I are...

80
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,033
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,033
I mean, I did see it coming.
It's the reason I broke up with you.

82
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,474
- Hey, how was Pittsburgh?
- It was good to be home.

83
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,349
Pittsburgh's also the home
of Andy Warhol, Mr. Rogers and ketchup.

84
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,272
- You can't compete with that.
- You can't.

85
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,552
Yeah, it was really great.
I got a tuna melt at my favorite diner...

86
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,280
...and I saw <i>Some Kind of Wonderful</i>
at the midnight movie...

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,273
...and hung out with all my friends.
It was really nice.

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,829
Guess I didn't realize
how much I missed them.

89
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,431
Hey, Dad.
You wanted to see me?

90
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,875
Kiki, we got a problem.

91
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,317
- Uncle Shaun was arrested last night.
- You're kidding. For what?

92
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,119
He was drunk, stumbled into
another guest's room at the St. Regis.

93
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,949
He's been stumbling around drunk
since you met him...

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,078
...which was in a bar.
I'll have someone in Legal handle it.

95
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,277
- I was thinking you might ask Sandy.
- Very funny.

96
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,238
He knows people at the DA's office.
He can make this go away.

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,152
- He'll never do it.
- Why not?

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,073
- Because it would be a favor to me?
- Pretty much. Yeah.

99
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,435
You could tell him
it would mean a lot to you.

100
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,310
Actually, it would mean a lot to me.

101
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,948
But if you want Sandy's help
after all these years...

102
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,238
...then you need to ask him,
because that would mean a lot to Sandy.

103
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,635
- No.
- You should see these two guys.

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,678
- Oh, come on.
- Honestly, it was unbelievable.

105
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,159
I swear to God.

106
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,356
- Hi.
- Hi.

107
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,032
So this is you and Summer
being a couple?

108
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,915
- Ain't love grand?
- I can really sense the bond.

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,231
It's like, your closeness,
it's overwhelming.

110
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,958
Oh, my gosh. Wait.

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,190
Is it last fall already?

112
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,670
- Come on, she's totally ignoring you.
- Anna, she's not ignoring me.

113
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,594
Summer just has her priorities in order.
You know how she feels about charity.

114
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,519
- Yes?
- Yeah. Good luck with that.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,877
Mrs. Cooper.

116
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,759
- What are you doing here?
- Parent-teacher conference.

117
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,435
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

118
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,117
Really good. You... I mean...
God, you look good.

119
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,875
Luke, I'm Marissa's mother.
You're a student at this school.

120
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,831
- We can't do this.
- You mean it's over?

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,797
No, I mean in the hallway.

122
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,712
I'll see you tonight.

123
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,759
- Hey, Julie.
- Jimmy, hi.

124
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,150
- You remember Luke.
- Who could forget?

125
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,799
- Luke.
- Hey, Mr. Cooper.

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,714
I'm glad you're here. I didn't want to go
to Dr. Kim's office alone. She scares me.

127
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,077
Okay, well, goodbye, Mrs. Cooper.
And Mr. Cooper.

128
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,553
I'll see you.

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,278
Both.

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,551
Have a good day.

131
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,559
Hey, I'm sorry about this morning.
That...

132
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,915
- It shouldn't have to be...
- Like this?

133
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,713
I was just sort of hoping
we could be friends, you know?

134
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,111
- I mean, as long as that's okay with you.
- Yeah. No, we should hang out.

135
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,069
Okay.
What are you doing tonight?

136
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,557
- Tonight's no good.
- It's okay. We don't have to do this.

137
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,597
What about after school?

138
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,830
Actually, after school's good.
It's better...

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,798
...because I'm supposed to have dinner
with my dad. Your place?

140
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,916
- Yeah, see you then.
- Cool.

141
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,359
Well...

142
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,115
...the restaurant's coming along, Sandy.
At this rate, you'll be open by 2008.

143
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,316
And there goes my appetite.
Caleb, hello.

144
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,714
- What the hell is that?
- It's my mother's meat loaf.

145
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,677
- God, your mother's here?
- Her recipe is.

146
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,435
- We're trying out a chef. You want some?
- The sight of your mother's meat loaf...

147
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,989
...has turned me into a vegetarian.

148
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,948
I know you're a big fan of the pop-in, but
is there another reason why you're here?

149
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,236
I've come to ask a favor.

150
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,833
I'm sorry, what did you say?

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,197
- You didn't hear me?
- I heard you. I want you to say it again.

152
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,477
- A friend is in trouble. I want you to help.
- I didn't know you had friends.

153
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,074
- It's Bill Shaughnessy.
- Uncle Shaun.

154
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,119
You pay Uncle Shaun to be your friend.
I guess he qualifies. What did he do?

155
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,158
He was drinking, stumbled into
someone else's hotel room.

156
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,596
They called security,
and now it's a legal matter.

157
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,355
- You've got lawyers at your beck and call.
- He came to me as a friend.

158
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,988
I want it handled like a friend.
Quietly.

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,628
By someone who has a relationship
with the DA's office?

160
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,679
I'm asking you.
I've known Shaun for over 40 years.

161
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,558
It would mean a lot to me.

162
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,913
- Did Kirsten tell you to say that?
- She thinks you'll say no.

163
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,275
My wife knows me pretty well.

164
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,510
But, you know,
sometimes I like to surprise her.

165
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,195
I don't want her to go and get all
conceited and stuff, you know?

166
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,636
You have a copy of the police report?
Now, I'm not saying that I'll do it.

167
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,157
I'm saying that I'll look at the report,
I'll make some calls and then we'll see.

168
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,828
- Got any more of that meat loaf?
- Maybe.

169
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,797
Well, that was a relief. Dr. Kim seems
to think Marissa's doing well.

170
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,269
I was sure she was gonna revoke
my license to parent.

171
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,908
You know, Jimmy,
I don't think I ever thanked you.

172
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,717
That's not true. You've thanked me
for alienating the community...

173
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,792
...destroying the family.
- For doing a wonderful job with Marissa.

174
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,515
I'm serious.
Listening to you in that meeting...

175
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,832
...you're totally involved in her life.
- You and Caleb must be doing really well.

176
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,955
- Why would you say that?
- Because you're being so...

177
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,156
...nice.
- Well, actually...

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,392
...Caleb and I aren't
seeing each other anymore.

179
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,039
And I'm much happier.

180
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,958
And to think, you've spent a lifetime
wanting to be rich and married...

181
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,157
...when what agrees with you most
is being poor and alone.

182
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,548
Isn't it better when we're alone?
Just the two of us?

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,673
- Why did you ignore me at school today?
- I didn't ignore you.

184
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,669
Okay, maybe a little.

185
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,718
I just... I want our relationship
to be private, okay?

186
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,075
I don't like other people
knowing my business.

187
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,834
- Why not?
- Because it's none of their business.

188
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,112
Look, there's, like, pressure...

189
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,590
...and scrutiny in the spotlight.
- What spotlight?

190
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,593
When has being in the public eye
ever helped a relationship?

191
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,070
Sure, we're this week's hottest couple,
but then the world gets sick of it.

192
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,152
The shopping sprees, the strip clubs.
People turn against us, okay?

193
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,231
"How many Juicy sweat suits
does she need?"

194
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,234
"That goatee is so mid-'90s." Pretty soon,
the movie bombs and the wedding is off!

195
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,711
But I'm not gonna let that
happen to us, because, Cohen...

196
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,313
...what we have is special.

197
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,392
Summer...

198
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,237
...that's maybe just...

199
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,757
- Guess I'm not very good.
- Yeah.

200
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,514
Want a rematch?
Because I couldn't possibly get any worse.

201
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,752
No, I should probably
start on my homework.

202
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,549
Oh, yeah, me too.
I mean, my dad's probably waiting.

203
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,075
- Is this...? I don't know, are we...?
- Why...? Why is this weird?

204
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,834
- It shouldn't be.
- We used to hang out all the time and...

205
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,797
Make out?

206
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,311
- We could always fight about Luke.
- Or Oliver.

207
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,478
Sorry. I just...

208
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,434
Hey, Ryan.

209
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,992
Hey, Marissa.

210
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,755
I'm early. Sorry.
I'll go and come back later.

211
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,592
It's okay.
We weren't doing anything.

212
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,479
Yeah, I was just leaving.
He's got a lot of homework.

213
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,194
Good to see you, Theresa.

214
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,431
It's nice to see you too.

215
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,552
The ninja game?

216
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,836
You're dead now.

217
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,916
Considering he is your "Uncle" Shaun...

218
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,310
...don't you think it's weird
we have never met?

219
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,758
He's not really my uncle.

220
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,394
- And he pretty much works all the time.
- Doing what?

221
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,959
He's a consultant.

222
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,918
Could you please be a little more vague?

223
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,593
He knows people.

224
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,115
You did it.
That was more vague.

225
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,317
The guys at the permit office,
the union guys.

226
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,550
He's our liaison.

227
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,312
Well, I looked over the police report,
I put in a few calls...

228
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,157
...and I'm sure I'll hear something back
before we get together tonight.

229
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,515
- Thank you.
- Overexposure, Ryan...

230
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,638
...it's a major source of conflict
in new relationships.

231
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,837
"Summereth." "Sethummer."
You understand what I'm saying?

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,833
- No. No. That's normal.
- Ryan, your friend Theresa called.

233
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,436
- I'd like to meet Theresa.
- Yeah, she'd like to meet you guys.

234
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,273
- What's she doing here?
- Taking a semester off, making money.

235
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,750
Catering a tennis tournament.
Her mom got laid off.

236
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,480
So she's out here a while.
Does Marissa know? I'm curious.

237
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,916
They kind of bumped into each other.

238
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,992
Look at you, the friend guy.
Bringing friends together.

239
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,037
- I sense sarcasm.
- You're perceptive.

240
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,994
This mysterious <i>caliente</i> female from
your past just shows up out of nowhere...

241
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,914
...with all this time on her hands
and no one to spend it with but you.

242
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,516
- Marissa okay with this?
- She's fine. They're back to being friends.

243
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,352
So when were they ever friends?

244
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,232
You are so beautiful, you know that?

245
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,434
You're very sweet.

246
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,751
- I wish we could stay here forever.
- Why?

247
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,708
We got everything we need here.
We got our bed. We got our cable.

248
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,677
We got each other.

249
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,674
- This place is awesome.
- It's not awesome.

250
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,274
It's $ 79 a night.

251
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,236
I gotta motor.
I don't wanna be late for homeroom.

252
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,158
You have homeroom.

253
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,709
Right. Because you're in high school.

254
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,438
And you're only 18.

255
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,919
Kaitlin, are you okay?

256
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,159
You're in front of the house?

257
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,869
Chester's mom was supposed to pick you
up at Grandma's and take you to school.

258
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,156
Your diorama.

259
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,034
Yeah, I think it's
in the living room, honey.

260
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,510
Okay, just wait there with Grandma.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

261
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,199
Okay. See you soon.

262
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,750
- See you tonight?
- Oh, Luke.

263
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,593
Motels, homerooms, dioramas.

264
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,639
- This is not the stuff of great romance.
- But, Mrs...

265
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,678
Julie.

266
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,597
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,629
- No worries.
- Good.

268
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,033
Hey.

269
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,708
- You mind if...?
- No.

270
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,519
Thanks.

271
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,515
- So, sorry about...
- Sorry I was such a...

272
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,480
- I should've told you she was coming.
- You didn't have to.

273
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,200
But you could've.
I mean, now that we're friends, right?

274
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,830
- Right.
- So you and Theresa...?

275
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,073
- We're friends.
- And she's back in town for...?

276
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,800
Work. She's staying
till the end of the week.

277
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,469
- Where's she staying?
- The motel by the pier.

278
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,710
The Seashell? Sea Monkey?

279
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,549
- The Mermaid.
- Right.

280
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,951
- Next week we could have that rematch.
- Think you're up for it?

281
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,078
Hey, what I lack in nunchaku,
I make up for in saber.

282
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,993
So...

283
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,475
...did you talk to Summer yesterday?
- Yeah.

284
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,916
- Oh, yeah?
- We talked about school...

285
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,911
...and sports and the weather.

286
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,878
But if you're referring to the part
where she's ashamed of me, no.

287
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,598
Didn't get to that.

288
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,513
Were you gonna say something?
Something very wise and helpful, Anna?

289
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,151
- No.
- You got nothing? No advice at all for me?

290
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,754
- I feel like you did.
- Why do I do this?

291
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,195
Because you're so wise, Anna.
You can't not.

292
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,318
All right, fine.
Look, you have to take a stand, all right?

293
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,357
You can't let her get away with it.

294
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,596
Otherwise she has something
to be ashamed of...

295
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,115
...because then her boyfriend
is a coward.

296
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,148
I'm just going to help with the kissing
booth, you know, because I love to help.

297
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,035
Right, coward. Got it.

298
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,478
Hope you don't mind.
I let myself in through the back.

299
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,949
It's what you do.
Famous Uncle Shaun.

300
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,516
Here. Famous Grouse.

301
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,353
I haven't seen a bottle of this
since Bob Mitchum passed.

302
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,318
- You knew Robert Mitchum?
- Yeah. He and his wife Dorothy...

303
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,758
...they used to have a place over there
on Linda Isle.

304
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,239
That was their favorite booth.
Sunday dinners. Chicken parm.

305
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,109
I'm partial to the parm myself,
and a lover of blended Scotch.

306
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,876
And Caleb keeps saying
you have no redeeming qualities.

307
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,998
So I read the police report.
I just have a couple of questions.

308
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,277
This fellow who's pressing charges,
he's in the construction business.

309
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,079
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, he's a lumber supplier...

310
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,518
...one of the biggest in the country.
In fact, he was in town on a negotiation...

311
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,875
...with one of the Newport Group's
chief rivals.

312
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,957
- Imagine that.
- Yeah, I'm guessing...

313
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,313
...that in that room
that you accidentally stumbled into...

314
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,311
...were documents
containing information...

315
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,517
...that would be very valuable
to somebody like Caleb.

316
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,956
- You think?
- You expect me or the DA's office...

317
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,716
...to believe a bellyful of liquor or a wild
coincidence would put you in that room?

318
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,312
You were there for Caleb.

319
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,710
That's an interesting theory.

320
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,431
And one I, you know, hope you don't
explore too much, because...

321
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,718
What is it, "Sandy"? You know, Caleb
and I have been friends for many years.

322
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,713
And if I were to sit down with the DA...

323
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,236
...there's no telling
what we might talk about.

324
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,512
- So, what do you think?
- It's good.

325
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,591
- They call them Balboa Bars.
- It's just ice cream.

326
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,796
No such thing
as just ice cream in Newport.

327
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,748
Like, instead of car washes,
they have auto spas.

328
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,673
Dogs have daycare.
Fashion Island has valet parking.

329
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,558
It's a weird place.

330
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,995
Still, it's beautiful.

331
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,755
I can see why you wanna live here,
start over.

332
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,275
Is that why you came back here?
Start over?

333
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,320
No, I couldn't.

334
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,750
I've got my mom to think about.

335
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,673
My brother. And Eddie.

336
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,879
You guys are still...?

337
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,079
We're taking some time apart. You know,
to see if we really belong together.

338
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,150
- What about you and Marissa?
- Kind of the same thing, I guess.

339
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,551
We're trying to be friends,
but it hasn't exactly been easy.

340
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,678
- Actually, it's never really been...
- Like this.

341
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,359
- That's because I never really liked you.
- True. Makes things easier.

342
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,069
Do you need to stretch
so you won't pull a hammy?

343
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,312
- Or are you ready for your workout?
- I'm sorry, Summer.

344
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,109
I need to take a stand. This separation
of the public and private spheres...

345
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,999
...isn't working for me. I can't do it.
- But I told you how...

346
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,355
One day you might have
some MTV-driven radio hits...

347
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,476
...and then a moderately priced
clothing line.

348
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,031
I could get offered $20 million to portray
a blind superhero in a red leather unitard.

349
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,079
But until then, as long as we're
complete faceless nobodies...

350
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,912
...living in obscurity...

351
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,031
...I can't acknowledge you privately
if you won't acknowledge me publicly.

352
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,919
Let me know when you're ready
to come to the bargaining table.

353
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,911
Until then, just consider me on strike.

354
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,071
You'll cross your own picket line
in no time.

355
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,992
Fight the power.

356
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,000
- Eddie.
- Hey.

357
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,596
- Hey, man.
- How's it going, Ryan? Good to see you.

358
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,238
You look good.

359
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,072
You look good, man.

360
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,959
Yeah, I went up and visited
your brother last week.

361
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,918
It kills me he's still serving time.

362
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,596
- Sucks, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

363
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,593
It's been a while, man.
What are you doing here?

364
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,479
Well, actually...

365
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,433
...I'm looking for Theresa.

366
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,988
Theresa?

367
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,551
Yeah, you know, her mom said
she was working out here in Newport...

368
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,679
...and your brother said you were living
the life out here, you know, so I...

369
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,310
- I thought maybe you'd seen her.
- She didn't leave a note or something?

370
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,879
No.

371
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,553
Nothing.

372
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,679
Some thanks for the ring I got her, huh?

373
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,877
- Ring?
- Yeah, we're engaged.

374
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,108
Engaged?

375
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,555
Damn, Eddie, that's great, man.

376
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,512
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

377
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,512
So she...

378
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,114
I mean, she hasn't looked you up at all?

379
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,475
No, sorry.

380
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,193
- You're living the dream out here, huh?
- Yeah, you said it.

381
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,952
That's all right. You deserve it.

382
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,868
You know, putting up with Trey
for all those years.

383
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,070
All right.
I'm gonna get out of here.

384
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,434
But...

385
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,229
- Hey, if you see her, you know, just...
- Yeah.

386
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,430
I don't know, I just...

387
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,398
I can't believe she'd
run out on me like that.

388
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,434
Neither can I.

389
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,960
- Were you gonna tell me you're engaged?
- I'm not engaged.

390
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,476
- What the hell are you doing?
- He asked, I didn't say yes.

391
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,200
- So you took off. That'll fix everything?
- You did.

392
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,432
Sorry.

393
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,070
You're gonna have to face him
sooner or later.

394
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,277
- I just need time to think.
- Yeah, you need about five years.

395
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,795
- You're 17.
- What's gonna be different in five years?

396
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,110
Or have you forgotten
where you come from?

397
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,953
Not everybody has an infinity pool,
goes to private school...

398
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,395
...and drives a Range Rover.
- What are you saying?

399
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,314
Eddie has his own place, he's a foreman at
work and isn't a screwup like his friends.

400
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,119
- All good reasons to marry him.
- And he loves me.

401
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,234
- And you?
- I just need time.

402
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,148
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Nothing.

403
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,033
- Don't say you're not hungry.
- I didn't say I wasn't hungry.

404
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,549
I'm starving.
Why do you think I'm being a bitch?

405
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,838
What are you gonna do, eat out of
the vending machine? Come on.

406
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,752
Come on.
Come to my house with me.

407
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,676
You just need a ride.

408
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,596
Upstairs, alone. Now.

409
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,514
Upstairs alone? I'm afraid I'd have to
file a grievance with the union.

410
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,671
- I've had enough.
- I left you two hours ago.

411
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,798
Well, it feels like four.
I've been thinking about what you said...

412
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,350
...and I find it totally insensitive.
- I'm being insensitive? Really? How?

413
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,717
Can't you accept that I'm uncomfortable
with public displays of affection?

414
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,560
You're offering yourself for $ 10 a pop
at a kissing booth.

415
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,678
How much more publicly
can affection be displayed?

416
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,674
I know there's a strike,
but technically...

417
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,276
...you wouldn't be considered a scab...
- Summer, don't say "scab."

418
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,677
If you didn't have to do anything.

419
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,749
Well, your strike-busting techniques
are no good here.

420
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,912
Sorry, the rank and file
are holding strong.

421
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,359
Solidarity.

422
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,114
Cal.

423
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,756
- What a surprise.
- A welcome one, I hope.

424
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,878
Well, that depends.

425
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,349
You've brought flowers?

426
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,031
Thank you. They're beautiful.

427
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,395
- I missed you.
- I've missed you too.

428
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,269
Neither of us are love-struck adolescents
looking to be swept off our feet.

429
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,399
We're both adults. Our lives
are full of responsibilities, difficulties.

430
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,391
Well, isn't this romantic.

431
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,710
We should be able
to come to some arrangement...

432
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,838
...where we both get from a relationship
what we want.

433
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,915
Is this a booty call?

434
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,878
What's a booty call?

435
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,032
It's when you show up at night,
unannounced, no apologies...

436
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,714
...no compliments, no commitments...

437
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,156
...just some crappy mini-carns
from Ralphs...

438
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,515
...and a very mistaken idea
that I just might wanna...

439
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,519
Guess it was a booty call.

440
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,148
How much are you involved
with Uncle Shaun, day-to-day?

441
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,719
Not much.

442
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,996
He spends most of his time
out of the office...

443
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,276
...on site with the crews,
suppliers, inspectors.

444
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,716
You gotta be a hard-ass to be good
at that job. Lots of tough characters.

445
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,079
I'm sure Shaun can be persuasive
when he needs to be.

446
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,993
Convincing-argument persuasive,
or baseball-bat persuasive?

447
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,472
If you don't wanna help him, I understand.
I didn't think you'd do it in the first place.

448
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,952
Hey, dinner's ready.
Slaved over hot take-out containers.

449
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,076
- Ryan here?
- Hey.

450
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,197
- This is Theresa.
- Hi.

451
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,351
- Hello, friend.
- Nice to meet you.

452
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,272
I'm Kirsten. And this is...

453
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,238
Sandy. Hi.
I've heard so much about you.

454
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,834
It's nice to meet you all.
Can I help? It looks great.

455
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,596
Sure. The key is taking the food
out of the Styrofoam containers.

456
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,591
But her real specialty is ordering.

457
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,990
Is the silverware in the drawer or...?

458
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,596
What's going on? Don't say "nothing,"
because it's not nothing. It's something.

459
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,399
- She's engaged.
- Wow. You make quick work of the ladies.

460
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,160
- To this guy Eddie.
- Oh, she just told you?

461
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,392
No, he did, when he showed up
looking for her.

462
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,114
What's going on here?

463
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,636
- And don't say "nothing."
- Because it's not nothing. It's something.

464
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,995
What we have here
is our very own <i>telenovela</i>.

465
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,720
- <i>Telenovela</i>?
- Yeah. Spanish-language soap opera.

466
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,395
<i>Ni Ía Amada M Âa</i>.
I hope Isabela gets Victor.

467
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,959
I love his handlebar moustache.

468
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,032
- You do it.
- Give it to me.

469
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,553
<i>Previously on</i> The Valley<i>:</i>

470
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,432
Hey.

471
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,110
What are you doing home?
I thought you'd be over at Ryan's house.

472
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,238
He's kind of busy.
A friend from home.

473
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,551
- Theresa.
- And you're okay with that?

474
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,280
- Yeah. It's not a big deal.
- It is kind of a big deal.

475
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,635
- He's important to you.
- What's important to me...

476
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,554
...is that we not talk about this right now,
because I'm fine.

477
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,759
It's just high school.

478
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,512
Hey, that's supposed to be my line, okay?
You're supposed to say...

479
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,468
...I could never understand. And how Ryan
is the most important thing in the world...

480
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,279
...and without him...
- We're just friends.

481
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,399
- Or at least we're trying to be.
- Look, at the risk of embarrassing you...

482
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,357
...you and Ryan...

483
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,110
...never friends.
- So I've been told.

484
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,670
- But if we can't be friends, then...
- Let him know what you wanna be.

485
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,873
See? There's still room around here
for me to be the adult.

486
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,758
Okay?

487
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,589
So we're all dressed up
for my brother's 16th birthday.

488
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,719
Not this one. Don't you have anything
that doesn't involve me falling down?

489
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,314
Did Ryan fall down when he did musicals?
Tell us.

490
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,189
You did musicals?
I did a musical or two myself in college.

491
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,352
Someone stop him before he starts
singing "Greased Lightnin'."

492
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,112
Do it, Dad. Travolta's your bitch.

493
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,918
- Thank you, son.
- Go ahead.

494
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,469
We were at the Holiday Inn,
at the revolving restaurant...

495
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,632
...and Ryan has this thing about heights...
- I'll get it.

496
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,392
Excuse me.

497
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,550
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

498
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,154
- Is Ryan here?
- Yes, he is.

499
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,629
- I love revolving restaurants.
- Who doesn't?

500
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,030
Motion and digestion,
unbeatable combination.

501
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,792
Look who's here.

502
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,831
- Hey.
- Hey.

503
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,070
Does everybody know everybody?

504
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,629
- Yeah. Hi, Theresa.
- Hi, Marissa.

505
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,235
- You hungry?
- Actually, I'm starved. Is it okay?

506
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,231
- Sure.
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

507
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,914
Let me get you a plate.

508
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,673
So, what's everyone talking about?

509
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,118
Hey, man, phone for you.
It's Eddie.

510
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,511
Hey, man, I can't find him.
Do you want me to take a message?

511
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,637
Apparently not. He hung up.

512
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,112
So dinner last night,
entertaining for the rest of us...

513
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,550
...but for you, wow.
- What, last night?

514
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,553
The whole dinner-theater/<i>telenovela</i> thing
you performed.

515
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,359
- <i>Telenovela?</i>
- Yeah, Spanish-language sudser.

516
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,829
Telemundo, dude. Univision.

517
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,911
Victor, with the sexy
handlebar moustache.

518
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,311
So you still have the mindset
that you're the friend guy, huh?

519
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,040
Befriending any beautiful woman
who cares to dine with us?

520
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,397
- I'm working on it.
- Right. Well, if I may...

521
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,120
...speaking from
a recent personal experience...

522
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,514
...the triangle's not a friendly shape,
okay? It's pointy. It's got sharp edges.

523
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,636
- Triangles hurt people.
- There's no triangle.

524
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,950
Marissa and I aren't together.
Theresa's here for work.

525
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,509
Except Marissa still obviously
has feelings for you...

526
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,114
...and Theresa obviously
has feelings for you.

527
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,068
In fact, the only thing that's not obvious
is how Ryan Atwood feels.

528
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,795
- I don't know. It's complicated.
- It is complicated.

529
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,191
It's complicated by the fact that
there's an Eddie who still obviously...

530
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,955
...has feelings for Theresa. That would
actually make this romantic triangle...

531
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,396
...more of a romantic rhombus.
- So, what am I supposed to do?

532
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,233
That I don't know.
But I would do something soon...

533
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,436
...otherwise someone's gonna get hurt.

534
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,233
Judging from Eddie's phone voice,
it's probably gonna be you.

535
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,798
<i>What the hell do you expect, Sandy?</i>

536
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,989
Construction's a dirty business.
Bids accepted below cost.

537
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,674
Permits mysteriously approved
at the last second.

538
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,912
Guys like Shaun
are the lifeblood of the industry.

539
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,398
Well, that was a touching speech, Cal,
but still the answer's no.

540
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,273
Good luck.

541
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,672
You're opening a Pandora's box,
you know that? Shaun's old. He's tired.

542
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,838
If the DA starts asking questions,
he's got lots of answers.

543
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,231
If you build your empire on quicksand,
sooner or later it's gonna sink.

544
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,119
What about Kirsten?
She's complicit in all this too.

545
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,397
- She doesn't know anything about this.
- Because I didn't tell her.

546
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,597
I was trying to protect her.
But she's number two at Newport Group.

547
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,910
She signs Shaun's paychecks.

548
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,799
So like it or not,
we're in this mess together.

549
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,913
Hey.

550
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,718
Hi.

551
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,870
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

552
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,999
It's not like Cohen and I planned to
get together. It sort of just happened.

553
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,152
And if it makes you feel better,
I don't think it's gonna work out.

554
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,269
Well, that makes me feel great.

555
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,352
I just can't be like one of those
couples, you know...

556
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,353
...who hold hands in the hallway
and make out in between classes.

557
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,795
Let the whole world
know what's going on.

558
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,315
It's none of their business, you know?

559
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,232
You don't have to ignore him, Summer.

560
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,958
I don't ignore him.

561
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,395
Okay, maybe a little,
but only in public.

562
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,835
You spent so much time
trying to get his attention.

563
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,877
I mean, you dressed up
as Wonder Woman.

564
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,080
Well, Wonder Woman
is supposed to have an invisible jet...

565
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,240
...not an invisible boyfriend.

566
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,830
I mean, either you're really evil
or there's something else going on.

567
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,989
I just don't know why he likes me.

568
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,636
I mean, he's way smarter. And we have,
like, less than nothing in common.

569
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,031
And he's just gonna get bored with me,
because, pretty much, all boys do.

570
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,993
If everybody knows we're dating...

571
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,674
...they'll know when he breaks up
with me, which he will.

572
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,797
I mean, dumped by Seth Cohen?

573
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,315
It's real good for my reputation.

574
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,755
- Hello?
- <i>Luke.</i>

575
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,828
- Hey, Mrs...
- Do not say my name out loud.

576
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,275
Come to the motel.
Park across the street and walk.

577
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,954
I'll get the same room.
Knock twice so I know it's you.

578
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,189
<i>And, Luke...</i>

579
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,108
...this is a booty call.

580
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,030
It turns out you're not the only one
who's a coward.

581
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,277
- Oh, it's nice to see you also, yeah?
- Summer's scared too.

582
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,635
I know. She's scared to be seen
in public with me.

583
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,473
Come on, Cohen. She fought for you.
She was fearless.

584
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,877
Ruthless, in fact.
Now she's got you.

585
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,798
There's nothing scarier than that.

586
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,437
Nothing scarier than being with me,
or do you mean, like, anyone?

587
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,909
Look, once you get what you want...

588
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,991
...that's when you've got
something to lose.

589
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,117
She's afraid of losing you, Cohen.

590
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,952
Why? I'm not going anywhere.

591
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,878
Maybe you need to let her know that.

592
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,476
- Hi.
- Hey.

593
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,200
Can we talk?
I know it's weird, me being here...

594
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,194
...but I just really needed to know...
- Am I still in love with Ryan?

595
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,632
Because you still are.

596
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,712
I don't wanna be.

597
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,838
It would be a whole lot easier
if I wasn't.

598
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,550
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Hey.

599
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,790
It's a long drive just to come say hello.

600
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,875
Last night, when you asked me
about Theresa...

601
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,156
...I wasn't completely honest.

602
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,238
Carl.

603
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,559
- I'm gonna take a break, all right?
- Okay.

604
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,677
- So why lie?
- I'm sorry, man. I didn't...

605
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,551
- She staying with you?
- No. She's working, like her mom said.

606
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,591
Still, I...

607
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,115
I mean, I pop the question...

608
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,157
...and she runs away...

609
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,077
...to you.

610
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,637
Married?

611
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,636
- Wow.
- Yeah, that's the plan.

612
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,589
You must really love him a lot.

613
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,074
<i>Do you love her?</i>

614
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,394
- I don't know.
- Yeah, well, I do.

615
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,232
Okay? I do.

616
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,994
And I wanna take care of her.
Do you?

617
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,798
I mean, can you?

618
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,433
Look, I know this is tough. L...

619
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,274
I can't tell you what to do.

620
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,549
But if you wanted to,
you could talk to her.

621
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,676
You know, convince her to come home.

622
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,719
Otherwise, be ready to fight for her,
because I'm not just gonna walk away.

623
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,518
I can't.

624
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,075
You got a long ride home.

625
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,639
You got a lot to think about.

626
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,032
In the church where my mom goes,
there's a stained glass window...

627
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,952
...of Teresa of Avila.

628
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,995
Her heart's being pierced
by the arrow of an angel.

629
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,399
Her eyes are closed.

630
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,474
And even though it hurts her
to love that much...

631
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,358
...she has the most beautiful smile.

632
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,037
I remember my first communion.

633
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,350
I was wearing a white dress and gloves.

634
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,080
<i>And I looked up at that window</i>
<i>and I thought...</i>

635
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,959
<i>... someday someone</i>
<i>would pierce my heart...</i>

636
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,077
...and I would walk down the aisle
in a real white dress...

637
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,071
...and understand why she's smiling.

638
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,073
I know it sounds lame.

639
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,473
But I guess life's not really like that.

640
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,916
You can't get caught up in wishing
for something that's not gonna happen.

641
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,159
You gotta hold on to the next best thing.

642
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,630
I guess I should call Eddie.

643
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,953
Yeah.
I should get back to school.

644
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,428
So thanks.

645
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,320
I can see why Ryan likes it here.

646
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,478
Here you go. Full refund.
Thanks for coming. The show's over.

647
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,710
Thanks so much, though.
It was great having you.

648
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,348
- This kid bothering you, Summer?
- No, it's okay. Thanks.

649
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,033
- Thanks.
- You're making a scene.

650
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,077
- I need to talk to you.
- I'll IM you later.

651
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,792
Okay.

652
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,712
- Let's talk up here.
- Oh, my God. No.

653
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,156
- Summer, I know you're scared.
- Yeah, of you.

654
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,517
You kiss these other guys, but you won't
kiss me? Acknowledge me now...

655
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,875
...or lose me forever.
- You're dating this emo geek?

656
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,315
Yes, Brad, she's dating this emo geek.

657
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,473
Yeah, that's right. I'm a big dork
and I listen to emo. And I'm dating her.

658
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,474
- Why are you doing this?
- Because, Summer, I like you this much.

659
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,433
And if you don't feel
the same way about me, then...

660
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,599
Someone will have to give me
a hand down. It's high up here...

661
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,911
...and I could fall and that would be
embarrassing. More embarrassing.

662
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,598
I can't believe this.

663
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,116
It's all over but the big,
public make-out session.

664
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,153
That'll be 10 bucks, Cohen.

665
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,550
That's for a worthy cause.

666
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,035
Hey, Carl, can I talk to Eddie?

667
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,078
Yeah. Yeah, I'll hold on.

668
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,397
- Hi.
- Hey.

669
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,754
You packing?

670
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,599
Yeah.

671
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,589
I think I should probably go home.

672
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,354
Seems like the right thing to do, right?

673
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,635
You gotta do what's right for you.
You and Eddie.

674
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,360
I gotta figure out what's right for me...

675
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,839
...and Marissa.

676
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,118
Right.

677
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,673
So if it's the right thing to do,
why don't I want you to go?

678
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,870
Why don't I wanna go?

679
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,276
I can think of a reason.

680
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,272
<i>Hello?</i>

681
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,192
<i>Hello?</i>

682
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,272
<i>Theresa, are you there?</i>

683
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,392
<i>Theresa?</i>
