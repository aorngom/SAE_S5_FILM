1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,326
Are you sure they're
gonna have something that fits?

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:06,609
It's not just a boutique.
It's GD's bio-textiles field lab.

3
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:08,633
Everything from
self-fitting wedding dresses...

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,718
- To maternity clothes?
- It's a growth industry.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,945
So am I.
Nothing fits anymore.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,556
Two beautiful mommies.

7
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,975
- Invisi-parel, huh?
- How'd you guess?

8
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:20,061
You can beta test
our latest prototype.

9
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:21,771
Not me. Just her.

10
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:24,732
So I'm the guinea pig?

11
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,151
Second time around,
you get over the feeling fat thing.

12
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,614
I still can't believe
I'm doing this again.

13
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:31,514
Alone.

14
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,659
I'm sorry.
You're doing it alone too.

15
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:36,399
But by choice.

16
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:39,389
Duncan is many amazing things,
but the settling down type

17
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:40,964
is not one of them.

18
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:43,448
Sorry. I have to go.

19
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:45,473
You have fun.

20
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:50,495
Trust me.
You're gonna love it.

21
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:52,968
Allison called.

22
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:55,721
She's got a dispute
that she wants you to deal with at GD.

23
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,240
<i>Apparently, a couple of scientists
aren't seeing eye-to-eye.</i>

24
00:00:58,365 --> 00:00:59,743
There's a shocker.

25
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,368
Yeah. I'm on my way.

26
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:05,856
<i>Are you okay?</i>

27
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,735
Yeah, someone's just about to get
the mother of all parking tickets.

28
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,613
You gotta be kidding me.

29
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:30,829
Anyone?

30
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:33,542
Crappy driver?

31
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,987
Oh. Gee... sorry.

32
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:42,146
You know, with stores
selling sodas by the gallon,

33
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,854
there really should be more
rest stops along the highway.

34
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,898
Not really my call, but you can't
park your car in the middle of the road.

35
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:50,570
I didn't.
That would be absurd.

36
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:53,988
I guess I really had to go.

37
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,205
Yeah. I guess so.

38
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,334
Well, the universe does
things for strange reasons.

39
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,663
But my gut tells me explaining that
could be kind of a time suck, so...

40
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:06,208
Ma'am... you sure
all you had to drink was soda?

41
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:08,294
Are you sure
that you're really a cop?

42
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,894
Yes. I'm a Sheriff.

43
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,465
So please move your car
before I have to cite you.

44
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,048
Fine, but just for the record,
I didn't leave it there.

45
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:17,349
No, it probably
magically parked itself.

46
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:20,624
You know, stuff happens.
Most people just ignore it.

47
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:23,476
You don't, by any chance,
need directions out of town, do you?

48
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:25,978
I don't need anything.
Thank you very much.

49
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,938
- Have...
- Have a nice day.

50
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,800
Took you long enough, Carter.

51
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,148
There is someone
who is driving me crazy.

52
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:45,087
Let me guess... A blonde chick
in desperate need of a rest stop.

53
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,269
What?

54
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:48,083
No. Him.

55
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,085
You're standing
in the way of science.

56
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,629
In the way of an idiot.

57
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:53,464
Dr. Murray Drechmeyer.

58
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,337
He is a brilliant
theoretical physicist,

59
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:57,762
but lately, he has veered off track.

60
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:03,098
He seems to believe that he has
discovered a paranormal disturbance.

61
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,851
He has locked his partner
out of the lab

62
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,898
and suspended all progress
on their project

63
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:09,994
while he protects his discovery.

64
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,898
Please just get them back to work.

65
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:13,973
I need their research
for something urgent.

66
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,153
Dr. Drechmeyer.

67
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,197
How's it goin'?

68
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,491
Finally! A man with a gun.
Don't be afraid to use it!

69
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:24,453
There's plenty of time for that later.
This is more important.

70
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,454
This?

71
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:28,332
The TIRDs? Look at them!

72
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:32,465
I'll bite.

73
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,423
Thermal imaging reactive displacement.
I've never seen levels like this.

74
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:39,844
This could be the first documented case
of signals from the spirit world.

75
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,345
Or the end of our funding.{\
Take your pick.}

76
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,889
We can write our own ticket
once we prove the other side exists!

77
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,267
I am in the middle
of a magnetic field test.

78
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:48,727
Which could scare them all away
if you don't stop it.

79
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,895
Enough!

80
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,738
You're gonna have to let her back
into the lab.

81
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:56,470
And...

82
00:03:57,448 --> 00:03:59,594
You have to look for your ghosts
someplace else.

83
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,220
Something's happening, Sheriff.

84
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:03,907
If someone on the other side
is trying to communicate,

85
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:05,882
how can I just ignore them?

86
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:08,873
Jo, check it out.

87
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:12,787
Pregnant.

88
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,257
Not pregnant.

89
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:16,589
Pregnant...

90
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:18,924
Invisi-parel
sure can hide the goods.

91
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,221
So the baby's father
is Duncan, right?

92
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:26,849
Works for the WHO?

93
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:30,436
Saving the world,
one malaria-ridden tsetse fly at a time.

94
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,479
Does he know you're here?

95
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:36,452
And before you judge,
we were only together a couple months.

96
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,361
And I'm not sure
he's the baby-having type.

97
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,226
Now's your chance to find out.

98
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:51,665
May I help you?

99
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:55,071
Extra large diet, easy ice,
and you do have a bathroom?

100
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:56,226
Right thru there.

101
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,880
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

102
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,465
Hey, hon!

103
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:01,383
I really wish you wouldn't do that!

104
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:02,593
Say hi?

105
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:05,327
Not you. Him.

106
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:10,248
Just in time.

107
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:11,260
For what?

108
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:13,135
Spiritual event, right here.

109
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:15,158
My TIRD meter is going wild!

110
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,729
So's mine!
He's scaring people. Do something!

111
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:21,796
Murray, why don't you
take a seat for a second, okay?

112
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,361
Listen,

113
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:27,627
you gotta stop
with all these commotions, okay?

114
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:31,039
Okay, did anyone just see that?

115
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,627
- What's goin' on?
- My meter is spiking.

116
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,865
It's starting!

117
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:47,012
- What is this, an earthquake?
- It's the TIRDs. They're manifesting.

118
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:50,349
Everybody down!

119
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:54,311
You call this a spiritual event?

120
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:05,293
Look out!

121
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,468
Rough town.

122
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,778
I was right.

123
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,148
They're here.

124
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,856
Projet-SG (1.00)

125
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:42,255
Nothing in the kitchen
could have caused this?

126
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,296
Expensive bottles of spirits to fly
off the wall like heat-seeking missiles?

127
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:47,281
Spirits. That's what they were.

128
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,907
- Poltergeists.
- The movie?

129
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,129
Only real.

130
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:51,493
Not real, not helping.

131
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,565
You can't deny me now.
We had a visitation.

132
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,306
Even the Sheriff saw it happen.

133
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,669
Tess!

134
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:01,838
Hi, Al.

135
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:03,943
You guys know each other?

136
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,968
Sheriff Jack Carter, Tess Fontana.
Tess and I are old friends.

137
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,450
- Nice to meet you.
- Again.

138
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:17,436
- So how old are we talkin'?
- Don't go there.

139
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,104
We shared an apartment.

140
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,274
So what's this, then?
A girls' weekend, a baby shower?

141
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:24,568
We really should get going.

142
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:26,737
But you're coming back, all of you?
Here? Tonight?

143
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:29,194
Look, these readings are real.

144
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,284
Give me one chance to prove it.
I know I can make contact...

145
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,570
I'll do it tonight.

146
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:34,912
And if you don't?

147
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:38,248
You won't have the Drech-man
to kick around anymore.

148
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:45,947
You know, some people
attribute occurrences like this

149
00:07:46,072 --> 00:07:47,672
to the Casimir effect.

150
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,386
Physical forces arising
from a quantized field,

151
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,297
moving objects through pressure.

152
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,017
So that's the answer?
The Cashmere effect?

153
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,403
It's one possible answer.

154
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,693
You have to take into account
electricity and relativity,

155
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:03,946
not to mention the fact
that objects are primarily influenced

156
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,359
by a magnetic field.

157
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:07,653
Meaning ghosts are magnetic?

158
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,323
Or someone's using magnets
to make it seem like there's ghosts.

159
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,242
Right, but...
who would wanna do that?

160
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:18,580
You share a lab with Drechmeyer.

161
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,048
Theoretically,
is it possible to use magnetic energy...

162
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:23,907
I didn't do anything.
I wouldn't waste another volt on him.

163
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:27,089
It is a good idea to mess with him.
I wish I had thought of that before.

164
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,499
So you like him.

165
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:31,321
Not anymore.

166
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:33,676
But you and Murray Drechmeyer
were romantically involved.

167
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:36,946
We weren't romantically anything.
We were married for 12 years.

168
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:39,776
He was more interested
in his ghosts than he was me.

169
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,135
Since I left him, well...

170
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,506
Things have just gotten
out of control.

171
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:45,144
Have they?

172
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:48,535
Or is that a way to discredit him
to have your project all to yourself?

173
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,636
He is the one
who is discrediting me.

174
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,948
Sheriff, if I had wanted
to humiliate my ex-husband,

175
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,949
I would have done so
a long time ago.

176
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:56,727
I chose to move on.

177
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:58,696
I suggest you do the same.

178
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:05,596
He's not on your level.

179
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,756
Just give him a chance.
You'll like him once you know him.

180
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,466
I meant your clearance level.

181
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,104
Three PHDs, and he thinks
that I'm here for a baby shower?

182
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:17,181
Which we'll totally have
once I figure out what you do at them.

183
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,516
You are officially here
as a visiting member of the staff.

184
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:22,811
And how many people know
the unofficial reason?

185
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:24,521
Just four besides me.

186
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,982
Randolph, Wolfe, Johnson,
and Henry Deacon.

187
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:31,111
It's like the Rolling Stones
of astrophysics.

188
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,832
You think you can handle them?

189
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:34,057
Start me up.

190
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,906
You look incredible.

191
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,831
You're glowing.

192
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:45,441
Come on, no one really glows.

193
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,070
Okay, look, Duncan...

194
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,092
When I asked for my stuff,
I didn't mean hand delivery.

195
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,411
But I had to come and see you...
for an explanation.

196
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,711
You can't tell me
that two people who spend a week

197
00:10:00,836 --> 00:10:03,068
making love in a spray
at Victoria Falls...

198
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:06,021
Duncan, no, you're right.
It was great, but...

199
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,833
How well do we really
know each other?

200
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,860
You know, our hopes, our dreams,

201
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:15,266
our reactions to surprises?

202
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:19,493
Running off isn't exactly
a way to find out, now, is it?

203
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,261
No, I know. I just...

204
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,458
Maybe our timing was just off.

205
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,089
There's another guy.

206
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:35,384
Something like that, yeah.

207
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:39,805
I appreciate your honesty.

208
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:42,084
And...

209
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,393
I'll respect your wishes.

210
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,115
After I meet him.

211
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,533
I'm not going to a seance.

212
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:03,522
Then think of it
as a scientific investigation.

213
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:07,768
Sorry, my crystal ball's
in the shop.

214
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:09,673
All right. I'll go.

215
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:11,920
But see what you can find out
about Murray Drechmeyer.

216
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,756
Like is he crazy or reallycrazy?

217
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:18,593
Like what does he have to gain
by proving that Eureka's "haunted"?

218
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,140
Right.

219
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:22,889
Spirits...

220
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,601
We know you're out there.
We're all friends.

221
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,838
We all believe.

222
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:31,473
Join us.

223
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:33,358
Join the circle.

224
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,403
Show us you're here.

225
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:46,465
Sorry...

226
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:54,642
So that's a giant TIRD-grabber?

227
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,758
- What?
- Ghost whisperer.

228
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:07,309
Sometimes, thermal energy
is the final indicator.

229
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:11,206
Visitations are often preceded
by other signs.

230
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:14,312
They could be all around us.

231
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:24,618
Drechmeyer...

232
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:29,093
"Madame Drechmeyer."

233
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:33,377
"Madame Cornelia Drechmeyer,
the premiere medium of her day,

234
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:37,486
"has contacted more than
a thousand spirits on the other side."

235
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:53,785
Spirits, come,

236
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:56,739
cross over from the other side.

237
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:12,472
Sorry.

238
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,275
<i>Get over here now!</i>

239
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:19,965
Look out!

240
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:22,664
They came!

241
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,406
They heard me!

242
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,143
Come on.

243
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:33,937
The desk!

244
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,119
I told you they were here.

245
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:55,455
So if you invited them to Café Diem,
how'd they end up here?

246
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,753
I don't know. But you gotta admit...
Showed up when I called 'em.

247
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,380
At the wrong location.

248
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,446
In a totally different building.

249
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,061
So they zigged
when they should have zagged.

250
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:06,790
Look, think what you want, Sheriff,

251
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:09,264
but I proved myself tonight
just like I said I would.

252
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,558
The Drech-man is back in business.

253
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,086
The Drech-man?

254
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,352
There's gotta be a reasonable
explanation for this.

255
00:14:18,477 --> 00:14:20,577
Heat waves, St. Elmo's fire.

256
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:23,653
What if Drechmeyer
has a reasonable explanation?

257
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,821
Come on!

258
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,699
Murray's mother,
Madame Cornelia Drechmeyer,

259
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:30,285
has made a real name
for herself communicating with the dead.

260
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:31,628
What if...

261
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,663
What if it's genetic?

262
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,107
Let's back burner the whole
Addams Family thing for a second.

263
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:39,207
- What's that effect, the...
- Casimir effect.

264
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,074
What if that had
something to do with it?

265
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,380
Not without help...

266
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:45,555
The magnitude of apparently
what you guys saw here

267
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,326
would require some sort
of localized focusing device.

268
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:52,807
Like this one?

269
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,720
Or maybe these.

270
00:14:58,036 --> 00:14:59,856
We've been finding them
all over town.

271
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:02,061
They're energy displacement sensors.

272
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:04,945
They're part of my research.
They record disturbances in the barrier.

273
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:07,372
- Are you sure they didn't cause them?
- Absolutely.

274
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,766
You can't just install
quantum vibration sensors

275
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:11,785
outside of GD without permission.

276
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,913
You wouldn't have given it to me,
and this was too important.

277
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:18,667
Which part, the science,
or proving your mother wasn't a fraud?

278
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:20,811
What did you tell him?

279
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:24,180
Admit it, Murray. You're obsessed.
Do you know what it's like

280
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:27,642
when the other woman
is your husband's dead mother?

281
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,970
Okay, this has to stop.
I'm suspending you indefinitely.

282
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:31,746
Wait.

283
00:15:32,644 --> 00:15:35,397
These sensors came from our lab.
I designed them.

284
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:38,937
They're just receivers. They couldn't
have caused any of these disturbances.

285
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:40,605
Thank you, MB.

286
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,440
Hope now you'll start to believe me.

287
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,238
I've seen more activity in three days
than I have in three decades.

288
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:50,358
Look, something's out there,
Sheriff Carter.

289
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,457
If we don't help it cross over...

290
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:54,416
who knows what it'll do.

291
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,930
His mother was a drama queen too.

292
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,880
I think Murray
may be on to something.

293
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,125
Oh, great.
So now you believe in ghosts?

294
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,495
The disturbances didn't start
until three days ago.

295
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,686
Did something special
happen here three days ago?

296
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,259
We reopened Section Five.

297
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,197
Section Five?

298
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:26,610
I hate that section!

299
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,221
It can't be a coincidence

300
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:30,563
that Drechmeyer's vibe-finder
pinged off the charts

301
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:33,867
on the same day
that you took the lid off Pandora's box.

302
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:37,261
Allison! You gotta do something
before this gets worse.

303
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,138
Okay. Get in.

304
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:46,463
Now, you know that I can't talk to you
about things that happen down there.

305
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,200
But I can tell you
that there is a new project.

306
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,227
- Well, can you tell me what it is?
- I'm gonna do better than that.

307
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:57,515
I'm gonna take you
to the most knowledgeable source...

308
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:00,103
the new head of Section Five.

309
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,940
You remember Tess.

310
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:09,819
You're the new head of Section 5?

311
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,738
I got bored after I finished
planning the baby shower.

312
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:15,201
Carter needs some help
with an investigation.

313
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,231
There have been some disturbing events
around town that seem to coincide

314
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:20,453
with some of the labs
coming back on line down here.

315
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:22,327
Yeah, and disturbing
kind of sums it up.

316
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,575
Just cooperate within
the parameters of security.

317
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:28,705
Play nice.

318
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,908
Everything would have been fine
if he just hadn't shown up.

319
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:45,801
It wouldn't have been fine,
because you're still lying to him.

320
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:48,982
- You didn't tell him you're pregnant?
- Duncan is a nomad,

321
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,359
and I'm liking the idea
of settling down here with you guys.

322
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,739
- I can't do that to him.
- Gee, thanks.

323
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,075
No, I mean I can't tie him down.

324
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,371
Maybe you should
let him decide that.

325
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:03,623
Morning.

326
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:07,293
Weren't you wearing that yesterday?

327
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,546
- Yeah, look at that.
- Right.

328
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,708
You stayed at his place last night.

329
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:13,966
Right, so... where is he?

330
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,437
That's a really
good question, Duncan,

331
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:21,598
one that deserves an honest answer.

332
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:24,272
The truth is...

333
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,470
he's...

334
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:30,400
right here.
Doug, sweetie, hi!

335
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,830
Come say hi.

336
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:37,556
Duncan, this is Doug.
My boyfriend.

337
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,993
- You... what?
- Yeah. He hates labels.

338
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:42,287
Nice to meet you, Doug.

339
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:45,652
So how long have you two
been together?

340
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,027
Sometimes it feels
like forever, huh?

341
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:50,894
And other times
it feels like it's brand-new.

342
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,089
Right! Anyway,
now that you guys have met...

343
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,725
Doug, what do you do for work?

344
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:58,178
Artificial intelligence, primarily.
Although I dabble in biotech.

345
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:02,307
Really? Because I've been trying
to integrate biotechnological treatment

346
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,028
into my epidemiological work
in third world countries.

347
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:07,715
Yeah? Well, there are some
really promising applications

348
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,315
in viral infections,
skin regeneration... You name it.

349
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:14,319
Join us for breakfast.
Would you? Please?

350
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,530
I would love to pick your brain and get
to know the man who stole Lexi's heart.

351
00:19:19,204 --> 00:19:21,220
What a tangled web we weave.

352
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:25,412
There was a gentleman I had
with an abscess across his face...

353
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:29,346
Been a pretty
uneventful tour so far.

354
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,282
Well, my safety record
is impeccable.

355
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:34,255
You've been here for three hours. Do you
have any labs that are actually open?

356
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,633
There's a working lab
right behind me.

357
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,009
This one.

358
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:41,554
Don't bother. Johnson said
he'll be traveling for a few days.

359
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:44,390
Great, then he won't mind
if we look around.

360
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:55,838
So what happens in here?

361
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:58,738
APS... alternate propulsion systems.

362
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,661
Like rockets and whatnot.

363
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:04,561
Yeah. That would be the systems
we already have.

364
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,375
What else is there?

365
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,973
You hear that?

366
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:17,102
Do you hear...

367
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:21,949
- That tickles my teeth. Hear that?
- Field trip's over. Back on the bus.

368
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,233
Let's go.

369
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:31,311
Do you feel hot?

370
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:37,197
- Let's...
- Sure.

371
00:20:46,431 --> 00:20:48,730
- So you sure you didn't feel hot...
- Nothing!

372
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:56,664
At least someone's
not so uptight around here.

373
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,015
See you around, Sheriff.

374
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,233
Just so you know,
they've reopened Section Five,

375
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:15,499
and I think it might be related to the
disturbances that we've been having...

376
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:17,567
I checked. Everything is fine.

377
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:20,528
The disturbances don't have
anything to do with the signal.

378
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:21,762
Good.

379
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,489
But the signal is getting stronger.

380
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,295
Interesting.
Okay, how long...

381
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
Signal?

382
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:29,421
What signal?

383
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:33,750
Fargo, you know anything
about a signal?

384
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:36,048
Dr. Rogers, it's go green month.

385
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:37,860
We need to talk about...

386
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:41,685
- your lab's excess energy consumption.
- I was talking to you!

387
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,279
I'm detecting a high level
of spirit activity in here.

388
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,738
Dr. Drechmeyer...

389
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:50,391
That's a strong one.

390
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:51,434
It's me.

391
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,636
What spirit activity?

392
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:02,560
Ma'am...

393
00:22:04,568 --> 00:22:06,342
- Can anyone see me?
- I do.

394
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:11,287
No one sees me either.

395
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:19,202
Do that again!

396
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,630
Are we... dead?

397
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:34,133
- Was there a feeling, any sensation?
- I don't know. It happened real fast.

398
00:22:34,258 --> 00:22:35,769
Okay. I gotta try this.

399
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:40,400
Holy...

400
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:44,070
We can't physically interact
with anything in here.

401
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:46,739
Do you have any idea
what this means?

402
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,570
No! I don't!

403
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,894
The universe is revealing
one of its secrets to us.

404
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:53,267
You know how rare that is?

405
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:57,141
I mean, this could be right up there
with relativity, with Prometheus...

406
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,536
We could be dead.

407
00:22:58,973 --> 00:22:59,918
Touch me.

408
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,381
Oh, just come here.

409
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,235
You satisfied?

410
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:14,642
In what way?

411
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:17,942
If we can feel each other,
how can we be dead?

412
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:21,441
And why aren't there any other dead
people around here besides us, huh?

413
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:23,511
How do you know there aren't?

414
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:28,936
Calling all dead people!
Club meeting in the rotunda!

415
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:32,731
See?

416
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:41,186
If we're not ghosts, then...

417
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,694
Look, could it be the...

418
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:45,381
the Cashmere effect?

419
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:49,593
- Overpaying for a sweater, are we?
- Yeah, overpaying for a sweater.

420
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,916
Yeah, Casimir effect.
Yes, I know.

421
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,058
1948 theory out of Holland
that empty space is actually teeming

422
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,642
with fleeting particles
and electromagnetic fields.

423
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:59,858
And sometimes
in dangerous situations,

424
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:02,174
people use humor
to alleviate tension.

425
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,861
It's a communications skill.
That's my field, actually... one of 'em.

426
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,737
I'm actually kind of an expert
in a number of some things...

427
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:11,233
What skill are we gonna use
to find out where we are

428
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:13,159
if nobody can see or hear us?

429
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,453
I have no idea.

430
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:22,309
Well, we rode the elevator.

431
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:24,841
- With karaoke mail guy.
- Right.

432
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:29,285
I think bald spots are really sexy
on some guys, don't you?

433
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,141
You talk a lot.

434
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,590
- I told you, I'm a communicator.
- Fantastic.

435
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,340
- Tell me what you do in Section Five.
- Not my information to share.

436
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:47,644
And irrelevant
to the current pickle we're in.

437
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:50,494
Pickles are my field, and they usually
lead straight to some GD project.

438
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:54,006
See? Just by using the word "pickles,"
you momentarily relieved my tension,

439
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:56,966
allowing me to refocus
on solving our problem.

440
00:24:58,902 --> 00:25:01,216
We were still here
before we went in there, right?

441
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:03,373
The mail guy talking to us.
Remember?

442
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:04,963
So whatever happened...

443
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:07,713
Happened in there. Right.

444
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,269
He said that johnson was traveling.

445
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:15,471
- I was here. You were standing there.
- Oh, right. I walked over here.

446
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,390
We had our hot flash.

447
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,433
Right. Right, you tripped on...

448
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:23,938
This is in here with us.

449
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,186
And this...

450
00:25:26,328 --> 00:25:28,369
looks like a mini version of that.

451
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:31,430
All right, what else
is in here with us?

452
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:33,739
Tequila.
If fate were kind.

453
00:25:36,824 --> 00:25:38,174
How 'bout a body?

454
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:40,745
That wasn't here before.

455
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,621
What have you got?
Is he dead?

456
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,011
No. Not dead yet.

457
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,316
Not on vacation either.

458
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:52,508
It's HJ Johnson?

459
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,301
The traveler who runs this lab.

460
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,341
Okay, his heart rate is stable.

461
00:25:57,997 --> 00:25:59,223
He looks dehydrated.

462
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,393
- What are those burn marks on his skin?
- They're pretty superficial.

463
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:06,537
Well, whatever happened to him
really knocked him out.

464
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,861
What is that thing you tripped over?

465
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,925
It's gotta have something
to do with this, right?

466
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:16,865
Portable re-entry pad.

467
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:20,536
- For what, like a spaceship?
- Or for us.

468
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,677
- Could this have done that to him?
- Only if he didn't have it calibrated

469
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:28,336
- properly.
- Hold on...

470
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,945
- You know what happened to us?
- I have a theory.

471
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:35,855
- Well, who the hell am I gonna tell?
- Okay, fine. You ready?

472
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:37,595
The fifth dimension.

473
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,972
The actual fifth dimension?

474
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,146
Yeah. HJ's baby.

475
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:44,274
Interdimensional travel.

476
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:49,814
He must have figured out
how to cross over using his p-branes.

477
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:52,295
Well, that cleared it up.

478
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,815
The theoretical membrane barriers
between all dimensions

479
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,405
are called p-branes.

480
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,240
Seriously?

481
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:01,217
- Science can't have a sense of humor?
- Yeah. Fair enough.

482
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:02,926
It's all based on string theory.

483
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:06,311
Certain levels of subatomic vibration
can unweave the p-brane,

484
00:27:06,436 --> 00:27:08,167
allowing for
interdimensional travel.

485
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:10,988
Okay, so... the platform things...

486
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:13,725
well, looks like HJ
figured out how to cross over

487
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,992
but knew he couldn't physically interact
between dimensions once he got here,

488
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:19,637
so he built a portable version

489
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:21,555
as a way to get back.

490
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:23,242
That clearly didn't work.

491
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,241
Well, the p-brane's
kind of like a curtain.

492
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:28,138
If you don't pierce through it,
you're just gonna make it wiggle.

493
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:30,064
And maybe bump into us
on the other side.

494
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:33,366
Tess, we can be the spirits
that drechmeyer notices.

495
00:27:34,012 --> 00:27:35,403
You're smarter than you dress.

496
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:38,155
What?

497
00:27:38,544 --> 00:27:41,603
So you're gonna try to make contact
with Murray by talking?

498
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,435
It's as good a theory as any.

499
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,060
You sure you know
how this thing works?

500
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:50,042
Well, I'm hoping it's kinda like
Dance Dance Revolution.

501
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,619
I'm really good at that.

502
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:55,614
And if you're right,
as soon as I turn this thing on,

503
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:59,697
Dr. Spooky's machine should be able to
pick up the vibrations from the p-brane,

504
00:27:59,822 --> 00:28:01,678
and we might be able to communicate.

505
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:04,436
So for the last three days,
Murray's been communicating with HJ?

506
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:06,094
Whenever HJ tried to get back over,

507
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:09,250
it shook the p-brane hard enough
to set this guy's dials off.

508
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,983
- Let's see if we can do it again.
- What if you end up like HJ?

509
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,402
HJ had it dialed up to a heavy load.

510
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,177
I'm starting at lingerie.

511
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,157
Gentle cycle...

512
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,616
Forget it.

513
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:34,336
- Are your teeth tingling?
- Kind of.

514
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,061
Look at that.

515
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,503
One, two, three.

516
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,445
He heard us.

517
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:02,698
Not really.
But if it makes you feel better...

518
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:07,662
you gotta turn on the ghost whisperer
so that we can communicate.

519
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,950
I can feel you, mother.

520
00:29:26,154 --> 00:29:28,057
If you're here, give me a sign.

521
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:30,925
We're here!

522
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:33,134
She's alive.

523
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:34,407
She's alive!

524
00:29:37,353 --> 00:29:40,236
- Who's alive?
- My mother. On the other side.

525
00:29:40,532 --> 00:29:43,267
And I realize the 2000 wasn't nearly
as powerful a machine as I needed,

526
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:45,074
so I made some adjustments.

527
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:46,513
Are you crazy?

528
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:49,569
Do you have any idea how much power
this electromagnet carries?

529
00:29:49,694 --> 00:29:51,165
Enough to cross her over.

530
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:56,957
This boost could be the thing that
gets us back to the third dimension.

531
00:29:57,082 --> 00:29:58,082
Wait!

532
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:00,381
It could kill us all!

533
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:04,642
Sheriff, I don't know
how the two of you got in here,

534
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,429
but you don't know
what you're doing.

535
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,682
The p-brane is sensitive,
and I haven't perfected re-entry.

536
00:30:09,954 --> 00:30:11,895
It knocked me clean out
last time I tried it.

537
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,988
It's this idiot and his receptor
interfering with my oscillations.

538
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,355
- If he turns it on again...
- Mother...

539
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,066
Come to us.

540
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,074
Get off now!

541
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:43,173
No more chances.
Give me your badge

542
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,260
and turn your equipment and
all your research over to Dr. Curtis.

543
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:47,912
But it worked.

544
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:49,468
There was someone there.

545
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,661
Your device just fried
a multimillion-dollar electromagnet.

546
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:55,942
There is no one on the other side.

547
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:02,604
Except us.

548
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,045
Your idea of help was a ghostbuster?

549
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,785
A theoretical physicist
who veered off track...

550
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,991
Lord knows what kind of vibration
that charge set off.

551
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:17,482
A p-brane wave of that magnitude
could grow to dangerous proportions.

552
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:20,294
You should have thought of that
before you tested your platform.

553
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:22,419
You weren't ready for
a space jump yet.

554
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:25,382
I wasn't gonna wait for some lady
ham radio operator from SETI

555
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,134
to come and take all the credit.

556
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,731
Guys!

557
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:35,309
So you were saying
something about a space jump?

558
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:38,229
Between the third and fifth dimensions.
I made it in no problem.

559
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:40,661
Re-entry's proving
to be more difficult.

560
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:41,652
Atomic fire.

561
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,401
Like when the space shuttle
loses a couple of heat tiles.

562
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,424
Something like that.

563
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:49,406
We need to get back down to Section Five
so I can recalibrate this thing.

564
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,050
There's no physical interaction.

565
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:57,373
So we're stuck
until someone presses the button.

566
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:02,985
- So you're not in love with him?
- Are you kidding me?

567
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,673
When I first met him,
I knew in ten seconds that I loved him.

568
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,507
So what's the problem?

569
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,719
What if he doesn't love me?

570
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,365
The guy came all the way from Africa
to bring you a box of your junk.

571
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,686
I mean, if that's not love,
I don't know what is.

572
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:16,146
Okay, so what if he loves me,

573
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:18,740
but what if he doesn't love
pregnant me, you know?

574
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:22,926
This guy, he builds clinics.
He saves villages. He knows Bono.

575
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:25,693
I just... I don't want him
to feel trapped, you know?

576
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,368
There's only one way to find out.

577
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:29,748
Can I just send him
a birth announcement?

578
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:30,876
Watch out!

579
00:32:34,107 --> 00:32:35,578
That's no good.

580
00:32:36,437 --> 00:32:39,915
Things are getting worse around town.
I thought Murray's journals could help.

581
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:42,320
All these calculations are his?

582
00:32:42,445 --> 00:32:45,087
Yes. He never let me look at them.

583
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,418
I've never really paid attention.

584
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:50,759
- Your husband goes off the deep end...
- You try not to fall in with him.

585
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:54,182
Before he became
obsessed with his spirits,

586
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:57,372
we were conducting research
on vibratory p-brane manipulation.

587
00:32:57,497 --> 00:32:58,601
Dimensionality.

588
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:01,874
What if his crazy
ghost hunting was...

589
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:04,057
An actual scientific breakthrough?

590
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:08,460
P- branes, shaking between dimensions,
Carter's flying espresso machine?

591
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,046
- You know what, let's go.
- Where?

592
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:16,910
I know a person
who actually works with p-branes.

593
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:20,831
HJ, your oscillations seem steep.

594
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:23,792
If I wanted your opinion,
I would have asked for it.

595
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,160
Why do you have
such a problem with me?

596
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:29,214
The whole scientific community
has a problem with you.

597
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,425
Because I disproved Cook and Moore's
half-baked theory about fractals

598
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,054
not needing a Hausdorff dimension
greater than their topological one?

599
00:33:35,378 --> 00:33:37,343
Or because I told
a department head at Heidelberg

600
00:33:37,468 --> 00:33:40,225
- that he totally need a better toupee?
- I'm working here!

601
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:53,923
You really said that?

602
00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:56,317
You can't screw around
with Hausdorff...

603
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:57,890
About the toupee.

604
00:33:58,015 --> 00:34:01,692
Well, it looked like he was walking
around with a ferret on his head.

605
00:34:01,817 --> 00:34:04,203
As long as you're trying
to help, right?

606
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:06,877
And look, if he doesn't
go easy on that p-brane

607
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,643
the next time through, we're all gonna
light up like the JumboTron at Fenway.

608
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:14,696
- Red Sox fan?
- How do you think I learned statistics?

609
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:17,588
- That's the only math I ever passed.
- Only math regular people need.

610
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:20,015
I believe she just
insulted you, Sheriff.

611
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:21,637
That's okay.

612
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:25,306
Listen...

613
00:34:26,388 --> 00:34:29,698
- Are you sure about these oscillations?
- I'm sure!

614
00:34:29,823 --> 00:34:33,487
As long as my equipment's running,
I'll be in sync with the p-brane.

615
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:35,571
Once I've calibrate it correctly,

616
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,950
I shall pass right through
the dimensional curtain

617
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,763
and collect my Nobel prize.

618
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:41,495
This is Johnson's lab.

619
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,957
- He's traveling for a few days.
- Deacon... What is he doing here?

620
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:47,710
Traveling? Then why are
his instruments reading out?

621
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:49,378
Is that what I think it is?

622
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,700
- It's an EM force field generator.
- On steroids.

623
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:55,406
If this has been running
the whole time that HJ's been gone,

624
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:58,137
it could be what's been causing
the disruption of the p-brane all along.

625
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,702
Murray's technology
wasn't causing anything bad.

626
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:03,684
It was reading the vibration
from HJ's technology.

627
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,436
I think we found Carter's ghost.

628
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:08,445
- You are awesome!
- We have to shut it down.

629
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,691
But that electromagnet
is our only way out!

630
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,077
- That's not good!
- We have to go now!

631
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,451
You can't...
you haven't finished calibrating!

632
00:35:15,576 --> 00:35:17,804
Don't tell me
how to work my own device!

633
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:18,766
It's ready.

634
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:21,952
Besides, he shuts down my equipment,
and we won't get another chance.

635
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:25,914
- How long will it take?
- It'll take a while.

636
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,016
Not like there's
an on/off switch, thank God.

637
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,961
Mary-beth and I have to figure out
the exact vibratory coordinates.

638
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,958
- On it.
- HJ, let me help you do that.

639
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,945
If it were anyone else
but Deacon, we'd have more time.

640
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:41,180
- We must be doing something wrong!
- P-brane waves are getting stronger.

641
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,434
Tess, you can't!
You can't.

642
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:56,028
- <i>How does it look out there, Jo?</i>
- Get inside, people!

643
00:35:56,852 --> 00:35:58,155
I'd say it's pretty bad.

644
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,021
Henry's working on it.
Just try to keep people safe.

645
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:07,151
Tell Carter I've got...
everything under control.

646
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,569
Isn't he with you?

647
00:36:10,314 --> 00:36:13,736
I have to ask what's gonna happen to us
if they turn it off before we're back?

648
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:15,611
Do I even have to answer?

649
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,781
The way his body
skid across the floor...

650
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:21,245
- I guess I owe you an apology.
- What?

651
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:24,139
I guess you didn't park your car
in the middle of the road, huh?

652
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:28,432
The skid marks. I should have known.
No way you skidded your car sideways.

653
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:31,499
But the p-branes do move sideways.

654
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:34,107
What?

655
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,859
HJ's oscillations were too steep.

656
00:36:36,206 --> 00:36:38,821
- What does that mean?
- It means that HJ's aim was way off,

657
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,216
and you need to make sure
they don't turn that machine off,

658
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:44,076
because I know what to do now.
We have to recalibrate this thing.

659
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,320
We're getting closer. Just a few more
minutes and we'll shut this thing down.

660
00:36:47,445 --> 00:36:49,373
Hello, remote calibrator.

661
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:51,688
The GD chopper had an accident.

662
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:54,127
- What? I grounded all air traffic.
- It flew off the helipad.

663
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:57,088
Fargo, get over there
and man that terminal.

664
00:36:57,441 --> 00:36:59,182
- How you doin'?
- More time.

665
00:36:59,307 --> 00:37:01,260
Come on, Sheriff, do something.

666
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,241
Bad news about the p-brane wave.

667
00:37:04,366 --> 00:37:06,765
It's growing
and spreading across town.

668
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,111
Push the button.

669
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:09,977
We're not ready yet.
It's delicate.

670
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:12,942
That's it!

671
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:16,576
Can you do to this
what you did before in Drechmeyer's lab

672
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,360
- with the gentle cycle?
- Yeah, I think so, but why?

673
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,447
Well, because if Allison
knows we're in here,

674
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:23,991
she won't turn off the platform.

675
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:26,469
Yeah, but she can't
see or hear you, so...

676
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:27,661
She can feel me.

677
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:28,912
What?

678
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:32,291
Like the way we felt the heat and Murray
felt his mother. It's all energy, right?

679
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,709
- It all depends on how...
- On how you shake the p-brane.

680
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:41,466
All right, hop on.
I'll set the platform's power to 50%.

681
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,598
Henry, hurry.
It's getting hot in here.

682
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:51,226
- Yeah, hold on.
- You have to stop Henry.

683
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:56,732
Don't... turn... it off.

684
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,150
Try and hold her longer.

685
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:00,561
Tess and I are here.

686
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:04,265
Don't lose us!

687
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,575
Henry, Henry, stop.
Don't turn it off.

688
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,869
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just feeling really warm.

689
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,916
She felt me.

690
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:18,754
- I've got the vertical holding.
- Wait, wait, stop!

691
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,049
Carter and Tess... I sent them
down here hours ago.

692
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,715
- I don't understand.
- Me neither.

693
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,261
I just know that we can't turn
that thing off until we find them.

694
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,642
Way to go, Carter!
She believed you!

695
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:31,725
Guys, you have to see this.
It's a projection of the p-brane wave.

696
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,030
Now it's just in Eureka,
but if we don't calm it down...

697
00:38:34,155 --> 00:38:36,063
- Portland, seattle, LA.
- Not good.

698
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,031
Allison, the wave is growing!
We must act now.

699
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:50,702
Turn it off.

700
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,479
Crap.
You done with that thing yet?

701
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:57,834
As done as I'll ever be. But we're
only gonna get one shot at this.

702
00:38:58,273 --> 00:38:59,273
You ready?

703
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:06,142
All right, here we go.

704
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:12,336
Three... two... one!

705
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:24,348
What?

706
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,098
The wave is dissipating.

707
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:31,910
We've shut it down.

708
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,754
Carter, where have you been?

709
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:46,287
It's a long story.

710
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:47,964
<i>Is Tess with you?</i>

711
00:39:49,818 --> 00:39:51,361
Yeah, safe and sound.

712
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:52,764
But...

713
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,649
we're gonna need a ride.

714
00:39:57,903 --> 00:39:59,553
And the Nobel prize.

715
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:02,453
Soon as I work on my aim.

716
00:40:10,136 --> 00:40:12,283
Promise me
you'll send photos from Belize.

717
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:13,342
Absolutely.

718
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:15,579
You know what?
This is getting too weird.

719
00:40:16,324 --> 00:40:17,592
He's so cool.

720
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:19,541
He is.

721
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:24,004
So I guess this is it.

722
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,630
I guess so.

723
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,134
Well, I wish you and Douglas
all the best.

724
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:30,634
Thanks, Duncan!

725
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:34,206
For what it's worth...

726
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:35,932
you were the one.

727
00:40:42,015 --> 00:40:43,023
I lied.

728
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:44,945
'Scuse me?

729
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,867
I am a big lying liar,

730
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:49,321
and you're perfect,
and I don't deserve you.

731
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:53,494
Ready to tell me
what's really going on now?

732
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,976
Douglas isn't really my boyfriend.

733
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:57,853
I couldn't tell you the truth,

734
00:40:57,978 --> 00:41:00,874
which was that I missed you
every single day.

735
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:02,825
That's a relief...

736
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:04,961
Because I think he's gay.

737
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,966
I should have told you this
a long time ago,

738
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:12,064
but I was too afraid
that you'd freak out,

739
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:14,888
and the truth is is that I'm the one
who's been freaking out.

740
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:18,058
I figured... you'd come around
if I was just patient enough.

741
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:27,487
So you're...

742
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:30,556
Twins.

743
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:32,777
So what do you think?

744
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:37,452
I think I'm gonna have
to think about this.

745
00:41:56,618 --> 00:41:57,374
Busy?

746
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:00,485
Just...

747
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,724
clearing Drechmeyer and Mary-Beth to
take over Johnson's lab in Section Five.

748
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,232
They're working together now.

749
00:42:10,753 --> 00:42:11,945
Long day, huh?

750
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,574
But at least
I spent it in one dimension.

751
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:17,910
You okay?

752
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,288
Yeah, I mean, I thought I was dead, and
I couldn't communicate with anyone...

753
00:42:21,593 --> 00:42:22,741
except you.

754
00:42:25,895 --> 00:42:27,371
Carter, is there something wrong?

755
00:42:27,496 --> 00:42:30,130
You and Henry
are working on something...

756
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,080
A signal?

757
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:35,385
And then you invite
your friend from SETI...

758
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,413
The place
where they communicate with...

759
00:42:39,783 --> 00:42:40,599
out there.

760
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:45,563
And you put her in charge
of a secret project in Section Five.

761
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,369
You know that I can't
talk to you about this.

762
00:42:48,494 --> 00:42:50,868
Well, Drechmeyer was right
about one thing.

763
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:52,366
Something's coming.

764
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:55,116
That's the signal...

765
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:56,740
isn't it?

766
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,077
I can't.

767
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,176
You know where to find me.
