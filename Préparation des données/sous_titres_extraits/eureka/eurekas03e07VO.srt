1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,547
What he's trying to tell you
is that... I'm pregnant.

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:06,303
I have a new puzzle for you to solve.

3
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:08,731
This complex is massive.

4
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,555
- Prewar. What, late 30's?
- I believe.

5
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:12,897
It's before Eureka was built.
What's down there?

6
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:20,273
Ever since you got to this town,
you've been looking for something.

7
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:22,566
Tell me what's going on.

8
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:23,893
No.

9
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:31,328
- I have to what?
- Oversee the mayoral election.

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,455
This is the official polling place.
It's not a big deal, Carter.

11
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:37,791
- Well, now why can't Jo do it?
- Because Jo's not your lackey.

12
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:40,010
Well, the town charter says
that voting security

13
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:42,754
falls on the highest ranking
law enforcement officer.

14
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:44,881
That would be you.

15
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,703
Unless you promote me
or become otherwise incapacitated.

16
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:50,173
The Mayor's seat has been open
for over a year.

17
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:53,222
The town needs a voice.
This is a very important service card.

18
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:54,682
How important can it be?

19
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:58,144
I mean, my daughter's backing
her 17-year-old boyfriend for the job.

20
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:01,268
Eureka doesn't discriminate.
Some of our smartest citizens are teens.

21
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:03,344
So instead of working,
I have to sit here

22
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,194
and count ballots
for some doogie Mayor?

23
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,405
No, actually, your sister
volunteered for that job.

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,392
It's a bad idea.

25
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:12,612
Lex becomes really obsessed
with politics.

26
00:01:12,732 --> 00:01:14,660
And her mood swings
are already out of hand.

27
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:17,766
Actually, she's really into it.
And you should be more sensitive.

28
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:21,014
- Your sister's pregnant.
- I'm Mr. Sensitive.

29
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:22,134
Like...

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,329
What... Paper ballots?

31
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,842
Digital voting machines
are way too easy to tamper with.

32
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:32,949
And campaigns get really competitive
around here.

33
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,673
Okay. I'll do it.
I'm... I'm...

34
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:39,220
- Thank you.
- Mr. Sensitive though.

35
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:44,299
Oh, my goodness.
What a beautiful baby.

36
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:46,996
Love that shirt.
There we go.

37
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:50,168
More Vinspresso?
Remember, vote Vincent.

38
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:53,375
Great. They love you!

39
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:56,568
I can't believe I let you talk me
into this. I hate politics.

40
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:59,046
We're the glue that holds
this town together, Vincent.

41
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,744
It's time we had a voice.

42
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:01,666
Smile.

43
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:04,266
- That's great, thanks.
- All right.

44
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:06,351
Now back to kissin' babies.

45
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:16,487
A vote for Lucas is a vote
for youthful innovation.

46
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:18,805
Oh, here's his ten point plan.

47
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,855
Kylie, can you help me pass out
some more buttons, please?

48
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,050
Then can we work on our lab project?

49
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,649
What's more important, Kylie,
homework or changing the world?

50
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,113
I don't know, Zoe.

51
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:34,736
- I've never been much of a leader.
- Which is why you have me.

52
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:37,673
That baby face of yours promises
idealism and hope

53
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:41,362
for all the minors of the town.
And I am going to help you deliver it.

54
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:43,458
- You mean manipulate it.
- Tomay-to. Tomah-to.

55
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:45,736
Sheriff Carter.

56
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,926
Halo Herrera.

57
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:50,715
Nephrologist, concerned citizen,
and future mayor of Eureka.

58
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:53,136
Well, you don't see
that combo platter everyday.

59
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,011
I'd like to talk 
about your endorsement.

60
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,649
I'm getting coffee.

61
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:58,765
- Could...
- Not your lackey.

62
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:00,857
Well, I...

63
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:02,673
Mr. Herrera is it?

64
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,514
I would love to endorse somebody, but...

65
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:06,426
But he's already promised
his endorsement...

66
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,730
- To my candidate, right, Sheriff?
- Actually...

67
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:11,568
Eureka needs a mayor who understands
how a company town works.

68
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:14,781
Why? So your boss can have some Global
Dynamics puppet to sell out the town?

69
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:16,901
How many people
is Thorne gonna fire?

70
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:20,911
So Vincent is the best candidate,
he's all about nurturing the community.

71
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:23,731
Guys! I just want my coffee.

72
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:27,768
Vincent, get Sheriff Carter
a Vinspresso on the house.

73
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,660
It's already on the house
and bribery is a crime.

74
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:33,421
Yeah.

75
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:37,512
Nice try, Fargo.

76
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:40,640
Do we amuse you, Herrera?

77
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:42,934
Watch and learn, kids.

78
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:45,343
Folks, would everybody
follow me outside?

79
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:47,730
I have something
that will entertain and amaze you.

80
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,236
Okay. I'm done.

81
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:02,547
Now can we talk about our project?

82
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,324
I've got some damage control to do.

83
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,417
- Why don't you just get it started?
- But we're supposed to work together.

84
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:09,604
We will after you've shown me
what you've got.

85
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:12,105
- So you're letting me take lead?
- That's right.

86
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:13,921
Now get to work, partner.

87
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:22,055
Leave professional politics
to the professionals.

88
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:25,300
- Told you it gets competitive.
- That's just wrong.

89
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:28,737
- Big news, guys.
- Yeah, what's up?

90
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:31,024
Those ancient security cameras
we saw in the bunker,

91
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:35,115
I pulled the negatives before Thorne
locked the place up again.

92
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:36,674
It's 35 millimeter.

93
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:39,782
We just have to find someone
old enough to develop it.

94
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,791
What?

95
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,091
The latest next gen technology
Zane's been developing for our sponsor.

96
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:01,179
Overengineered to keep you cool
in the hottest situations.

97
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:05,266
It's amazing what the greatest minds
and a big old corporate check can buy.

98
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:08,350
Too bad we can't buy
the next mayoral election.

99
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:10,588
Just kidding, Allison.

100
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:15,277
I would, however,
like you to endorse Dr. Herrera.

101
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,293
Well, won't that be seen
as Global Dynamics taking sides?

102
00:05:18,413 --> 00:05:21,793
Maybe. But on the other hand,
having someone to smooth

103
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:25,861
ruffled feathers during the next round
of cutbacks isn't a bad idea.

104
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:28,176
Well, I prefer to make up
my own mind.

105
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:30,625
You should also think
about what's best for Global.

106
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,844
We need a personal relationship
with the town.

107
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:35,128
One that shows
that we're all on the same team.

108
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:37,422
Are you and I on the same team, Eva?

109
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:41,219
Of course. I'd like to think
we're also friends.

110
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,760
Good.

111
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:46,432
So why don't you tell me
what's in the bunker under Tesla.

112
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:54,174
We found bariogenic radiation.

113
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,264
Zoe and her friends are very lucky
that they weren't infected.

114
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,303
That's why I'm ordering

115
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:04,091
a thermal cleaning
of the entire facility.

116
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,877
You realize you'll destroy
any organic material that's left inside.

117
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:09,731
Our first obligation is to the town.
Excuse me.

118
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:11,560
Make sure you vote.

119
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:18,964
This is Allison Blake.
I need some records from the archive.

120
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:22,593
What a time suck this is.

121
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:24,493
How did we live before digital?

122
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:26,905
I never knew you had
an artistic side, Carter.

123
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:29,049
I'm a man of many facets.

124
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,676
Check out the date stamp.
1939.

125
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:34,359
I thought Eureka wasn't
founded till 1950.

126
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,859
Well, it wasn't.
What were they doin' down there?

127
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,048
Well, whatever it was,
they tried to bury it for good.

128
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:43,823
Look who we have here.

129
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,235
- SARAH, lights.
- <i>Certainly, Sheriff.</i>

130
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:48,770
That was yesterday?

131
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,610
Thorne's been lookin' for somethin'
ever since she came to Eureka.

132
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,044
How much you wanna bet
it's in this room?

133
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:59,244
So what is she up to?

134
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:04,234
That's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.
The debate's about to start.

135
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:07,167
- You prepare your opening remarks?
- What opening remarks?

136
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,849
<i>Hello. Hello.
Is this on?</i>

137
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,728
<i>Hi, everyone.
Welcome to debate night.</i>

138
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:19,613
- I'm Sheriff Carter and I'll be...
- Cut to the chase!

139
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,485
We want issues, not filler!

140
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:25,364
Thank you, Lexi, for your wildly
inappropriate enthusiasm.

141
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:30,119
So without further ado,
I give you your candidates.

142
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,677
And if elected,
I'll bring the same principles

143
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:37,315
to the mayor's office
as I do to Café Diem.

144
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:40,588
In short, you want it, I got it!

145
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:44,509
I promise to bring a voice
to the pre-teen prodigy

146
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,387
that the establishment too often sees
as just another pretty brain.

147
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:52,619
Times are changing
and Eureka must change with it.

148
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,077
I will protect the tenets
on which this town was founded

149
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:58,163
and help usher in a new day
for Eureka.

150
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,615
It's a new day all right.

151
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:24,171
Season 3 Episode 7
Here Come the Suns (v 1.00)

152
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,366
Team Projet-SG.

153
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:30,887
http://projet-sg.net

154
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:33,558
Just another days in Eureka.

155
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,507
Well, it's a mini sun.

156
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:41,148
Really?

157
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,157
Took you all night
to come up with that?

158
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:47,099
No. It took us all night to rule out
any GD experiments as the cause.

159
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:50,324
- So now we have two suns.
- Just like Tatooine.

160
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,785
- Tatu-what?
- Geek speak.

161
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:56,454
The good news is it's stable holding
its position at about 1,000 feet.

162
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:58,136
We're not lighting the entire state.

163
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:01,353
The last thing we need is a spotlight
on the town the whole world can see.

164
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,403
Well, agree.
But it's 6:00 AM.

165
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:05,755
And 90 degrees.
How do we turn it off?

166
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:09,093
I'm not sure yet. It has to be
some kind of fusion reaction.

167
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:12,117
- Sounds dangerous.
- No, not necessarily.

168
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:14,557
Based on its containment,
I'd say it's deliberate.

169
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,309
Who'd want to make
a second sun on purpose?

170
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:20,062
Maybe the guy who was trying
to make a big bang at the debates.

171
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:21,981
Oh, cloud guy.
Herrera.

172
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,900
Eva wanted me to endorse him.

173
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:27,830
- Such a hidden agenda.
- What do you mean?

174
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:30,589
Zane found some security photos
of her sneaking around the facility.

175
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,783
- What's down there anyway?
- Well, nothing for long.

176
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:34,771
She ordered a thermal cleaning.

177
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,797
Can we stop it
till we get inside?

178
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,373
No, she's forbidden access.
The whole place is classified.

179
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:42,035
Something's goin' on.

180
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:44,253
You go talk to Herrera.
I'll look into it.

181
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,336
Yes, Allison Blake.

182
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:51,871
She asked for me?

183
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:54,513
Okay. I'm on my way.

184
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:03,345
- Hot enough for you?
- Yeah.

185
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,119
What's with the umbrellas?

186
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:08,437
He likes to be prepared?

187
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,907
Did that just come from inside?

188
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:19,986
That would be yes.

189
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:33,635
You changed your mind
about that endorsement?

190
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:35,763
Not really.
What is this?

191
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,542
This is the end to drought,

192
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,977
which we may be needing
sooner than later.

193
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:42,979
Welcome to my cloud farm.

194
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,618
Cloud farm?

195
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:49,602
Yeah, that's...
That's what he said.

196
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:53,071
I'm taking Cloud City to a whole
new level with nanotech hydration.

197
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,992
Cumulus, stratus, cirrus,
I can create 'em all.

198
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,909
Like you did with the cloud gag
yesterday.

199
00:10:59,029 --> 00:10:59,852
Nice, huh?

200
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:03,791
I found a way to hydrogenically infuse
the atmosphere so I can sculpt clouds.

201
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:06,613
The commercial applications
are limitless.

202
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:09,663
Well, I'm more concerned
about your sun stunt.

203
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:10,715
Sun? No, no.

204
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:13,801
I'm a cloud guy. Not that I don't
mind the bump in the polling numbers.

205
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:15,351
People love a spectacle.

206
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,847
Yeah, but you have to admit
the timing was suspicious.

207
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:20,095
Have anyone from Global
come and review my record.

208
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:23,840
My life is an open book, Sheriff.
I'm beholden to my constituents.

209
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:30,507
Gotta admit, it's a hell of a show.

210
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:40,405
Zane.
Just the man I'm lookin' for.

211
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:43,622
Save your breath, Fargo.
I already know who I'm voting for.

212
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm offended. You think I'm only here
to get your vote?

213
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,033
- You're not?
- No.

214
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:51,549
I also want a favor.
It is roasting out there.

215
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,645
A candidate has to project
cool confidence

216
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:55,479
under the most extreme conditions.

217
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:59,260
I hear you're beta testing something
that can help with staying cool.

218
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,142
- Yeah, I might be.
- Give me enough

219
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:05,310
to get through the election and if...
when Vincent wins,

220
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,355
I'll name a park bench after you.

221
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:09,690
Tempting, but no.
I don't do politics.

222
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,108
But good luck with that.

223
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:15,196
Based on these sun scans, I'd say your
competition's definitely heating up.

224
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:25,853
I was testing the voting machines

225
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:28,025
and I got dizzy.

226
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,378
I know you're not an OB.

227
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:34,475
Not really a fan
of western medicine.

228
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:37,676
- But I trust you.
- Well, I'm flattered.

229
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,787
I'm sure you have much bigger
issues to deal with.

230
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,969
Yes, and I have people
to deal with them.

231
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:45,521
So let's put your mind at ease.

232
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:49,948
So Carter says you've always
been interested in politics.

233
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:51,690
He said I'm obsessed, didn't he?

234
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,010
No.

235
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,236
Jack thinks the system is broken.

236
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,447
But I think it's up to us
to make the system work.

237
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:03,953
Well, this little guy's system
is working perfectly.

238
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:05,453
Here. Want to take a look?

239
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:12,378
It's amazing.

240
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:21,121
- What, is something wrong?
- I think I figured out

241
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:23,013
why your hormones are so
out of whack.

242
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:25,015
You're getting a double dose.

243
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:28,269
Lexi, you're having twins.
Both boys.

244
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,628
Two sons?

245
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,507
Two suns.
Why didn't I think of that?

246
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:38,409
- Because it's crazy.
- It's brilliant.

247
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:40,695
Lucas, I don't think you appreciate
what's at stake here.

248
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:42,898
I mean, the mayor's office
oversees City hall.

249
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,534
- So?
- So...

250
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,329
That includes the Sheriff's department.
You could be my dad's boss.

251
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,584
- And I thought he hated me now.
- It's time to step up our game.

252
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:57,214
When the world hands you suns,
make sunscreen.

253
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,842
Iced mocha, folks.

254
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:02,803
Stays cool as Vincent will be
when he takes the oath of office.

255
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,470
Suits? It's over
100 degrees out here.

256
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:08,309
Some candidates can handle the heat
better than others.

257
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:09,725
Nice gimmick.

258
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:11,851
We're just helping the voters
stay refreshed

259
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:14,105
so they can make a cogent decision
at the polling booth.

260
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:16,357
We're just trying to protect voters
from harmful UV rays

261
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,235
so they won't be blinded
by indecision.

262
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,844
- Iced mocha! Get it while it's cold.
- Sunscreen, people.

263
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,895
Vote lucas and say no
to premature aging.

264
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:28,871
Zoe, I've had a small issue
with our class project.

265
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:31,456
Bigger priorities at the moment, Kylie.
Here, grab a box.

266
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:34,919
No. I think this is something
you're really gonna want to see.

267
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,641
This better be good.

268
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,103
Okay, Fargo,
what's the big emergency?

269
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,537
The corruption
of the democratic process.

270
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:51,719
Everyone knows Herrera's
in Thorne's pocket.

271
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,674
And now she's harassing
my candidate. Look.

272
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,775
- What are you talking about?
- It's my wall of fame.

273
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:58,978
Thorne took it.

274
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,277
She redacted all the photos
of Eureka's founders.

275
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:02,922
She doesn't want the voters to see

276
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:05,199
how connected Vincent is
to this town's history.

277
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,282
- Why would she do that?
- Why?

278
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:13,968
Herrera checked out.

279
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:17,853
There's nothing in his background having
to do with solar energy or fusion power.

280
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:20,515
Great. So we got two suns
and no suspect.

281
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,051
And now apparently
no air conditioning.

282
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,228
Get anything off Herrera?

283
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:29,164
Other than a creepy politician vibe, no.
No, nothing.

284
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:31,891
- What did you find?
- Well, I ran some scans.

285
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:34,958
The sun has all the properties
of a main sequence dwarf star.

286
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:36,814
The big question
is its energy source.

287
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,315
Well, I might be able
to shed some light on that.

288
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,015
I ordered copies of all records

289
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:43,153
having to do with the hidden facility
under Tesla.

290
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:47,101
Now, of course, Eva's either
had them redacted or they don't exist.

291
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:50,286
But she forgot one thing.
Accounting.

292
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:53,497
Oh, somebody messed up
their lunch receipt.

293
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,291
The DOD keeps track
of every penny that they spent.

294
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:59,336
So I thought I'd see
where they were spending in 1939.

295
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:02,229
Check out the stuff
they were ordering.

296
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:04,854
Deuterium. Tritium.
These are heavy hydrogen atoms.

297
00:16:04,974 --> 00:16:07,789
Yeah, and the essential elements
in building fusion bombs.

298
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:11,098
So Thorne dug up
an old bomb testing facility?

299
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:15,728
We gotta get into that room before
Thorne does her thermal cleaning thing.

300
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,062
To do what exactly?

301
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:19,815
To figure out whether something
down there is causing what's up here.

302
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,040
Hurry up.
It's over here.

303
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,467
Kylie, it's a billion degrees out.
I don't have time to play house.

304
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:31,922
Excuse me.
I'm nine and I'm a junior.

305
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,579
I don't play house.

306
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:38,250
Then what are we doing here?

307
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:39,602
Take a look.

308
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,971
Kylie, can you remind me
what our assignment was?

309
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,968
Build a working model
of the solar system.

310
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:51,597
Took that a bit literally, did you?

311
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,807
How'd you get all the planets
to orbit like that?

312
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,389
They are not the problem.

313
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:02,650
The sun's a little off.

314
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:07,197
We are so getting an "A".

315
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,812
One small issue.

316
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:11,825
I can't make it stop.

317
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:20,959
So we're not getting an "A"?

318
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,831
Yeah, not so much.

319
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:27,234
You know what, a controlled fusion
reaction like this takes real talent.

320
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:29,181
Well, it wasn't even that hard.

321
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:31,348
Take a gravitron field generator,

322
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,139
surround it in a little reactor plasma,
heat and serve.

323
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,168
Served up kind of a big helping,
don't you think?

324
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:40,270
Well, we're a little off
on the plasma density.

325
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:43,680
We? Oh no, no, no.
See, I didn't do this.

326
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,922
And I'm gonna need you
to resign from the campaign.

327
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,676
We can't afford the scandal.

328
00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:49,427
Thanks for the support, partner.

329
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:51,692
Henry, I got a town
full of cranky people

330
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:53,466
who need some sleep.
You got any ideas?

331
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:55,535
Yeah, make it do
what it's supposed to do.

332
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:58,486
It should've started
to dissipate by now.

333
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:01,125
Well, it's... It's getting
some fuel from somewhere.

334
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:03,235
Chances are it'll burn itself out.

335
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:06,924
But in the meantime, I'm gonna go back
to my garage and research just how fast.

336
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,633
- Thanks. Let me know what you found.
- Can I come? I want to help.

337
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,489
I think you helped
enough already today, don't you?

338
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:15,292
I tell you what, you can take
atmospheric readings, okay?

339
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:17,821
Great.

340
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:20,855
Great.

341
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:28,376
So what convinced you?

342
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:31,030
Oh, Eva had all the old photos
removed from Café Diem.

343
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,673
Add that to the mass redaction
of old GD records...

344
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,118
And making Jo shut down
the Eureka museum.

345
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,987
And having me and Henry
dig up this place.

346
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:41,498
They're all windows
into Eureka's past.

347
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,333
Windows Thorne seems to want shut.

348
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:44,793
Let's find out why.

349
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:58,220
Focus on our constituents.
No swag for seniors. We're on a budget.

350
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:01,851
Hey, Kylie, look, about earlier.

351
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:05,189
- You mean when you sold me out?
- You made a second sun.

352
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:07,932
- You told me to take the lead.
- I was being nice.

353
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:11,110
Like all politicians,
you'll say whatever it takes

354
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,738
to get what you want.

355
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:16,274
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

356
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:25,809
The radiogenic detection field
reads negative for fusion products.

357
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:27,410
That good or bad?

358
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:29,781
It means we're not being radiated.

359
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:31,174
Rats.

360
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:33,050
That's definitely
a good thing, Carter.

361
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,135
No, I mean, literally.
Rats.

362
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:42,800
- You got somethin' you want to say?
- No.

363
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,186
Okay, come on.

364
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:48,356
Henry said that the second sun
was getting fuel from somewhere.

365
00:19:48,476 --> 00:19:51,023
- Is it down here?
- Well, if it is, I'm not finding it.

366
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:53,363
Can't believe this place
has been under us all these years.

367
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,698
It's like a door into Eureka's past.
Look at this.

368
00:19:57,921 --> 00:20:00,347
That's the door we saw
in the security photos.

369
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:01,523
All right,

370
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,483
- let's unlock it.
- My specialty.

371
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,173
So how long do you need?

372
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,484
This long.

373
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:18,387
These old school locks are no match
for a 20 zettahertz processor.

374
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,943
Okay.
This is a bit of a letdown.

375
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:37,655
Why order a thermal cleaning
of an empty room?

376
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:39,658
Good point.
Maybe it wasn't always empty.

377
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:42,402
Can I see the light scanner thingy?

378
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:47,136
One biotelemetric
dispersion scanner.

379
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:48,981
Yes. Okay. Coming up.

380
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:55,373
This baby reads patterns of movement
left behind by organic materials.

381
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:57,959
All right,
let's see who's been in here.

382
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,480
Look at that.

383
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:04,692
The dust layer means
that these prints are old.

384
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:07,997
But these high heels
are definitely new.

385
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,898
So are the military boots.

386
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:14,860
Looks like they were
moving stuff out.

387
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:16,702
Like what?

388
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:20,795
- Like them.
- Oh, my God.

389
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:23,952
- Are those...
- Bodies? Carter, hand me the scanner.

390
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:27,664
These bodies were removed
in the last 24 hours.

391
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,959
We have to find out who they were
and what they were doing down here.

392
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,568
And why Thorne
was trying to hide them.

393
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:41,678
This facility is classified
and scheduled for thermal cleaning.

394
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:44,598
Yet here you are
violating direct orders.

395
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,300
I'd except this kind
of insubordination from you, Sheriff.

396
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:50,111
- Thank you.
- But from you two...

397
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:52,954
I've always had a bit of trouble
with authority.

398
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:57,402
As far as I'm concerned,
this just became an active crime scene.

399
00:21:57,563 --> 00:21:59,489
Oh, this is out
of your jurisdiction, Sheriff.

400
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,781
I'd be happy
to have the DOD remind you of that.

401
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:03,825
And I'd be happy to tell them why.

402
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:07,113
- You tryin' to bluff me?
- No, he's not, because he's leaving.

403
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:09,109
- We all are.
- No, actually.

404
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:12,425
- We're not.
- Carter, we crossed the line.

405
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:14,452
Let's not make it any worse.

406
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:20,060
- You sure about this?
- Sorry.

407
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:24,122
Okay.

408
00:22:42,505 --> 00:22:45,310
- I can't believe Allison backed down.
- Yeah, me neither.

409
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,030
Now Thorne has all the evidence.

410
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:50,188
I wouldn't say
all the evidence.

411
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:54,251
I yanked the chip from the dispersion
scanner before they took my stuff.

412
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:56,684
We can see images
of everything we scanned.

413
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:57,587
Nice.

414
00:23:06,763 --> 00:23:08,348
That's definitely not good.

415
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:10,030
Really?

416
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:14,521
Based on my initial data, it should've
burned itself out hours ago.

417
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:17,482
That doesn't look like
it's burning out.

418
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,236
It looks like it's getting hotter.

419
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:23,459
<i>I'm melting.</i>

420
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:26,732
It's midnight and 110 in the shade.

421
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,807
- People are getting pretty testy.
- Yeah, me included.

422
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,792
It reminds me of tornado weather.

423
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,490
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

424
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,837
Well, just keep everybody calm
and preferably indoors.

425
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:40,046
<i>Roger that.</i>

426
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,802
Kylie is gathering atmospheric data.
I should know something soon.

427
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:46,981
All right.
Zane's working on it too.

428
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,666
And in the meantime,
Thorne's wiping out

429
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:52,668
any evidence that connects
her to these bodies.

430
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:56,295
- Any idea who they were?
- I'm getting conflicting information.

431
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,415
How so?

432
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,796
From the surveillance photos,
their approximate age

433
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:03,672
is somewhere between 35 and 45
when they entered the room in 1939.

434
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,531
- All right. With you so far.
- The organic residue that you scanned

435
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,653
establishes that they also died
in 1939.

436
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:13,607
So they were buried there
for 70 years?

437
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:15,420
Yeah, here's
the really puzzling thing.

438
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,190
Common sense says they were
around 40 when they died.

439
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,935
But based on these readings, their
biological age is somewhere around 80.

440
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:34,800
I want someone posted outside
that facility at all times.

441
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:39,168
Nobody comes in
until after the thermal cleaning.

442
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:43,306
Let's get the bodies
ready for transport.

443
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:44,448
Transport?

444
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:46,404
To where?

445
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm afraid it's classified information,
Allison, as is everything in this room.

446
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:55,247
And I'd really appreciate it
if you leave now.

447
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:58,754
You said that you considered
us to be friends. I do too.

448
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:02,836
So why don't you just tell me
who those men are?

449
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,465
I know what it looks like
from where you stand,

450
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,467
but it's not what you think.

451
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:11,550
These were good men
who gave their lives for this town.

452
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:14,227
And it could've been prevented.

453
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,976
You make it sound
as if you knew them.

454
00:25:17,363 --> 00:25:19,132
It's time for you to go now.

455
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:22,911
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I have to.

456
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,077
Dr. Deacon, there's something
I think you're really gonna want to see.

457
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:36,561
Well, please tell me
you didn't make another sun.

458
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:39,666
No, I've been trying to figure out
how to extinguish the first one.

459
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:42,929
- You mean the second one.
- Semantics? Really, Sheriff?

460
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:45,863
Could we just...
Kylie, what did you find?

461
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:47,799
Well, I've been doing
readings all over town

462
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:51,344
and the upper air is saturated
with excess hydrogen.

463
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,904
- Is that bad?
- Well, not by itself.

464
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:57,600
But mixed with Kylie's project, hydrogen
could cause a whopping fusion reaction.

465
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:59,268
Well, how whopping are we talking?

466
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,896
Well, depending on the source
and how much is left, big.

467
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:04,191
Look, I don't know
where this hydrogen is coming from,

468
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:06,151
but I promise I didn't do it.

469
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,456
That's okay.

470
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:11,323
I have a pretty good idea who did.

471
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:13,614
There's no way
my clouds caused this.

472
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:16,690
Well, it's not the clouds themselves.
It's what's inside of them.

473
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,432
- It's a whole lot of hydrogen, right?
- Well, not that much.

474
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:22,292
Maybe 1,000 liters at standard
temperature and pressure.

475
00:26:22,552 --> 00:26:24,718
Well, you've been outside.
It's plenty.

476
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:28,465
How was I supposed to know someone'd
be creating a stellar fusion reaction?

477
00:26:28,678 --> 00:26:31,009
Hello. You live in Eureka.

478
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:34,932
I guess this means
I won't be getting your endorsement.

479
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,933
Well, it's...
Just stick to the problem.

480
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,129
Is this how you deliver
the nanos to make your clouds?

481
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:41,892
Yep. A single stage booster
that fuels the cold accelerant

482
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:44,022
mixer for better saturation
and heat dispersion.

483
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,050
- Nice.
- We gotta fix this.

484
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,257
Can you reverse it?

485
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:51,446
You mean exsanguinate the excess
hydrogen from Eureka's lower atmosphere?

486
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:53,427
- Yes.
- No.

487
00:26:53,547 --> 00:26:55,557
I mean, I can make any shape
you want,

488
00:26:55,677 --> 00:26:59,369
but once the clouds have seeded,
natural hydration processes take over.

489
00:26:59,532 --> 00:27:02,057
I say we enjoy the extra sunlight
while we can.

490
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:04,417
It'll burn itself out soon enough.

491
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,369
You were saying?

492
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:23,770
It should've extinguished itself.
But it didn't.

493
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:26,307
That's because Kylie's sun...
Ingenious though it is...

494
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:29,651
has evolved from a dwarf star and
is developing into a red super giant.

495
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,945
- Which means?
- Instead of burning out,

496
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:33,655
it's blowing up big time.

497
00:27:33,926 --> 00:27:35,921
Not my fault entirely.

498
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,435
It's not stopping there.
The sun flares are just the beginning.

499
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,832
And we only have a few hours
before it goes critical.

500
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:42,622
Okay, what are our options?

501
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:44,582
If we can 
launch a dispersion module,

502
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:47,469
a concentration of iron atoms
fired directly into the sun's core

503
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:50,422
- should cause it to implode.
- And imploding's a good thing?

504
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:54,342
Yes. Once the sun's incapable of fusion
reaction, then, we'll all be safe.

505
00:27:54,981 --> 00:27:56,189
What if it doesn't work?

506
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,100
We all get front row seats to
a supernova way bigger than Hiroshima.

507
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:01,808
And Eureka becomes
a mile deep crater.

508
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:07,058
That's too risky.
We need to evacuate now.

509
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:08,646
Y... Jo's already started.

510
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:10,244
But this is also the most advanced

511
00:28:10,364 --> 00:28:13,236
research complex on the planet
and we have an opportunity to save it.

512
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,936
And I'm already developing
a compound to trigger the implosion.

513
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:19,159
- And I'm working on a delivery system.
- Towns can be rebuilt. People can't.

514
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,064
Which is why we're evacuating the people
while we're trying to save the town.

515
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:25,427
You might be comfortable
risking lives, but I'm not.

516
00:28:25,547 --> 00:28:27,459
Make sure everybody gets out
while there's time.

517
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,307
Eva, we have a chance
to save decades of research.

518
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:32,007
That wasn't a request.

519
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:35,341
It's like she wants to see the place
go up in flames.

520
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,627
I think she might.

521
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:41,054
Well, what now?

522
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:50,923
Let's go, people!

523
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:53,478
Move! Move!
Shuttles are waiting outside.

524
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,694
Let's go!

525
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:57,893
You know what, after the election,
we'll have the influence around.

526
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:00,926
- Maybe I can up your pay rate.
- Don't make me use the stun gun.

527
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:03,024
You heard her, Fargo.
Keep moving. Everybody move.

528
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:07,162
But we're just making sure
his constituents are safely away first.

529
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:09,834
How come you two aren't drenched
like the rest of us?

530
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,880
Oh, a worthy candidate is always
cool under pressure, Sheriff.

531
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:15,524
And it's classified.

532
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,593
However, I could be convinced
to share my secret for, say,

533
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:20,436
your endorsement.

534
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:25,855
This is mine.
Both of you on the bus.

535
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:28,060
Go. Go!
Everybody move! Keep goin'!

536
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,773
Sounds like we're using sunscreen
to beat injustice.

537
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:33,338
- Just smile and look pretty.
- Zo, what are you doin'?

538
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,838
You gotta go.
Guys, please.

539
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:38,039
Not yet. Latest election polls
only show Lucas down by two points.

540
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,199
You wanna score points with the voters
or with your girlfriend's old man?

541
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:42,976
No contest, sir.

542
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:48,839
- That'll work.
- Vote Lucas!

543
00:29:50,463 --> 00:29:52,544
All right, everybody's cleared out.
Any luck?

544
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,585
- We're locked and loaded, Sheriff.
- XRT online and ready.

545
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:58,425
It'll take two people to get
the module in position for launch.

546
00:29:58,635 --> 00:29:59,626
I can do that.

547
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,822
- I can do that on my own.
- No. I'll go with you.

548
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:01,961
No. I'll go with you.
I know this baby best.

549
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,814
Okay. All right.
You three get to an evacuation site.

550
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:06,989
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

551
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:08,447
- Be careful.
- Thanks.

552
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:10,697
Could you keep an eye
on Lex and Zoe?

553
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:13,473
Of course.
Just come back safely.

554
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:15,391
Thanks.

555
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:24,575
We're at a safe distance from town.

556
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:27,281
We can move everyone quickly
if we need to, but with...

557
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:30,227
ten evac camps for 2,600 people.

558
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:33,989
Things are gonna get crowded.
How are you feelin'?

559
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:36,485
I just wish someone
would do something about the heat.

560
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:37,965
I hear your pain.

561
00:30:38,474 --> 00:30:40,500
This town needs a Mayor
who can be cool in a crisis.

562
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:43,211
And if I'm elected,
I promise I won't sleep

563
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:46,008
until darkness falls again
on Eureka.

564
00:30:46,265 --> 00:30:47,409
Oh, please.

565
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:49,843
You don't need stale
campaign promises.

566
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:53,283
You need ideas that are fresh
as baked bread,

567
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:56,505
which by the way,
Vincent also provides twice daily.

568
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:59,185
Say no to half-baked science
and overbaked bread.

569
00:30:59,753 --> 00:31:02,439
- Lucas is your man.
- Can't bake his way out of a paper bag.

570
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,690
- Like cloud makers...
- What is wrong with all of you?

571
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,468
Eureka was founded
to protect the greater good.

572
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:11,444
You're worried about votes.
You should be worried about lives.

573
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:13,826
You cannot be a leader
if there is no town to lead.

574
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:16,843
So I suggest you get
your priorities straight.

575
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:21,747
That was beautiful.

576
00:31:24,705 --> 00:31:25,863
Having fun yet?

577
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:29,443
Driving headlong into a fiery death
is everybody's idea of a good time.

578
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:31,488
Sometimes I think it's his.

579
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:34,854
Carter, could we have a minute?

580
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,645
Sure.

581
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,115
Jo, you're supposed to be miles away
at an evac camp by now.

582
00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:01,675
I should risk my life more often.

583
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,541
I prefer you didn't.

584
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:06,336
Come on, Josefina,
don't go all serious on me now.

585
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:09,130
It's too late.

586
00:32:21,742 --> 00:32:24,596
- I thought we agreed to evacuate.
- We did. What are you still doing here?

587
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:26,763
None of your business.
Don't play games.

588
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:29,788
I'm not.
I think Zane's device is gonna work.

589
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,819
- Probably.
- If you don't die first.

590
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,626
That is part of the job.

591
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:38,159
And the men in that bunker
would know that.

592
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:41,454
Whatever it is you think you know
about what you found or about me,

593
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:42,798
it's wrong.

594
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:45,283
Maybe.
But I'm just gettin' started.

595
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:49,000
If there's one thing I learned in life
is that nobody should be left behind,

596
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,297
no matter what the reason.
And that includes you.

597
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,096
I'm duty bound
to enforce this evacuation.

598
00:32:58,356 --> 00:33:00,577
Jo, make sure
she gets out of town safely.

599
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:02,809
And no, that's not a request.

600
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:14,694
That looks pretty bad.
You sure the rocket can handle it?

601
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:18,835
An untested delivery system
aimed at an out of control mini sun.

602
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:20,243
What could go wrong?

603
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,839
Ready?

604
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:42,234
It's fried.

605
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,943
I'll call Allison.

606
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,438
Okay, Carter, what's wrong?

607
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:51,496
Zane's module. Electronics are fried.
Do you have any spares lying around?

608
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,922
GD has plenty
of short range booster assemblies.

609
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:56,773
We just need to adapt them
to the XRT's specifications.

610
00:33:56,943 --> 00:33:59,699
- We'll never make it back in time.
- There is another way.

611
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,909
<i>Dr. Herrera's hydrogen seeding device.</i>

612
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,246
It uses similar boosters to the XRT.

613
00:34:05,908 --> 00:34:07,991
But my greenhouse is too close
to that sun.

614
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:10,209
And there's no way
they'll ever survive the heat.

615
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,557
Well, hold on.
Maybe there is.

616
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,873
- <i>What are you thinking?</i>
- Well, like Fargo said earlier.

617
00:34:16,318 --> 00:34:18,902
We just need to stay cool
under pressure.

618
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:25,767
I've been workin' on
this heat protection formula for weeks.

619
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,171
- Sure that'll work?
- It's a prototype.

620
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:34,442
But it's overengineered to respond
to increased body heat and adrenaline.

621
00:34:36,012 --> 00:34:38,439
Takin' on a supernova
so we should have plenty of both.

622
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,657
All you gotta do is slather it on.

623
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:43,541
We should have a good 10,
maybe 15 minutes

624
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:45,078
before we combust.

625
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,413
Fantastic.

626
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:51,209
That's gettin' worst.

627
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,961
- Then why are you slowin' down?
- I'm not.

628
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:56,547
You smell burning rubber?

629
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:03,096
Gonna have to run for it.

630
00:35:05,215 --> 00:35:08,142
Dude, it's like 2 zillion degrees
out there.

631
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:11,270
- Okay, I'm game.
- You do anything normal for fun?

632
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:13,564
I play a wicked game of yahtzee.

633
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,392
Put that gel on thick
if you know what's good for ya.

634
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:19,170
You ready?

635
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,793
I feel like a lobster in here.

636
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:37,753
Temp's climbing.
If we stay long, we'll boil.

637
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:41,220
Find that rocket.

638
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:44,484
- It might help if I could see anything.
- Keep looking!

639
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:52,430
Got it! Got it!

640
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,333
Yep! Right!

641
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:05,118
This way.

642
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:22,884
And...

643
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:25,553
set.

644
00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:29,807
We only get one shot at this.
I don't wanna miss.

645
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:31,350
Using GPS to target?

646
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,604
- I was gonna eyeball it.
- Oh, stellar.

647
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:38,519
Whatever happens, it's been fun.

648
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:41,277
No, it hasn't.
Push the button.

649
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:14,393
Take a look at that.

650
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:23,225
That is quite a sunset.

651
00:37:43,883 --> 00:37:45,869
So you managed to pull it off.

652
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:48,477
You sound disappointed.

653
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:51,722
Someone cancelled the thermal cleaning.
I wonder who.

654
00:37:51,982 --> 00:37:54,600
You may have the backing of the DOD,
but these people still work for me.

655
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:57,145
- And you work for me.
- Not without an explanation.

656
00:37:57,315 --> 00:37:59,105
- Those bodies...
- Are my concern.

657
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:04,360
You're asking me to trust you,
but you're giving me nothing.

658
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,719
Well, I'll give you some advice.

659
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:10,408
History has a way of haunting you
no matter how far you run.

660
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:16,127
This is mine and I'm putting it to rest.
So you stay out of my way.

661
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:34,265
Listen, whoever wins,
it was nice doing battle with you.

662
00:38:34,786 --> 00:38:37,045
After all this,
I don't even care who wins anymore.

663
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:41,981
- As long as one of us buries that guy.
- Amen to that.

664
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:46,193
Hey, partner.
Thanks for the save.

665
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:48,154
Fiery death not popular with voters.

666
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,440
I caused it.
It's the least I could do.

667
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,574
My fault too.

668
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:54,599
I got so caught up in everything
when I should've been helping you.

669
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:56,996
- This time I'll make it up to you.
- This time?

670
00:38:57,256 --> 00:38:59,216
Well, we have to make a new model.

671
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:02,001
And someone should make sure
I don't destroy the universe. So...

672
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:04,038
Partners?

673
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,404
- Glad to see you're okay.
- Me too.

674
00:39:12,313 --> 00:39:14,422
- Look, about before...
- It's cool, Jo.

675
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:17,934
It was a crisis.
You were caught up in the moment.

676
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,375
No, I wasn't.

677
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:33,463
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

678
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:35,111
Way to go, Sheriff.

679
00:39:35,526 --> 00:39:36,931
So how's the...

680
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:40,292
Itchy.

681
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,667
Hope that means it's healing well.

682
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:44,351
Listen, what...

683
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:48,172
you and Zane did
was a brave... mythic.

684
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:49,340
Maybe selfish.

685
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,489
- I'm growing attached to the town.
- This town,

686
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,470
is fortunate to have you
to protect it.

687
00:39:56,382 --> 00:39:59,600
- I'm just doin' my job.
- And... Thorne?

688
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:06,303
I'm workin' on it.

689
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,652
May I have your attention, please?

690
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:10,924
'scuse me.

691
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:13,114
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

692
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:14,904
Everyone.

693
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:19,338
Quiet!

694
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,921
Thank you.

695
00:40:22,593 --> 00:40:25,923
All the ballots are in.
It was a very close race.

696
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,774
But after a late night surge
at the polling booths,

697
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:32,065
our new mayor elect is...

698
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:34,177
Mr. Henry Deacon.

699
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:38,321
Seriously?

700
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,646
No, wait.
I wasn't even on the ballot.

701
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,024
I kinda started a write-in campaign.

702
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:52,554
And someone gave you
their official endorsement.

703
00:40:52,777 --> 00:40:53,988
You're welcome.

704
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:55,513
I don't know...

705
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,201
- What to say.
- Say that you'll take the job

706
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:01,704
because Zoe's boyfriend
is the runner up.

707
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:06,315
Clearly this is a surprise.

708
00:41:06,485 --> 00:41:09,860
I'm not one for making
campaign promises.

709
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:12,673
But I will say this.

710
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,957
What makes Eureka special

711
00:41:15,415 --> 00:41:17,346
is not the ideal behind it,

712
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:20,170
but you. This community.

713
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,615
This family

714
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:24,504
that I'm very proud to be a part of.

715
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:26,395
And it's this family

716
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:29,948
that I promise to protect

717
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,045
no matter what.

718
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:35,654
Thank you.

719
00:41:43,808 --> 00:41:46,040
See.
Sometimes the system does work.
