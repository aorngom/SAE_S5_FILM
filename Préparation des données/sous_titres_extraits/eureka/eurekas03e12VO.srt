1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:02,569
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,323
Sheriff Jack Carter, Tess Fontana.
Tess and I are old friends.

3
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:08,069
You're the new head of Section Five?

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,344
Look, Duncan, how well
do we really know each other?

5
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:13,929
You know, our hopes, our dreams,

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,840
our reactions to surprises?

7
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,102
I think I'm gonna
have to think about this.

8
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:24,315
You and Henry
are working on something.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,967
It's a signal, isn't it?

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:29,862
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

11
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,739
Henry, what are you saying?

12
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,200
There's something out there.
It's heading straight for us.

13
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:36,208
Straight for Eureka.

14
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:43,874
What's all this?

15
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,920
We're making
a baby book for the boys.

16
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:49,674
- Smile, uncle Jack.
- Thanks for that.

17
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:50,931
SARAH, print.

18
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:53,469
<i>I'd be happy to maintain
a virtual album</i>

19
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,763
<i>with holographic growth charts
and captured sound.</i>

20
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,395
That's okay, SARAH.

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,320
Some things are better
the old fashioned way.

22
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,146
- So any word from Duncan?
- Dad.

23
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:06,355
What? No, it's okay, Zoe.

24
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:10,319
He's probably halfway across the world
curing disease where he belongs.

25
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,348
Which is why I didn't tell him
I was pregnant to begin with.

26
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:16,232
I'm sorry, aunt Lex.
I really didn't mean to pressure you.

27
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:17,952
I thought you would work it out.

28
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,473
No, Zoe, it's not your fault.
Life is...

29
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,665
It's messy sometimes.

30
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,491
- Is it?
- Here we go.

31
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:25,960
So everything's my fault?

32
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,991
No, not everything.

33
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,756
Look, Jack, even when we were kids,
you never took my side.

34
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,324
Lex, cut the guy some slack.
You lied to him, then you took off.

35
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,721
He didn't have the chance
to do the right thing.

36
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:45,537
Life is messy.

37
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:48,607
But this isn't how you clean it up.

38
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:51,010
He doesn't want this.

39
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:52,148
I do.

40
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,571
So I'm moving on.

41
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,366
I got to get dressed.

42
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:00,264
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

43
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:19,992
Moving on.

44
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:34,361
- So what's this all about?
- Just waiting for the aliens to land.

45
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:35,906
Seriously?

46
00:02:36,343 --> 00:02:38,699
Actually, it's our turn to host
'cause we went there last year.

47
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:40,618
Um, "there" being...

48
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:43,432
Area 51, Eureka's arch rivals.

49
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:46,248
Our annual bowling match
goes back nearly 50 years.

50
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:49,502
- Bowling. That sounds pretty intense.
- You have no idea.

51
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:52,546
Area 51,

52
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,799
- that's UFO guys, right?
- Wrong.

53
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,177
They got the alien rep after
a surveillance balloon crashed in 1947.

54
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,057
- Never lived it down.
- Which is why we love to rub it in.

55
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,932
Totally throws off their game.

56
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:09,480
Hello, Fargo.

57
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,497
Hello, Bismark.

58
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,183
What is that odor?

59
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,782
- The smell of fear.
- The only thing scary is your breath.

60
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:21,867
Ready to lose for the fifth year?

61
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,786
Did you bring your green men
to help you?

62
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,454
I'll show you green men.

63
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:28,123
Easy, ladies.
Keep the competition friendly, okay?

64
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,284
It's hardly a competition, Sheriff.

65
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:32,169
Your little team
doesn't stand a chance.

66
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,108
You haven't met our secret weapon.

67
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:37,466
Hey, Big Ed, come out and say hi.

68
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:43,848
Big Ed Fowler?

69
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:45,641
The former PBA champion?

70
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,691
He also happens to be
a very gifted biochemist.

71
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:55,944
Bowling's more of a hobby.

72
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:59,405
There's no way.
This is a violation of the rules.

73
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,448
You can't bring in a ringer
from the outside.

74
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,414
Rules state anybody
employed here can play.

75
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:05,911
Read 'em and weep.

76
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,915
Still time to beam back
to the mother ship.

77
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:12,918
- Bring it, Fargo.
- It's been brung, Bismark.

78
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,453
- Nice English.
- Nice face.

79
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:16,213
All right, stop.

80
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:18,094
I gotta go.

81
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:20,259
But both of you... behave.

82
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:34,103
Finally.

83
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:37,484
- What did you come by, pack mule?
- Nice to see you too, Tess.

84
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,050
Sorry, but time-sensitive issue.

85
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:43,073
We need your help collecting
all the globidium in Eureka.

86
00:04:43,294 --> 00:04:44,575
All the what?

87
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:46,399
Globidium... It's a nuclear element

88
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:48,245
artificially created here at Global.

89
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,864
It's much safer than plutonium
with ten times the energy output.

90
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:52,958
Why the recall?

91
00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:55,357
Globidium's been field tested
in town for years,

92
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:57,358
but we need to get it back
for a new project.

93
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:58,756
Not everyone is complying.

94
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,883
And we were hoping
you could persuade them

95
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,702
using your inimitable
Andy Griffith charm.

96
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:07,514
You have the unique ability
to make a compliment sound insulting.

97
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,642
- Who said that was a compliment?
- Stop.

98
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:12,171
I really need your help, Carter.

99
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:14,521
In the meantime, it's artificial.
Can't you make some more?

100
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,399
We could if we had six months.
But we don't. We need to move quickly.

101
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:20,110
This has something to do
with the signal from space?

102
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,196
You told him?

103
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,656
No, but you just did.

104
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:27,493
You think you're clever.

105
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:28,731
Yes, I am.

106
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:30,955
So when are the little green men
coming to Eureka?

107
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,665
Sorry. I can't share the details.

108
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,001
We shared an alternate universe.
Does that not mean anything to you?

109
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,296
- Just get to that list, Sheriff.
- All right.

110
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:41,907
I'm on this list.

111
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:43,927
The smart house reactor
runs on globidium,

112
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,177
we'll need yours too.

113
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,318
Is that a problem?

114
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,267
SARAH might have an issue with it.

115
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:56,705
You don't have to worry about SARAH.
She can be adapted to alternate sources.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,487
She doesn't like change,
and neither do I.

117
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:00,612
I noticed.

118
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,628
Meaning?

119
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:05,724
Tess Fontana.

120
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:07,483
I mean, she gets under your skin.

121
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,282
Yeah, just a bit.

122
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:13,622
I think our first customer
is trying to make a fast getaway.

123
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,596
Clean globidium-mobile!

124
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:18,095
I'll return the power cell tomorrow.
I got a hot date tonight.

125
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,518
She loves the car.

126
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:22,509
She's just gotta love you for you.
Pop the hood, Henry.

127
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,219
I just had this cleaned inside and out.
You can eat off that engine.

128
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:30,514
It's not here. The reactor's empty.

129
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:37,187
Seth, give it back.

130
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,856
I'm the victim.

131
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:40,816
Then why were you trying
to get away?

132
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,444
In a car with no power cell.
How dumb do you think I am?

133
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,244
What the hell?

134
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:20,705
Strike one!

135
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:25,868
You know the rules.

136
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:28,197
You mess with your own balls.
But not with ours.

137
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,116
Somebody can't take a joke.

138
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:33,285
Fargo, I have one word for you.

139
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,828
Is it "surrender"?

140
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:38,457
It's "truce".

141
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,579
We're above this pettiness.

142
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:45,211
So I'm gonna be the bigger man here
and propose that we focus on the game.

143
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:46,423
No more pranks.

144
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:48,828
Deal?

145
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:51,646
Deal.

146
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:53,764
May the best team win.

147
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,141
As long as they're human.

148
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:58,179
Good one.

149
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:03,689
- We're really calling a truce?
- No way!

150
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,747
I just want to keep them
off their guard.

151
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:08,722
That way they'll never
know what hit 'em, huh?

152
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,071
What the frack?

153
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,494
His car was in the driveway all night.
Anyone could have taken the power cell.

154
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,655
Yes, but globidium
is a unique power source

155
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,674
without it,
our project won't be ready in time.

156
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,688
What project is that exactly?

157
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,594
The point is we need to find it.

158
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,597
Do we need to be worried
about health risks?

159
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,724
Compared to elements
like plutonium, no.

160
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,585
But if it is taken out of the container,
then we'd be looking at

161
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,229
moderate levels of...

162
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:46,106
Radioactivity.
Now, that's odd.

163
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:49,284
It's picking up
a radioactive source...

164
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:51,389
from somewhere.

165
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,808
We demand action.

166
00:08:57,498 --> 00:09:01,498
I think they're taking
the little green men thing a bit far.

167
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:10,340
This is no joke.
They're radioactive.

168
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,403
Projet-SG (1.00)

169
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,701
Those guys are crazy.
They're trying to kill us.

170
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,335
You're gonna be fine.

171
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,321
- They're gonna be fine, aren't they?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,102
You have elevated levels
of gamma radiation

173
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:44,381
that mutated
the pigmentation of your skin,

174
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:47,544
but it's
the equivalent of a sunburn.

175
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,755
So we're not gonna turn
into The Hulk?

176
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:53,508
Only if you get
really, really angry.

177
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:58,656
Don't worry. It'll be out of your system
in a few days.

178
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:00,447
Then we need
to get back to practice.

179
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:02,559
We need to get even.

180
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,295
Fargo smash!

181
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:05,687
Fargo will not smash.

182
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:08,023
There'll be no getting even.
Understand?

183
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:14,488
- That's actually a pretty color.
- Yeah, if you're a muppet.

184
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,383
What could have caused this?

185
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:18,838
Could it be a missing power cell
courtesy of Area 51?

186
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:21,536
On its own, no.
But if it was altered, it's possible.

187
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:24,164
I've worked with these guys before.
They're dorks but harmless.

188
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:27,072
We still need to collect
the remaing power cells.

189
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:30,447
- You go with Jo, I check out Bismark?
- Let's go.

190
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,881
Don't be afraid to use deadly force.

191
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,636
<i>There's a visitor at the door.</i>

192
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,875
Maybe it's the baby's crib.
SARAH, you can open the door.

193
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,065
Hello, Lex.

194
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:51,212
<i>This is the Duncan?</i>

195
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:52,935
Yeah, this is...

196
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,278
him.

197
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,859
- What is that?
- It's my house. It's...

198
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,209
- Possessed.
- <i>Of a singular artificial intelligence.</i>

199
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,662
SARAH, please.
I thought you left town.

200
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:07,040
- I prefer to deal with my problems.
- We're nobody's problems.

201
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,562
Don't turn this around on me, okay?

202
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,878
You are the one who took off
without saying a word.

203
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:13,922
You freaked out when I told you.

204
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,089
It's 'cause of the way
you sprang it on me.

205
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:19,011
I mean, kapow! Lookie here!
Twins! Right out of thin air!

206
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:24,016
All right, you're right.
So maybe I panicked a little.

207
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:25,267
A little?

208
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,986
So you would have reacted differently
had I told you in Cape Town?

209
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:36,185
Maybe.
The point is I had a right to know.

210
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:38,675
You're right.

211
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:40,425
You did.

212
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:44,285
So what do you wanna do now?

213
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:45,871
What do you wanna do?

214
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:49,585
I want us to be honest
with each other.

215
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:52,495
I mean, come on. We had six...

216
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:55,310
crazy, passionate months together.

217
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:58,435
But this wasn't in the cards.

218
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,625
Life looks different to me now.

219
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,432
I'd give up anything for these kids,
but I don't expect you to.

220
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,892
Isn't that my choice?

221
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:14,965
Go back to your life, Duncan.

222
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:16,985
Please?

223
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:21,073
That's what you really want?

224
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:26,105
<i>You heard the lady.</i>

225
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,212
Yeah, there you go!

226
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:39,045
Just picture Fargo's face on the pins.
Works every time.

227
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,170
Bismark!

228
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:42,235
Well, hello, Sheriff.

229
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:43,745
How's Fargo?

230
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,932
Green with envy or just plain green?

231
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:49,184
What'd you do?
How'd you do it?

232
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:51,285
Camoscope.

233
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:54,430
The future of camouflage.
It emits gamma rays into the skin,

234
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:56,733
starting a chain reaction
that alters the pigmentation.

235
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:00,487
Any chance you powered it
with a stolen bit of glob...

236
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:04,699
It's a nuclear power cell thingy.

237
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,375
We don't steal.

238
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:07,695
We win.

239
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,330
You're taking the prank thing
a little far, don't you think?

240
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,542
As far as turning
a beloved mascot invisible

241
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:16,753
or planting a bioengineered laxative
in a rival's talcum powder?

242
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,338
Why would you do that?

243
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,030
You guys did that...

244
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:22,967
Last year in Area 51.

245
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:28,371
Look, if you really wanna find
your nuclear power cell thingy, Sheriff,

246
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:31,220
you might wanna talk
to your own team members,

247
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,779
'cause they're the ones
that take things too far.

248
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,875
For you.

249
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,364
- You're Lexi's niece, right?
- Yeah, Zoe.

250
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:46,867
You know, your aunt can be
unbelievably stubborn.

251
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:49,661
And overprotective.
It runs in the family.

252
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,510
What's with the green man group?

253
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:56,877
My boyfriend's team
got punk'd by their rivals.

254
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,572
It's probably gamma radiation.

255
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:00,922
I saw something similar
near a reactor in Siberia.

256
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,382
The green's a nice touch.

257
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:04,509
You know how to fix it?

258
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,277
Lucky for you, a good epidemiologist
always travels prepared.

259
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,825
Vinspresso ice cream, anyone?

260
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,560
Vincent, we don't need ice cream.
We need payback.

261
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,360
Oh, my.
What are you, green and deaf?

262
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:18,356
- I said no payback.
- Of course, Sheriff.

263
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:20,520
We'll take the high road.

264
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:23,446
- It's a good idea.
- Stop sucking up, Lucas.

265
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,906
Are you planning any pranks
involving a nuclear power cell?

266
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:29,284
We've dabbled in low-combustion
explosives, but nothing nuclear.

267
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:32,464
Lucas, what part of "secret"
don't you understand?

268
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:35,149
You almost done with Tess's list?

269
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:38,459
Yeah, and Seth Osbourne's not
the only one missing a power cell.

270
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:41,254
- We have three more thefts.
- Of course we do.

271
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:44,841
Can I offer you two some ice cream
before it all melts?

272
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,219
- No, thank you.
- What's the problem?

273
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:50,810
My freezer died right after
Area 51 showed up.

274
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:52,807
Coincidence? I think not.

275
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:56,686
Well, don't be too sure.
Is Café Diem on the list?

276
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:02,351
The freezer runs off globidium.

277
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,654
And it was working when Big Ed
cleaned it this morning.

278
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:06,870
Now...

279
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:09,530
Seth Osbourne said
that he had his car cleaned as well.

280
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:12,953
Would Big Ed happen to work
in the auto detailing business?

281
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:16,373
Well, sure, Big Ed can clean anything.
I mean, that's his job.

282
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:17,749
He's the cleaner.

283
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:23,758
That's it. All the globidium cells
we've managed to collect.

284
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:26,446
Well, the laser telescope
is gonna need a lot more power

285
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:28,669
if we're gonna get
a good look at that...

286
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,265
Whatever it is.

287
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:33,390
- Is that what's sending the signal?
- Yeah, it's the best image we can get.

288
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:35,934
The new telescope will give us
a much higher resolution.

289
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,743
But our atmospheric window
closes in 24 hours.

290
00:15:38,868 --> 00:15:40,888
Well, Carter will find
the stolen power cells.

291
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:42,713
Just give him some time.

292
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:46,995
Is there anything,

293
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:49,239
you know, going on between you two?

294
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:51,185
What?

295
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:52,775
God, no.

296
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,744
I'm pregnant.

297
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:57,706
You know, some guys are into that.
More of you to love.

298
00:15:58,035 --> 00:15:59,085
Okay, stop.

299
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,492
We're friends. Just friends.

300
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:05,755
If you say so.

301
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,930
Okay, thanks, Principal Wallace.
We'll let you know when we find it.

302
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,260
Let me guess.
She had Big Ed clean something?

303
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:17,885
Globidium-powered barbecue
that's now missing a power cell.

304
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,000
Looks like the cleaner's dirty.

305
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,410
Well, maybe we'll get lucky
and he'll confess.

306
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:24,035
It's just down here.

307
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:41,825
I guess he stepped out.

308
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,936
Or took off.

309
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:50,865
The missing power cells.

310
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,780
Should we be worried about,
you know, radiation exposure?

311
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:56,205
Well, I gotta...

312
00:16:58,995 --> 00:17:00,395
I'm gonna say yes.

313
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:07,785
Is that Big Ed?

314
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,015
Not anymore.

315
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,502
No radiation. It's all good.

316
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,588
- Tell that to Big Ed.
- So he just melted?

317
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:30,632
Like a green popsicle
on a sunny day.

318
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,540
At least you found the globidium.

319
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:35,900
Well, globidium
couldn't do this on its own.

320
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:38,181
Could it react to the stuff
that turned him green?

321
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:41,032
Well, if the combo generated
the right amount of radiation,

322
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:43,050
it could mutate human cells.

323
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:45,725
- We need to talk to Henry.
- All right.

324
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:48,690
Theoretically, it's possible...

325
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:51,277
Except for one problem.
These containers?

326
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:53,235
They're empty.

327
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,456
What happened to the globidium?

328
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:58,815
I don't know. I mean, there's not
a single photon in any of them.

329
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,230
As a matter of fact,

330
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:03,248
there's a total absence of radiation
in Big Ed's remains.

331
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:07,567
- Well, that's disturbing.
- Well, he's a big puddle of goo.

332
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:10,905
No, no, Carter, I mean on average,
we're all exposed to .2 rem

333
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,300
of radiation each year, which means,
to some degree, we're all radioactive.

334
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,210
- Well, that's comforting.
- No, it's normal and generally safe.

335
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:20,306
Though neither of those words
seem to apply here.

336
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:21,899
You get used to that.

337
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,860
If Big Ed was turned green
by radiation,

338
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,398
shouldn't his levels be even higher?

339
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:30,335
One would expect, but...

340
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:32,360
It's like something drained it out.

341
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,363
- What about the rest of the team?
- They've been tested. Everyone's fine.

342
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:39,075
Let's get 'em back and check
their radiation levels just to be safe.

343
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,828
You threatened my team
and liquefied our secret weapon!

344
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:44,372
This is blasphemy, okay?
Madness!

345
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,458
This is Eureka!

346
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,130
Break it up.
What happened?

347
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:50,211
I have no idea, okay?
But we didn't do it.

348
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,588
You did turn them green.

349
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:54,390
I told you.
We fully tested the camoscope.

350
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:56,217
The effects
are completely superficial.

351
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,430
Did you do anything else to Big Ed?
Any pranks, any other...

352
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,682
When? We've been practicing all day.
Ask anyone. They'll tell you.

353
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:06,227
You probably been using alien
mind control on everybody here.

354
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:08,635
- Bite me, Kermit.
- Guys!

355
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:11,858
A man's dead, okay?

356
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:14,305
Now, I need help.
You got it?

357
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,725
- Got it.
- Got it.

358
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:19,760
Great.
Fargo, you knew Big Ed.

359
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:22,160
Any reason that he'd want to stockpile
a bunch of globibidum?

360
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:24,204
- Globidium.
- Don't push me.

361
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:26,865
I don't know.

362
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:30,251
He usually kept to himself.
I know he liked to clean.

363
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:32,253
And I think he had a pet.

364
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,800
You want to keep Area 51 here
until further notice?

365
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,470
Fargo, get your guys to GD,
just in case.

366
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,929
Like, in case we melt?

367
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,281
As long as you're green,
I'd like to keep an eye on you.

368
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:44,724
I'll watch them. Come on.

369
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:47,325
And remember, no more pranks, okay?

370
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:55,495
Last one, I swear.

371
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:03,325
What's in that stuff? It reeks.

372
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:05,245
Tell me about it.

373
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,747
It's an organic mineral mask
made of herbs,

374
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,708
sea salt and fruit extractions
from around the world.

375
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:13,253
Should leach
the toxins out of the skin.

376
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:16,227
I feel like a girl.

377
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,415
Would you rather stay green?

378
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:20,938
Yeah, I didn't think so.

379
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,105
I'll be right back.

380
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:28,431
- Smoothie.
- Sure.

381
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:31,312
- Can we get Lexi's special?
- Aunt Lex. What's up?

382
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:34,885
I just came to get a smoothie
before yoga with Allison.

383
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,325
What's Duncan doing here?

384
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:43,909
He's taking pity on my green boyfriend.
I hope that's okay.

385
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,077
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

386
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,454
Because I'm fraternizing with the enemy
for my purposes.

387
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:50,668
No, Duncan isn't the enemy.

388
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:53,024
Besides, he's really good
at what he does.

389
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,673
I should go meet Allison.

390
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,186
- There you go.
- Thank you.

391
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:02,719
And a decaf Vinspresso ice cream.

392
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,546
It's for Allison.
She's craving it.

393
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:05,623
Thanks.

394
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,823
Let's see what we got.

395
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:26,105
Well?

396
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:30,839
Duncan, you're a genius.

397
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,670
Can we fix the rest of me now?

398
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:35,296
It's not just you.

399
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,045
How much of this stuff can we make?

400
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,077
So...

401
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:44,041
Why would a cleaner
wanna steal globidium?

402
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:47,108
Big Ed wasn't just a cleaner.
He was the cleaner.

403
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:50,190
Clean rooms, contamination control,
waste management...

404
00:21:50,315 --> 00:21:53,175
They're all essential to the research
that we do here at Global.

405
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,482
I heard a single dust mite
once got into LEP at CERN

406
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,733
set them back six months.

407
00:22:01,264 --> 00:22:05,331
So if dirty is bad,
then would Ed have stolen the cells

408
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:08,534
to power like a nuclear vacuum?

409
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:13,552
What Tess means is
that we have moved well beyond that.

410
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:15,875
Big Ed specialized
in bioremediation,

411
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,301
using microorganisms to restore
a contaminated environment

412
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:20,671
back to its natural state.

413
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,568
So kinda like soap?

414
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:26,803
What?

415
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:33,758
Each organism was created
to clean a particular metal or chemical,

416
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:37,021
which makes it perfect
for cleaning up industrial waste,

417
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:38,927
oil spills, and the like.

418
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:42,176
Well, Big Ed's remains
were cleaned of radiation.

419
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:44,570
Could he have had
an organism that did that?

420
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,053
All right, everyone.

421
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:56,366
You need to apply the treatment
wherever you're green.

422
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:58,737
So... take off your clothes.

423
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,878
Get naked here?

424
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:03,303
All right.
You heard him.

425
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,717
You with me.
Boys with Duncan.

426
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,117
Relax, Doug.
Nudity is perfectly natural, all right?

427
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:12,265
I lived in places in Africa
where it's the custom to go au naturel.

428
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:14,767
Bully for you.
I prefer privacy.

429
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:21,743
Here it is.

430
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,736
Big Ed bioengineered a prototype
for a microorganism

431
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,530
that ingests gamma radiation
for nuclear waste cleanups.

432
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,558
He even gave it a nickname.
"Spot".

433
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,526
As in "remover", I'm guessing.

434
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,918
Fargo said that big Ed had a pet.

435
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:38,416
Yeah, but all I see here
are cleaning supplies.

436
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,726
And when I went by his house, he didn't
have any food dishes or litter boxes.

437
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:46,758
But could this pet project
be his pet?

438
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:49,010
Well, if it is, pets need to be fed.

439
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:51,523
- Wanna guess what his favorite food is?
- Globidium.

440
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:55,564
- No wonder he's so far over budget.
- He used my power cells as pet food?

441
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,394
With you collecting it all,
it was either that or let it starve.

442
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:01,997
And if he ran out, Spot might be after
other sources of gamma radiation.

443
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,864
Like a green Big Ed?

444
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,028
Where is this thing now?

445
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:13,451
- Looking for its next meal.
- In here?

446
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,703
Well, it's not like
it just can open up a door.

447
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:23,111
There's another way out.

448
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:38,026
Man, this stuff stinks.

449
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:53,954
What is in this stuff?

450
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:02,583
Get off me!

451
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:06,257
Go, go, go!

452
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:09,048
What was that?

453
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,066
I may never shower again.

454
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:25,255
I'd rather go naked than wear fur.

455
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,013
Yes, General.

456
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:37,323
I understand your concern
about the signal.

457
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,762
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah, one second.

458
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:40,827
Yes, sir.

459
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:42,474
I will schedule a call.

460
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:48,075
Hey, partner.
I got you a little present from Vincent.

461
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,463
It's ice cream.
It's a little melted.

462
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:52,328
I am so sorry.

463
00:25:52,453 --> 00:25:54,135
I am going to have
to cancel yoga today.

464
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:57,172
I have a situation
that I have to deal with.

465
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:02,699
I guess I'll just see you next time.

466
00:26:06,677 --> 00:26:07,590
Come on.

467
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:09,705
You okay?

468
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:16,323
Duncan's in town.

469
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,702
Yes, I know.
I met him.

470
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,870
He's helping un-green
our bowling team.

471
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:22,817
Yeah, he's good that way.

472
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,361
He's good most ways, actually.

473
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:27,001
Too good.

474
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:30,023
You make that sound
like a bad thing.

475
00:26:30,148 --> 00:26:33,174
I just... I don't want him
to change because of me...

476
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:34,800
Or them.

477
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:39,315
Oh, well, I'm not gonna lie to you.
Children definitely change things,

478
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,890
but mostly for the better.

479
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:43,894
- You ever have any regrets?
- Oh, about having them?

480
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:47,647
I mean, it's hard running this place
and being a parent.

481
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,184
But is it worth it?

482
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:51,442
Absolutely.

483
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:54,461
My only regret is that Nathan...

484
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:56,447
isn't here to share it with me.

485
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:03,579
I closed the valves on the main line.
That should keep it in the building.

486
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:06,499
But if it went down the drain,
what's to stop it from coming back up?

487
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,538
Well, I think I scared it, actually.

488
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:10,899
I mean, when I came in,
it jumped off Fargo in a hurry.

489
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:13,357
Trust me,
you're not that intimidating.

490
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:16,926
And single-celled microorganisms
don't get scared.

491
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:20,930
It wasn't so micro, and it was green.
Can't be a coincidence.

492
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,907
It might have reacted with the gamma
radiation in big Ed and mutated,

493
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,228
but you know what? I'm not
detecting any radiation signature.

494
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:29,605
Well, that makes it tough to track.

495
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:32,637
Well, maybe instead
of going after it,

496
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,275
we bring it to us.

497
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,279
- With what?
- Bait.

498
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:46,329
Hey, I heard what you did
for the team.

499
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:48,713
Always helping people
wherever you go.

500
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:50,999
Listen, can we talk?

501
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,089
- There's nothing left to say.
- Lexi, why are you pushing me away?

502
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,522
Because there are plenty of people
out there for you to save.

503
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,219
- I'm not one of them.
- I never thought you were.

504
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:03,027
If anything, you saved me.

505
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:06,726
I'm sorry.
I'm late for class.

506
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:07,958
Bye.

507
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:15,745
We can't afford to lose
any more globidium.

508
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,160
What we can't afford
to lose is researchers.

509
00:28:18,285 --> 00:28:20,409
Oh, thanks.
Way to make me look selfish.

510
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,243
What we need
is a sample large enough

511
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,433
to lure spot out before
he finds another food source,

512
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:27,245
- and when he comes out to eat...
- We capture him. Done and done.

513
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,687
Famous last words.

514
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:31,310
You have a better idea?

515
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:33,687
You're pretty sure
of yourself, aren't you?

516
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,629
Part of my Andy Griffith charm.

517
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,132
Oh, my God.

518
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,034
What happened to all my globidium?

519
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,021
Oh, God. I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say that.

520
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:54,773
I think Spot's found
another food source.

521
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:56,197
Come on.

522
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:08,525
We're gonna need a bigger container.

523
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:15,336
- We gotta contain it to Section Five.
- The entire level is locked down.

524
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:18,915
- That won't help if it's traveling.
- At least it's trapped in the building.

525
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,884
For the moment... but you saw that door.
It could pop up anywhere.

526
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:26,263
It gets bigger, it needs more radiation.
We need to secure any potential sources.

527
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,983
I'll start to evacuate.

528
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,811
Well, judging by its size,
it'll eat just about anything.

529
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:36,064
Did you just look at me
when you said that?

530
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,687
I wo... ice cream.
I was looking at the ice cream.

531
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:42,113
Ice. Cold.

532
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,371
When Fargo was in the shower,
he bumped into the faucet.

533
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:46,685
I thought I scared it,
but maybe it doesn't like the cold.

534
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,158
- So what are you proposing?
- That we freeze it in its tracks.

535
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,420
Hey, it's the miracle worker.

536
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:00,631
Thanks so much for taking care of Lucas.
Our prom pictures would have sucked.

537
00:30:01,323 --> 00:30:02,357
My pleasure.

538
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,919
Can I get a large coffee to go?
I've got a long drive ahead of me.

539
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,098
Wait.
You're leaving?

540
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:12,308
Your aunt's made it perfectly
clear she doesn't want me here.

541
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:16,105
So you travel halfway across the world
to see her, and then you just give up?

542
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:18,023
I can't make her talk to me.

543
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:19,733
You can talk to her.

544
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:22,361
I've tried, Zoe. She won't listen.

545
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:23,778
Well, try again.

546
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,740
Look, Carter women are complicated

547
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,930
and stubborn and slightly crazy.

548
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:32,621
But we're definitely
worth the fight.

549
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:35,663
She doesn't want me
to fight anymore, Zoe.

550
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:37,543
So I'm going home.

551
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:40,441
Can I have my coffee, please?

552
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:46,802
Tell her good-bye for me.

553
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,027
Tell her yourself.

554
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:59,500
Temperature gauge...
Homing mechanism...

555
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,818
And I've rigged you a motion detector
so you can track Spot's movement.

556
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,306
- Thank you.
- Are you sure

557
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:07,406
- freezing this thing is gonna work?
- Yeah, it worked in the blob.

558
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:10,130
- Oh, very reassuring.
- It's a living organism.

559
00:31:10,255 --> 00:31:12,703
The cells shouldn't be able to stand
temperatures below 200 kelvin.

560
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,829
Be careful.

561
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:16,707
I should be able to handle
a mindless eating machine.

562
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,683
You looked at me again.

563
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:25,390
The... No, no, I was... the...

564
00:31:26,627 --> 00:31:28,552
- You're pretty.
- Oh, nice save.

565
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:31,252
The blob?

566
00:31:31,377 --> 00:31:33,849
Must have been drawn by the emissions
from the power station.

567
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:36,110
But that emits alpha radiation,
not gamma.

568
00:31:36,235 --> 00:31:38,757
Which means any source of radiation
could be on the menu now.

569
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:39,939
Including us.

570
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:42,003
Awesome.

571
00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:53,035
I'm in.

572
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:56,166
- <i>Now what?</i>
- All right, Jack, watch yourself.

573
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,754
Well, he's not detecting
any movement down there.

574
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:01,585
But the station's alpha emissions
are at 20% and dropping.

575
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,796
Jack, Spot's gotta be there.

576
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:06,818
<i>The relay station's on your left
about 50 meters down.</i>

577
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:07,943
<i>Be careful.</i>

578
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:10,133
Yeah, thanks.

579
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,519
Got a nice frozen treat for ya.

580
00:32:30,553 --> 00:32:31,923
Something's happening.

581
00:32:32,072 --> 00:32:34,354
Movement detected 40 meters away.

582
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,921
Movement is minimal.
Relatively stationary.

583
00:32:37,046 --> 00:32:39,373
<i>Alpha emissions now at 10%.</i>

584
00:32:39,754 --> 00:32:41,917
All right, maybe
it's still working on dinner.

585
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:52,763
<i>It's on the move.
Heading right towards him.</i>

586
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,086
30 meters and closing.

587
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:56,383
- Alpha emissions depleted.
- Talk about a dine and dash.

588
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,308
20 meters.

589
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,438
I don't see it.
Where is it?

590
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:04,267
- 10 meters.
- Jack, just look around.

591
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:07,234
It's gotta be right in front of you.
You should be able to see it.

592
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,710
Or not.

593
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,136
Jack, what's happening?
You okay?

594
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:35,956
<i>Jack, come on.
Say something!</i>

595
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,205
<i>What's going on?</i>

596
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:41,727
Yeah, how do you like me now, huh?

597
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,398
Wait a second.
It's moving away. 10 meters.

598
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:56,557
15 meters.

599
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:58,577
Jack, what's happening?

600
00:34:04,568 --> 00:34:06,210
I think I made it mad.

601
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:08,671
- It's back in the pipes.
- I'm guessing not for long.

602
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,839
So much for your Hollywood ending.

603
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,272
So I was wrong about the cold thing.

604
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:15,552
But Spot jumped off Fargo
for a reason.

605
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,936
Well, maybe it didn't like
the way he tasted.

606
00:34:21,905 --> 00:34:23,936
- That's not bad.
- I have my moments.

607
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,158
Duncan's beauty cream?
I mean, Fargo had it all over him.

608
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:33,154
If it neutralized the gamma radiation
in the guys, it might neutralize Spot.

609
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,140
- So what's in it?
- He used a variety

610
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:38,338
of organic astringents, antioxidants,
anhydrous desiccants.

611
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:40,577
- Anhydro... hy...
- Desiccants.

612
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,664
It's a hydroscopic substance
that induces dryness in its environment.

613
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:45,906
- Like salt!
- Yeah.

614
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:47,334
Or salty things.

615
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:50,647
Your brain is really an enigma.

616
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:52,717
No, but could we use that
to fight Spot?

617
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:54,967
I mean, salt can kill slugs.

618
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:58,470
By dehydration.
So if Spot's physiology is similar,

619
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:01,470
then Duncan's compound
would have the same effect.

620
00:35:01,698 --> 00:35:04,852
Great. We get like a truckload of it
and just flush it and kill it.

621
00:35:05,093 --> 00:35:07,438
I don't know. Freezing it
only affected the outer shell.

622
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:11,017
We need a better delivery system.
Something that'll blast the compound

623
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,317
inside-out.

624
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,362
I think I got some guys
who can help us.

625
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,470
Bringing me behind
enemy lines, deputy?

626
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:18,782
You must really like me.

627
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:21,394
Or I'm just trying to kill you.
Which is it?

628
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,538
- Hey, you're not green anymore.
- But you're still stupid. Go figure.

629
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,471
You guys made this mess.
You can help us fix it.

630
00:35:28,596 --> 00:35:30,287
- What do you want?
- Your camoscope.

631
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:32,599
- Hand it over.
- No can do, Sheriff.

632
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:35,471
- You don't have clearance at Area 51.
- But I do.

633
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,790
Why are you slumming
with these losers?

634
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:40,852
Slumming?
Who do you think you're fooling, Toby?

635
00:35:40,977 --> 00:35:43,098
You applied to transfer here
three times.

636
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:46,119
- Oh, busted!
- Guys, we don't have time for this.

637
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,931
- Hand it over.
- Come on.

638
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:53,125
- Here you go.
- You got Duncan's formula?

639
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,009
Time to put everybody's toys together.
Let's go.

640
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:57,851
- You first.
- Oh, no, after you.

641
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,337
Go!

642
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,267
- Thanks.
- Yeah, I love messing with those guys.

643
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:11,873
What's going on?

644
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,092
That was Spot breaking through the
shut-off valves on the main pipeline.

645
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:19,104
- It's gotten out of the building.
- We gotta figure out where it's going.

646
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:21,916
There are radiation sources
all over town, including the people.

647
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:24,292
Yeah, but globidium's still
his favorite flavor, right?

648
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,248
But everybody's turned it in.

649
00:36:26,373 --> 00:36:27,927
Well, not everybody.

650
00:36:28,114 --> 00:36:29,230
Who's left?

651
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,130
Me.

652
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:35,275
- Zoe, it's me. Are you at the house?
- I'm at Café Diem.

653
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:38,237
Good. Is Lexi with you?
SARAH's not picking up.

654
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:40,467
She got take-out and went home.

655
00:36:40,857 --> 00:36:42,125
<i>Something wrong?</i>

656
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:46,328
I don't think
she'll be dining alone.

657
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:50,698
SARAH, can you get the door?

658
00:37:17,672 --> 00:37:19,236
SARAH, what's going on?

659
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,325
You make me crazy.
You know that?

660
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,324
Come on in.

661
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:29,246
You don't get to just decide everything.
You're not the supreme decider.

662
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,652
Supreme decider?

663
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:33,450
You may have nothing else
to say, all right, but I do.

664
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:35,085
I'm not leaving until you hear it.

665
00:37:36,947 --> 00:37:39,590
I know we didn't plan for this.
I know kids are gonna change things.

666
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,716
Maybe we won't travel for a while.

667
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,345
But when we do, at least we'll see
things through the eyes of our kids.

668
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,261
Honestly, I can't think
of anything better.

669
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:49,698
Okay, you say that now.

670
00:37:49,823 --> 00:37:52,410
But what about in six months
or six years?

671
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:54,930
This isn't a temporary
assignment in Tanzania, Duncan.

672
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:56,940
This is the rest of our lives.

673
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,574
That doesn't scare me.

674
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:03,134
I know I freaked out before, okay?
But you don't have to doubt me now.

675
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:07,409
Okay, it's not that doubted you.
It just...

676
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:09,832
When I was a kid,
I always had the feeling

677
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,749
that my dad would rather
be somewhere else,

678
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:14,449
and I would just hate it
if you ever felt that way.

679
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:16,001
Lexi, I love you.

680
00:38:16,573 --> 00:38:19,838
I want us all to be together.
I know the timing isn't perfect.

681
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:23,934
We're gonna have our problems.
But whatever comes, we'll handle it.

682
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:27,346
You might wanna reconsider.

683
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:30,182
What is that?

684
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:35,103
You know what? Get back!

685
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:38,023
Get out of here!

686
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:39,595
Lexi, go.

687
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:41,649
Go.

688
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,077
This is what it wants.

689
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:51,536
Bowling?

690
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:55,157
No, this is basically a salt center
with a gamma radiation shell.

691
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:57,042
When it loosens, you run.

692
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:03,618
Does Spot want a treat?

693
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,928
There you go.
There you go.

694
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:10,722
There you go. Okay.

695
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,560
Okay, is it loosening?

696
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:19,385
- Get ready.
- It's working!

697
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,325
Go!

698
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,175
Everybody o...

699
00:39:48,065 --> 00:39:49,479
I'll take that as a yes.

700
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,267
Can I take that as a yes?

701
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:57,942
We don't have to live here, do we?

702
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:03,991
I'm good.

703
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:12,257
Perfect.

704
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,120
A seven-ten split.
That's gotta hurt.

705
00:40:15,688 --> 00:40:19,541
And with area 51 in the lead,
Eureka needs the spare in order to win.

706
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,214
The pressure is on.

707
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:23,183
Come on, we can do this!

708
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:26,815
Thought you guys
were already down the road.

709
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,631
- Oh, don't sound so anxious.
- I'm not anxious.

710
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:33,138
- I'm totally gonna miss you, aunt Lex.
- I'm totally gonna miss you too.

711
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,557
And I'm actually
gonna miss you as well.

712
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:39,009
And I'm actually almost touched.

713
00:40:39,134 --> 00:40:40,884
Don't worry,
we'll come back and visit.

714
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:42,204
Well, you better.

715
00:40:43,886 --> 00:40:45,358
Trying to watch a game here.

716
00:40:45,757 --> 00:40:47,888
Fargo, wipe the floor with them!

717
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:31,029
Eureka wins!

718
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:50,298
Well played, Fargo.

719
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:52,843
Big of you to say, Bismark.

720
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:55,981
- Doesn't make us friends, though.
- I'll shake on that.

721
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:04,882
- That's an amazing shot, Fargo.
- Thank you, Sheriff.

722
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,524
Thank you for not playing
any more pranks. I appreciate that.

723
00:42:08,213 --> 00:42:09,444
Well, we won.

724
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,653
We didn't really need
to rub it in their faces.

725
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,202
But we really wanted to.
Gotta run.

726
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,070
I love this town.

727
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:31,323
Any luck identifying
the source of the signal?

728
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,446
We can't get an image.

729
00:42:33,571 --> 00:42:35,385
Our atmospheric window has closed.

730
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:39,514
We'll have no way of knowing
what's coming until it's on top of us.

731
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:42,610
Unless we can figure out
how to decipher the signal?

732
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:45,407
Listen, Tess.

733
00:42:46,005 --> 00:42:47,395
General Mansfield is concerned

734
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,900
that whatever's sending this signal
may not be friendly.

735
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:52,402
He's ordered me to prepare
a defense system.

736
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,014
What?

737
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:55,488
Allison, you can't.

738
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,742
Whatever it is, you could provoke it
or you could scare it off.

739
00:42:59,135 --> 00:43:01,161
I'm afraid that's a risk
that we'll have to take.

740
00:43:01,577 --> 00:43:03,330
We have to be prepared for anything.
