1
00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:01,917
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,340
Say hello to your daughter.

3
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:10,932
Hey, baby.

4
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:15,264
So, Tess, you think you can
handle this place on your own?

5
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:16,862
Me?

6
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:26,859
<i>Don't forget the quarterly reviews
are due this thursday.</i>

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,174
So I'll make sure Fargo
has the proper documentation.

8
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:32,657
<i>With Henry away at NASA, you will be
in charge of the senior staff meeting.</i>

9
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>Watch out for Burke,
because if she starts talking...</i>

10
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,536
We'll be ordering dinner in.
I got it.

11
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,022
<i>Good, good.</i>

12
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:41,832
<i>Don't forget. Make sure that...</i>

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,049
Would you trust me?
I know this is kind of my first day,

14
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:47,421
but I'm thinking
I got everything under control.

15
00:00:47,604 --> 00:00:49,204
<i>Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry.</i>

16
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:55,221
<i>I really appreciate
you filling in for me at GD.</i>

17
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:57,157
GD's gonna be fine.

18
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:58,974
Now, would you go be a mom already?

19
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:01,122
<i>All right. I can take a hint.</i>

20
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:02,881
Bye.

21
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:09,819
Thought you finished your homework.

22
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:12,718
Yeah, I did.
I'm doing college research.

23
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:15,950
But... you're a junior.

24
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:19,036
Which puts me like five years
behind the other kids at Tesla.

25
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,830
- They took the SCAT in grade school.
- The SCAT?

26
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:24,043
The Student Career Assessment Test.

27
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,610
It's supposed to point us
in the right direction.

28
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:28,337
I didn't take it till last week.

29
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:30,297
So, what did it say?

30
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,072
I haven't gotten the results yet.

31
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,078
But after helping Allison with the baby,
I know I just want to be a Doctor.

32
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:39,765
You did really like that.

33
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:42,393
I loved it.

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,896
I hate the thought of you leaving.

35
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:50,389
- <i>I'll always be here, Sheriff Carter.</i>
- Yes. Not the same.

36
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:52,862
Speaking of being alone...

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,541
- How are you and Tess doing?
- Good.

38
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:59,041
Really good.

39
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,614
You know,
if she ever wants to like...

40
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:03,521
Stay over...

41
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,015
Not having this conversation
with my daughter.

42
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,378
Dad, I'm just saying...
life's short.

43
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:14,359
Thank God.

44
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:28,203
You need a hand?

45
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:30,463
It's not really a two-person job.

46
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:32,509
You hate this kind of work.

47
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:33,751
Not today.

48
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:35,553
Zane's coming home.

49
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:37,730
He's been gone a long time.

50
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:38,855
A month.

51
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:42,495
This is getting serious.

52
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,216
It's been a while.

53
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:47,033
I mean, there was Callister.

54
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:49,334
- And, well, he was a...
- A robot.

55
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,422
Then there was Taggart,
and, well, he's...

56
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,547
Taggart.

57
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,342
I mean, I'm not used to the...

58
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:00,616
Normal relationship thing.

59
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,266
So what about you and Tess?

60
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,711
Have you guys exchanged keys yet?

61
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:14,395
Why is everybody
asking me that today?

62
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,989
So, what are we doing
on the mountain service road?

63
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:22,414
I need a straight shot
for some transport headed to GD.

64
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:26,355
Traffic duty with no traffic.

65
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,360
Feels kind of silly.

66
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:47,771
Maybe not so silly.

67
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:59,115
That's a really big truck.

68
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:10,545
Why the face?

69
00:04:11,355 --> 00:04:13,405
I'm just confronting my future.

70
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,839
You got your test results?
Cool! What did they say?

71
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,708
I'm too afraid to open the email.

72
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,719
Why?
The SCAT is, like, 99.8% accurate.

73
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,138
That's the point. This could tell me
what kind of medicine I'm cut out for.

74
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:27,933
You know, I was thinking ob-gyn,
but pediatrics could be cool.

75
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:29,602
This'll help you decide.

76
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:33,494
Okay. I can't click it.

77
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,053
What?

78
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:40,447
Robotics engineering?

79
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,355
Look at those data points!

80
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,701
It's a perfect aptitude
match for you.

81
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:46,992
Very cool.

82
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:49,805
No, that's not cool.
That's totally not what I want to do.

83
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,630
It's just a stupid test.

84
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:52,750
Order up.

85
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:11,352
I've got a welcome home
present for you.

86
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:19,559
You okay?

87
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:21,178
I'm fine.

88
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:24,946
Let's try this again.

89
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:29,433
I've got a lot of work to do.

90
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:42,967
Things seem pretty quiet.
Why are you calling me down here?

91
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:46,112
Things are pretty quiet.
I need you to keep them that way.

92
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:49,248
- I need your help with some security.
- Security for what?

93
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:51,897
We got a very special
delivery today.

94
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:59,475
What exactly is this delivery?

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,354
It's about 750,000 years...

96
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:04,571
Give or take a few millennia.

97
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:09,307
Pretty impressive, huh?

98
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:15,163
You need security...

99
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,160
for a giant icicle?

100
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:18,848
It's an ice core.

101
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:22,119
The longest one ever recovered.

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,092
A GD team just drilled it
out of the Arctic sheet.

103
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:28,885
You see, snow has been falling
in the arctic for millennia.

104
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:31,432
And this core
is a record of each year,

105
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,769
layer by layer by layer,
stretching all the way back into time.

106
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,522
And that's valuable why?

107
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:42,499
Snow traps things as it freezes...

108
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,496
Spores, bits of volcanic ash.

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,866
So we can actually see
what the atmosphere looked like

110
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,798
thousands and thousands
of years ago.

111
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,454
Kind of cool
when you think about it.

112
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:55,789
Not the temperature kind, but the...

113
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,586
- I should go do something.
- Bye, Fargo.

114
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,952
Okay, look.
You see each of these bands?

115
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:06,050
Each one of them represents
up to 10,000 years.

116
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,468
Like tree rings.

117
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,610
Exactly!
And all of human history...

118
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:14,032
Takes up about this much
of the core.

119
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,503
Kind of makes you feel insignificant,
doesn't it?

120
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:20,689
Like we just don't have
as much time as we think we do.

121
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:24,965
So, uh, we should probably
make the most of it then, huh?

122
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,229
I'd say so.

123
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:32,159
Maybe dinner at my place...
Just you and me?

124
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,907
Yeah, that sounds...
Oh, no... I can't.

125
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:37,414
It's my first day covering for Allison.
I have so much to do.

126
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,583
But soon, okay?

127
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:40,793
Sure, sure.

128
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,881
So this is the first time we've had
an intact core to study in the lab.

129
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,801
Zane developed a nanoparticle
refrigeration system

130
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,878
just to get this thing down here.

131
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,471
That guy is the king of cold.

132
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:54,348
Tell me about it.

133
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,475
So, security?

134
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:59,002
The team leader will fill you in
on what he needs.

135
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:00,646
He should be here any minute.

136
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,901
The Iceman Cometh.

137
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:20,451
Good day.

138
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,094
Projet-SG (1.00)

139
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,477
Grand to have
the old team back together!

140
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:43,689
Jo. Good to see ya.

141
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:44,815
You too.

142
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:47,276
I'm assuming
you all know each other?

143
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:50,702
Eureka was my home for a spell.

144
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,999
I did some fine zoological
work in these parts...

145
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:55,075
And it hasn't been
the same without you.

146
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,410
Where you been?

147
00:08:57,488 --> 00:08:59,253
Ambled from Melbourne to Minsk.

148
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:02,875
I was doing a polar bear count
when I heard about the ice core project.

149
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:06,253
Couldn't turn down a chance
to study primordial life, now, could I?

150
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,256
Well, you never know
where a walkabout's gonna lead ya...

151
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:12,092
Sometimes you end up
right back where you started.

152
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:14,761
Not so bad, eh?

153
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:16,768
Morning, Doc.

154
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:19,587
Your fridge has still got
some temperature fluctuations.

155
00:09:19,712 --> 00:09:21,852
- I'll take a look.
- Aren't you freezing?

156
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:26,174
- Petrotech.
- Who-tech?

157
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,442
He's wearing petrotech.
It's a reactive thermal barrier.

158
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,153
Best cold weather insulation
in the world.

159
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,677
All of GD is insulated with it,
along with every building in town.

160
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:38,619
Making cloth out of it is
an incredibly expensive process.

161
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:40,084
Waste of time.

162
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,296
Men of the Arctic
should respect the Arctic ways.

163
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:47,419
Everything I'm wearing
I killed and skinned myself!

164
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:49,254
Right down to my walrus skivvies...

165
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,256
We'll take your word for that.

166
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:53,769
Not to worry.

167
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:57,262
Just a bit of international business

168
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,940
that needs attending to.

169
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,041
Our drilling camp
was on Russian ice.

170
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,716
They're sending over
a commissar-type to sign off

171
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:06,841
before we can start
experimenting on the core.

172
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:07,894
I'll do it.

173
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,858
Welcome home.

174
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,590
So what's the story
with Jo and Taggart?

175
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,278
They dated for a while.
I know that seems hard to imagine.

176
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:23,580
Not really.
Attraction's a funny thing.

177
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:25,415
Excuse me.

178
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,959
Sir, hello.
Welcome.

179
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,041
You are in charge.
Dr. Blake, correct?

180
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,636
No, I'm actually Dr. Fontana.
Dr. Blake is currently on leave.

181
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,259
Substitute.
Wonderful.

182
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:38,916
But, I see you do not take time
to personally greet out of town guests.

183
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,778
I apologize about that.

184
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,730
Sheriff Carter,
this is Captain Yuri Gregor.

185
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:46,215
Captain and chief security officer
for northern district.

186
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,715
Good to meet you, Captain.

187
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,939
You have papers.

188
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:52,109
Yes. Yes, I do.
Just need your John Hancock.

189
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,965
Your signature, sir.

190
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,445
And then you can be on your way,
and we can begin our research.

191
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,337
- We're very eager to start.
- I'm sure.

192
00:10:58,462 --> 00:11:00,307
But this ice is
important piece of history,

193
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:02,868
so I need to be sure
that she is safe in your care.

194
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,249
Well, Captain, I can assure you
here at Global Dynamics...

195
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,936
I need facts, Doctor,
not your sweet-eyed assurances.

196
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,796
Sheriff, you will verify this list
for security information.

197
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:18,897
This'll take a while.

198
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:22,279
It is required before
we turn over this ice to you.

199
00:11:22,404 --> 00:11:25,976
No checklist, no John Woodcock.

200
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:30,439
Months with no daylight at all.

201
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:35,089
The only sound is the keening wind

202
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:37,639
as it scours the ice,

203
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:39,898
looking to punish a man

204
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:42,591
for the least mistake.

205
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:45,250
They say...

206
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:47,914
the North changes you.

207
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,058
Keeps a part of your soul.

208
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:53,193
The man who returns...

209
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,633
He's not the man who left.

210
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:05,378
'Scuse me, mates.

211
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,936
Here you go, kid.
I'll be back in a jiff.

212
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:21,901
We haven't had yet a chance to talk.

213
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:26,051
But even when we did, we didn't.

214
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,807
You left town without
even saying good-bye.

215
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,446
Two years ago.

216
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,900
I didn't think you wanted
a good-bye from me.

217
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:38,387
You and Zane were already
well on your way

218
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:40,915
to becoming a happy little couple.

219
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:43,939
I guess we were.

220
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:48,141
He's... an odd fellow,

221
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:50,364
if you don't mind me saying.

222
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,425
Moody type.

223
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:58,688
Chatty at first, but after a while
he turned downright...

224
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,239
icy.

225
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,851
My audience awaits.

226
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,278
It is good to see you again, Jo.

227
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,261
Fargo. Hat.

228
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,826
Now... where were we?

229
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,773
What you just saw...
between Taggart and me...

230
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:40,493
That wasn't romantic or anything.

231
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:46,327
Well, you know that, right?

232
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:50,539
Don't worry about it.

233
00:14:02,464 --> 00:14:03,758
Somebody looks tense.

234
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,510
What's the matter?

235
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:10,150
Captain Yuri has me going through
Eureka's library of disaster plans.

236
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:12,934
I mean, tsunami, missile attack.

237
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:18,021
Genetically modified
super-intelligent ferret infestation.

238
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,274
Cool.

239
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,281
And apparently we have

240
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:26,155
an emergency pneumatic vacuum
tube communication system.

241
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:28,710
No, we don't!

242
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:32,296
I mean, what's it behind
some picture in some wall?

243
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,164
And I mean, look at these plans...

244
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:41,713
Yeah, but... I mean...

245
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,466
Doesn't actually work, right?

246
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,179
Wait... that's...

247
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,326
that'll be really handy if we ever
need to send anyone a baseball.

248
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:02,912
You okay?

249
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:09,740
Zane...

250
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:14,376
He's just...
He's being so cold.

251
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:20,162
Think after a couple
of weeks with Taggart...

252
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:23,381
anyone would need
a little alone time.

253
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,574
Just try to be patient.

254
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:52,865
Captain Yuri!

255
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,213
Everything you asked for.

256
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:59,227
I reviewed disaster plans
from 15 years,

257
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:02,011
and we are prepared
for every possibility.

258
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,211
Could you maybe... a hand...

259
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,080
This is for you.

260
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:09,085
Oh, this...

261
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:10,844
This is very excellent.

262
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:14,472
Thank you. Great.
So... I don't mean to be rude...

263
00:16:14,718 --> 00:16:17,892
Where is my manners?
Please, you must have pastry!

264
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:21,524
I was down
in your beautiful commissary.

265
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,318
There was such selection!

266
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,334
I overindulge.

267
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:29,071
That is good.

268
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,275
With all due respect, sir,

269
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,704
a lot of people are eager
to get working on the core,

270
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:38,099
- so if we could sign?
- Of course.

271
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:41,024
There's just one more thing
our bureau of standards requires...

272
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:43,585
Precise measurement
of ice core itself.

273
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,883
I'm sure Taggart's
come up with some sort

274
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:48,773
of super-accurate
laser measurement thing.

275
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:49,822
No doubt!

276
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,729
But men like us...

277
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,337
We do not trust
this kind of technology.

278
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,368
- Sure.
- We are, how you say...

279
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,051
old-school.

280
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,509
There's way more ice in here
than there was before.

281
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:29,576
Now I know
you're around here somewhere.

282
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,898
Can I get some help in here?

283
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,387
I've never experienced
anything like it!

284
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:52,664
One minute, I was standing there
measuring the density of the core.

285
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,990
The next minute...
it was upon me.

286
00:17:56,537 --> 00:17:57,492
What was?

287
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,459
The ice!

288
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:02,580
Like some icy anaconda.

289
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,905
Dr. Taggart, the thing is,
ice doesn't really attack.

290
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,253
Maybe it's a malfunction
in the cooling unit.

291
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,522
Well, nanoparticle refrigeration
is an incredibly new technology.

292
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:18,112
It could be interlopers
of a more mythical nature.

293
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:20,974
Spirits of the North.

294
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,090
I'm gonna call Zane
about those cooling units.

295
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,899
I'm telling you, Jack.

296
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,208
There are strange things
under the midnight sun!

297
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,585
But before we go looking for yetis,

298
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,782
we're gonna check out
the refrigeration machine

299
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:40,030
- and the ice itself.
- Right.

300
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:42,074
Right.

301
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:45,744
The ice is everywhere.

302
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:47,877
It's even growing up the walls.

303
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,501
That's weird.

304
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:05,508
You ever seen ice
with black streaks in it before?

305
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:12,025
Then again, I've never paid
that much attention to ice before.

306
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:17,822
I got you a present.

307
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:25,108
- Robotics kit.
- A college-level robotics kit.

308
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:26,645
Pretty neat.

309
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:28,541
Right?

310
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:32,708
I already told you
I'm not interested in this.

311
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,589
Have you ever even tried robotics?

312
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,648
No. I don't have to. I mean,
I already know what I wanna do,

313
00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:40,330
regardless of what
that dumb test says.

314
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:41,846
Yeah, this week you do.

315
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:44,160
I'm just saying...

316
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,644
I just don't want you to miss out on
something that you might really love.

317
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:56,522
Who else was in here around
the time you found Taggart?

318
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,436
As far as I know, only Zane.

319
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:01,275
He's the one that designed
this cooling system, right?

320
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,785
I figure one of these things
probably just went haywire.

321
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:05,165
They're fine.

322
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:09,170
I checked them. Twice.

323
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,418
Okay. Any ideas?

324
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:16,297
Whatever happened in here
has nothing to do with my equipment.

325
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,217
Excuse me, but I've got work to do.

326
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,785
Hey, Carter.

327
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,245
Hey, Henry. How's NASA?

328
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:35,441
- It must have been nice to get out...
- Afternoon.

329
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:40,465
- How you feeling?
- Tip-top, thank you.

330
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:44,925
Amazing what the body can achieve
with a couple hours in a hot bath.

331
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:48,023
Good.
I was worried about you.

332
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,865
More of the same, I guess. But...

333
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:56,095
About before...

334
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,798
I was wrong...

335
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:00,884
to leave town...

336
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,303
without saying goodbye.

337
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,765
To leave things between us
unsettled.

338
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:10,955
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:12,915
Me too.

340
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,608
It's important to me
that you and I remain friends.

341
00:21:18,515 --> 00:21:21,070
I wouldn't want to lose you
from my life.

342
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,175
- Hey, look, I gotta go...
- Me neither.

343
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:28,695
Back on your feet, I see.

344
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:30,415
And on the case.

345
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:33,865
I checked out
all the refrigeration units.

346
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:37,285
Yeah, they're fine.
All operating at 100% capacity.

347
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:40,040
I don't know
if that's good news or bad.

348
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,915
I did find something interesting
in that bit of ice you gave me.

349
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:45,785
Those black streaks...

350
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,085
Malformed ice crystals.

351
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:50,953
Evidence of incredibly fast growth.

352
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,105
Fast enough to grab a man?

353
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,335
Ask me tomorrow.

354
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:58,925
Wait!

355
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:00,725
Why tomorrow?

356
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,625
The ice...

357
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,095
is still spreading.

358
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:10,954
What did the defrost crew do
with all that ice from the core lab?

359
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:14,624
Section Three refrigerated storage,
waiting for analysis. Why?

360
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,627
Taggart said that the ice isn't normal.
It grows fast.

361
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:22,090
I don't know the credence you can give
to a guy who wears a beaver on his head.

362
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:27,252
He's really good at what he does,
and he says that the ice contains...

363
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:30,098
black maladjusted crystals.

364
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:33,017
- What does that mean?
- It means that it's spreading.

365
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:36,045
That's impossible.
It's just regular ice.

366
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:39,975
Or not.

367
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:43,987
Oh, my God.

368
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:04,298
So Dr. Fontana, I have gift.

369
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:06,968
Scarf for you.

370
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,250
- Cashmere, to keep you warm.
- Thank you.

371
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,575
And for you...

372
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,058
Is beer hat!

373
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,860
Thank you!

374
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:20,320
Captain, we want to assure you
and your government that we are doing...

375
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:22,817
everything we can to help.

376
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:26,446
I have instituted a level four lockdown
to control the spreading of the ice.

377
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:29,741
We would like to sample the core
to make sure that it wasn't damaged.

378
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:32,784
So sir, if you could just
sign these papers...

379
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:34,245
Are you joking me?

380
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:38,819
I can't sign papers till I've confidence
you can protect core, and right now...

381
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:40,605
is no confidence.

382
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:44,422
- Captain...
- I must go.

383
00:23:44,785 --> 00:23:46,735
I have tee time at mini golf.

384
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,695
Somehow, I don't think
he really wants to leave.

385
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:54,682
One day.

386
00:23:55,265 --> 00:23:57,380
One day, and I've caused an ice age

387
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,713
and started
an international incident.

388
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,147
Yeah, it's like the cold war
all over again.

389
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:05,145
It's fine.

390
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:08,046
We'll figure out what's happening.

391
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:09,925
You promise?

392
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:15,565
I know just the man for the job.

393
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,997
So... Progress report?

394
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:21,290
We're not gonna be able to contain it
till we know what's causing it.

395
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:23,953
Well, considering we've only known
about this for a few hours,

396
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:25,766
I'd say we're making great strides.

397
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:28,541
The only thing making strides
is this ice.

398
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,410
If you choose to focus
on the negative...

399
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:34,110
Oh, there's a positive?
What's the positive?

400
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:36,224
The elevator shafts
are filling with ice.

401
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:39,380
I'm using iridium blowtorches
to melt frozen doors

402
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:41,970
because my scientists
are trapped inside section three,

403
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:44,649
so I would love to hear
something positive.

404
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:47,325
Righty-o!

405
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:50,885
I think we're good.

406
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:55,705
This ice just grows back
as quickly as we can melt it.

407
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:58,980
Everyone is working on this.
Everyone is talking with everyone.

408
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:01,305
But we still can't find an answer.

409
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:06,587
Maybe the person who's not talking
is the person with the answer.

410
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:14,762
Artificial intelligence?
Yeah, right.

411
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,713
- Did you check the power converter?
- Yeah, I checked it.

412
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:19,690
This is why I like people
instead of machines.

413
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:21,690
People don't have power converters.

414
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:24,465
Actually,
the human digestive system of...

415
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,191
Forget it.

416
00:25:29,335 --> 00:25:31,154
Why do you care about this so much?

417
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:34,282
I think you could really
enjoy robotics, that's all.

418
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:37,415
Well, it's been a ton of fun so far.

419
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:41,372
And there are some amazing
college programs around.

420
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:45,515
Like MIT?

421
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:49,530
They have one of the best
robotics programs in the country, so...

422
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:50,855
Yeah, they do.

423
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:53,009
And they don't have
a medical school.

424
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:59,515
- We could go together.
- That's not the reason.

425
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,727
That's not the only reason.

426
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,520
I really think
you could be great at this.

427
00:26:05,645 --> 00:26:08,845
The test is right, like,
99.8% of the time. Remember?

428
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:11,319
Okay. I'll just check
the converter again.

429
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,750
- Can we ask you a few questions?
- I'm kind of busy.

430
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,078
We need to know
what you figured out about the ice.

431
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:25,333
Nothing.
I thought Taggart was working on it.

432
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:28,745
Well, everyone's working on it.
We don't seem to be getting anywhere.

433
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:33,240
And you don't seem to be
as worried as everyone else.

434
00:26:33,365 --> 00:26:36,202
It's not my problem.
I'm concerned with maintaining

435
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:38,420
the integrity of the core
through temperature control.

436
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:41,224
- So far so good.
- Have you seen the rotunda?

437
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:45,335
And again, that doesn't affect
my responsibilities.

438
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,020
What the hell is going on?

439
00:26:47,145 --> 00:26:50,895
You go away for a month,
and you come back acting like the thing.

440
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:53,778
What's going on with you?

441
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:56,175
I'm fine.

442
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:01,822
He's not fine.

443
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:06,835
That's not him.

444
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,084
He's different.

445
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:10,155
Something's going on.

446
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,927
Look at the coffee.

447
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,485
- I don't care about...
- It's frozen solid!

448
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,522
He's so cold.

449
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,875
How is he?

450
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:46,695
Not bad.

451
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:50,911
Considering we literally found
ice crystals growing inside of him.

452
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,380
Is he gonna make it?

453
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:58,718
We were able to melt the ice deposits
using an ultrasonic patch.

454
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:01,637
But if it's anything like the ice
that's been around GD...

455
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,848
It's gonna grow back
as quick as you can melt it.

456
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,970
Well, the patch will help him
for a little while.

457
00:28:07,095 --> 00:28:08,145
But then...

458
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,160
Could it be the ice
that was making him act so strangely?

459
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:14,685
Yeah, we think so.

460
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:18,080
The black crystalline structure
is present throughout his body,

461
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:21,781
including tiny concentrations
in the limbic area of his brain

462
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:23,326
which controls emotions.

463
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,621
This ice is all over GD.
If it can infect people...

464
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:30,624
No, it isn't contagious.
We've already done preliminary scans.

465
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,192
Okay, so why Zane?

466
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:39,045
Honestly, Jack, I have no idea.

467
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:43,900
I've got teams tearing apart
those refrigeration units.

468
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:46,891
The answer has got to be somewhere
in those nanoparticle drivers.

469
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:49,415
Maybe not.

470
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,523
What?

471
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:57,109
What if it's what's in
the refrigerator?

472
00:28:57,815 --> 00:28:58,815
The core?

473
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,741
- There you are, you little bugger!
- You found something?

474
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:08,037
- <i>Dikarya basidiomycota</i>.
- Di-di-what?

475
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:09,935
Fungi.

476
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:13,290
Looks like we dug up
a little stone age hitchhiker.

477
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:15,595
Basidiomycota couldn't spread
like this on its own.

478
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,560
Something must be affecting it.

479
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,465
Agreed.
I'll drill out a little sample.

480
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:21,940
I'm sorry. I cannot allow this.

481
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,190
'cause the ice
is still Russian territory.

482
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:27,272
No, captain, we have to analyze
this organism, please.

483
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:31,257
I'm not satisfied with your procedures.
I could not possibly sign paper yet.

484
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:33,064
I mean, this place is like madhouse.

485
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,233
Stop pretending this is about security.
It's about shopping.

486
00:29:37,805 --> 00:29:39,130
What? Is crazy person!

487
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:42,760
The captain is an important man.
He's in charge of the Northern district.

488
00:29:42,885 --> 00:29:46,117
- He didn't come here to shop, Jack.
- But if you sign, you're headed home.

489
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:49,395
No scarves, no beer hats,
no fancy pastries.

490
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:51,685
Nothing.

491
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:57,770
Do you know
what Northern district is?

492
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:01,205
Nothing but ice, snow,
and more ice, for miles!

493
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:03,926
Our one town
is tiny research station.

494
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,297
Do you have any idea
what it's like to be security officer

495
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:08,572
in town full of crazy scientists?

496
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,625
Actually...

497
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:13,095
I do.

498
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:19,733
We need that signature or the whole
West coast is gonna be covered in ice.

499
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:21,652
Of course, I sign papers.

500
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:24,238
Great. Let's get a piece
of this ice into the lab right now.

501
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,322
On it.

502
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,744
Why is it that every guy I date
ends up in this infirmary?

503
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,038
'Cause you're bad luck, obviously.

504
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:37,168
A joke at my expense.
Glad to have you back.

505
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:46,165
About that, I'm sorry.

506
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:50,285
I'm sorry.

507
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,174
I should never have
suspected you of...

508
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:54,449
Suspected me?

509
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:56,545
Of what?

510
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:00,865
Taggart got frozen, and I...

511
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:04,625
And he and I used to...

512
00:31:05,485 --> 00:31:06,655
Well, you know...

513
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:08,535
Really?

514
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:11,285
You thought I loved you that much.

515
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:18,209
You know, after the way I acted,
I would have suspected me too.

516
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:22,645
So, what's the prognosis?

517
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:26,967
You're gonna be fine.

518
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:33,716
As soon as they figure out
why ice with black lines in it

519
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:36,441
is growing all over GD
and inside of you.

520
00:31:36,835 --> 00:31:37,935
Black lines.

521
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:40,275
You mean striations.

522
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:42,655
Yeah, I guess.

523
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:47,404
I came across something about that,
during research for my cooling units.

524
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:50,199
- Is Taggart working in the core lab?
- Yeah, but...

525
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,267
- I need to help him.
- No!

526
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:56,435
You need to stay here
and get better.

527
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:59,495
Jo, I'm not going to get better.

528
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:04,559
Not unless I help that crazy australian
find out what's happening around here.

529
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:06,335
It's my only chance.

530
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:09,975
Have you seen my pants?

531
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:17,215
- I thought maybe you could use a hand.
- That I could.

532
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:19,175
You up to it?

533
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:21,965
So use me while you can.

534
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,732
How's it going?

535
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:25,585
That good, huh?

536
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:27,845
What's that?

537
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:29,435
It's her first day.

538
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:32,465
Trying to keep her
in a positive frame of mind.

539
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:36,662
- That's nice of you. Is it working?
- Yeah. I think so.

540
00:32:36,975 --> 00:32:39,460
- We are so screwed.
- Come on.

541
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,109
You got two of the greatest minds at GD
working on it.

542
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:45,546
One of whom is about to become an ice
sculpture if we don't figure this out.

543
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,650
We still don't know why Zane
was affected but Taggart wasn't.

544
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:50,275
Jack, we're nowhere.

545
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:55,055
Did you think the job
was gonna be easy?

546
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,585
You got a chill?

547
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,776
We can't have you freezing to death
before we come up with a way

548
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:15,117
to prevent you from freezing to death,
can we, mate?

549
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:19,965
- Chivalry isn't dead.
- Yeah, but the coat is.

550
00:33:20,553 --> 00:33:22,700
Guess petrotech isn't as great
as everyone thinks.

551
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:24,900
No, that's just the ice crystals.

552
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:27,625
It's making him cold
from the inside out.

553
00:33:27,885 --> 00:33:30,135
Even petrotech can't keep him warm.

554
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:32,595
Wait.

555
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,495
The difference between
Zane and Taggart...

556
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,115
is the petrotech.

557
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,217
You nailed it.
The regenerative insulation in petrotech

558
00:33:42,342 --> 00:33:44,198
is like the sheaths
around the fungus spores.

559
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:48,067
The petrotech is like a fertilizer,
and the fungus is, well, like a fungus.

560
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,249
Well, the ice is using the petrotech
as a base to spread everywhere...

561
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:54,774
It's started to compromise
the integrity of the building.

562
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:59,161
- Good news, then, right?
- Good news?

563
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:03,035
The building is about to fall down.
I broke a building!

564
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:08,035
But the ice doesn't have
anyplace left to go.

565
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,260
We got this polar bear cornered.

566
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:12,841
- Maybe not.
- Maybe not what?

567
00:34:13,115 --> 00:34:15,070
Fargo said the entire town
was made of petrotech.

568
00:34:15,195 --> 00:34:17,033
It's bonded into the walls,
the windows,

569
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:19,223
even in the roads
to keep them from icing over.

570
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,100
Roads?
I don't like the sound of that.

571
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,228
<i>Dad, something weird
is happening here.</i>

572
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:25,915
We can't get out.

573
00:34:26,235 --> 00:34:27,606
And it's freezing.

574
00:34:28,415 --> 00:34:29,765
We're in trouble.

575
00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:44,490
How are you feeling?

576
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,876
Ever heard of brain freeze?
Try that times about a thousand.

577
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:49,503
Good and bad news.

578
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,005
We've isolated the fungus
and figured out a way to kill it.

579
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:56,073
But the bad news is the bug is showing
the first signs of mutation.

580
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,990
It's a natural process,

581
00:34:58,115 --> 00:35:01,217
but we let it get a few more generations
down the road,

582
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,760
and our fix won't work.

583
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,186
That mutation means an unstoppable
worldwide ice age in a matter of days.

584
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,354
We're gonna stop this bug now.

585
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:11,010
The modified fungicide
might kill it.

586
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:13,677
It's getting at it that's the problem.
We can't spray it from the air.

587
00:35:13,802 --> 00:35:16,430
The fix needs to literally
get inside every wall in town.

588
00:35:16,555 --> 00:35:18,866
Now you know why I had you
looking at emergency plans.

589
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,884
Was there not one for this?

590
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,790
Will the emergency communication system
be able to reach everyone?

591
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,835
According to this, the network leads
from here to every building in town.

592
00:35:32,545 --> 00:35:35,869
The tubes go into the walls
where the petrotech is, right?

593
00:35:35,994 --> 00:35:37,954
We create a aerosol version
of the fungicide

594
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,029
and pump the cure all over GD
and then the town.

595
00:35:44,385 --> 00:35:47,066
- You're a genius.
- Well, not so much.

596
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:50,541
We'll need to build a pump
with exactly the right kind of pressure.

597
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:52,930
Yeah, before the building falls.

598
00:35:53,055 --> 00:35:55,819
I'll run an algorithm to figure out
how to disperse the fungicide.

599
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,196
I'll go to Cafe Diem.

600
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,511
The roads are all iced over.
You'll never make it.

601
00:35:59,636 --> 00:36:02,236
I might be able
to lend a hand with that.

602
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:07,995
Just like old times, hey?

603
00:36:09,105 --> 00:36:11,126
I hate old times!

604
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,860
Damn it!

605
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,885
Why did I waste my butane
on creme brulée?

606
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,098
Zoe, can you see if there's
any more cartridges in the back, please?

607
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,145
Sure.

608
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:26,905
We're gonna be okay.

609
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:28,555
We're gonna be okay.

610
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:33,045
Vincent will get us out.

611
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,140
No, he won't.

612
00:36:35,265 --> 00:36:37,694
The ice is growing faster
than he can cut through it.

613
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:40,005
Your dad is coming, right?

614
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:43,301
The temperature's dropping 15 degrees
every ten minutes.

615
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:46,036
I mean, we'll freeze to death
before anyone gets here.

616
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,871
Death?

617
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:50,675
Death!

618
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:01,885
GD wasn't built for this.

619
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:05,347
I hate to be Chicken Little,
but the sky might actually fall in here.

620
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:10,675
Start a backup.
Open up the vents on system branch B.

621
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:17,406
- How many buildings in town is that?
- Maybe half.

622
00:37:17,531 --> 00:37:18,610
We're getting there.

623
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:27,165
Iridium laser blowtorch.
A man's best friend.

624
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:30,595
Crikey!

625
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,915
Must be 30 below in here.

626
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:35,425
Where is everybody?

627
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:37,705
Think they found a way out?

628
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:43,549
Maybe they found themselves a toasty
corner to wait for the cavalry, huh?

629
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:46,755
Toasty corner...

630
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:56,648
Dad!

631
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:57,975
You okay?

632
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:03,196
Staying warm in the walk-in fridge.
Downright brilliant!

633
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,489
It was Zoe's idea.

634
00:38:04,735 --> 00:38:06,930
- Everyone else was freaking out.
- That's my girl.

635
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:08,755
Yeah, frozen girl. Hugs.

636
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:10,555
Wait, wait.

637
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,655
What is that noise?

638
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:15,959
Sounds like a gas leak.

639
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:19,755
Vince, where's your emergency pneumatic
vacuum tube communication system thingy?

640
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:23,175
There's a wall panel,
but it's frozen.

641
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:25,195
It's just over here.

642
00:38:27,935 --> 00:38:29,035
Right there.

643
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:47,325
It's working.

644
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:49,565
Get along, you fungi!

645
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:13,295
So glad you're feeling better.

646
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,270
Your hands are still freezing.

647
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:18,095
I ordered you a soup and a hot tea.

648
00:39:21,715 --> 00:39:23,068
I really missed you.

649
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:34,893
Looks like things have warmed up
around here.

650
00:39:39,325 --> 00:39:42,254
I'm sorry for the way
I was acting the last few weeks.

651
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:44,840
No worries.
You weren't yourself, that's all.

652
00:39:45,265 --> 00:39:47,300
Yeah, well, thanks
for bringing me back.

653
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,185
My pleasure, mate.

654
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,847
Worth it to see this one
smiling again.

655
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:56,210
Ready to get back to work?

656
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:59,315
We've only got a few centuries
of history to defrost and study.

657
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,040
What do you say, mate?

658
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:06,310
You'll have to get started
without me.

659
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:08,835
I think I owe someone
a proper hello.

660
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,785
You got it to work!

661
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,770
A little solder here,
some logic circuit rewiring there.

662
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:28,710
You're right.
I do have a knack for this.

663
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:31,285
Forget it.
You're going to med school.

664
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:36,209
That's what you thought you should do
before I gave you stupid advice.

665
00:40:37,095 --> 00:40:39,495
I mean,
that was just my gut feeling.

666
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:43,815
- I didn't think...
- Like getting in a fridge to stay warm?

667
00:40:44,105 --> 00:40:47,277
Your gut feeling saved everyone
in this place, including me.

668
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:52,495
- What about the test?
- Forget the test.

669
00:40:52,695 --> 00:40:55,590
I'm even gonna help Dr. Deacon
with a space data project

670
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:57,245
that isn't about physics.

671
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:01,291
So I guess
the test isn't so accurate.

672
00:41:02,145 --> 00:41:03,390
Sure it is, but...

673
00:41:03,515 --> 00:41:07,339
I've always known you were different
than 99.8% of everyone anyway.

674
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:22,395
That was delicious.

675
00:41:23,055 --> 00:41:24,664
- Thank you.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

676
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:26,900
SARAH, you can take the night off.

677
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:29,609
<i>Would you like to hear my selection
of after-dinner cordials?</i>

678
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:32,581
No, thank you. We're good.
So, good night.

679
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:36,175
Sorry.

680
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:38,665
I should go.

681
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:41,293
- I still have a lot of work to do.
- Sure.

682
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,542
Was that okay?
Did you like everything?

683
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,167
I'm good. Thank you.

684
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:47,964
But let's do this again soon,

685
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,939
you know, when things get
a little less crazy.

686
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:06,965
Not looking. Not looking.
Just passing through.

687
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,220
- Where you going?
- Pilar's.

688
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:15,695
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- Zoe, you don't have to leave.

689
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:17,525
You two kids have fun.

690
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:26,360
I guess you have
to get back to work.

691
00:42:26,485 --> 00:42:27,885
I probably should.

692
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:43,735
Or work can wait till tomorrow.
