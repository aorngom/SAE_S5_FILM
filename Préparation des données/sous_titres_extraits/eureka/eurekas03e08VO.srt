1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:01,659
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka...

2
00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:03,965
Come on, Josephina,
don't go all serious on me now.

3
00:00:04,387 --> 00:00:05,208
Too late.

4
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:07,641
Thorne dug up
an old bomb-testing facility?

5
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:09,803
- What's down there anyway?
- Nothing for long,

6
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:11,398
she ordered a thermal cleaning.

7
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:13,579
She redacted all the photos
of Eureka's founders.

8
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,951
- Oh, my God, are those...
- Bodies?

9
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:17,854
History has a way of haunting you.

10
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:21,577
This is part of mine, and I'm putting it
to rest, so you stay outta my way.

11
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:30,813
So...

12
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:32,957
Party at Pilar's tonight?

13
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:35,124
Doubtful.
My morning shift felt like a double.

14
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,454
In fact, I'm about as energetic
as this dish rag.

15
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:39,841
Which is why you need some fun.

16
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,405
Get up.

17
00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:55,216
I'll just... I will just sit here
till you are finished.

18
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,605
Why do dads ruin everything?

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,760
'Cause they're men,
and men are ruiners.

20
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:06,569
Zane drama?

21
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:10,907
Fear.
Okay, never date a coward.

22
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:14,983
I put myself out there,
commitment-wise,

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,950
and he froze.

24
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:22,145
- We haven't talked since.
- Well, here's your chance.

25
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:25,946
Hey, Jo.

26
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:31,219
You... eat yet?

27
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:36,307
I thought maybe we could,
you know, we could have a bite.

28
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:37,503
A bite.

29
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:40,525
Well, we wouldn't want you
to commit to a whole meal.

30
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:43,273
- You got something to say?
- I already did.

31
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:45,489
And you couldn't handle it.

32
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:50,075
Hi, ruiner.

33
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:54,334
You know, if we're ever gonna find out
why Thorne moved those bodies,

34
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,814
- we'll have to search the bunker.
- Stopping a thermal cleaning

35
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,217
didn't slow her down.
She's pulled in an outside contractor.

36
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,324
What kind of outside contractor?

37
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:02,959
I'm not sure.
His name is Hendrix.

38
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,015
He's set himself up in a trailer near
the bunker. That's all I could find out.

39
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:09,023
But I know he has something to do
with what she's trying to hide.

40
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:10,893
And she's moving those bodies.

41
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:13,417
We have to autopsy those bodies
in order to discover

42
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:16,640
- their cause of death and ID.
- ID'ing them is gonna be difficult.

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,123
She's redacted every personnel record
and photo from 1939,

44
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:21,853
even the ones
that were on that wall.

45
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:26,453
Why would anybody want photos
of scientists and founders of Eureka?

46
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:29,828
Yeah, I mean, somebody on that wall's
gotta be part of the answer.

47
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:32,706
Well, we're never gonna know
without those photos.

48
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:35,699
Or a... photo of a photo.
Hey, Vince.

49
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:39,245
Remember the day of the speeches?
You took photos in front of that wall.

50
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:41,968
Yeah, you mean the ones
where I look like sasquatch?

51
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:43,974
- Yes! Those are the ones.
- Thanks.

52
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,172
I think Fargo has them.

53
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:50,579
Great. Okay.
I'll talk to Fargo.

54
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,221
Jo'll check on Thorne's guy.

55
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:54,139
And, Allison,
we have to have those bodies.

56
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,030
Okay.

57
00:02:57,296 --> 00:03:00,578
All right, Dr. Hendrix,
you sure you have enough material?

58
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:02,769
Trust me, Miss Thorne.
I'm very good at what I do.

59
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:04,854
That's why I called you in.

60
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:07,398
- How long before everything's in place?
- As long as it takes.

61
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,776
This bunker is massive, and you don't
wanna make a mistake with this stuff.

62
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:13,201
Fine, but we need this
completed as soon as possible.

63
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,576
I'll be happy to give you
any help you need.

64
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,867
This is a delicate operation.
I would prefer to do it myself.

65
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:20,161
We only have one shot.

66
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,163
Take it quickly.

67
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:32,940
Dr. Hendrix, it's the police.
I need to speak with you.

68
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:40,077
Thanks, Carter.
That was pointless.

69
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,752
Found you.

70
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:43,978
How'd you get here?

71
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:45,854
I rode my bike.

72
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:49,941
And so you know, this passive-aggressive
thing is really annoying.

73
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:52,610
You wanna try just aggressive?

74
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:54,764
No.

75
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:56,203
Not really.

76
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:58,116
I didn't think so.
See ya.

77
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:04,163
Could you come here for a second?

78
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:07,709
Why? So you can hit me with that?

79
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,753
Well, not until you tell me
what it is first.

80
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:13,576
Please?

81
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,601
Anodized aluminum with a trap valve.

82
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:26,508
Okay.

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
And that means...

84
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:30,716
It's a pressurized container
of some kind.

85
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:33,061
It's got a remote trigger.

86
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:34,387
For what?

87
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:37,126
To set it off at a distance.

88
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,704
You wouldn't want to be
anywhere near this when it went off.

89
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:45,279
You could pack a hell of a lot
of something in a device like this.

90
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:51,490
How much could you pack
in about a thousand of them?

91
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,767
Some of us actually work
for a living, you know.

92
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:09,203
Yeah, I didn't wanna do this
on the GD system.

93
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:10,604
You owe me a lunch hour.

94
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:14,096
And you mind turning around?
I have some personal photos on here.

95
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:15,446
Oh, yeah, sure.

96
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,268
All right, let's see.

97
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,947
Not it.

98
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,966
Not it.

99
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:22,761
Not it.

100
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,620
- Definitely not it.
- That's a good one.

101
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,206
What about personal
don't you understand?

102
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:32,072
All right.
Okay, here we go.

103
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:35,145
Great. Can you zoom in
on the photos in the background?

104
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:36,547
Not on this dinosaur.

105
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:40,326
And since I can't do it at GD, I'll have
to do it when I get home later tonight.

106
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:41,895
Fargo, this is important.

107
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,525
You're gonna have to go home now.

108
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:46,464
Dr. Blake won't like me
bending the rules like this.

109
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:48,945
Ah, you'd...
be surprised.

110
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:54,769
Oh, great.

111
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,276
Ms. Thorne wanted me to double check
the delivery address on the shipment

112
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,034
from the morgue.

113
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:02,511
One sec.

114
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:04,871
Great. Thanks.

115
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:13,138
I'll never make fun of aunt Lexi again.
I feel like I'm pregnant with twins.

116
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:15,453
Oh, don't ever say the "p" word
in front of your dad.

117
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,683
He'll lock me up
and throw away the key.

118
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:19,577
I feel like he's always watching me.

119
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:22,947
If I weren't so tired,
I'd tell you stop being so paranoid.

120
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:26,863
<i>Unidentified intruder.</i>

121
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:28,724
See? Always watching.

122
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:30,518
<i>Initiating detention procedure.</i>

http://projet-sg.net

126
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,298
SARAH, turn off security right now.

127
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,798
<i>I can't, Sheriff. The intruder
is an imposter, not Zoe Carter.</i>

128
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,592
Zoe and I walked in
and SARAH went insane.

129
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:05,844
<i>Because the unidentified
intruder is not Zoe.</i>

130
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:08,806
System off!

131
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,643
<i>Manual override engaged.</i>

132
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:18,172
- Honey, you okay?
- I think so.

133
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,733
Did you set a trap for Lucas?

134
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:22,153
No. There's just something wrong
with SARAH.

135
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,048
Yeah, what's wrong is living
in a house that can taser you.

136
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:28,326
No, she didn't hurt me.
I just got really dizzy.

137
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:31,360
- You should go to the infirmary.
- No, dad, really, I'm fine.

138
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,916
I've just been run down.
It's no big deal.

139
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,047
Is SARAH dead?

140
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:40,253
No, we just powered her down.

141
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:42,006
Fargo's gonna run
a full system check.

142
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:44,618
And Zoe and I are gonna go to Café Diem
till he figures out

143
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:45,885
why she turned on us.

144
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,171
Okay.
You sure you're okay?

145
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,474
- You sure you didn't zap my boyfriend?
- She's fine.

146
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:05,232
Nice job getting
those bodies out of GD.

147
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,823
You know Eva's gonna be
able to track your ID off that scanner.

148
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,645
Which is why we need to hurry.

149
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:12,428
All right, let's find out
about our friends.

150
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,250
You all right?

151
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:21,796
Since when are you
the squeamish sort?

152
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm not, I'm just...

153
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:25,024
I'm just worn out.

154
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:28,094
Really, I'm fine.
Let's just get started.

155
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,837
That one's almost empty,
but I was able to analyze

156
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,483
the leakage around the nozzle.

157
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,047
It's some kind of cement.

158
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,980
Well, so you know what Hendrix
is doing with about a thousand of 'em?

159
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,859
No idea.
Why don't you ask him?

160
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,237
While you're at it,
find out why it has a remote trigger.

161
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:53,226
There's also a manual release.

162
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:55,163
I see that.

163
00:08:58,978 --> 00:08:59,978
I'm stuck.

164
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:01,788
Yeah. We're stuck.

165
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:03,851
Together.

166
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:09,344
- I'll find Hendrix.
- Thank you.

167
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,621
Perfect.

168
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:30,282
Busy day?

169
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:34,049
Yeah, yeah.
There's not much time to talk.

170
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,206
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Oh, Sheriff Carter.

171
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,357
I thought access down here from
the highway was supposed to be blocked.

172
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:44,003
Yeah, I had to take
the scenic route.

173
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:46,609
Okay. Is there something
I can help you with, Sheriff?

174
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:48,841
Well, it's just
that I don't know you,

175
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:50,918
and you've...
you've closed down a road,

176
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:54,958
and you've got a ton
of this freakish instant cement, so...

177
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:57,683
This is an authorized
military operation.

178
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:01,617
Yes, I know, authorized by Eva Thorne.
I know.

179
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,775
Look, you seem like a really nice guy,
but I can't tell you anything.

180
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:09,070
- Fair enough.
- How 'bout I tell you things then?

181
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,364
There's an abandoned
underground facility.

182
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:16,148
You're loading in about a thousand
canisters of that stuff,

183
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:19,068
and all with America's sweetheart
behind it.

184
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:23,182
You're very perceptive.
She's a piece of work, that one.

185
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:26,837
But I think she's gonna take
a few pieces outta me

186
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:29,479
- if I tell you what I'm doing.
- Okay.

187
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:33,135
Could you tell me
when you're gonna be done doin' it?

188
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:34,939
When is the road gonna be clear?

189
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:37,223
I think we'll be done
end of work day tomorrow.

190
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,900
Great. Thanks.

191
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,838
Oh... one more thing.

192
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:47,032
What if someone made
the very understandable mistake

193
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:49,193
of opening one of the canisters...

194
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:52,250
And then someone else got their feet

195
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,276
caught in your super goo?

196
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:55,950
It's called Instantanium.

197
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:58,927
It's a nano-polymer syntactic foam.

198
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,185
You know what that means?

199
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,001
Well, no.
But how do we get 'em out?

200
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:07,295
You get a saw.

201
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:12,385
- Great. So you can just cut through it.
- No. You cut through their legs.

202
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:19,040
Yes.

203
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:23,936
Son of a...

204
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,810
Don't you look at me
in that tone of voice.

205
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,928
- This isn't my fault.
- Okay.

206
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:34,822
Dr. Bonehead's lab.

207
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,533
Let me guess...
you two are still stuck together.

208
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:40,197
Just till I can reach my gun.

209
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:43,563
What'd you find out from Hendrix?

210
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:47,127
It's called Instantanium,
some sort of hardening foam.

211
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:49,282
No... nano...

212
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,215
lastic foam.

213
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,215
<i>- Nano-polymer syntactic foam?</i>
- Yes!

214
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:55,085
What, wow?

215
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:58,054
Nanoparticles are bound together
at a molecular level.

216
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,640
Did Hendrix have any idea
how to get out of it?

217
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,908
One, but you're not gonna want
to try it.

218
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,840
I've slept in tee-pees,
huts, yurts...

219
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,778
I'd take a bed of nails right now.

220
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,837
Okay, I know why I'm tired.
I'm sleeping for the boys.

221
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:18,331
What's your excuse?

222
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:21,902
I think I'm coming down with something.
Every bone in my body aches.

223
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:23,584
Is this what it feels like to be 30?

224
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:26,419
Okay, I'll forgive you
for that in 15 years.

225
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:28,751
You do look a little pale.

226
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:33,589
Smart house is up and running.
Everything's fine.

227
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:35,715
For the house that occasionally
takes you hostage?

228
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:39,428
Honest mistake. Zoe's DNA didn't match
the sample on SARAH's database.

229
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,722
It's not like I went out and changed it.

230
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:43,641
Well, maybe it was a memory glitch.

231
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:46,435
Either way, I reset her,
and it won't happen again.

232
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:48,437
- So we get to sleep in real beds now?
- Yep.

233
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:50,811
- With real pillows?
- You're all set for the house.

234
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:53,067
And tell your dad it took me
a while to enhance them,

235
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:56,220
but I am a photoshop God,
so I got those old pictures he wanted.

236
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,848
I love old pictures.

237
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:00,847
The Sheriff was interested
in which ones?

238
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:03,848
- The ones on the wall...
- Of my grandfather's house.

239
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:07,787
He has this one with Mickey Mantle, and
I promised I'd get it restored, so...

240
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:09,041
Thanks, Fargo.

241
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:11,669
- I'll pick 'em up later.
- Okeydokey.

242
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:15,713
- So can I buy you some ice cream?
- I'm pressed for time now.

243
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,649
Oh, you're checking on
that Hendrix guy down in the bunker.

244
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,218
That's a big job you gave him.

245
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,089
- Classified.
- That's what he said.

246
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,809
He said it's some part
of some big military project.

247
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,066
- That's right.
- I checked with Mansfield, and he said

248
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:30,020
- that it isn't a big military project.
- You spoke to the General?

249
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,906
He doesn't take my calls, but I used
your name, and he picked right up.

250
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:34,650
It was awesome.
I hope you don't mind.

251
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,456
I mind just about everything you do,

252
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:39,460
especially when you stick your nose
into somebody else's business.

253
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,249
Well, dead bodies
are always my business.

254
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,588
The General says hi,

255
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,163
and he can't wait to be briefed
about the underground facility.

256
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:50,665
- Seems he didn't know a thing about it.
- Well, apparently, he does now.

257
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:51,979
Yeah.

258
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:57,756
I'm just looking for the truth.

259
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:01,031
Sometimes the truth
needs to be left alone.

260
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:05,097
But you've made that impossible now,
haven't you, Sheriff?

261
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:09,586
Yes, I have.

262
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,063
- Henry, tell me you found something.
- Yeah, I found something all right.

263
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:25,034
These men did not die
of natural causes.

264
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,508
Awesome!

265
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:28,570
- Not for them...
- Definitely not for them.

266
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,874
Their death was accelerated brutally.
Rapid aging.

267
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,635
Every cell in their body

268
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:36,376
went through an entire life cycle
in a compressed period of time.

269
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:39,423
Something was introduced to their system
that killed them in a month.

270
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:42,132
- You think they were poisoned?
- Could be. I don't know.

271
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:45,179
I'm trying to identify
the elemental base of the pathogen.

272
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:47,705
It's something
I've never seen before.

273
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:51,519
Look at that...
40 to 90 in a month.

274
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:53,573
Now, does that look natural to you?

275
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,815
If you can prove that they didn't die
of natural causes, I can investigate.

276
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,860
And if I can investigate, then I can
stop Thorne from sealing the bunker.

277
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:03,127
- I can try.
- All right.

278
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:09,119
God, what if I have to go
to the bathroom?

279
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:13,326
Why do you think I'm working so fast?
I had four cups of coffee this morning.

280
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,941
This isn't so bad.

281
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,839
Hey, guys.
You got a china pattern yet?

282
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,222
No, hold on.
I need Jo for a second.

283
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:26,260
I'm kinda busy right now,
and that means that...

284
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,450
My job is less important than yours?

285
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,133
Well, that depends.
Can you do it with one leg?

286
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,607
Good times.

287
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,731
<i>I have an array of exotic flavors
for you to choose from.</i>

288
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:44,816
<i>I chose them specifically
based on the regions you've traveled.</i>

289
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:47,635
The fact that a house can actually try
to suck up to me

290
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:51,120
is almost as disturbing
as a house taking my niece hostage.

291
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:54,822
<i>I'm still indicating
that her DNA has changed.</i>

292
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:56,000
Aunt Lexi?

293
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:59,305
Great. Just when she's finally
getting some sleep. Yeah?

294
00:15:59,636 --> 00:16:00,450
Here.

295
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:02,948
Aunt Lexi, are you there?

296
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:04,960
Yeah, I'm right here.

297
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,844
Are you okay?

298
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,221
There's something wrong
with my eyes.

299
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,688
I can't see.

300
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:17,564
All clear.
No one left inside.

301
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:18,460
Good.

302
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:23,198
You really know how to work a man.

303
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:24,692
So I've been told.

304
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:26,243
Everything set?

305
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,325
This place will be
an instantanium fortress...

306
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:31,578
Every entrance
5 feet thick with the stuff.

307
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:34,509
Now, the facility itself
will stay clear like you asked.

308
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,069
With you rushing me, though,
I can't promise a smooth detonation.

309
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:39,410
Meaning?

310
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:43,255
Look, an underground job like this
needs to be calibrated precisely

311
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,966
so the geological foundation
of the place isn't disturbed.

312
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:48,989
Now moving the operation
a day up on me...

313
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:51,632
You might feel a few little quakes.

314
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:54,956
You sure it'll be impossible
to reopen once it's triggered?

315
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,334
Nothing breaks my Instantanium.

316
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:00,926
Thank you, Dr. Hendrix.
I'll take it from here.

317
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:04,442
- Well, you're not going back in there.
- I have a few things to take care of.

318
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:07,044
Okay, but once this goes,

319
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:10,183
anything still in there
is never gettin' out.

320
00:17:16,064 --> 00:17:19,591
If Hendrix seals the facility
before we get a warrant, we're screwed.

321
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:22,076
It's a big place.
There's gotta be a weak spot.

322
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:23,420
... can I just get my...

323
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,608
... so if we find out
where it is and protect it...

324
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:27,675
- We can get in later.
- Can we just...

325
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,444
Okay, take a closer look
right over here, right?

326
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:32,841
There's an air shaft just there.

327
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,009
I think it goes down
to the second level.

328
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:36,161
Cataracts...

329
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:38,519
easy to get rid of nowadays

330
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,897
especially with our prototype.
She's gonna be as good as new.

331
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:46,193
You're gonna be able
to see again soon.

332
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:48,256
- How did this happen?
- SARAH's lasers.

333
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:50,696
Really bad for the eyes.
Can I talk to you for a second?

334
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,055
Sure. Sure.

335
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:58,415
It wasn't lasers, Henry.

336
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,645
You get cataracts when you're old,
not when you're 17.

337
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:02,501
Yes.

338
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:07,259
Tell me it doesn't have anything to do
with how those three men died.

339
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,592
SARAH was right.
Zoe's DNA has changed.

340
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:13,991
Every cell in her body
is beginning to age rapidly.

341
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:15,900
Now, if she has the same thing
as those men,

342
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,820
there's one place
she could have gotten it.

343
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,518
- The bunker.
- Yes.

344
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:21,866
Okay...

345
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:28,193
She hurt her ankle when she was there.
She slipped in some purple liquid.

346
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:30,070
- Could that be it?
- I need a sample.

347
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,950
I'll get you a sample.
You stay?

348
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,652
Sure, listen, GD's done a lot of work
on arresting cell degeneration.

349
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:38,704
I've even put a team together.
So try not to worry.

350
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:39,914
Yeah.

351
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:43,239
- That picture...
- Not now.

352
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,328
No, no, you need to see this.

353
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:53,260
That's impossible.

354
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:56,638
Well, sometimes impossible
answers a lot of questions.

355
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,321
Don't... touch
the pretty metal canisters.

356
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,280
Sheriff? You need
to get out of here now.

357
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:56,768
Sure.

358
00:19:58,294 --> 00:20:01,160
- If you tell me what's going on.
- What?

359
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:04,621
That stuff you're trying to hide...
it killed those three men,

360
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,459
- and now Zoe's been exposed.
- That's not possible.

361
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,629
She slipped in it when she was lost
down here. Now it's changed her DNA.

362
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:13,166
My God.

363
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,105
If that's true, we've gotta get
out of here as fast as we can.

364
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:18,887
Nice... try.

365
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:23,171
But I spoke to Hendrix. He's not sealing
this place until tomorrow.

366
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:26,728
No, no! You called Mansfield.
I had it accelerated.

367
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:29,513
We've gotta get to the air shaft!

368
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,997
That was our only way out.

369
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:48,126
Crap.

370
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,722
So you knew this was gonna happen.

371
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,055
Why are you down here?

372
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:05,981
I wanted to end it.
All of it.

373
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:08,478
Including me.

374
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:14,693
I should have done it a long time ago,
but I didn't have the courage.

375
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:20,737
What are you talking about?

376
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:21,992
Courage to...

377
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,358
What?
To... to...

378
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:27,303
Courage...

379
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,375
To cover up how those men died.

380
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:33,503
Yeah.

381
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:37,331
- What did you do to them?
- I didn't do anything to them.

382
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:40,330
They died 70 years ago.
I wasn't even born.

383
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,357
Well...

384
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:45,641
Try again.

385
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,228
This is one of the pictures
you took out of Café Diem...

386
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,045
That's you.

387
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:57,986
You were here in 1939

388
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:00,302
with them.

389
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:04,933
I was.

390
00:22:07,987 --> 00:22:10,909
But I didn't hurt them.
I just couldn't help them.

391
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:13,960
So...

392
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,952
I'm 107 years old.

393
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:22,219
Why didn't you die like them?

394
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:26,431
I don't know.
I'm the only one.

395
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,801
Well, now you have a chance to fix this.
I mean, Zoe's not lucky like you.

396
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,869
She's like them, and she's gonna suffer
unless you tell me everything you know!

397
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:35,440
I know, but we're stuck here.

398
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:37,651
Well, I'm not dead yet,
and neither are you.

399
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:39,403
So we're gonna find a way.

400
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:41,720
We're not letting Zoe die.

401
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:48,237
Here ya go.

402
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:50,737
Good eats in this town.

403
00:22:50,857 --> 00:22:53,695
Glad you think so.
You'll be staying a while longer.

404
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:07,083
We set off the first
atomic bomb here.

405
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:09,048
No, first atomic bomb was...

406
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:10,360
Los Alamos?

407
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,456
They learned from our mistakes
and went with plutonium.

408
00:23:14,283 --> 00:23:17,607
We used a rare element found
only in certain meteorites.

409
00:23:18,284 --> 00:23:20,153
The first test was flawless.

410
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:22,380
But it created a certain...

411
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:25,282
unique by-product
in the blast chamber.

412
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,369
The purple stuff. The...
the stuff Henry couldn't identify.

413
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:30,989
Element x.

414
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:35,000
They asked the team to study it.
There were only four of us exposed.

415
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:37,919
But nobody knew its effects
until it was too late.

416
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:38,788
So...

417
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,631
why did they age and you didn't?

418
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:44,576
DNA hadn't even been discovered yet.

419
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:48,258
But Jimmy knew that, genetically,
I was one in a million.

420
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,973
Sorry. Jimmy is...

421
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,861
Perkins.
He was the team leader.

422
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,145
Along with Blackman and Ross.

423
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,732
- And you.
- Well, I was a lab assistant.

424
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:01,483
The best a girl could hope for
in those days.

425
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,864
But Jimmy insisted
that I keep my exposure a secret...

426
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:08,236
- I wouldn't have to do what they did.
- Bury themselves down here.

427
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:10,675
Yes. They locked it all away.

428
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:12,788
The element.
The whole project.

429
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,113
And they were so close to a cure.

430
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:17,984
- How do you know that?
- I read their paperwork.

431
00:24:18,476 --> 00:24:22,453
They worked on it every day
for the rest of their lives.

432
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,757
28 days.

433
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:29,721
28 days?

434
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:35,289
Zoe was exposed to this stuff
seven days ago.

435
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:37,956
This place is amazing.

436
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:41,938
You got the right dissolving chain here,
but you're gonna need francium 227AC,

437
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:44,377
and there's less
than an ounce of that on Earth.

438
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:46,894
Yeah, except for the stash
here at GD.

439
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,767
You're kidding, right?

440
00:24:50,668 --> 00:24:51,741
I'll order it up.

441
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:54,702
But we'll only be able
to make up a few milligrams.

442
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,593
We're getting a series
of small earthquakes

443
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:00,112
around the underground facility.
Any idea why?

444
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,548
Hey, I told her that would happen
if she rushed the job.

445
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,571
- You mean you've already sealed it?
- Yeah, about an hour ago.

446
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:08,168
Oh, Carter...

447
00:25:11,024 --> 00:25:13,059
I put all their papers in here.

448
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:15,767
- What am I looking for?
- Notes, papers, journals.

449
00:25:16,086 --> 00:25:18,103
Anything that can help Henry
save Zoe.

450
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:21,736
Hitler was already marching
across europe.

451
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:24,563
Imagine if he'd gotten his hands
on our bomb research.

452
00:25:25,642 --> 00:25:28,039
Oh, there'd be Volkswagens
everywhere.

453
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:31,533
So why come back?
Why not just keep it all hidden?

454
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:34,494
I tried to move on, have a life.

455
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:37,414
But things changed for women.

456
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,374
I made something of myself.

457
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:41,876
Fate catches up with you...

458
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:43,736
no matter how far you run.

459
00:25:43,957 --> 00:25:47,048
I did so well, I became the best person
for the job at GD.

460
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:50,677
I've spent a lifetime
trying to forget this place.

461
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:53,388
I needed to know.

462
00:25:56,502 --> 00:25:58,643
Because your name isn't Eva Thorne.

463
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,566
It's Mary Perkins.

464
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:10,113
Jimmy was my brother.

465
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:17,192
If I had known that Zoe would
have found her way down here,

466
00:26:17,312 --> 00:26:19,612
I never would have opened
this place up again.

467
00:26:19,732 --> 00:26:21,917
Don't worry about it.
We're gonna help her.

468
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:24,981
Well, even if we find the cure,
we can't get out of here.

469
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:27,569
Well, you believed in your team.

470
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,107
I believe in mine.

471
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:32,177
So next step,
we need some of that liquid.

472
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:36,514
Well, there's a storage pool
in the cooling chamber.

473
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:38,856
- Great.
- Follow me.

474
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,871
This solvent might work.

475
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:45,988
Just FYI... there's a chance
of a slight explosion.

476
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:47,488
No, wait... Explosion?

477
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:48,608
Just do it.

478
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,423
- Thank God!
- Oh, look, it worked. You're free!

479
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,048
Yes, in another five minutes,
I would have chewed off my own leg!

480
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:14,052
Your mouth is probably big enough.

481
00:27:14,952 --> 00:27:17,806
- How much longer, Fargo?
- The bunker's computers are 70.

482
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:20,423
It's like teaching Lincoln
how to use an iPhone.

483
00:27:20,543 --> 00:27:22,852
Get us a signal down there.
We need to know if Carter's okay.

484
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:24,794
Easier said than done.

485
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:26,730
How's Zoe?

486
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:29,015
Tired, but stable.

487
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:32,817
I was able to identify the DNA marker
that that purple element affects.

488
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,923
I just need more of it
so that I can test a reversal process.

489
00:27:37,043 --> 00:27:40,357
There's gonna come a point of no return,
her body won't be able to bounce back

490
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:43,174
from whatever aging
she's already experienced.

491
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:45,859
Henry, listen,
I have been feeling exhausted,

492
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:48,044
not your normal kind of tired.

493
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:51,131
- I was down there, too, you know.
- Well, then, I want you tested.

494
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:58,930
This room would have been buried
if you hadn't cut the wire.

495
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:01,141
Yeah. What is all this stuff anyway?

496
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,055
It was too dangerous
to enter the cooling chamber.

497
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:07,234
So we had a video system installed

498
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,987
to monitor the liquid level.

499
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:12,493
We were working with atom bombs
for the first time,

500
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:16,236
so we didn't want the radiation
to seep into the groundwater.

501
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:18,287
Is this the storage pool?

502
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:19,307
Yes.

503
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:27,027
It looks like the Instantanium's has
cracked the base of the storage pool.

504
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:30,211
It's leaking out.

505
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:34,231
If it reaches the groundwater and gets
into the Eureka drinking system...

506
00:28:34,354 --> 00:28:37,093
Eureka's gonna get
very old... very fast.

507
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:42,726
Even if we do make it out of here,

508
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,804
Henry doesn't have any purple stuff
to make a cure.

509
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,562
We need to save your daughter.

510
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:51,359
Yes.

511
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:53,785
We do.

512
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:06,218
I've had this for a long time.

513
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:09,620
My brother thought
I might need it one day.

514
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,218
Zoe needs it more.

515
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:29,479
What about you?

516
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:34,257
I'd rather save somebody now
than hold onto it for a lifetime.

517
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,157
We have to figure out
how to get it outta here.

518
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:47,594
Look, I know this was a rush job,
but I did seal the entire facility.

519
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,391
Well, every fortified
position has its weak point.

520
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:53,354
I'm thinking yours is down
at the bottom of that ventilation shaft.

521
00:29:53,474 --> 00:29:55,806
You might know that,
but how does Carter know that?

522
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:57,548
We looked at the same schematic.

523
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,129
When two people really know each other,
then they're in sync,

524
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:02,982
- and when they're partners...
- I get it.

525
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:04,693
Could you just drive the car, please?

526
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:07,788
I can't believe this shaft
was here the whole time.

527
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:11,683
Yeah, labeled on every map
as a capped well.

528
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:26,695
- Why are we still in this room?
- I think it's our best bet.

529
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,123
No offense, Sheriff,

530
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:33,339
but nobody has any idea
what's going on down here.

531
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:35,314
Lupo and I looked at the same plans.

532
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:39,382
We identified the same weak points,
and this was the weakest.

533
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:42,819
That's why you tried to clear
all the canisters in this room.

534
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:45,185
Yeah, but I missed one.

535
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:49,363
And now there's only one thing
between us and the air shaft.

536
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:54,033
One canister or not,
that material's invulnerable.

537
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,694
So everyone keeps telling me.

538
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:03,972
Do you...
hear something?

539
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:15,519
Good afternoon!

540
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:18,671
My name is Joe Lupo,
and I'll be saving your ass today.

541
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:21,341
Someone oughta promote you.

542
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:39,522
So how is she?

543
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:41,702
She's hanging in there.

544
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:43,654
Henry's pulled up
half the departments at GD.

545
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:46,115
- And Eva's doing everything she can.
- Great.

546
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:49,911
The solution that Henry's working on...
we're all gonna need it soon.

547
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,005
So it made it into the groundwater?

548
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,922
Our monitors registered contamination

549
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:56,167
in over a million acre-feet
of the aquifer.

550
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,532
You're lucky you don't have a boss.

551
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:01,122
Otherwise, he'd come down here,
he'd kick your...

552
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:02,394
Allison Blake.

553
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:06,995
- Where is she?
- Eva Thorne is currently

554
00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:10,352
aiding Dr. Deacon in trying to get
a dangerous situation under control.

555
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,621
You said eva Thorne
is the dangerous situation

556
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:15,385
with bodies, and underground facilities,
and cover-ups.

557
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,124
Yeah, sir, the situation
has changed since I called you.

558
00:32:18,244 --> 00:32:19,971
Yes. It's gotten worse.

559
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:23,386
You've allowed a breach of security
in a deactivated facility

560
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:26,198
turn into a potential
town-wide catastrophe.

561
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,017
General, Sheriff Carter is in no way
responsible for this situation.

562
00:32:29,137 --> 00:32:31,660
No, Thorne is.
I want you to arrest her.

563
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,814
Sir, it's imperative
the testing of Thorne continue.

564
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:36,040
Well, you can test her
after she's been arraigned.

565
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,617
Sir, on a personal note,

566
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:41,451
my daughter was exposed
to whatever stuff that is down there,

567
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:43,148
and the testing can help her.

568
00:32:43,268 --> 00:32:44,826
But we have to do it now.

569
00:32:46,386 --> 00:32:47,323
All right.

570
00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:50,006
When this is over,
Thorne belongs to me.

571
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,371
Thank you.

572
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,534
We're hoping to create
a counter-reaction

573
00:32:54,654 --> 00:32:56,667
using non-baryogenic radiation

574
00:32:56,787 --> 00:33:00,231
to counter the baryogenic radiation
that she was exposed to.

575
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:03,901
It's... like using x-rays
to treat cancer.

576
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:07,947
It'll work.
It has to.

577
00:33:08,574 --> 00:33:09,517
Well...

578
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,537
we'll know in a few hours.

579
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:15,514
If it does work, how long will it take
you to make enough for the whole town?

580
00:33:15,634 --> 00:33:16,634
I can't.

581
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:22,332
It took all of Thorne's sample
just to make enough for Zoe.

582
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:25,659
I know my brother would have
been working right up to the end

583
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,856
trying to find a way
to neutralize the element.

584
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:31,702
All I can find here are designs
for some kind of a bomb... a big bomb.

585
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:34,138
They spent their last days
working on a doomsday weapon?

586
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:36,262
Not my brother.
He was looking for a solution.

587
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,454
Maybe the bomb was the solution.

588
00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:41,676
Does it say anywhere
that the bomb created a lot of non...

589
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,927
- bary...
- Non-baryogenic radiation?

590
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:45,478
- Yes.
- Yeah,

591
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:48,224
they were talking 20, 30 kilotons.

592
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:51,165
That's enough to irradiate
ten square miles.

593
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:52,641
Could that fix the town?

594
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:55,787
A range like that would certainly reach
the aquifer. I mean, it might work.

595
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:59,327
Sure, if they actually built the thing.
It doesn't say how far they got.

596
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:02,794
Well, they had a month.
They wouldn't have wasted the time.

597
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:20,144
Sure this is the right room?

598
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:23,898
The only peak on our particle scan
is located 12 feet directly behind you.

599
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,831
Signal's hot.
I think I'm close.

600
00:34:39,062 --> 00:34:41,332
- Is there anything down there?
- Yep.

601
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:43,969
A really big bomb.

602
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:46,462
- <i>So how far did they get?</i>
- Pretty far.

603
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:50,527
Time to finish what they started.

604
00:34:52,697 --> 00:34:55,264
<i>Give me a couple hours
and I'll let you know.</i>

605
00:34:58,385 --> 00:35:01,950
All right, baby, all you have to do
is neutralize a radioactive water table

606
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,849
and we are good.

607
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,013
The bomb's primed and ready to go.

608
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,628
It's hot-wired into the timing circuits
down here.

609
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:21,020
- <i>Great work, Zane.</i>
- That wasn't me.

610
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,451
It was all Jimmy.

611
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:25,267
It's set up so you can start
the countdown remotely.

612
00:35:25,387 --> 00:35:26,972
<i>As soon as you're clear.</i>

613
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:28,932
Okay.

614
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,424
Just got one more thing to do.

615
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:47,825
We've evacuated the area
above the facility.

616
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,359
You sure there's enough Instantanium
to handle a nuclear blast?

617
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:52,825
'Cause if it shatters,
all the force will go up, not down.

618
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,264
- It'll never reach the aquifer.
- But it will reach us.

619
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:57,783
Look, I told you
I double-covered that area.

620
00:35:57,903 --> 00:35:59,788
Your little firecracker
won't even make a dent.

621
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,543
It's fascinating, you know.
You've created a problem so big

622
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,888
the solution is to detonate
an atomic bomb.

623
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:07,132
I know, right?
How cool is that?

624
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:15,382
Should I...

625
00:36:15,981 --> 00:36:17,338
come with you guys?

626
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:22,492
<i>Automated countdown sequence
initiated.</i>

627
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:25,297
<i>Detonation in...</i>

628
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:26,384
<i>Ten...</i>

629
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:28,370
<i>Nine...</i>

630
00:36:29,257 --> 00:36:30,089
<i>Eight...</i>

631
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,425
<i>Seven...</i>

632
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:34,379
<i>Six...</i>

633
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,197
<i>Five...</i>

634
00:36:37,525 --> 00:36:38,368
<i>Four...</i>

635
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,481
<i>Three...</i>

636
00:36:41,384 --> 00:36:42,286
<i>Two...</i>

637
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:44,257
<i>One...</i>

638
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,237
<i>Zero.</i>

639
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:50,187
The sensor's into the water table.

640
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,740
It'll take a few seconds
to get the reading.

641
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,166
And let us know
if we're all gonna die.

642
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,546
Pretty much.

643
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:01,639
- Well, no matter how it turns out...
- It's been a fun day.

644
00:37:02,171 --> 00:37:03,693
Yeah. Yeah.

645
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:05,810
Yeah, I guess it was.

646
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:11,148
Oh, nice to end the relationship
on a high note.

647
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:17,438
So what's the verdict?

648
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:22,092
The explosion's completely neutralized
the baryogenic radiation in the aquifer.

649
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:23,812
The groundwater's safe.

650
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:25,454
Well, good for us.

651
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:27,807
I...

652
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:30,252
I should... call Allison.

653
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:31,335
Yeah.

654
00:37:32,994 --> 00:37:34,046
After that call,

655
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:37,288
if you... maybe wanna go for a...

656
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,343
you know, break-up dinner?

657
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:41,382
No.

658
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:47,591
How'bout a...
a make-up dinner instead?

659
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:02,089
Guess it's not so bad
being stuck together.

660
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,052
Allison Blake, please.

661
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:25,032
I'm really glad I came to stay here.

662
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:28,618
And I'm glad uncle Jack
is gonna be around for the boys.

663
00:38:29,871 --> 00:38:30,871
Me too.

664
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:35,614
If you guys hug, I know I'm dead.

665
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:37,306
Well...

666
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:39,946
hi, lazy.
How you feeling?

667
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:42,927
17, I hope.

668
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,900
Well, we have that Thorne lady
to thank for that.

669
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:04,053
I came here thinking
I couldn't trust anyone.

670
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,267
Boy, was I wrong.

671
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,446
- I wish I could have done more.
- You made sure that nobody

672
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:12,140
would have to go through what my brother
went through... that's enough.

673
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,063
And I still wanna work
on a cure for you.

674
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,941
It worked for Zoe.
That's what's important.

675
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:20,849
And I can leave here thinking
about my future instead of my past.

676
00:39:21,746 --> 00:39:22,938
That's quite a gift.

677
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:25,116
- Where will you go?
- I'm quite a resourceful gal.

678
00:39:26,618 --> 00:39:29,161
Whoever I become next,
I'll be well taken care of.

679
00:39:31,523 --> 00:39:32,744
Good-bye, Henry.

680
00:39:43,403 --> 00:39:45,386
Thank you for giving me a new life.

681
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,430
Are you sure that Mansfield doesn't know
that we have the remains?

682
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,146
I convinced him that Thorne
destroyed them down in the bunker,

683
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:13,200
along with most of their research,

684
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,624
and I promised Eva
that I would lay them to rest.

685
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:19,920
We are laying it all to rest.

686
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:23,442
Henry, I...

687
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:29,257
I've been kind of afraid
to ask you this, but was I...

688
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:30,869
Exposed? No. Oh, no.

689
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,252
Oh, okay.

690
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,225
- No, the results came back negative.
- Good. I just...

691
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,127
I guess I just need some rest.

692
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:39,731
Although... I did find
something else.

693
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,558
So... party at Pilar's tonight?

694
00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:50,813
You sure you're feeling up to it?

695
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:53,037
I'm feeling up to a lot of things.

696
00:40:56,806 --> 00:40:58,883
Good thought to hold onto.

697
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:05,881
I'm not gonna look.

698
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:08,359
I'm... I'm not gonna look, okay?

699
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:12,797
Yeah.

700
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,746
I shouldn't have looked.

701
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:18,104
You're a good dad.

702
00:41:18,683 --> 00:41:20,253
Well, I don't know.

703
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:23,682
Glad things are back to normal.
You know, as normal as they get.

704
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,029
Getting excited
about being an uncle?

705
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:28,697
Yeah, I guess.

706
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:31,256
I... you know,
never really had boys around.

707
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,118
Well, they'll need a role model.

708
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:36,455
True. I can finally coach
little league.

709
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:39,295
You would be a great coach.

710
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,308
I was kinda hoping,

711
00:41:42,763 --> 00:41:43,754
you'd be mine.

712
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:47,258
Okay. You gonna...
take up t-ball, or...

713
00:41:49,129 --> 00:41:50,094
No, my...

714
00:41:51,354 --> 00:41:52,471
my birthing coach.

715
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:56,267
I'm pregnant.

716
00:41:59,135 --> 00:41:59,889
How?

717
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,371
- The usual way.
- I got the... drill.

718
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,444
- Wow, so... so it's...
- Nathan's.

719
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:09,405
You okay?

720
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:13,766
Oh, General Mansfield.

721
00:42:13,886 --> 00:42:16,524
You sure don't make my job easy,
do you, Carter?

722
00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:20,373
- Where's Thorne?
- General, I can explain.

723
00:42:20,493 --> 00:42:22,804
Dr. Blake, I have no evidence
that you've been insubordinate.

724
00:42:22,924 --> 00:42:24,170
Don't give me any.

725
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,250
Uh, sir... she's not so much
a fugitive as a victim, and...

726
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,722
Your job is to enforce the law,
not to make judgments.

727
00:42:35,175 --> 00:42:37,155
- Yes, sir.
- You're a good man,

728
00:42:38,677 --> 00:42:41,604
but you disobeyed a direct order, and
this time, I can't look the other way.

729
00:42:45,434 --> 00:42:48,298
Eureka no longer
requires your services.

730
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:50,654
You are fired, Carter.
