1
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,960
Okay,I've got a triple-shot mocha sirillium latte,an extra-hot chromiumkona macchiato,and a double-distilled peruvian slow roast.

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,560
Okay,I'm telling you,it's weird.

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,720
This is america's favoritepastime.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,940
It's a bunch of grown menslapping each other on the butt and hitting ballswith sticks.

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,300
You wanna talk weird?Let's talk aboutwhat you're wearing.

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,260
You choose nowto mock my clothes?

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,430
Call it like I see it.

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,160
There's nothing wrongwith this dress.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,150
The fact that you call a tank top with a belta dress?

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,990
All the wrongI need.

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,470
Well,you know,it's not likeI'm wearing a thong under it.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,560
Ok--okay,oh,no.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,190
How old are you?

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,100
Old enough to knowthat that is the last thing I want to hearmy 15-year-old daughter saying.

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,320
Thong!
Don'T.

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,350
Thong.

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,020
Thon...guh.

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,180
Hey,hey,hey.

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,170
Eyes front.

20
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,170
Eyes front.

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,440
Here you go.

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,150
Hey,vincent.

23
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,390
I heard something about a town meeting somewhere this morning.

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,900
Do you know where or when?

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,850
Oh--here and now.

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,080
good morning,eureka!

27
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,120
And here's the monday morning minute,and after much discussion,

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,530
we are installing our first traffic light on the corner of main and archimedes.

29
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,600
Also,we'll be holding special elections next month for our new town mayor.

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,250
All interested candidates,please contact allison blake.

31
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,370
xxxxxxx

32
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,040
Would you like to say a few words,sheriff carter?

33
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,120
(Carter) oh,okay.

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,780
Um,uh,like he said.

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,900
Uh,I'm jack carter.

36
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,750
And this is my daughter,zoe.

37
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,260
So,uh,be nice-- dad,stop talking.Now.

38
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,710
it's--it's-- nice to be here.

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,190
Eureka is definitely...

40
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,970
unique.

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,390
oh,hey.I was wondering,um,ifanybody'd like to get together for,uh,you know,a pickup baseball game.

42
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,350
You know,or--or maybe a league.

43
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,510
You know,something very low-key.Just,you know,hang out.

44
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,560
You get to know each-- (man) yeah,our minute's just about up,sheriff.

45
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,150
Oh,okay--well,if anybody's interested--

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,400
so,to recap.Traffic signal.

47
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,490
Mayor's election.

48
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,630
Sheriff carter.

49
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,800
Baseball.

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,530
Have a great week,folks.

51
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,440
(Stark) baseball league.

52
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,900
I just want to put himin my pocket.

53
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,910
Be nice,nathan.He's just tryingto fit in.

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,220
Yeah,don't hold your breath.

55
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,370
Speaking of which,what's going on withthe anti-missile shield ray?

56
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,570
I got two teams working on itaround the clock.

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,880
You'll have your prototypeby friday.

58
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,880
Good.

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,070
The department of defensehas invested a lot of money in that project,nathan.

60
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,620
They want a return.

61
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,880
Soon.

62
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,950
Do they?

63
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,810
Just a friendly word of advice.

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,150
So we're friends now.

65
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,980
Well,I guess that's a stepin the right direction.

66
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,810
[Laugh]All right.

67
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,520
Don't get too excited.

68
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm not running out to renew our wedding vowsor anything.

69
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,930
Look,allison,I was thinking.

70
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,320
Maybe we should-- so,um--

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,990
kevin's been doing much better since he startedthe new drug trial.

72
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,000
Good.

73
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,920
That's good.

74
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,480
Had a very positive sessionthis morning.

75
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,440
He's very calm,focused.

76
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,660
Doesn't seem to be havingany side effects from the methyl,um...

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,420
methylphenidratehydrochloride.

78
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,210
It's a mouthful,but...

79
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,530
maybe the first stepto finding a cure to autism.

80
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,250
So kevin is definitelyon the drug?

81
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,410
Allison,even if I knew,I couldn't tell you.

82
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,610
It's a double-blind study.

83
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,560
If I told you,it would skew the results,invalidate the trial.

84
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,850
I know,it's just that latelyhe's seemed more...

85
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,330
you know,focused.Connected to me,if that makes any sense.

86
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,530
That's whatwe're all hoping for.

87
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,530
Great.

88
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,620
So you'll keep me in the loopon the shield ray.

89
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,040
Consider yourself kept.

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,040
Well,have a good dayat school.

91
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,850
Try not to commitany felonies.

92
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,970
Ha.Good pep talk,dad.

93
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,780
xxxx

94
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,560
Yeah,go ahead,jo.

95
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,070
xx

96
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,560
Do you need something?

97
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,900
xxx

98
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,230
Copy.

99
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,770
Perfect.

100
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,110
Hey,jo.Whatcha got?

101
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,810
Hit and run.

102
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,310
Says it came out of nowhere.

103
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,690
You get a descriptionof the other vehicle?

104
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,790
That's just it.There is no other vehicle.

105
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,810
Whatever hit herwas on foot,and according to her,invisible.

106
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,070
Give her a sobriety test?

107
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,190
Yeah,she's clean.

108
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,780
Check this out.

109
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,820
So what do you thinkhit her?

110
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,420
Well,whatever it was,it went that way.

111
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,590
You have bears around here?

112
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,370
Never seen a beardo anything like that.

113
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,720
What else could it be?

114
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,810
Gigantopithecus americanus.

115
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,900
Taggart,what the hell?

116
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,660
It could still be out there.
What?

117
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,450
Note the large stride.

118
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,150
Trail of destruction.

119
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,560
Extended footprint.

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,330
Tell me you don't meanbigfoot.

121
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,250
I mean gigantopithecus americanus.

122
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,790
Let's give him a sobriety test.

123
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,470
How'd you get hereso fast?

124
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,830
Heard you on my scanner.

125
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,940
And what,you were just passing by in full camisand night vision goggles?

126
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,450
Yeah.

127
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,820
Nice.

128
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,920
Hey,guys?

129
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,910
I think we foundour hit-and-run.

130
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,040
Is that a body?

131
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,800
Not anymore.

132
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,970
He's saving the restfor later.

133
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,660
That's how they feed.

Proudly Presents

136
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,260
Like this before in my life.

137
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,680
I have.

138
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,550
It's never pretty.

139
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,270
Would you stopwith the bigfoot?

140
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,410
This is serious.I take bigfootvery seriously.

141
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,730
There's no wayan animal did this.

142
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,890
Real or imaginary.

143
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,170
Carter's right.I mean,look.

144
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,310
These are friction burns,those are impact wounds.

145
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,660
He's probably brokenevery bone in his body.

146
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,690
It's like he fellout of an airplane.

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,200
Yeah,only horizontally.

148
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,500
(Henry) exactly.

149
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,170
Okay,so we knowthis isn't an animal attack.

150
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,700
If you buy that hypothesis.

151
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,630
Yeah,I'm going outon a limb.

152
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,790
Henry,what is this?

153
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,620
That is a subcutaneouscomputer chip,probably biometric.

154
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,170
Sorry?

155
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,290
Oh,um,a geneticallyencoded marker usually used for trackingor identification.

156
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,600
Like I used on a black rhinoin the african bush.

157
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,270
Yeah,just like that.

158
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,460
Only this is a little bitmore sophisticated than what you would find onthe open market,which means--

159
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,200
that this guy's either a researcherat global dynamics--

160
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,580
or the research.

161
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,520
I'll call stark.

162
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,630
Hold on.I got a better idea.

163
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,020
Allison blake.

164
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,660
Hey,allison.It's,uh,carter.

165
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,030
I need a favor.

166
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,600
Ooh,I thoughtyou'd never ask.Listen,I wanna play first base.

167
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,930
They're always putting mein right field.

168
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,730
Actually,that's notwhy I'm calling.

169
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,610
There's been an accident.

170
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,180
And it might be connectedwith global dynamics.

171
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,870
We found a subcutaneouscomputer chip in the man's wrist,and I need you to source it.

172
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,030
Don't let anyone know.

173
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,820
We're trying to do this as quiet as we can.

174
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,210
got it

175
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,070
You comfortable,fargo?

176
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,450
Can I offer you a beverage?

177
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,690
I haven't slept in days.

178
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,790
My team just can't keep up.

179
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,880
Milton's team is fullof section five guys.

180
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,280
They have better materials,unlimited resources,not to mention 160 I.Q.S.

181
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,910
Competition breeds excellence.

182
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,530
Brings outthe best in us.

183
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,470
Yeah,tell thatto nancy kerrigan.

184
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,500
You ever want to be consideredfor section five,you gotta be ableto compete on their level.

185
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,680
Talent will only get youso far.

186
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,080
Comes down to attitude.

187
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,970
Yeah,I got plentyof attitude.

188
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,210
But what I don't have is a hypervelocityantimissile shield ray.

189
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,590
You know,but at least I'm punctual.

190
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,780
Milton's not late yet.

191
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,550
hey,dr.Houk. Aren't you gonnabe late for work?

192
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,970
I've got plenty of time.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,950
Well,in that case,let me top you--

194
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,640
Dr.Houk.

195
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,110
Right on time.

196
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Okay,gentlemen.

197
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,520
Change of plans.

198
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,970
The team that can delivera working prototype by tomorrow at 5:00gets the funding.

199
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,180
But you said friday.

200
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
By tomorrow,we'll have itin a variety of colors for you,dr.Stark.

201
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,400
See what I mean,fargo?

202
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,210
Attitude.

203
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,440
Okay,guys.

204
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,210
Our deadline is now tomorrow.

205
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,250
So,uh...

206
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,080
we need to step it up.

207
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,180
We need to get serious.

208
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,070
But mostly,we need to cheat.

209
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,150
Twice in one day.

210
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,300
I'm starting to thinkyou miss me.

211
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,310
I think it's youwho's missing someone.

212
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,400
I'm bettingthe computer chip means-- ssh.

213
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,470
Nothing.

214
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,960
I'm betting the computer chipmeans this guy was working on somethingclassified.

215
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,470
I don't know what's going on,but my gut tells me it's bad.

216
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,700
His gut should'vetold you that.

217
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,510
Well,let's hope the autopsycan give us something concrete.

218
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,550
i want everything packed up and moved backto global dynamics.

219
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,950
Hey.

220
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,890
Hey!

221
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,490
It's a crime scene.Don't touch anything.

222
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,970
It's not a joke.You want to attend to that?

223
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,990
I appreciate your efforts,sheriff.

224
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:22,150
But this is a little aboveyour pay grade,which I assume you knew,since you called allison before you called me.

225
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,520
You are so stuckin right field.

226
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,500
I had to tell him,carter.

227
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,000
We have strict protocols about this.

228
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,740
You're interferingin a criminal investigation,and I'm the law.

229
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,610
This man workedin section five,where I'm the law.

230
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,930
So unless you havehard evidence of a crime,you can stopwhat you're doing.

231
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,120
Henry.

232
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,880
Just consider me switzerland,you know?

233
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,800
Just here packing up.

234
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,190
I respect the job that you do,sheriff,I do.

235
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,220
It just ends herE.

236
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,480
Oh,I'm just getting started.

237
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,290
Be prudent,sheriff--I wouldn't want you to end up in federal prison.

238
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,820
Yeah?

239
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,830
Well,I wouldn'twant you to end up with my footshoved up your a--

240
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,190
carter.

241
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,610
Sheriff,we're grown men.

242
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,950
I like to think we're a littlemore evolved than that.

243
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,270
Well,you overestimate me.

244
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,020
xxx

245
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,020
xxxx

246
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,320
There's gotta be somethingwe can do.

247
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,270
Stark's head honchoup at global dynamics.

248
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,540
When he says "jump," everyone else says"what trajectory?

249
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,490
" Yeah,well,I say...

250
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,540
screw him.

251
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,350
Well,he's probably sayingthe same thing about you.

252
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,210
Only in latin.

253
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,940
You saw the body,right?

254
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,500
I mean,there's no accident.

255
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
I'm not giving up on this.

256
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,550
Unless we can show evidenceof a crime,you don't havemuch of a choice.

257
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,610
I can't show evidenceof anything.Stark took it all.

258
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,270
Not all of it.

259
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,300
That's a pen.

260
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,200
No,it's a portablemagnetic resonance imager.

261
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,300
I just did a quick scan while everybody elsewas distracted.

262
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,430
We may not have a body,but with a little patience,

263
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,400
we are gonna havea darn good three-dimensionalrepresentation.

264
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,690
Henry,I could kiss you.

265
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,780
But why don't wemove this to jo's desk?

266
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,490
I'm running a reconstructivealgorithm.

267
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,560
Just to sort offill in the gaps.

268
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,210
How long before we geta full image?

269
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,270
A few hours,maybe less.

270
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,670
Once I get itback to the garage,I can boostthe processing power.

271
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,110
Okay.

272
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,570
In the meantime,jo and I'll try to figure out how this guy got this way.

273
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,190
Where are we going?

274
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,310
Back to the woods.

275
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,980
Odds are stark's goonsmissed something.

276
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,130
Dr.Houk.

277
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,040
A word.

278
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,580
Just a few finishing touches,dr.Stark,

279
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,260
and it should be readyfor test phase.

280
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,620
Good.

281
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,970
Good.

282
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,130
And your team?

283
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,310
Everyone pulling their weight?

284
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,770
I didn't wantto say anything,but dr.Hawthornewasn't up to the task,so I sent him home.

285
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,260
When?

286
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,980
Yesterday.

287
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,670
Why?

288
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,530
There's been an accident.

289
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,740
Hawthorne.

290
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,210
Is there anything elseI should know,milton?

291
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:46,470
Only that in spiteof his shortcomings,you're going to havea highly sophisticated antimissile prototypeto test tomorrow.

292
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,260
A man died,milton.

293
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,430
I have bigger concernsat the moment.

294
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,330
So big you want usto stop working?

295
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,440
I'll keep you apprised.

296
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,870
What's happened?
Nothing.

297
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,590
Just get back to work.

298
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,370
Where's hawthorne?

299
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,930
Did something happen?

300
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,330
Let me worryabout hawthorne.

301
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,950
We've only got 26 hours.

302
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,600
We need to makeevery second count.

303
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,070
What?

304
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,370
It's just enoughto get us through the night.

305
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,870
I don't know.

306
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,680
The side effects-- something's not rightwith this stuff.

307
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,060
One more dose isn't goingto kill you,keller.

308
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,550
Not taking itmight kill your career.

309
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,300
It's your call.

310
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,220
No,come on.

311
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,570
Bingo.

312
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,400
which basically meanscertain nonlinear dynamical systems,extremely sensitive to initial conditions--

313
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,470
exhibits a phenomenonknown as chaos.

314
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,590
Come on,courtney,that's a textbook definition.

315
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,510
You've got to cite specific examples...

316
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,920
open your eyes,meat.

317
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,070
Sorry,it wasan accident.

318
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,690
You're not gonna screw with my dad's credit scoresagain,are you?

319
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,970
Lucky for you,I'm in a forgiving mood.

320
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,270
Good god,it's nerd-vana.

321
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,280
You have no idea.

322
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,920
I don't know,you look fairly normal.

323
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,120
Well,everyone's gottheir way of standing out.

324
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,770
Like yelling "thong!"In a crowded restaurant.

325
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Too much?

326
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,580
got my attention.

327
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,780
Yeah,well,thongs geteveryone's attention.

328
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,640
I'm dylan.

329
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,850
Zoe.

330
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,740
Yeah,I know.The monday minute?

331
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,080
You did see that,huh?

332
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,980
Don't worry,I-- I know exactlyhow you feel.

333
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,870
It's a dragwhen people judge you by what your parents do.

334
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,140
Your dad'sa total loser too?

335
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,370
Actually,he's a nobel laureatein chemistry.

336
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,160
Mom's a physicist.

337
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,010
Compared to them,I'm the loser.

338
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,900
And I got a 4.6 gpa.

339
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,140
Well,that sucks.

340
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,180
That's growing upin eureka.

341
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,270
So I guess you're oneof the brainiacs,huh?

342
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,940
Uh,well,I do havean internship at global dynamics.

343
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,470
I hope that doesn't coloryour opinion of me.

344
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,440
it depends.

345
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,910
On?

346
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,030
Whether or not you let mecheat off you in class.

347
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,640
Hey,jo,do you have a knife?

348
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,230
Ask a stupid question.

349
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,580
xxx

350
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,690
There's our evidence.

351
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,200
Hi,henry.How's it going?

352
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,480
Fire in the hole!

353
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,290
Oh,I'm sorry.

354
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,000
I didn't hear you come in.

355
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,010
I can't hear anything.

356
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,170
Henry,what are you doing?

357
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,480
Working on a hunch.

358
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,650
A hypothesison how our guy died,and it wasn'tany bigfoot.

359
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,290
Yeah,well,tell me something I don't know.

360
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Okay.

361
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,620
He tripped.

362
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,870
He tripped and was hitby the car?

363
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,450
No,he hit the car.

364
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,400
What,was he goinglike 500 miles an hour?

365
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:42,240
588 miles an hour,and he glanced off it,which would explainwhy the car spun out instead of being smashedon impact.

366
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,970
Yeah.

367
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,860
I think I likethe bigfoot theory again.

368
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,010
Here,look,I've donenumerous simulations.

369
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,990
I've done mechanical augmentation,I've done temporalmanipulation,I've done biologicalenhancement.

370
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,300
only one theory  make sense

371
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,780
Someone or somethingturned our guy into road runner.

372
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,510
Okay.

373
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,230
If that somethingwas a chemical...

374
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:06,900
okay.

375
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,900
And that you could ingest.

376
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,020
Could you test for it?

377
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,240
Sure,if I had the body.

378
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,340
How about a body part?

379
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,060
Oh,that's very good.

380
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,150
Very good.

381
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,680
Why's it look like me?

382
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,680
it's generic.

383
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,950
Eureka.

384
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,110
Henry,do you everactually work on cars?

385
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,310
Sometimes when it gets slow,yeah.

386
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,630
Here,look.Check this out.

387
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,840
See how when I probe the tissue,how the adp/atp ratiois out of equilibrium?

388
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,820
First thing I noticed.

389
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:11,960
Not only that,this guyhas highly elevated levels of cyclopentanoper hydrophenanthren.

390
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,750
He's been juicing.

391
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,340
With what,like,rocket fuel?

392
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,060
I don't know.

393
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,200
We won't find itin barry bonds' locker.

394
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,280
Could you find thisin section five?

395
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,160
Maybe.I'll know moreonce I isolate the compound.

396
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,380
okay.

397
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,130
Okay,let's say someoneliterally is speed freaking.

398
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,710
Um,what signswould I look for?

399
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,770
Besides runningat 600 miles an hour?

400
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,520
Appetite,extreme thirst.

401
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,650
Any drug that would increasethe metabolic rate this much requires massive amountsof electrolytes,simple and complexcarbohydrates.

402
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,680
Henry,you're a rock star.

403
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,080
Can I borrowyour wonder pen?

404
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,400
Sure.Where are you going?

405
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,580
To grab a little lunch.

406
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,060
so I thought you were mad at me.

407
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,930
If I was,would I betaking you out to lunch?

408
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,270
Here?

409
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,830
Well,maybe I'ma little mad at you,yeah.

410
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,230
Okay,what is thisabout,carter?

411
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,390
Nothing.

412
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,100
You know?

413
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,630
We just never hang out.

414
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,100
I wanna knowwhat's going on with you.

415
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,320
You know,what's going onwith allison.

416
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,590
Okay,for a cop,you're a bad liar.

417
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,060
I'm afraid there may bedrugs involved with our john doe's death.

418
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,050
What kind of drugs?

419
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,500
The kind that canmake you run at mach 5.

420
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,780
You sure you're not on drugs?

421
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,970
Yes.

422
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,780
Look for someone eating a massive amountof food.

423
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,500
So we're lookingfor someone who's hungry.

424
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,600
Yeah.

425
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,240
In a cafeteriaat lunch.

426
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,000
Look,I'm not talking abouta regular amount of hungry.

427
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,240
I'm talking like postsuper-speedy drug binge hungry.

428
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,220
You think global dynamicshas a drug problem?

429
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,190
I think I have a dead researcherwho was juicing on something.

430
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,100
I mean...

431
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,090
athletes juice,right?

432
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,960
Why not scientists?

433
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,530
Speaking of which...

434
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,180
no cafeteria food'sthat good.

435
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,160
Wait,wait.

436
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,590
Look,those guysare from section five.

437
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,790
This has to be handleddelicately.

438
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,420
Trust me.

439
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,660
Honest.

440
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,240
Hey,guys,I hateto interrupt your lunch,but I was wondering if you couldhelp me with something?

441
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,350
I want to knowwhat drug this guy was on,and which one of youkilled him.

442
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,340
Son of a bitch.

443
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,810
Is that delicate enoughfor you?

444
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,200
Sheriff.

445
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,020
I'm really startingto tire of this.

446
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,570
Well,then,I'll make it easy on you.

447
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,310
Have these guyssubmit to a drug test.

448
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,770
Do you have evidence that they're takingsomething illegal?

449
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,940
Well,illegal,no.

450
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,520
xxx

451
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,680
And whoever gave it to himis looking at a possible murder charge.

452
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,610
Assuming that's true,um,how do you knowanybody else is taking it?

453
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,680
Oh,I have my reasons.

454
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,720
I'm listening.

455
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,480
These guys...

456
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,970
are eating way too much.

457
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,430
Your damning evidenceis a healthy appetite?

458
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,590
Well,when you put itlike that,it just sounds dumb.

459
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,220
I know.Look,sheriff.

460
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,290
I'm gonna need something a little more conclusivethan the munchies.

461
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,720
That morewhat you had in mind?

462
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,550
I want them quarantinedand isolated for investigation.

463
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,700
This is stillan internal matter,sheriff.

464
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,630
Not anymore,nathan.

465
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,480
Fargo took thisfrom milton's team.

466
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,390
Give it to me.

467
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,450
I'll have it analyzed-- that's evidencein an ongoing investigation.

468
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,290
Carter is right.

469
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,400
Milton obviously knowsmore than he's saying.

470
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,950
I'll have henryanalyze this.

471
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,500
Uh,we can interrogatemilton's team tomorrow.

472
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,660
Well,why not now?

473
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,980
I want to let them stew.

474
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,240
Any drug that gets peoplethis cranked has got to havea nasty rebound.

475
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,250
Fine,well,we can put themin the decontamination chamber in section four.

476
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,260
Perfect.

477
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,710
Nice tie.

478
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,430
I'm really startingto dislike that guy.

479
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,180
xx

480
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,430
xxx

481
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,370
Enjoy.

482
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,130
My god,this workload is insane.

483
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,790
I mean,who needsthis kind of pressure?

484
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,210
When do kidsjust get to be kids?
did it a hard day in school

485
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,840
Actually,I made a friend.

486
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,420
That's great!What's her name?
His name.

487
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,850
Is dylan.

488
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,370
Relax,he's perfectly normaland smart.

489
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,070
He even has a studentinternship at global D.

490
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,680
Since when do you like guyswho are normal and smart?

491
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,570
there is someone at the door

492
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,340
Since they look like him.

493
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,900
We need to,um,talk aboutincreasing security.

494
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,400
Against burglars?

495
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,040
Against boys.

496
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,920
Wow,you guyslive in a hole.

497
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,750
I mean,it's a nice hole.It's very,uh...

498
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,370
very postmodernarmageddon.

499
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,780
Dad,this is dylan.

500
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,330
From the caféthis morning,right?

501
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,290
Yeah,yeah.

502
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,860
But I promisemy intentions are honorable.

503
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,950
It's not your intentionsI'm worried about.

504
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,090
Dylan's my chemistry tutor.

505
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,320
just helping herget a head start,you know?

506
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,180
You need all the help you canaround here,believe me.

507
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,510
Famous parents,overachiever,he has issues.

508
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,340
Don't we all?

509
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,670
Don't you have work to do?

510
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,450
Yeah,I heard aboutthat accident.

511
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,300
Did you figure outwhat caused it yet?

512
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,870
yeah,as a matter of fact.

513
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,150
I'm this close.

514
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,480
Okay,great.Why don't youget on that,'kay?

515
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,440
All right.

516
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,270
I'm just gonna bein the next room.

517
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,830
I have a gun.You know that,right?
Dad.

518
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,740
And it's loaded.
Leave.

519
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,010
I'm just saying.
Now.

520
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,290

521
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,540
Hey,henry.It's carter.

522
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,500
Um,look,I think I gotwhat killed our guy.

523
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,330
Still working on the who,but I need a chemical analysis,so,uh...

524
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,580
give me a callwhen you get in.

525
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,910

Dad?

526
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,540
Zoe,you okay?
Yeah.

527
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,050
What was that?

528
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,390
A warning.

529
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,290
back off

530
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,300
They're allin pretty bad shape.

531
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,190
I almost feel sorryfor them.

532
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,060
Well,he's almost ready.

533
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,390
And you're surethey were here all night?

534
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,460
Yeah,they've beenunder constant surveillance.

535
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,000
Well,someonetrashed my place last night.

536
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,050
Someone moving too fastfor my security camera.

537
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,030
If it wasn't one of them,they definitely knowwho it was.

538
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,520
Maybe you shouldquestion them at some point.

539
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,110
Do I tell youhow to do your job?

540
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,890
No,but that isan amusing idea.

541
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,250
I'll question themwhen they're good and ready.

542
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,150
Let me out of here!

543
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,770
You can't keep melocked up like this.

544
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,450
Let me out!

545
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,810
Like now.

546
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,960
A tape recorder?

547
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,260
This is priceless.

548
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,950
this is howthis is gonna work,milton.

549
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,730
I'm not gonna ask youmisleading,clever questions.

550
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,680
Not gonna try to trap you,all right?

551
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,900
You work in section five,I figured you're too smartfor that.

552
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,350
Good.

553
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,830
What is gonna happenis that I'm gonna sit right out there.

554
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,190
And watch you slowly go into withdrawal.

555
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,030
Until every nervein your body is on fire.

556
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:24,010
Until your skin's crawlingand your brain is begging for whatever the hellyou took.

557
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:30,550
See,I got a body pumped fullof just god knows what,and everythingpoints to you.

558
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,550
I didn't kill him.Anybody.

559
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,200
Well,you see,I need a different story.

560
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,310
Hmm?

561
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,770
You got options,milton.

562
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,200
You have options until I head outthrough that door.

563
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,890
Okay?

564
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,050
Good luck.

565
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,900
Wait.

566
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,460
We were just tryingto keep up.

567
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,070
I didn't know anybodywould get hurt.

568
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,620
Who else is involved?
Nobody.

569
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,820
Nobody?

570
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,850
Somebody trashed my housetrying to get me to back off from this investigation,and if you clowns are in--

571
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,460
okay!

572
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,720
But first...

573
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,320
you gotta know,it wasn't mmmmmmm...

574
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,370
wasn't what,milton?

575
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,980
Milton?

576
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,650
Wasn't?

577
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,680
Wasn't what?

578
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,890
Dammit.

579
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,850
I was so close.

580
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,050
Must be a reactionto coming off the drug.

581
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,580
His metabolism's overcompensating,forcing his nerve systemto shut down.

582
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,190
Can you counteract it?

583
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,450
Not without knowingexactly what he was taking.

584
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,740
What is he saying?
I don't know.

585
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,220
But my assistant might.

586
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,350
Don't ever call me that.

587
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,750
Not you.

588
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,130
Come here.

589
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:31,410
It wasn't my idea.

590
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,590
I didn't make this stuff.

591
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,530
I just used it.And so did hawthorne.

592
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,880
So you can't hold me responsible for his death.

593
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,400
Priceless,huh?

594
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,980
Mph is still experimental,but what it altered like that?

595
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,240
But no one thought-- what's mph?

596
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,960
I think he's talking about methylphenidratehydrochloride.

597
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,780
It's an advanced formof ritalin.

598
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,210
That's the drug they're usingon kevin in the study.

599
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,110
They must have altered itin the lab.

600
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,720
Changed the chemicalcomposition.

601
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,620
Who has access to it?

602
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,770
Um,I can accessthe personnel files.

603
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,980
But it'll be a long list.

604
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,610
Researchers,kids,their parents,techs,student interns-- hold it.

605
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,880
Student interns?

606
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,170
One of them named dylan?

607
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,040
Yes.

608
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,090
Dylan hartwell.

609
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,330
He's a senior at tesla.

610
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,060
That's my daughter's boyfriend.

611
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,810
Son of a bitchwas hiding in plain sight.

612
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,190
Okay,jo,you goto the kid's house.I'm hitting the school.

613
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,740
i'm on it

614
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,310
I can't believe you did that.

615
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,850
Allison-- you convinced meto put kevin in that study.

616
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,940
Now you've given him a drugthat has killed a man.

617
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,320
The drug didn't kill him.

618
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,610
Cooking it in the lab did.

619
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,100
And I didn't give kevinanything.

620
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,420
Oh,oh,great-- now you're gonna try to lay the blameon someone else?

621
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,050
No,I'm telling you that kevinisn't on the drug.

622
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,810
What?

623
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,550
He's not on mph.

624
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,740
He's receiving the placebo.

625
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,640
How could you know that?

626
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,150
It's a double-blind study.

627
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,600
Because I cheated.

628
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,320
Look.

629
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,230
Mph is perfectly safewhen used properly,but

630
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,110
with every new drugthere's side effects,and until we knew more,I-I just--I couldn't risk it.

631
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:03,010
No,you--that can't-- I--

632
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,980
no,he has been so differentsince he started that trial.

633
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,420
Because you're different.

634
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,960
Any progressthat kevin has made?

635
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,720
It's because ofhis relationship with you.

636
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,880
Not because of any drug.

637
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,040
And you've known about this all this time?

638
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,800
I'm sorryI couldn't tell you.

639
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,390
I...

640
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,000
I just wantedwhat was best for him.

641
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,400
Don't lie to me again.

642
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,390
But...

643
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,320
thank you.

644
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,010
Zoe!

645
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,450
Hey.

646
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,530
Uh,where's dylan?

647
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,870
It was one kissduring homeroom.

648
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,260
Relax.

649
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,920
Okay,I'll freak outabout that later.

650
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,690
Right now,I need to knowwhere dylan is.

651
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,620
Okay,I don't know.

652
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,250
I'm not his keeper.

653
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,050
All right,come with me.Come on.

654
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,620
Here,I'll bring a notetomorrow.

655
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,710
I'm telling you,he's using drugs.

656
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,680
Oh,of course you think the guy I likemust be using drugs.

657
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,900
He had access to the lab,and he was in our house last nightwhen it was trashed.

658
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,160
What do you think-- dylan was right next to methe whole time.

659
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,160
This drug,mph--uh,he cooks it into speed.

660
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,090
Literally.

661
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,370
I mean,it can make youmove faster than the eye can see.

662
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,740
Do you realizehow crazy you sound?

663
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,310
Nobody can move that fast.

664
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,560
Dad!

665
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,160
why couldn't you just leave it alone?

666
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,300
I told you to back off!

667
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,070
You had to keep pushing.

668
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,310
Everybody's always pushing,all the time.

669
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,530
Dylan,where's zoe?

670
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,970
You don't knowwhat it's like!

671
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,740
I know what it's like to be pulledfrom a moving vehicle.

672
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,980
Where's my daughter?

673
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,090
I cooked the mphso that I could keep up.

674
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,980
They came to me.

675
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,960
I wasn't dealing it.

676
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,080
They saidthat if I helped them,that they would help me.

677
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,920
They would help me move up,you know?

678
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,750
Now I'm goingto lose my internship.

679
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,860
Do you have any ideahow hard that I worked for that?

680
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,150
Dylan,you gotta trust me.

681
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,360
No,I told hawthorneto watch the dosing--

682
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,360
okay.So it's an accident.Right?

683
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,060
You can come back from this.

684
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,110
As long as you don'tdo anything else stupid.

685
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,540
Or more stupid.

686
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,060
Don't call me stupid!

687
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,790
You gotta listen to me.

688
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,420
And don't tell mewhat to do.

689
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,680
Okay,you gotta stopdoing that.

690
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
dad!

691
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,160
Zoe,stay put!

692
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,300
Dylan?
Back off.

693
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,620
Zoe.

694
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,160
Put the gun down,dylan.

695
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,290
Why,so I can go to jailfor the rest of my life?

696
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,330
Damn straight!
Not helping!

697
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,570
I can't go to jail.

698
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,360
It doesn't have to endlike this.

699
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,520
I can't go to jail.

700
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,780
Dylan,don'T.
No!

701
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,820
dylan!

702
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,210
Two bits of advice: Always check the safety.

703
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,110
And never rush the moundwhen the pitcher's got the ball.

704
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,090
Dad!

705
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,770
Hey,hey.

706
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,290
Hey,are you okay?

707
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,180
Yeah,are you?

708
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,480
Yeah,well,better than your boyfriend.

709
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,710
We are so broken up.

710
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,150
Where's the car?

711
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,040
This is dr.Stark.

712
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,060
I'd like a new projectgiven top priority.

713
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,670
That's right.

714
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,060
Section five.

715
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,650
Would you lighten up,carter?This was your idea.

716
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,600
Don't remind me.

717
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,710
Look,I know it's notthe way you pictured it.

718
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,050
But the important thing is,people are making an effort.

719
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,510
Really?

720
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,600
Is that what this is?

721
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,930
An effort?

722
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,660
I call thisan abomination.

723
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:50,210
Well,it's a beautiful dayhere at quantum field.

724
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,220
There's our very own jack carter.

725
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,420
Jack carter,ladies and gentlemen.

726
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
Let's hear it for jack carter.

727
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,750
Steps up to the plate.

728
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,920
Time to...

729
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,380
play ball!

730
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,790
Whoo,dad!

731
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,290
Come on!

732
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,540
Batter batter batter batterbatter batter batter...

733
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,960
crowd the plate,law dog.

734
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,180
I'll nail ya.

735
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,020
Aw,just throw the damn ball,dogcatcher.

736
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,810
come on,dad!This pitcher's got no game.

737
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,440
Knock it downtown!

738
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,130
taggart is looking for his pitch.

739
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,560
Oh,come on--finally.

740
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,720
He sees something that he likes.

741
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,800
Winds up for the pitch--

742
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,930
It's a long,hard,fly to center.

743
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,690
He caught it!

744
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,860
At the fence.

745
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,480
It's the first big-- big play of the game.

746
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:01,060
Now that is what I call baseball.

747
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,700
Let a pro show youhow it's done.

748
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,870
And it is--pssh!

749
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,780
Outta here.

750
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,220
It's gonna bea hell of a game,you know what I'm talking about?

751
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,150
A hell of a game.

752
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,470
I'll never get used to this town.

753
