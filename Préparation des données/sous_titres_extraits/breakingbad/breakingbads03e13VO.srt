<i>Previously on</i> Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,919
This whole Gale situation.

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,379
It's just not working out.

4
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:09,091
- What's up, partner?
- This is my replacement?

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,969
I understand that you have a problem
with two of my employees.

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,180
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,849
They got an 11-year-old kid
doing their killing for them.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,770
No more children. Understand?

9
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,177
Grandma? Oh, God.

10
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:29,694
Run.

11
00:01:12,676 --> 00:01:14,350
- Hello again.
- Hi!

12
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,855
I hope we're not too late.

13
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,325
No, no.
Perfect timing.

14
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,959
Stan, this is my husband Walt.

15
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:21,694
- Hi. Good to meet you, Walt.
- Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:24,029
- Sandia Laboratories?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:26,752
I hear some pretty fascinating
stuff goes on out there.

18
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:28,701
You know...

19
00:01:28,826 --> 00:01:30,549
Working on anything
you can talk about?

20
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,035
I'm picturing giant space lasers.
Am I right?

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,273
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,354
But giant space lasers?
Now, that sounds cool.

23
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:41,948
I'll have to bring it up
at our next staff meeting.

24
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:44,578
- Just remember I get a cut.
- All right, that's a deal.

25
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,012
So this is it, honey.
What do you say?

26
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,233
- Do you want to take a tour?
- Sure.

27
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:54,297
Look, how about I give
y'all some privacy?

28
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:57,322
I'll go out to the car
and make a few calls.

29
00:01:58,127 --> 00:01:59,859
Take as much time as you need.

30
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,549
- All right. Good.
- Okay. Thanks.

31
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,073
He's actually a nice guy.
He doesn't push.

32
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:10,766
So, as you can see, there's...

33
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,669
there's a kind of flow
going on here.

34
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:14,383
It's a nice big living room.

35
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:18,290
And this is the dining area.

36
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:20,674
- The dining area. Right.
- Yes.

37
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:22,073
And...

38
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:26,179
- It's got a pool.
- Oh, pool is nice.

39
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:30,249
Backyard could be a little bigger.

40
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,608
And...
there's a breakfast bar

41
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,153
kind of dealie here which is nice.

42
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:39,157
And, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious

43
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:42,178
and, you know,
got good appliances, and...

44
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:43,862
How many bedrooms?

45
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,397
Three.

46
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:46,398
Told you.

47
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:48,261
There'll all pretty good size,
and...

48
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:50,706
this is the first one here.

49
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:53,153
And then there's
two more at the back.

50
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:54,423
Only three bedrooms?

51
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:58,441
I think we're gonna need at least five.
Don't you think?

52
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,314
Five?

53
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:01,202
What?

54
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:04,413
Do I look like I'm about
to drop a litter? Dude.

55
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,597
No, we'll have three kids
total, eventually.

56
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:11,237
But we'll need
a spare room for a study

57
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:14,262
so that I could work at home
and you can write.

58
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:16,898
I don't...

59
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:18,650
I don't think this
is gonna be enough.

60
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:21,865
Okay.

61
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,431
What about a wine cellar?

62
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:25,833
I mean, we certainly
cannot be expected

63
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,654
to live without a wine cellar.

64
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:28,994
Very funny.

65
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,997
I just think we need to set
our sights high is all.

66
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:33,574
At least higher than here.

67
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:36,877
This is a good neighborhood.

68
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:40,363
It's got a good elementary
and supposedly a very good high school.

69
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:42,564
And believe me... 'cause I have

70
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,254
definitely looked everywhere...

71
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,376
for our price range,
this is as good as it gets.

72
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:50,889
Then let's stretch our price range.

73
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:53,634
Truly.
I mean, why

74
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,377
why buy a starter house when we'll
have to move out in a year or two?

75
00:03:58,092 --> 00:03:59,965
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

76
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,334
I'm serious.

77
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:03,985
Come on.

78
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,137
Why be cautious?

79
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,312
We've got nowhere to go but up.

I'm gonna need some...

88

some kind of assurance.

Walter,

92
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:43,033
you've been busy.

93
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,171
You want to put your arms out
to the sides for me, if you would?

94
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,319
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

95
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:09,120
I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

96
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:11,357
I need my sleep.

97
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,364
You said no half measures.

98
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:20,418
Funny how words can be
so open to interpretation.

99
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:24,774
You get your car fixed?

100
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:25,923
Not yet.

101
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,377
You're gonna want
to get your car fixed.

102
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,569
Let's see how this goes first.

103
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,765
Has your condition worsened?

104
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:11,599
- Excuse me?
- Your medical condition,

105
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:14,142
- has it grown worse?
- Not that I know of, no.

106
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,947
Is there a ringing in your ears?

107
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:19,975
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

108
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:22,994
I'm quite well, thank you.

109
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,868
Clearly you are not.

110
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:29,051
No rational person
would do as you have done.

111
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,115
Explain yourself.

112
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,777
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

113
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:40,951
I intervened.

114
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,786
Some worthless junkie...

115
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,814
For him you intervene
and put us all at risk?

116
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:50,567
Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
keep the peace for eight hours?

117
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:53,411
That's right.
He couldn't.

118
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,598
He was angry because
those two dealers of yours

119
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:58,818
had just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

120
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,532
I heard about it.

121
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:03,673
He should have let me
take care of them.

122
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,134
Maybe.

123
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:09,236
Then again, maybe he thought
it was you who gave the order.

124
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,087
Are you asking me

125
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:17,637
if I ordered the murder of a child?

126
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:22,265
I would never ask you that.

127
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:30,379
Where is Pinkman now?

128
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,928
I wouldn't know.

129
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:37,482
A couple of time zones
away, at least.

130
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:41,085
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.

131
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,944
He has enough money to last forever.

132
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:45,989
He knows he needs to keep moving.

133
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:48,415
You'll never find him.

134
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:50,073
I don't know, Walt.

135
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:52,876
It's what I do, after all.

136
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:57,640
He's out of the picture.

137
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,059
I saved his life.
I owed him that.

138
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:02,127
But now he and I are done,

139
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:04,821
which is exactly what
you wanted, isn't it?

140
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,572
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man,

141
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:16,679
so if I may, I would like
to review options with you

142
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,035
of which it seems
to me you have two.

143
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:22,505
Option A...

144
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,251
you kill me right here and now.

145
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:28,054
Apparently, I have made
that very easy for you.

146
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:30,671
You can kill me... no witnesses...

147
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:34,798
and then spend the next
few weeks or months

148
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:38,004
tracking down Jesse Pinkman,
and you kill him too.

149
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:40,917
A pointless exercise,
it seems to me.

150
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,592
But that is Option A.

151
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:44,704
What is Option B?

152
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,173
I continue cooking.

153
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:48,978
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

154
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,577
We forget this ever happened.

155
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:54,580
We consider this a lone hiccup

156
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:56,256
in an otherwise

157
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,185
long and fruitful

158
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,593
business arrangement.

159
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,947
I prefer Option B.

160
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:12,173
You'd need a new assistant.

161
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,525
I could get right on that.

162
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:17,842
This time, I choose.

163
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:35,563
Your car.

164
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:37,774
Get it fixed.

165
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,095
Really?

166
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,245
It's good to see you.

167
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:52,935
Thanks.

168
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:56,641
It's good to be back.

169
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:01,279
- Shall we?
- By all means, Gale,

170
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:03,298
let's cook.

171
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,553
What about that rhinoceros?

172
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,245
You think he'd make a good pet?

173
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,608
Don't you think if you called to him,
he'd come running for his supper?

174
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,145
I'll bet he would.
I bet he'd come running.

175
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:25,165
You're silly, Pop Pop.

176
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,533
Well, a little.

177
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,335
But he'd probably
knock everything over.

178
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,104
Plus, there's that big nose of his.

179
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,506
That's not a nose.
That's a horn.

180
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,372
Is that so?

181
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,143
His real nose is little.

182
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,616
I learn all kinds of
things being with you.

183
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,249
Okay, June Bug, these are for you.

184
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:49,656
- What about the rest?
- The rest are for me.

185
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,426
No, they're not.
You're too old for balloons.

186
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:55,730
You're never too old for balloons.

187
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,019
Give me a hug.

188
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,355
I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.

189
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,528
- Bye, Pop Pop.
- Bye, baby.

190
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:10,623
Please. Please, no.

191
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:32,485
Chow, do you have anything
you want to tell me?

192
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,116
Thank God you're here.

193
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:35,686
They keep me prisoner.

194
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,021
They keep you prisoner.

195
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:39,492
I don't do nothing for them ever.

196
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,452
They try and make me.

197
00:18:41,716 --> 00:18:42,659
I say no.

198
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,867
They steal my chemicals.

199
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:46,697
I can't stop them.

200
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:48,965
- I am businessman.
- You're a businessman...

201
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:50,734
The lady out front...

202
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,047
Lady, are you still there?

203
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,627
Ask her if she's still there.

204
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:10,844
She says yes.

205
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:13,610
How's her driving?

206
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:15,827
Driving. Is she good
behind the wheel?

207
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:18,263
Good. She's good driver.

208
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,199
Licensed? Dependable?

209
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,869
She has a Camry.

210
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:24,621
Good.

211
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:31,610
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

212
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,404
I strongly recommend that you
return our calls next time.

213
00:19:35,912 --> 00:19:38,051
So have her drive you
to the hospital.

214
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:44,371
She's gonna need her shoe.

215
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:57,033
Where did they cross?

216
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:58,608
Laredo, looks like.

217
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:01,432
They didn't exactly send
their A players.

218
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:04,373
But like you said,
it's cartel, all right.

219
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:08,657
Probing for weakness.

220
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:12,194
Well, they didn't find any.

221
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:17,256
What about Pinkman?

222
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,440
I'm making inquiries.

223
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,396
Done. That's two?

224
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,521
All right.
Let's close it up.

225
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,179
Bring it down.

226
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:52,293
Ready?

227
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,518
Okay. We're good.

228
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:07,601
You can take your mask off now.

229
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:19,928
Does that guy ever leave?

230
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,275
When exactly did that start?

231
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:27,411
It's new.

232
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:29,969
We had a...

233
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:35,146
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

234
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:37,661
I'm sorry to hear that.

235
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:39,444
No, it'll be fine.

236
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,264
Things will continue to smooth out.

237
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:44,632
Yeah, it'll be fine.

238
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:48,676
By the way,

239
00:21:49,258 --> 00:21:52,403
if you're at all worried
about working with me...

240
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:53,628
No, I'm not.

241
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,443
Because whatever
my shortcomings last time,

242
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:59,953
I intend for things to go
perfectly from here on out.

243
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,806
So, if there is...

244
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,514
Gale, you're great.

245
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:05,061
Seriously.

246
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:06,449
I just...

247
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,384
However you like things to be done

248
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:12,047
is exactly how we are gonna do them.

249
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:13,171
Period.

250
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:15,894
From here on out.

251
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:16,811
So...

252
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:21,217
please teach me.

253
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:28,914
Okay.

254
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:52,680
Gale.

255
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,294
It's good to see you.

256
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,419
Mr. Fring.

257
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:56,894
Wow.

258
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,046
- This is...
- I should have called first.

259
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,070
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

260
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:04,832
No, not at all.
Please come in.

261
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,771
Can I offer you something?
Crème de Menthe?

262
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,784
No, thank you.

263
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:15,596
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

264
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:18,946
It's no inconvenience.

265
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:23,908
I need to talk to you
about something...

266
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,162
something rather pressing.

267
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:32,997
If push came to shove,
I was wondering

268
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,955
how soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

269
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,702
You and an assistant.

270
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:41,697
Why would...

271
00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:45,910
Why would push come to shove?

272
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:50,401
Has Walter ever talked to you about why
he got into this line of work?

273
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:55,982
I guess I assumed it was
because it pays so well.

274
00:24:56,107 --> 00:24:58,398
Oh, it is, but specifically.

275
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,904
Has he ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

276
00:25:05,113 --> 00:25:06,452
Oh. I'm not surprised.

277
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:08,427
He's a very private person.

278
00:25:09,661 --> 00:25:12,346
What exactly are
his health problems?

279
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:14,473
He's dying of cancer.

280
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,918
It is why he does this,

281
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:20,317
to provide for his family,
which he has accomplished.

282
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,882
They will never want for anything.

283
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:24,407
He's seen to that.

284
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,075
Well...

285
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:30,611
How long does he have?

286
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:34,419
That is very much the question.

287
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:39,017
He does not want to talk about it,
and every time I bring it up with him...

288
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:44,404
I don't know
that he's fully accepted

289
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:46,018
the reality of it.

290
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,073
And not to sound cold-blooded,

291
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:50,986
but I am running a business here.

292
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:53,197
No, I understand.

293
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:56,562
I have...
a very large investment in this.

294
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:59,634
There is so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down,

295
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,259
not even for a week.

296
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:04,264
So you understand my concern

297
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,941
and my desire for continuity?

298
00:26:08,356 --> 00:26:09,571
I do, absolutely.

299
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,443
Now, I intend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants,

300
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,380
assuming he's physically up to it.

301
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:21,165
But as he cannot or will not

302
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:24,017
tell me how long that might be,

303
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:28,291
I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

304
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:31,772
The worst-case scenario.

305
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,870
I suppose if we had...

306
00:26:42,522 --> 00:26:44,922
at least a few more
cooks together...

307
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,687
You don't think you're ready now?

308
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:50,001
Well,

309
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,680
he is such a...

310
00:26:54,872 --> 00:26:55,822
a master.

311
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,432
There's always more for me to learn.

312
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:05,666
But I'm thinking that if we had...

313
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:10,454
say, one or two more cooks?

314
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,008
One more...

315
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,630
I guess, would do it.
I suppose.

316
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:23,767
I believe in you, Gale.

317
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,707
I know that when the time comes,

318
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:29,617
you will be ready.

319
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
What's up?

320
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:53,477
Walt?
Is there...

321
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:01,054
any particular trick

322
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,079
to purging the catalyst bed?

323
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:07,707
No, it's pretty straightforward.

324
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:09,982
I'll show you when we get there.

325
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:37,056
Yeah.

326
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:40,123
Tell him I'm in conference.

327
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:51,337
- Can't you see I'm in conference?
- I'm looking to find a client of yours.

328
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,180
I was hoping you could
help me out with an address.

329
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:55,649
Which client?

330
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:56,974
Jesse Pinkman.

331
00:28:57,818 --> 00:29:00,668
Jesse Pinkman in the phone
book Jesse Pinkman.

332
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,812
How would one track him down?
I wonder.

333
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:10,642
- You're still here.
- I need your full attention, Saul.

334
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:13,166
Jesse Pinkman current whereabouts.

335
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:17,170
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you can get back to whatever this is.

336
00:29:17,295 --> 00:29:20,645
What am I, eight-grade hall monitor?
"Current whereabouts."

337
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,208
Let me tell you something...

338
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,806
You are good right there.

339
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:28,557
Now, let's both get comfortable.

340
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:35,318
Now, when I say
I'm looking for Pinkman,

341
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:37,293
we both know why, don't we?

342
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:40,672
And you pretending otherwise
only wastes my time

343
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:42,447
and serves to annoy me.

344
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:44,755
Mike, uh,

345
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:47,800
there are rules
to this lawyer thing.

346
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,202
Is that right?

347
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:50,119
Yeah.

348
00:29:50,513 --> 00:29:53,006
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

349
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:55,272
And that's something
I provide for you.

350
00:29:55,397 --> 00:29:57,278
So if I give up Pinkman, well,

351
00:29:57,403 --> 00:29:59,145
then you're gonna be asking

352
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,977
"Old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy.
What's to keep him from giving me up?"

353
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,516
You see?
So then where's the trust?

354
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:09,676
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

355
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,102
Yeah, it's an argument.

356
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:16,226
So...

357
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:20,613
don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

358
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,770
Now tell me where to find him.

359
00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:25,895
You know it's the right thing.

360
00:30:30,943 --> 00:30:32,593
I can't tell you, Mike.

361
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:34,254
All right, I...

362
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:37,676
Look, if I was to tell you,

363
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:40,513
I just...
I couldn't live with myself.

364
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:42,181
I'm sorry.

365
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,726
But who's to say I didn't write

366
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:48,863
the address down in my day planner?

367
00:30:48,988 --> 00:30:52,183
Or on a scratch piece
of paper somewhere?

368
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,331
Who's to say I didn't
write down a location

369
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,262
strictly for my own
professional use?

370
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:03,733
Do not touch anything on my desk.

371
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:07,671
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a Nescafé.

372
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:27,333
I'm just looking out for you,
that's all.

373
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,858
Like a mother hen.

374
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:33,090
Believe me, money laundering
ain't what it used to be.

375
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:34,604
God, do I miss the '80s.

376
00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:36,609
Wasting your time.

377
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:39,040
I'm buying the car wash.
End of story.

378
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:43,006
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so...

379
00:31:58,223 --> 00:31:59,015
Huh?

380
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:00,631
Was I right?

381
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:03,975
Where else are you gonna find
a business that's this much fun?

382
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,500
Unless we're talking
massage parlors,

383
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,160
and I don't see it.

384
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:09,721
Shall we?

385
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,657
You ever actually play laser tag?

386
00:32:19,862 --> 00:32:22,812
It's good cardio.
Plus you get to shoot at kids.

387
00:32:32,423 --> 00:32:34,868
You got your bumper cars
over there down that way.

388
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:37,942
Got your arcade right here.
All the latest video games.

389
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:39,570
Snack bar is over there.

390
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:42,008
Nothing stopping you
from selling beer to the parents.

391
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,652
That's a whole new revenue stream.

392
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:45,549
All right, we're...

393
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:46,724
We're good.

394
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:49,784
Holy Christ.

395
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,409
We're good?

396
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:53,564
This constitutes good
where you're from?

397
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:55,039
My car is bugged.

398
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:56,523
I said maybe... maybe...

399
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:57,754
I'm being followed.

400
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,959
What the hell have
you gotten me into?

401
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:02,455
My very own P.I.
is threatening to break my legs.

402
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,649
That's like Thomas Magnum
threatening

403
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,009
that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

404
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:08,601
Over and above.

405
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:10,880
Service-wise,
this is over and above.

406
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:12,655
You and I survive this,

407
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,026
oh, I'm seriously
rethinking my pricing.

408
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:18,283
And that goes double for you,
Hip-Hop.

409
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:20,947
My guy's no dummy.
Right?

410
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:23,095
So I give us maybe 24 hours before

411
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,708
he figures out
that address goes nowhere.

412
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,333
You guys do your thing.
Make it snappy.

413
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:31,422
I'll go see if they have Tetris
or something.

414
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:41,274
How are you holding up?

415
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:45,354
You?

416
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:48,452
I got my old job back.

417
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:51,926
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

418
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:54,146
He's their boy, huh?

419
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,380
He's their boy.

420
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:59,403
How long you think you've got?

421
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:03,197
Well, he asks a lot of questions

422
00:34:03,322 --> 00:34:04,804
about the cooking process.

423
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:07,932
I try to be as vague as possible,
but I got

424
00:34:08,057 --> 00:34:11,554
that guy Victor watching me,
listening to every word I say.

425
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:14,767
Maybe the only thing
that's saving me

426
00:34:14,892 --> 00:34:17,228
is Gale's fastidiousness.

427
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:19,472
Once he feels confident

428
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:21,797
that he knows my entire method...

429
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:29,622
So what do we do?

430
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,508
You know what we do.

431
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:46,672
There's got to be some other way.

432
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,183
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

433
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:53,903
All right?

434
00:34:54,282 --> 00:34:57,208
I mean, I can't believe
I'm saying that at all,

435
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,730
but for your family?

436
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:02,064
The DEA would love you.

437
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,354
All the shit you could tell them?

438
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,503
Federal Witness Protection,
that's a good deal.

439
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:10,122
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.

440
00:35:11,113 --> 00:35:12,263
I'll make it.

441
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,519
We had a...
We had a good run.

442
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,990
But it's over.

443
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:24,786
Never the DEA.

444
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,682
The cook can't stop.
That's the one thing I'm certain of.

445
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,266
Production cannot stop.

446
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:36,239
Gus can't afford to.

447
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:40,059
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got,

448
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:43,863
then I've got leverage.

449
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:45,825
And leverage keeps me alive.
It keeps

450
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,711
you alive, too.
I think I can see to that.

451
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:53,490
If I'm the only chemist
that he's got.

452
00:36:03,214 --> 00:36:06,953
I can't do it, Mr. White.

453
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,089
Like you said, I'm...

454
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:13,877
I'm not a...

455
00:36:16,347 --> 00:36:17,547
I can't do it.

456
00:36:24,193 --> 00:36:25,243
I'll do it.

457
00:36:28,874 --> 00:36:29,974
I'm gonna...

458
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,208
I'm gonna need your help.

459
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,633
I mean, they're watching me
day and night.

460
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,145
They never leave me alone
with Gale, not for a moment.

461
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:40,727
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

462
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,835
He's not in the phone book.
I can't find him on the Internet.

463
00:36:44,473 --> 00:36:46,185
I can't do it in the lab.

464
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,910
Victor's always there.

465
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:52,214
But if I could just...

466
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:55,704
shake Victor for even
an hour one night,

467
00:36:56,095 --> 00:36:57,595
I think then that...

468
00:36:58,923 --> 00:37:00,373
I may be able to...

469
00:37:04,295 --> 00:37:06,295
make it look like an accident.

470
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,283
There's got to be some other way.

471
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:14,342
I'm all ears.

472
00:37:15,686 --> 00:37:18,684
But when it comes down
to you and me versus him...

473
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:19,809
I'm sorry,

474
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:22,259
I'm truly sorry...

475
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:25,711
but it's gonna be him.

476
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:30,980
You are the only edge that I've got,

477
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:33,900
as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

478
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:35,802
But I need you to track him.

479
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:37,377
Get me his address,

480
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:39,479
and I'll do the rest.

481
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:49,839
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

482
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:57,013
Are you gonna save mine?

483
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,522
<i>Yeah.</i>

484
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:11,925
Please tell me you found him.

485
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,945
<i>6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard,</i>

486
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:16,621
<i>Apartment 6.</i>

487
00:39:20,845 --> 00:39:21,888
<i>You there?</i>

488
00:39:22,164 --> 00:39:22,956
Yeah.

489
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:27,147
6353 Juan Tabo, Number 6.
Got it.

490
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:31,771
He's home?

491
00:39:32,481 --> 00:39:33,273
<i>Yep.</i>

492
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,971
Anyone watching the place?

493
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,044
<i>No. Looks pretty much wide open.</i>

494
00:39:40,698 --> 00:39:42,448
<i>When are you gonna do it?</i>

495
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:47,876
Tonight.

496
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,340
Once it gets dark.

497
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:56,486
<i>Don't do this, Mr. White.</i>

498
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:58,434
<i>Please.</i>

499
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:00,733
<i>Go to the cops.</i>

500
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:34,761
We got a problem.

501
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:37,919
Some kind of chemical
leaking in your lab.

502
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,528
You gotta come with me.

503
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:44,945
I'll, uh... I'll follow you.

504
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,919
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
Come on, get in the car.

505
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,462
I don't know
if it's a barrel leak or what,

506
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,624
but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

507
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,671
After you.

508
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:11,457
Walter, the sooner
you figure out what this is,

509
00:42:11,582 --> 00:42:13,382
the sooner we all go home.

510
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:20,239
Please don't do this.

511
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:22,142
Mike...

512
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:25,239
You don't have to do this.

513
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:29,381
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do, Walter.

514
00:42:30,304 --> 00:42:31,354
Downstairs.

515
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:33,045
I'll cook...

516
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,848
I'll cook for free.
And there won't be any more trouble.

517
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:36,883
I promise you.

518
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:40,025
If I could just talk to Gus,
I know I can make him understand.

519
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,688
If I can talk to Gus...

520
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,657
I can convince him, okay?
Just let me, please...

521
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,574
- Please let me talk to him!
- Shut up!

522
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:47,599
Shut up.

523
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:51,834
I can't do it.

524
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,309
I'm sorry.

525
00:42:57,061 --> 00:42:58,871
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

526
00:42:59,150 --> 00:42:59,946
Okay?

527
00:43:00,071 --> 00:43:02,484
Like you said, he's the problem.
He's always been.

528
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,243
Without him, we would...

529
00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:06,713
And he's in town, all right?

530
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:09,377
He's not in Virginia or wherever
the hell you're looking for him.

531
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,284
He's right here in Albuquerque,

532
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:12,885
and I can take you to him.

533
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:15,148
I'll take you right to him.

534
00:43:18,736 --> 00:43:20,259
- What do you say?
- Where is he?

535
00:43:20,384 --> 00:43:21,794
You give me an address.

536
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,665
I don't... He moves.

537
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,132
He moves around,
but if you let me call him...

538
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,246
Please.

539
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:28,704
No, I just...

540
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:30,063
My phone. I'll just...

541
00:43:30,448 --> 00:43:32,487
It's just my phone.
I'll call him,

542
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,588
and I'll have him meet me.

543
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:36,013
All right? Okay?

544
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:37,893
Okay?

545
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:19,355
Did you do it?

546
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:23,228
<i>Mr. White?</i>

547
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:25,749
<i>Did you do it?</i>

548
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,440
No, I didn't do it.

549
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:30,869
<i>I can't now.</i>

550
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:34,853
- <i>It's gonna have to be you.</i>
- What?

551
00:44:35,497 --> 00:44:38,571
- No way, man.
- <i>Listen. You're closer than we are.</i>

552
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,206
You'll have a 20-minute lead.

553
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,275
They've got me,
they're going to kill me.

554
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,597
- Jesse, do it now! Do it fast!
- Bitch!

555
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:46,145
<i>Do it! Jesse!</i>

556
00:44:55,034 --> 00:44:57,390
Just what the hell was that exactly?

557
00:44:57,515 --> 00:44:59,058
You might want to hold off.

558
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,114
Yeah?

559
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:01,731
Why?

560
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,585
Because your boss is gonna need me.

561
00:45:05,942 --> 00:45:09,378
6353 Juan Tabo,

562
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,864
Apartment 6.

563
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:16,058
Yeah.

564
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:05,140
Hi.
How can I help you?

565
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,680
Take whatever you want.

566
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,421
I have money.
I have...

567
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,692
I got a lot of money.

568
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:22,233
I have...

569
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,684
Please don't do this.

570
00:46:35,524 --> 00:46:37,186
You don't... You...

571
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:40,785
You...

572
00:46:41,895 --> 00:46:43,695
You don't have to do this.
