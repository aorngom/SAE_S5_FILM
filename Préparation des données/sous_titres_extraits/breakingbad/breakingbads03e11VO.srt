<i>Previously on</i> Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:04,378
Grant me this divorce.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,465
Let's kick it back into gear.
Maybe I know a whole new market.

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:10,373
That half a pound we're off by...

5
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:12,470
If they ever found out,

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,263
I won't be able to protect you.

7
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,728
I want security for my family.

8
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,061
Then you have it.

9
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,563
He is a hero and he's not going
to be in a wheelchair.

10
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,815
We can always pay their bills.

11
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,193
Walt came up with a system
for counting cards.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,103
I loved her.

13
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:42,559
Yo, I thought I was going
to see some, like, vaginas.

14
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:49,884
I didn't say she actually
painted vaginas.

15
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:51,927
I said

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,459
some of her paintings
looked like vaginas.

17
00:00:58,707 --> 00:00:59,707
Seriously?

18
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:01,622
Not even close.

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,598
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

20
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:09,859
Everyday items, her surroundings.

21
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:13,590
Some of it evoked

22
00:01:14,353 --> 00:01:15,703
an erotic nature.

23
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,601
It's who she was.

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,699
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

25
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:25,835
This chick have medical issues?

26
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,117
This particular painting...

27
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:31,293
...is of a door.

28
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,757
Any other doors we can check out?

29
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:38,352
Like, real ones or...

30
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,557
You know, I don't get it.

31
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:46,313
Why would anyone paint
a picture of a door

32
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:49,734
over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,902
But it wasn't the same.

34
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,087
Yeah, it was.

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,932
It was the same subject, but
it was different every time.

36
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:59,634
The light was different.
Her mood was different.

37
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,369
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

38
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:05,061
And that's not psycho to you?

39
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:09,198
Well, then, why should we
do anything more than once?

40
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:11,810
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

41
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:15,306
Maybe we should only have sex
once if it's the same thing.

42
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:19,382
Should we just watch one sunset?

43
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,829
Or live just one day.

44
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:26,789
Because it's new every time.
Each time, it's a different experience.

45
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:27,964
Okay, fine.

46
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:32,983
I guess the cow skull
pictures were cool,

47
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:34,927
but a door?

48
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:37,396
I will say it again.

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,021
A door.

50
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:42,649
Why not a door?

51
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,104
Sometimes you get fixated on something,
and you might not even get why.

52
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,999
You open yourself up
and go with the flow,

53
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:52,274
wherever the universe takes you.

54
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,013
Okay, so...

55
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:57,086
the universe took her to a door,

56
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:59,964
and she got all obsessed with it

57
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:04,052
and just had to paint it
20 times until it was perfect.

58
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,786
No, I wouldn't say that.
Nothing's perfect.

59
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:07,938
Yeah?

60
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:09,634
Well...

61
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,229
Oh, yeah.

62
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:14,442
Some things.

63
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:33,093
That was so sweet,
I threw up in my mouth a little bit.

64
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:37,621
You can't admit just
for once that I'm right.

65
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:38,646
Come on.

66
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:42,196
That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over

67
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:44,221
until that stupid door

68
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:45,733
was perfect.

69
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,868
That door was her home,
and she loved it.

70
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:53,203
To me, that's about making
that feeling last.

71

73
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,543
All right, here we go.
You ready?

74
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:37,262
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

75
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Nope.

76
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,022
Nope, that's it.
Take me up.

77
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:48,212
You can do this, Hank.
Come on.

78
00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:52,077
It's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

79
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:53,976
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

80
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,518
If you can get your leg
up that high, I say go for it.

81
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,863
- Take me up.
- All right, coffee break.

82
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:01,098
We're gonna let you rest for a minute.


83
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:03,167
Never mind about your coffee break.

84
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,454
I'm done.

85
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,628
We'll pick up where we left off.

86
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:12,053
Come on, Uncle Hank.
You can do it.

87
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,217
How else are you going
to get out of here?

88
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:16,774
Don't you have any friends?
Jesus, find something better to do.

89
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:20,201
I don't need everyone
staring at me hanging here

90
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:21,737
like a camel's ball sack.

91
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,779
He just wants to be supportive.

92
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:26,154
It's all right.

93
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,769
I'll be right back.
Okay? I'll be right back.

94
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:37,348
You gonna get me out
of here sometime today?

95
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:45,970
We got our first bill,

96
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,598
- and if you're still insistent...
- I am.

97
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:58,742
Prepare yourself.

98
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,883
They're gonna start coming in
weekly like that, so...

99
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,227
Okay.

100
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,504
You're sure you can do this?

101
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:16,525
Yeah.

102
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,180
I'll do that.

103
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:00,657
What the hell, man?

104
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,006
What, I can't work a scale now?

105
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:06,593
This is bullshit.

106
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:08,003
Just say it.

107
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:09,923
Just say the words.

108
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,746
You think I'm stealing.

109
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,397
Walk with who you are.

110
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:33,105
That was a phrase my sponsor
used to use with me

111
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,807
back when I first started
coming to meetings.

112
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:39,986
It's probably just a different
way of saying "Be yourself." Right?

113
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,705
But this idea of "walk"

114
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:45,618
also tells me

115
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,907
that I have to move forward.

116
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:50,052
Always good advice,
at least for me.

117
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:53,991
I see we have some
new people here at group,

118
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,259
a couple new faces.

119
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:56,934
Let's see some hands.

120
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,527
First time?

121
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:07,194
Great.

122
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,262
Welcome.

123
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:11,331
Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

124
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,356
Say whatever's on your mind.

125
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:16,355
How about you?
You want to start us off?

126
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,790
My name is Andrea...

127
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,601
We don't bite.
No judgments.

128
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:33,595
You can be as open and honest
as you want to be.

129
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:38,790
Honestly,
I don't want to be here.

130
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,307
All right.
Fair enough.

131
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:45,816
Who else had their hand up?

132
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:52,826
Hey. 'Sup?

133
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,110
My name's Jesse.

134
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:57,226
Why, hello.

135
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:59,448
My name is Brandon.

136
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,478
And this is, I believe, Peter?

137
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:05,653
Right. I'm Peter.
How are you?

138
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:17,839
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

139
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:20,298
It's gonna get a little
slower smuggling product

140
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:23,043
with Grandpa Anus
watching every move I make.

141
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:26,503
But don't worry.
I'll keep it flowing.

142
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:27,928
Great. Right on.

143
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,139
So how's it selling?

144
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:33,548
Mad volume?

145
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,385
Yeah. It's, uh...

146
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,863
You know, it's, um...

147
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:41,788
It's not so good.

148
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:45,542
What do you mean?
How much have you sold?

149
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,000
I sold a teenth.

150
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:49,408
One teenth?

151
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:51,036
That's it?

152
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:51,953
Yeah.

153
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:53,759
To who?

154
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:55,497
To him.

155
00:09:58,003 --> 00:10:00,178
It's not so easy
selling to these people.

156
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:02,079
They're here trying
to better themselves.

157
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,292
Yeah, there's, like,
positivity and stuff going on here.

158
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:09,421
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two,

159
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:12,223
and you're too pussy to sell?

160
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,660
You're pathetic.

161
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,895
You know what?
I want it back. All of it.

162
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:20,720
I'll sell it myself.

163
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:22,251

Don't be like that.

164
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,136
Selling to these people,
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

165
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,250
It's not natural.

166
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,638
Yeah, Jesse,
it's not easy like you think.

167
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,829
I'll show you exactly
how easy it is.

168
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:54,974
- Sorry.
- No. Go ahead.

169
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:57,057
It's Andrea, right?

170
00:10:58,486 --> 00:10:59,278
Yeah.

171
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:01,973
My name's Jesse,

172
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:05,576
and, uh, I don't really
want to be here, either.

173
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:12,316
Sorry.

174
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:35,446
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

175
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:39,752
Your dad is.

176
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,702
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

177
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:49,805
Are you that boring?

178
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:52,165
I'm comforting.

179
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,638
I'm a comforting presence.

180
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,820
There we go.

181
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:08,057
Hey, so check it out.

182
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,843
See what that means?

183
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:12,481
Check out the date.

184
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:15,800
Next Thursday
is officially six months

185
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:17,875
that I have had my learner's,

186
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,033
which means I can get my provisional

187
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,472
and start driving by myself.

188
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:28,121
Since when? You don't
turn 16 for two more months.

189
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,749
It doesn't matter.
It's a provisional.

190
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,877
Look it up. They changed
the law, like, 10 years ago.

191
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,923
Well, I didn't vote for that.

192
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,846
Doesn't matter if you voted for it.
It's the law.

193
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,636
So both of you start thinking about
what kind of car you want to buy me.

194
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,305
 I'd be good with either

195
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,512
an old IROC or a 'Stang.

196
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:50,951
A 'Stang.

197
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,565
How about something
with playing cards in the spokes?

198
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,944
Makes a nice motor-y sound,
you know?

199
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:03,685
Ah-ah, dad.
You're not gonna get off that easy.

200
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:07,771
Well, I think that this is, um...

201
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:11,823
We should probably table
this discussion for later.

202
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:15,654
Your dad and I have a couple things
we need to talk about, so...

203
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:16,969
Okay.

204
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:22,114
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback

205
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,284
in Grabber Lime

206
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:26,273
with a shaker hood.

207
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:28,271
'Stang.

208
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:30,835
I want to write that down
so I don't forget.

209
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:33,155
Darn it. No pencil!

210
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:01,255
What is
Ice Station Zebra Associates?

211
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:06,780
It's a loan-out.
It's fine.

212
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,011
Whose loan-out?

213
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:12,090
It's fine. Really.

214
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:16,598
I... have a guy.

215
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:18,540
Okay.

216
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:21,672
Does your guy know

217
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:24,036
the tax code and regulations
in New Mexico?

218
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:27,985
'Cause there's very specific paperwork
that has to be submitted quarterly.

219
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,718
Yes. My guy is a top...

220
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,954
- guy.
- Who is he?

221
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:36,012
What's his name?
What are his qualifications?

222
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:40,831
This money has to be unimpeachable

223
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:43,663
when it reaches Hank and Marie.

224
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:45,706
And it is.

225
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,654
- It will be.
- But how do I know that?

226
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,127
Apparently, you can't
even tell me the man's name.

227
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:53,902
Jesus. Skyler,
do you really want to know?

228
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,144
Do you really want to know?

229
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:01,127
Really?

230
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,115
Hello. Welcome.

231
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:38,203
What a pleasure it is to have you.

232
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,395
I'm just gonna call you
Skyler, if that's okay.

233
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,566
It's a lovely name.
Reminds me

234
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,000
of a big beautiful sky.

235
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,384
Walt never told me
how lucky he was...

236
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,093
prior to recent unfortunate events.

237
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,556
Clearly, his taste in women
is the same as his taste in lawyers.

238
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,081
Only the very best

239
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:57,289
with just the right amount of dirty.

240
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:01,032
That's a joke.

241
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,452
That's a joke.

242
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,047
It's funny because you are
so clearly very classy.

243
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,632
Here. Please, sit down.

244
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,928
So Walt tells me that you have

245
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,900
some concerns I can alleviate.

246
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:16,503
Yes, I do. I have...

247
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,019
concerns.

248
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:22,427
If we're going to go down this road,

249
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:25,529
and clearly we are
for the sake of my brother-in-law.

250
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,134
I've heard about him.

251
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:29,819
He's an American hero.

252
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:34,070
At any rate,
I need some assurances

253
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:36,031
that we're gonna go
about this in a manner

254
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:38,741
that is extremely safe and cautious.

255
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,799
Fair enough.
I'll walk you through the process.

256
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:44,377
First step is something
we like to call

257
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,382
money laundering, all right?

258
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,137
Take your money,

259
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,525
represented by, say,
these jelly beans.

260
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:52,564
You know, I'm a bookkeeper,

261
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:55,591
so I actually know
what money laundering is.

262
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:57,923
Well...

263
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,997
And, as with most things,

264
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,708
the devil is in the details.

265
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,183
So to begin with,

266
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:07,936
what are we saying is
the source of this money?

267
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,759
That's simple.

268
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:13,170
Walt here actually
came up with a great story about

269
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,534
gambling winnings.

270
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,059
Blackjack, right?
Some card counting?

271
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:19,395
Actually, that was Skyler's idea.

272
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:22,081
Well,

273
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,542
you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

274
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:27,788
Well, there you have it.
I'll generate

275
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,713
false currency transaction reports

276
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,917
out the wazoo.

277
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:33,598
As well as the necessary W-2Gs.

278
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,072
I know a couple casino managers

279
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,878
who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

280
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,308
It's a win-win for everyone.

281
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,944
Yeah, but you can't
sell that for very long.

282
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:45,524
Way ahead of you.

283
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:48,684
We declare just enough
so as not to arouse suspicion,

284
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,955
then Walt's one-time winnings
become seed money

285
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:53,650
for an investment.

286
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:55,535
Investment in what?

287
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,710
Drum roll please.
Wait for it.

288
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,151
Laser tag.

289
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:04,412
Laser tag.
7,000 square feet

290
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,692
of rollicking fun in the heart
of northern Bernalillo County.

291
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,585
Laser tag?

292
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,058
Yeah. There's guns
and glow lights and...

293
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,893
Kids wear the vests,
and they have to split into teams...

294
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:18,451
Actually, I know what it is.

295
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:21,346
It's just that in relation
to Walt, it's...

296
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:24,525
It doesn't make any sense.

297
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:28,793
It makes more sense than you two.
I'm still trying to figure it out.

298
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:31,068
Do you even know Walt?
I mean...

299
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,185
how would he of all people
buy a laser tag business?

300
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,605
It doesn't add up.

301
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,707
It adds up perfectly.
Walt's a scientist.

302
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:40,482
Scientists love lasers.

303
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,444
Plus they got bumper boats, so...

304
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,081
Hey, everybody.

305
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:48,651
Walt suddenly decided
to invest in laser tag.

306
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,326
Just out of the blue.

307
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:53,149
Really? That's what we're
supposed to tell people,

308
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:56,469
our family, our friends,
the government?

309
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,464
Let me bottom line this for you.
You don't need to be involved.

310
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,077
Because I've been doing this
for a lot of years,

311
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,157
successfully, believe it or not,
without your help.

312
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,994
So thank you for stopping by.

313
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,752
You want a beer or something?

314
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,488
Or something.

315
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:35,868
What do you mean?

316
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,784
Like beer.

317
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,944
I'm clean out of anything else.

318
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,523
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

319
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:49,384
Yeah.

320
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:52,444
I've heard it over

321
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:53,967
and over

322
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:56,167
and over again.

323
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:01,516
You know, don't you think
it's ridiculous

324
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:04,177
that society says beer

325
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:07,299
is okay and a little hit
of something

326
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,574
sweet is wrong?

327
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:11,809
I mean...

328
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,841
What's the point of shutting
yourself off completely

329
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:19,097
from something that
lifts you off the ground?

330
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,064
I spend so much energy

331
00:20:25,902 --> 00:20:29,251
fighting the urge not to use,

332
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:32,465
and I feel like crap because of it.

333
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,666
I know. It's just...

334
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:39,978
What?

335
00:20:42,563 --> 00:20:45,152
I can't get caught using again.

336
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:51,677
See, the thing is...

337
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:55,908
not to get caught.

338
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,441
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

339
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,197
Just a little gas in the tank,

340
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,434
and suddenly...

341
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,290
everything is interesting.

342
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,820
Man, I wish I can make
that feeling last.

343
00:21:23,755 --> 00:21:26,326
Like I said, I got nothing here.

344
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,311
What if I could get some?

345
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,263
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Hey, B!

346
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:45,501
Your Nana brought you home early.

347
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,745
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today.

348
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,460
I was.
Then I saw your car.

349
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,850
- I thought you had a meeting.
- I did, but we changed the time.

350
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:01,524
Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.

351
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:03,149
He's like a sponsor.

352
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:05,178
This is Grandma.

353
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,310
Jesse, this is Brock.

354
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,850
So, you...

355
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:28,965
You have a kid, huh?

356
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,723
What's up?

357
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:33,041
Brock, huh?

358
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:35,788
That's a cool name.

359
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:39,428
Here.
Give it up.

360
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,273
Brock is almost 6.

361
00:22:52,795 --> 00:22:54,890
You okay with kids?

362
00:22:55,598 --> 00:22:57,438
Yeah, he's cool.

363
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,382
Brock is gonna go play in his room
while the big people talk.

364
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,357
He's gonna go play
with his Legos and his cars.

365
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:08,292
- Say "Bye, Jesse."
- Bye, Jesse.

366
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:22,934
Safe and cautious,
that's all I'm asking,

367
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,640
and that man is neither.

368
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:29,845
I'll admit, he comes across
like a circus clown.

369
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:33,214
But he actually knows
what he's doing.

370
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:36,972
Safe and cautious is you
not being involved in this at all.

371
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:39,144
Well, it's a little late on that.

372
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:42,881
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

373
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:53,238
This isn't just about
what happened before.

374
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:59,717
My involvement in this is ongoing.

375
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,769
Understand?

376
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:06,694
I can't just quit.

377
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:11,876
I have something of a contract.

378
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,045
It's all very safe and professional

379
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:17,325
and structured.

380
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,524
I can't simply quit.

381
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:31,302
Where are you going?

382
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,609
If you're gonna
launder money, Walt...

383
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:52,290
At least, do it right.

384
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,058
You worked here four years.

385
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:15,763
It's a business you understand.

386
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,081
It's a story people will believe.

387
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:20,685
Not laser tag. This.

388
00:25:21,494 --> 00:25:22,645
This is what we buy.

389
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,231
You.

390
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,000
This is what you buy.

391
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:01,745
Jesse, right?

392
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,738
- How goes it? Hanging in there?
- Please, just...

393
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:09,275
Dumb-ass.

394
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,487
Sorry, man. I was trying
to keep it on the DL.

395
00:26:14,465 --> 00:26:17,283
You and that girl,
you do the deed yet?

396
00:26:17,712 --> 00:26:18,717
Do what?

397
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,508
You know.

398
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,123
Sell to her.

399
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,584
What are you two even doing here?

400
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,587
What do you mean?

401
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:32,550
You can't get your nut up to sell.

402
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,217
What's the point of even coming?

403
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,053
Homie, I'm on, like, step 5.

404
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,242
Deuce, yo.

405
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,472
I'm catching up.

406
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:46,860
Whatever.

407
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:48,311
Later.

408
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:56,374
Dude needs to come into the fold.

409
00:27:01,907 --> 00:27:03,107
You know what?

410
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,025
I have magical powers.

411
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,924
You want to see?

412
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,089
Ready?

413
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:15,192
That's not real.

414
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:16,676
It is real.

415
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:20,388
You want to see something that's real?
Look at this. Watch this.

416
00:27:22,002 --> 00:27:22,890
Ready?

417
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:30,698
You like that?

418
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,180
That's science and stuff.
Makes it do that.

419
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,625
Do it again.

420
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,251
Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.

421
00:27:38,376 --> 00:27:39,323
It's okay.

422
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,344
It's okay.
Want to see it again?

423
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:43,869
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

424
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:45,684
Firecrackers.

425
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,396
I don't have any firecrackers on me.

426
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:52,122
Who does tricks with firecrackers?

427
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:53,357
Tomás.

428
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:56,961
Tomás does tricks
with firecrackers, huh?

429
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:58,224
Who's Tomás?

430
00:27:58,349 --> 00:27:59,427
He's my kid brother.

431
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:02,805
And we don't talk about him.

432
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,016
Come on.

433
00:28:05,377 --> 00:28:06,684
Eat your food, Brock.

434
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,689
Can I have a chip?

435
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,187
I'm gonna steal your chip.

436
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:13,602
Hey, that's mine.

437
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:18,391
That's it?
That's what you want to buy?

438
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:20,616
People will believe it at least.

439
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:23,696
I worked here for four years.

440
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:25,995
Wax on, wax off.
Was that you?

441
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,489
Hey, how come you guys always get
with the air freshener, huh?

442
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:31,726
I explicitly say
I want no air freshener,

443
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:35,421
and every time I drive away
smelling like an Alpine whorehouse.

444
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,072
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

445
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,127
Makes a better story
than your laser tag.

446
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:46,474
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?

447
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:48,639
She has a point.

448
00:28:48,764 --> 00:28:51,437
It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

449
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:55,176
Based on her years of experience
in money laundering, I suppose.

450
00:28:55,676 --> 00:28:57,052
Let me tell you something.

451
00:28:57,177 --> 00:28:59,630
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

452
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:02,275
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner.

453
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,544
And it worked because I believed it.

454
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:08,037
It has nothing to do with the story.

455
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:12,181
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work
because it doesn't have a Danny.

456
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:13,751
There's no Danny here.

457
00:29:15,524 --> 00:29:17,880
What in God's name is a Danny?

458
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,000
Danny runs the laser tag.

459
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:22,402
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

460
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,192
Where others saw a dirt lot,

461
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:27,329
he saw black lights, rubber aliens,

462
00:29:27,454 --> 00:29:29,850
teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

463
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,811
It was like Bugsy Siegel
in the desert.

464
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,665
And when the stock market took a shit
and Danny got into trouble,

465
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,621
he went searching for exactly the type
of situation that we're offering.

466
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,926
Danny will look the other way

467
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:43,707
to keep his dream afloat.

468
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:46,692
In other words, Danny
can be trusted completely.

469
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:51,297
That guy, the guy with the
eyebrows that won't quit...

470
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:52,622
is he a Danny?

471
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,278
You buy this place,

472
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:58,003
all you got is a big building
that squirts water.

473
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:00,533
You got no Danny here.

474
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:14,620
You want to stay for dinner?

475
00:30:17,252 --> 00:30:18,102
Thanks.

476
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:20,869
What time is it?

477
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:24,191
Early still.

478
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:33,459
What?

479
00:30:34,803 --> 00:30:36,483
I thought maybe,

480
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,801
if you're holding,

481
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:40,426
we can do something.

482
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:43,195
What?

483
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:47,317
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about?

484
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,155
Maybe you had a line on some.

485
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:51,579
Wait.

486
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:54,254
What?

487
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,929
I thought you said
the kid is coming home.

488
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,365
Yeah, in a few hours.

489
00:31:01,472 --> 00:31:03,611
And you seriously want to get high?

490
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,933
I don't know what you're
getting so pissed about.

491
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:08,657
You're the one who brought it up.

492
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,600
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

493
00:31:13,812 --> 00:31:15,372
What kind of mother are you?

494
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:16,501
What?

495
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,003
What kind of mom gets wasted
with a little kid to take care of?

496
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:28,125
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

497
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,871
You gonna come
in my house and judge me?

498
00:31:30,996 --> 00:31:34,099
Like you got no responsibility,
so it's okay for you to get high.

499
00:31:34,537 --> 00:31:36,883
What do you know about me?
I take care of my baby.

500
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:38,521
I'll do anything for him.

501
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,361
The day Brock was born, I swore...

502
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:46,111
I won't let what happened
to Tomás happen to my son.

503
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:49,095
I'll die first.

504
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:51,737
Sorry.

505
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:02,145
Look, I'll get out
of here if you want.

506
00:32:03,374 --> 00:32:05,112
That's what you want to do, then go.

507
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,933
It's not what I want.

508
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:11,027
I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

509
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:24,348
We both were.

510
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:28,718
You're right.

511
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:32,041
I don't know what
you've been through.

512
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,775
You can tell me if you want.

513
00:32:39,403 --> 00:32:41,737
This whole neighborhood
is run by gangs.

514
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:45,319
They run the drugs,
control the streets.

515
00:32:48,814 --> 00:32:50,864
And they sort of took Tomás in.

516
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,722
No dad around.

517
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:57,218
8 years old,

518
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:00,602
they got Tomás slinging.

519
00:33:01,843 --> 00:33:03,243
Part of some crew.

520
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,340
Then, when he was 10...

521
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,907
for some initiation or something...

522
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,410
they made him kill somebody.

523
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:22,646
I heard the rumors.
I didn't believe it at first.

524
00:33:25,895 --> 00:33:27,745
But I saw him a week later.

525
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:34,241
He told me, yeah, he did it.

526
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,740
They gave Tomás a gun.

527
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:41,713
Gave him a choice.

528
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,482
Him or some dude.

529
00:33:46,878 --> 00:33:48,028
So he did it.

530
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,848
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

531
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,134
Who did he say he killed?

532
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,119
Some dealer...

533
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,124
from some outside crew.

534
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:06,728
Right around the corner from here,

535
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:08,403
over off the Central.

536
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:14,134
Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

537
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,320
Off the Central?

538
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,698
Like, over by the train tracks?

539
00:34:27,304 --> 00:34:28,504
When was this?

540
00:34:30,504 --> 00:34:31,904
A few months back.

541
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,630
What else did he tell you?

542
00:34:44,064 --> 00:34:46,358
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

543
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,114
Shot him dead.

544
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:55,640
Just because he was
working the wrong corner.

545
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,492
It won't happen again.

546
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:06,475
Not to my son.

547
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:24,773
Guess what.

548
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,292
People who say "Guess what"

549
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,756
and then actually
expect you to guess...

550
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:32,691
I hate those people.

551
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:34,757
Well, I just heard

552
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,990
about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank

553
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:42,846
who is going to be released
at the end of this week.

554
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:45,312
Isn't that fantastic?

555
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,813
Are they planning on rolling me
out the front door at least,

556
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,378
or they'll put me on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

557
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:59,039
Listen, I don't care what any damned
insurance company thinks.

558
00:35:59,536 --> 00:36:01,344
I'm not leaving here until I'm well.

559
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:03,724
Hank, this isn't about insurance.

560
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:05,927
I've talked to everybody,
and they all say

561
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:08,165
that you are healthy
enough to go home.

562
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,962
Oh, I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.

563
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:12,085
Hank, you get stronger every day.

564
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,525
You don't need to be in a hospital.

565
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,162
In this condition, yeah, I do.

566
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:20,742
You'll be just as comfortable
at home as you are here.

567
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:24,246
- You'll have all the same equipment...
- All the same equipment?

568
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,142
The equipment that you have here,
that you need.

569
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,484
Short term.

570
00:36:28,994 --> 00:36:32,022
You'll do your PT at home,
and it will be great,

571
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,204
because you'll be home.

572
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:36,927
Wait till you see the bedroom.

573
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,711
I had them move the plasma in.

574
00:36:38,836 --> 00:36:40,987
I know that's how
you always wanted it.

575
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:43,334
You only had to get shot
to get it, right?

576
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,536
I got you a new bed.

577
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,911
A hospital bed?

578
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,958
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

579
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:55,712
You'll be home.

580
00:36:56,511 --> 00:36:58,461
You get that out of my house.

581
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:00,635
You hear me, Marie?

582
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:02,198
Today.

583
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,121
I leave this hospital

584
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:09,631
when I walk out of here,
you understand?

585
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:12,925
And not before.

586
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:18,205
What's a Danny?

587
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,825
Danny is an accomplice,

588
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,938
someone who's in on the scheme,

589
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,301
who knows about laundering,

590
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,203
who's paid to look the other way.

591
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,081
Now, while I agree with you

592
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,249
that laser tag is a hard sell,

593
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,020
without a Danny,

594
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:37,421
the car wash isn't really an option.

595
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:41,842
He can't get you another Danny
to run the car wash?

596
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:44,497
Easier said than done,

597
00:37:44,953 --> 00:37:47,553
if we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

598
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:02,738
What about me?

599
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,310
What about you?

600
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:09,661
Me.

601
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:13,123
I'll be the Danny.

602
00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:16,752
No, Skyler.
That is not a good idea.

603
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,212
I'm perfectly capable
of managing a small business.

604
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,271
A legal business, not this.

605
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:22,674
Who else could we trust?

606
00:38:25,373 --> 00:38:26,473
I'm in this.

607
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:29,932
And if I'm in it,
I'm going to do it right.

608
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,434
You are not in this.
You are not...

609
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,937
- We're married. How am I not in this?
- We are not married.

610
00:38:35,642 --> 00:38:36,772
We're divorced.

611
00:38:46,002 --> 00:38:46,802
Right?

612
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:53,283
I never actually got around to...

613
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:55,403
filing the papers.

614
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:03,099
Married couples can't be compelled
to testify against one another.

615
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:07,451
So there's that.

616
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:38,381
Respirator.

617
00:39:40,163 --> 00:39:40,963
Right.

618
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:17,385
I'll be there.

619
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,830
What was that?

620
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:25,468
An invitation.

621
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,903
You're right on time.

622
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,371
Please, come in.

623
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:00,559
I hope you like <i>paila marina.</i>

624
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:03,389
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

625
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:09,716
It sounds like a cliché, but indeed,
it's like my mother used to make it.

626
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,504
Come on.

627
00:41:16,051 --> 00:41:17,681
You can help me cook.

628
00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:22,565
This is a Chilean dish

629
00:41:23,162 --> 00:41:26,483
that I love,
but I never get to make it.

630
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:30,320
The kids won't eat it.

631
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:35,659
You know how that is.

632
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:37,786
Sure.

633
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:43,509
Do you mind?

634
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:46,587
Would you slice the garlic?

635
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:50,416
Very thin.

636
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,016
Why did you invite me here?

637
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:04,986
We're working together.

638
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:07,376
Why not break bread together?

639
00:42:09,654 --> 00:42:11,364
Now the garlic.

640
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:33,216
It always amazes me the way the senses
work in connection to memory.

641
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:36,710
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

642
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:40,213
Taken separately, these ingredients
alone don't remind me of anything.

643
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,059
Not very much at all.

644
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,618
But, in this precise combination,

645
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:49,365
the smell of this meal, instantly...

646
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,056
it brings me back to my childhood.

647
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,612
How is that possible?

648
00:42:54,898 --> 00:42:57,240
Basically, it all takes place
in the hippocampus.

649
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:01,417
Neural connections are formed.

650
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,306
The senses make the neurons express

651
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:07,959
signals

652
00:43:08,261 --> 00:43:12,238
that go right back to the same part
of the brain as before,

653
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,107
where memory is stored.

654
00:43:16,156 --> 00:43:17,969
That's something called

655
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,442
relational memory.

656
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,544
Don't quote me on that.

657
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:29,129
I'm rusty on my biology.

658
00:43:30,283 --> 00:43:32,019
That's very interesting.

659
00:43:37,606 --> 00:43:39,950
I would like to help you,
if I could.

660
00:43:42,032 --> 00:43:43,132
Help me how?

661
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,692
When I first started out,
I made a lot of mistakes.

662
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,794
More than I care to admit.

663
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,111
I wish I'd had someone to advise me.

664
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:58,343
Because this life of ours,

665
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,732
it can overwhelm.

666
00:44:05,565 --> 00:44:07,365
You are a wealthy man now.

667
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:11,629
And one must learn to be rich.

668
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:14,561
To be poor, anyone can manage.

669
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,038
What advice do you have for me?

670
00:44:23,711 --> 00:44:25,908
Never make the same mistake twice.

671
00:45:10,484 --> 00:45:11,484
What's up?

672
00:45:14,276 --> 00:45:15,503
You Tomás?

673
00:45:15,918 --> 00:45:17,568
Heard you were the man.

674
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:19,278
Yeah? What you want?

675
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:23,853
Crystal.

676
00:45:25,252 --> 00:45:27,015
You think you could hook me up?

677
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:30,629
- 300.
- For a teenth?

678
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,506
Shit, come on, yo.

679
00:45:33,495 --> 00:45:34,500
300.

680
00:45:56,718 --> 00:45:58,209
Hey, what's up?

681
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,579
Bounce.
