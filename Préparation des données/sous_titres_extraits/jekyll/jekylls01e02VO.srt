1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,915
Come to my family again
and you and I are at war.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,836
<i>How soon can we bring him in?</i>

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,831
We can't just pull him off the streets.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,039
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,
I thought you were Tom.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,997
Daddy! Daddy!

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,280
You can be anything
you want to be, Mr Hyde.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,835
Jekyll and Hyde. The comparison
has occurred to me, but this is fiction.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,273
Any idea who might be bribing us,
Dr Jackman?

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,635
Or who might be following
you in a black van?

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,755
He's got a knife. Minimum necessary
force. You understand me?

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,838
OK, OK, a quick half, then.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,230
I've got to go home and change.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,398
Unscheduled change, he's coming.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,074
What triggered it this time?

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,794
You might at least have had the decency
to be having an affair.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,632
<i> I'm not sure how strong he is.</i>

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,109
<i> Strength isn't usually a variable.</i>

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,032
- Sorry?
- In cases like this.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,158
There aren't any cases like this.

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,673
Good luck, Miss Reimer.

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,354
Goodnight, Dr Jackman.

22
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,755
Who are you?

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,115
You know who I am.
You brought me here.

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,919
No I didn't. Who are you?

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,513
We were just talking.

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,831
That wasn't me. Who are you?

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,399
Ooh, nice.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,835
It's not your usual perfume,
there's another one.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,753
Special scent for today, then?

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,753
For him?

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,352
For me?

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,950
<i> The woman sitting
opposite you is Katherine Reimer.</i>

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,315
<i>She's a psychiatric nurse...</i>

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,673
<i>...with experience in related areas.</i>

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,959
# It's raining, it's pouring
Jackman is boring #

36
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,429
He was talking about me.
I'm Katherine Reimer.

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,716
- Is he doing you?
- No.

38
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,077
- Can I?
- No.

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,516
- Then what are you for?
- I'm your new nanny.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,150
Oh, Mary Poppins, I love Mary Poppins!
I could eat Mary Poppins!

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,359
I'm here to work for you.

42
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,154
For both of you, if you approve.
You have a vote too.

43
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,869
- What, we're getting in help now?
- I have references

44
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,952
and I can start immediately
if that suits.

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,192
If you have any questions,
I'd be happy to answer them.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,079
- Am I interviewing you?
- Yes.

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,153
- Why do you want this job, Ms Poppins?
- It's interesting. Clearly unique.

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,389
It's an opportunity...

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,269
# She's talking, she's lying
She's telling a tale and she's dying #

50
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,238
- Why do you say I'm lying?
- Your heart rate just went up.

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,152
Pitter, patter, pitter, patter!

52
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,836
I want this job because it's
a unique opportunity. Next question.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,115
Why is it unique?

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,722
When I spoke to Dr Jackman,

55
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:44,434
I assumed this was a simple case
of split personality.

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,319
But there's a physical change too,
isn't there?

57
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,670
You've got darker hair,

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,195
a different hairline.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,879
Your eyes are darker too, very dark.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,689
Hard to tell, you're sitting down...

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,674
...but I'd say you're, what,
a couple of inches taller?

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,713
A few pounds lighter too,
that's got to be handy.

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,112
Oh, and you've got a slightly
different jaw line. Next question.

64
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,748
- Why did you lie to me?
- I'm sorry?

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,673
When I asked you why you wanted
the job, why did you lie?

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm sorry, I didn't...

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,039
Rule one. Don't ever lie to me!
I can smell lies.

68
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,674
Thing is, darling, I don't care
why you want the job,

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,798
don't mind if you've got secrets
or if you don't answer my questions.

70
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,394
Don't answer many questions myself.
But don't...

71
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,070
...don't ever...

72
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,715
...lie to me.

73
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,233
Now. Why do you really want this job?

74
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,149
Don't open your mouth unless
you're telling me the truth.

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,709
Good girl.

76
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,634
Good girl, Mary Poppins,
you're learning.

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,270
- Love a girl with secrets.
- Next question.

78
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,635
- Can you release me from this chair?
- I can.

79
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,358
- Will you?
- Do I have a job?

80
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,750
- Release me.
- What happens if I do?

81
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,391
- Find out.
- Going to need some assurances.

82
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,998
The lights and cameras on.
You're safe if the lights are on

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,913
and Daddy can see me.

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,716
Look away.

85
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,467
Keep going.

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,316
So here's the deal.

87
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,278
Here's the "job".

88
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,352
As long as the lights
and cameras are on, you're safe.

89
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,919
Lights out...

90
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,791
...you're dinner.

91
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,920
What do you think?

92
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,477
I think you must have quite an appetite.

93
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,195
Tee hee hee.

94
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,637
Gonna watch telly before I go out.

95
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,837
There's beers in the fridge,
bring several.

96
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,835
Welcome to the company, Mary Poppins!

97
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,437
How many times?

98
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,239
You feel an unscheduled change coming,

99
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,891
you tell me where I am!

100
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,634
Yes, no problem at all.
I'll speak to you later. OK, bye bye.

101
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,879
Sir?

102
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,554
She left, sir.

103
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,395
Fine, good. Well, um...
can I have the bill, please?

104
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,994
You've already paid.

105
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,038
Yes, yes, of course I have.

106
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,196
Ah, you go to the gents, you come back,

107
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,510
you're a changed man.
We've all been there.

108
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,908
Right.

109
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,470
Happen to know where I parked?

110
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,630
You could have told me
I was seeing someone.

111
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,234
- Lose your keys again?
- Where does he leave them?

112
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,799
So who is she?

113
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,236
He's left-handed. Why can't
either of you check the other pocket?

114
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,235
- Who is she?
- I keep your secrets, I keep his too.

115
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,949
- I know he sees lots of women.
- "Sees" is a nice word.

116
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,509
I need to know if he's got
a relationship.

117
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,399
- Why is this one a relationship?
- Dinner, no sex.

118
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,634
Oh. Have you been drinking?
Don't tell me you took the car.

119
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,951
He drank. He took the car.
Why am I getting the look?

120
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,157
- How was your driving?
- Expressive.

121
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,596
I gave you a breathalyser.
You don't know where you've been.

122
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,512
- Ta.
- It's enough to have the curse.

123
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,557
You don't need to lose your licence!

124
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,915
- Is this the tea I like?
- It's the same tea.

125
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,311
- Tastes like the other one.
- There isn't another one.

126
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,675
I wasn't due this evening,
I owe him the time.

127
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,876
He can have it any time,
but not tomorrow.

128
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,990
I'll tell him.

129
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:01,510
Can't believe
he's calling himself Hyde.

130
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,353
- He read the book. He liked it.
- Liked it? Read it?!

131
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,193
Made him laugh.

132
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,672
So what's she like? Have you met her?

133
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,839
Has he brought her home to Mummy?

134
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,908
That information's off limits,
Dr Jackman.

135
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,595
- I'll listen to the audio logs.
- He asked for 3 hours off the recorder.

136
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,957
The GPS shows he didn't
change location during that time.

137
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,793
All within the terms of your agreement.

138
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,927
He's entitled to a private life.

139
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,033
I'm not allowed to know
who I'm dating?!

140
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,509
- You didn't tell him he was married.
- I'M married!

141
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,035
- HE'S dating someone.
- He's met my wife and kids.

142
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,966
I can't get equal rights with myself!

143
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,990
He saw your family.
He's kept away since.

144
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,436
He made a promise and he's keeping it.

145
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,559
Only because I kept him
in the chair for a week.

146
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,710
He does get angry, doesn't he?

147
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,233
Yes.

148
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,711
You're safe here, Katherine,
the cameras.

149
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,824
He's capable of anything, but only
if he thinks he can get away with it.

150
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,879
I know what he's like, Dr Jackman.
I've met him.

151
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,869
- Definitely tastes like the other tea.
- There's only one tea.

152
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:19,032
Excuse me.

153
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,599
Hello? No, you're early, but it's fine.

154
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,389
I told you, there'll be no
after effects, it's a low dosage.

155
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,599
It causes amnesia, he won't remember
a thing since he got back here.

156
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:37,320
Later.

157
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,197
<i>It causes amnesia, he won't remember</i>
<i>a thing since he got back here.</i>

158
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,917
<i> I still don't understand</i>
<i>why you had to drug him.</i>

159
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,596
Because I've got every key
in the flat except one.

160
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,715
Still trying to take down the security.
It's like Big Brother in here.

161
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,348
He's got too many safeguards,
I'm cutting the power.

162
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,750
<i>- Is that safe?</i>
- Of course it's not safe.

163
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,629
He won't be under for long, and I don't
know who he'll be when he wakes up,

164
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,836
so no offence...

165
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,638
You win. I believe you.
Your letter was in the box.

166
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,794
Did you hear me? I believe you.

167
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,995
<i> Hello, Katherine.</i>

168
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,190
Mr Hyde?

169
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,232
<i>Jackman's in bed now. Hyde is awake.</i>
<i>And you're dead now.</i>

170
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,413
<i>You knocked him out, didn't you?</i>

171
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:55,990
<i>Silly little Katherine,
silly little dead girl.</i>

172
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,596
<i>When the Doctor is out, I'm in.</i>

173
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,834
<i>Oh, Katherine, alone at last!</i>

174
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,275
Mr Hyde, you don't play these games,
not with me.

175
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,032
You've always had more sense.

176
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,954
<i>You know what I've got now? You.</i>

177
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,838
Ohh...

178
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,797
<i>I've also got the main fuse.</i>

179
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,238
<i>Yep. Took your keys.</i>

180
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,790
<i>Yep, took my keys</i> too.

181
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,820
<i>Well, lookee here, Katherine!</i>

182
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,795
<i>Everything you need
for the perfect night in.</i>

183
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,192
<i>A beautiful woman,</i>
<i>a locked door and soundproofing.</i>

184
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,112
- You won't hurt me.
<i>- I'll eat you.</i>

185
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,317
You know the rules. You hurt me,
anyone, he turns himself in!

186
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,811
<i>- You turned off the cameras.</i>
- Anything happens to me,

187
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,433
you think he won't know it was you?

188
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,750
<i>- You're guessing.</i>
- I know how he thinks.

189
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,478
<i>I am how he thinks.</i>

190
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,552
Then you've got a problem.
Because you like me.

191
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,894
<i>Bet your life.</i>

192
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,633
Are you messing with me?

193
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,597
- Ten.
- What?

194
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,354
- Nine.
- What is this? What are you doing?

195
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,476
Eight.

196
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,631
Seven.

197
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,358
What are you doing?

198
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Six.

199
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,275
Five.

200
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,194
- No!
- Four.

201
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,392
Three.

202
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,996
Two!

203
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,551
Come to Daddy!

204
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,760
# She's running, she's crying

205
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,550
# She's turned out the lights,
she's dying #

206
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
No!

207
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,870
If I tell you who I am,
you won't kill me.

208
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,233
Are you listening? If I tell you
who I am, and who sent me here,

209
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,552
you'll turn the lights back on,
the cameras, you won't hurt me.

210
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,277
Go on, then. Try me.
Ask me who sent me here.

211
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,399
We need to do this.
We need a slam dunk.

212
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,870
This is the slam dunk. All respect,
but we're running out of time.

213
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,430
<i> Mr Lennox, we have already</i>
<i>waited over 100 years.</i>

214
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,717
That's awesome, truly awesome.
100 years, respect!

215
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,077
Love those numbers. But if we don't
move now, we're gonna lose him.

216
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,870
- We'll be waiting another 100 years.
<i>- I've reviewed your proposal.</i>

217
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,519
<i>What if the child dies?</i>

218
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,355
He's got two kids, he's got twins.
He's got like a kid and a buffer kid.

219
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,476
He's got a margin-for-error kid.

220
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,552
<i>The children are potentially important.</i>
<i>Both of them.</i>

221
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,314
Hearing that,
but we are managing our risks.

222
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,152
We are gonna contain and control.

223
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,754
<i>And if you can't?</i>

224
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,388
My neck on the line. My personal neck.

225
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,835
Love my neck, won't
let anything happen to it.

226
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,595
Contain and control, listen to the neck.

227
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,433
<i>What's the hurry?</i>

228
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,711
Tom Jackman is 41.

229
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,519
Now, I've got a floor full
of people running numbers,

230
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,195
telling me shit about genetic damage,
about what the change is doing to him.

231
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,271
None of them thinks he'll make 43.

232
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,590
Some of them don't think
he'll make Wednesday.

233
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,393
That, with respect, with all respect, is
what the hurry is. We need to do this.

234
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,553
You can...

235
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,028
Thank you.

236
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,953
Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you.

237
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,356
She said yes. Buy the zoo!

238
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,754
Feeling a bit weird. Don't really
remember getting home last night.

239
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,831
He hasn't been
taking drugs again, has he?

240
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,673
Don't think so.

241
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:07,118
OK. Tell him next time I wake up feeling
like this, I'm peeing in a bottle.

242
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,635
Yes, Dr Jackman.

243
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,437
- You OK?
- Yeah, sure.

244
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:28,479
- What's wrong?
- Sorry. Jumpy today. It's nothing.

245
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,278
Time of the month?

246
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,274
Bit rich, coming from the wolf man.

247
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,789
- See you later.
- See you.

248
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,190
Daddy! Daddy!

249
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,113
Uncle Billy!

250
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,197
- Hello, boys.
- Where did Uncle Billy go?

251
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,352
Sorry, no Uncle Billy.
He says he'll come another day.

252
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,478
But I saw him,
he was sitting right next to you.

253
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,631
No, he wasn't.

254
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,713
- I did, I saw him!
- He's not there, stupid!

255
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,553
- I saw him!
- Come on, boys, in you go.

256
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,757
- Tom!
- Peter.

257
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,319
What are you doing here?

258
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,359
Oh, you know,
I just thought I'd drop by.

259
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,432
- What, socially?
- What's wrong with that?

260
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,477
You.

261
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,076
Heard there was a zoo trip, thought
I'd help look after the boys.

262
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,753
That all right?

263
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,833
Extra pair of hands.
Didn't think you'd mind.

264
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,312
Well, that's all settled then. Come on,
you two, let's get you strapped in.

265
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,635
Am I being set up for a man-to-man?

266
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,678
Well, you don't have them
with me any more.

267
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,355
Peter at a zoo?! He's wearing a suit.
Who wears a suit to the zoo?

268
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,750
Have a good time.

269
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,233
Sorry. Rules of estrangement.
Do we kiss now? I've forgotten.

270
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,871
- I'll have them back by six.
- OK, no kissing. Filed.

271
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,710
Eddie, be careful.

272
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,911
Come on, Harry.

273
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,674
Daddy, I want chips.

274
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,274
In you go, help Daddy find a table.

275
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,238
Eddie, wait for me.

276
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,030
Eddie, wipe your nose.

277
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,156
- Why?
- It's running.

278
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,996
- But I'm eating.
- And not just food, wipe your nose.

279
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,358
Is it always like this? The... eating.

280
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,276
Sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

281
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,796
No, no, no. Just sharing
your food at speed.

282
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,839
Will you for God's sake
wipe your nose?!

283
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,393
What's wrong?

284
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,075
Eddie, what's wrong?

285
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,352
- You shouted at him.
- No, I didn't. Of course I didn't.

286
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,114
I didn't shout at anyone.

287
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,836
Are you awake?

288
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,633
- Something wrong?
- No.

289
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,355
So, since when have you
been an animal lover?

290
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,919
I hunt every summer.

291
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,153
That's not exactly loving them, is it?
That's more shooting them.

292
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,518
Well, it's a brief relationship.

293
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,078
Right, out you come.

294
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,118
Harry, you go with Uncle Peter.
Eddie, you come with me.

295
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,989
Come on, Harry, careful now. Good boy.

296
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,639
That's it.

297
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,554
Tom. What's wrong?

298
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,470
Nothing, probably nothing.
Just being paranoid.

299
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,517
Right you lot, let's go to the zoo.

300
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,194
What's paranoid?

301
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:45,958
When you think everyone's
out to get you.

302
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,871
Wolf! Wolf...

303
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,670
Wolf, wolf!

304
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,110
What's wrong with it?

305
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,197
The meat wasn't fresh. There's really
no excuse for that in a zoo.

306
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,157
Daddy, Eddie's nose is running.

307
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,952
Eddie, not your jumper, use a tissue.
In your pocket there's a tissue.

308
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,792
Which child?

309
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,390
How about the snotty one?

310
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,751
Eddie, use the tissue.

311
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,356
<i> If you had to lose a kid,</i>
<i>I'd guess you'd choose the snotty one.</i>

312
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,638
Let's make this work, people.

313
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,282
Our last and best chance
for a long time,

314
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:43,920
according to our man on the inside.

315
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,510
I'm on my way, but, listen, I'm not
sure about any of this any more.

316
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,030
It's too late now Katherine.

317
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,428
I'm at the café.

318
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,116
It's like a leaky tap, your nose,
do you know that? It's like a leaky tap.

319
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,113
We'll to have to send you
back to the factory, get it mended.

320
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,876
Yeah, the man'll come and take him away,
won't he, Daddy, to the factory.

321
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,190
Now, use the tissue, OK? Not your coat.

322
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,272
But I don't want to go to the factory!

323
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,195
No, no, you're not going to the factory.
There is no factory. I'm joking, OK?

324
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,750
Big, silly Daddy joke. All right?

325
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,950
So. You walk out on your wife.
Now there's an Uncle Billy.

326
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,634
Good-Iooking young man, I hear.

327
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,074
You don't think? Claire doesn't think?

328
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,704
- Claire thinks he's your relative.
- People have relatives.

329
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:57,075
You don't.

330
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,236
You were found at a station
at six months old.

331
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,152
- I know.
- No family, no relatives,

332
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,588
you didn't even have
a bloody train ticket.

333
00:29:07,688 --> 00:29:10,997
So, who is Uncle Billy?

334
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,959
I've been your friend for years.
More than your friend.

335
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,875
- My boss, in fact.
- Your benefactor.

336
00:29:19,012 --> 00:29:20,112
Got you a job, a life.

337
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,041
So I'm obliged
to tell you everything?

338
00:29:22,158 --> 00:29:25,718
No, no, no.
I think I'm obliged to listen.

339
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,193
Tom, you have to trust someone.

340
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,196
Eddie, stop it. Daddy. Daddy.

341
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,397
- Is that yours or mine?
- Is what?

342
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,199
- It's mine, hang on.
- Hello, who is this?

343
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,237
<i>- Dr Jackman, it's me.</i>
- Katherine?

344
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,834
Hyde's awake.

345
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,438
I'm sorry?

346
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,948
<i>He's awake, Hyde,
in your head right now.</i>

347
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,478
What are you talking about?

348
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,870
<i>Can we talk? Are you alone?</i>

349
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,713
I'm at the zoo, I'm with my kids.

350
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,791
<i>Go somewhere we can talk.</i>

351
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,833
I have to take this call.
You'll keep an eye on the boys?

352
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,592
Sure.

353
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,078
- OK.
<i>- Are you alone?</i>

354
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,589
I'm at the zoo.
What do you mean, he's awake?

355
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,239
He can't be if I am.

356
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,710
<i>That's not what you thought</i>
<i>when you shouted at Eddie.</i>

357
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,440
<i>You thought it might have been</i>
<i>Hyde then, didn't you?</i>

358
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,398
- How do you know?
<i>- And when you arrived at the house,</i>

359
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,916
<i>Eddie thought he saw Hyde</i>
<i>in the passenger seat, remember?</i>

360
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,073
<i>Could have been some kind of</i>
<i>psychic impression? Sensitive child?</i>

361
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,236
- Katherine, how do you know about that?
<i>- He's awake in your head, right now.</i>

362
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,392
- He can't be.
<i>- He's awake. Look at your phone.</i>

363
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,711
- My phone?
<i>- Look at it!</i>

364
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,192
<i>It's not connected.</i>
<i>So the question is, Dr Jackman,</i>

365
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,238
<i>how can I be phoning you</i>
<i>if your phone isn't connected?</i>

366
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,256
<i>How is that physically possible?</i>

367
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,790
<i>How is that possible, Dr Jackman?</i>

368
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,916
<i>How is that possible?</i>

369
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,469
<i>How is that possible?</i>

370
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,709
<i>How is that possible...</i>

371
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,871
<i>... Daddy?</i>

372
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,438
How can you be phoning me?

373
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,434
<i> Jesus, I'm not phoning you,</i>
<i>I'm in your head.</i>

374
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,433
<i>Keep the phone at your ear,</i>
<i>people will think we're schizo.</i>

375
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,674
What, schizo? Do you think?
I just took a call from my own id!

376
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,917
Wh... why aren't you asleep?

377
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,757
<i>There's something in our bloodstream,</i>
<i>keeping me awake. Something new, a drug.</i>

378
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,673
<i>- Ooh, tickles.</i>
- You can feel your blood?

379
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,717
<i>- You can't do that?</i>
- Who drugged us?

380
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,110
<i>- That's not why I called.</i>
- You had a reason?

381
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,397
<i>I'm your dark side,
it's not like we chat.</i>

382
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,354
- What was that?
<i>- Pulled it from your memory.</i>

383
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,192
<i>- Who are those guys?</i>
- Which guys?

384
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,396
<i>THOSE guys.</i>

385
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,993
- How do you do that?
<i>- You can't do that?</i>

386
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,871
- They're following me.
<i>- Not you.</i>

387
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,440
- Eddie!
<i>- Yeah, 'cause remember...</i>

388
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,068
<i> "I don't want</i>
<i>to go to the factory."</i>

389
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,355
<i>"I don't want to go to the factory."</i>

390
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,750
What is this? What's happening?

391
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,399
Daddy! Daddy!

392
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,632
Stop doing his voice, stop it!

393
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,759
<i>- I have.</i>
- Daddy! Daddy!

394
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,877
- Eddie?
- Daddy, Daddy!

395
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,470
Eddie.

396
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,230
Stay there. Don't move.

397
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,634
- Daddy, where are you going?
- My son's in there.

398
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,190
My son's in there with the lions.
We've got to get him out!

399
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,310
My son's in there! Please, you've got
to help me! I need your help!

400
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,119
My son's in there!

401
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,352
Wh? What are you doing?

402
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,399
Who are you? What do you want?
What do you want?

403
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,472
<i>Me. They want me.</i>

404
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,631
OK, take me! Take him, take Hyde,

405
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,472
Just get my son out of there!

406
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,596
<i>- They took the snotty one.</i>
- Eddie!

407
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,035
<i>That shows consideration.</i>

408
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,515
Eddie! Eddie!

409
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,716
It's OK, son.

410
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,388
Oh, God! Eddie...

411
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,950
Daddy!

412
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,432
Daddy!

413
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,397
- He's gone in.
- Has he changed?

414
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,993
I don't know!

415
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,390
I take responsibility
for any mistakes today,

416
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,516
which means I fire everybody!

417
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,557
You said this would work!
Has he changed?

418
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,278
- What the hell was that?
- Jesus!

419
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,109
Oh, my God! Shit!

420
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,475
I'm going out on a limb here,

421
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,437
he's changed.

422
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,711
What's he doing?

423
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,476
He just threw a lion over a wall.
Anything he likes.

424
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,313
Give it up for a ballsy song choice.

425
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,799
- There's a note.
- What?

426
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,349
On the lion, there's a note.

427
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,909
- Well...
- What?

428
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,390
Get the note from the lion.

429
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,438
#... the lion sleeps tonight

430
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,232
# Oh-we-oh-we-oh
We-um-um-a-way...

431
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,311
- It's for you.
- What, me?

432
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,278
"Dear Benjamin,
meet me in the lions' den."

433
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,079
He can't be serious.

434
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,110
He sent a note with a dead lion. How
much more serious do you get?

435
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,838
"PS Alone."

436
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,279
Well, I've got several clear lines
of sight. I'll get my best shots on it.

437
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,037
Don't kill him, or me.

438
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,236
In that order.

439
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,756
Clean up the van.

440
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,114
#... um-um-a-way

441
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,798
# In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight

442
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,548
# In the jungle, the quiet jungle
The lion sleeps tonight...

443
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,994
Mr Hyde.

444
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,314
#... Oh-we-oh-we-oh
We-um... #

445
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,596
Ever killed anyone Benjamin?

446
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,593
Not personally, I have people.

447
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,676
You're missing out.
It's like sex, only there's a winner.

448
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,799
Thought you might be here somewhere.
Come in.

449
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,978
You know what,
I'm doing fine just here.

450
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:53,715
You nervous, Benjamin?

451
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,158
Ner? Not nervous,
no, no, I'm just a little... lion aware.

452
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,916
Not nice to turn down
someone's hospitality, Benjamin.

453
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,277
I've got my pride.

454
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,355
- You can control them?
- They're just lions. Can't you?

455
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,957
Kid seems a little freaked.

456
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,273
Yeah, what can you do?
Somebody tried to feed him to a lion.

457
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,309
Yeah, sorry about that.
Just an experiment.

458
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,674
A what?

459
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,070
We wanted to precipitate the change.

460
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,708
As we understand it,
placing your child in danger,

461
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,476
especially the primal kind of danger,
the threat of a savage beast,

462
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,909
would create exactly the right chemical
conditions to bring us, well, you.

463
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,915
Why should I care if the kid's
in danger? Have you seen his nose?

464
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,359
- Well, you did just save his life.
- No! I killed a lion.

465
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,999
There's a difference.

466
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,078
You know what?
You don't have to care about him.

467
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,677
Tom Jackman cares. So you came.

468
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,311
So you took over a whole zoo
for an experiment?

469
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,879
It's our zoo.

470
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,945
What?

471
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:31,112
We didn't have to take it out,
it's ours.

472
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,748
- Since when?
- This morning.

473
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,549
Tom Jackman bought tickets,
we bought the zoo.

474
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,553
What, you thought we sent
in a SWAT team?

475
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,871
Money is the new war.

476
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,197
That's who you're talking to.
That's what we can do.

477
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,830
Which of your guys put my son in here?

478
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,551
- Why do you want to know?
- I don't. Tom Jackman does.

479
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,597
He's awake, I can feel him.

480
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,548
Tickles.

481
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,005
Sorry, I can't give you
that information.

482
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,871
OK, the big guy
I put through the window.

483
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,713
What's his name?
You mentioned his name...

484
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,030
Christopher!

485
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,797
That's amazing. What you can do,
all of it. Amazing. Look at you!

486
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,393
The most powerful creature on
the planet, that's what I'm looking at.

487
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,189
Fastest, smartest, the best.

488
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,352
And you're British, so it's even funny.

489
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,513
We have waited and you have come.

490
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,479
Forty years ago, a baby

491
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,633
was left in a railway station,
six months old.

492
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,634
But we knew who he was,
who he had to be.

493
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,189
And we have cared
for Tom Jackman ever since.

494
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,559
More, more than cared,
controlled every step of his life,

495
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,792
waiting for you to emerge.

496
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,875
And here you stand. Mr Hyde, reborn.

497
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,555
The second coming, with balls.

498
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,314
- Who left me at the station?
- Who knows?

499
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,879
You don't.

500
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,270
We know more
about Dr Jekyll's experiment

501
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,510
and your creation than anyone.
We can help...

502
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,992
# You don't know who left me
at the station #

503
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,676
Let's find out together. Work with us.

504
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,195
What do you say?

505
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,954
- What if I say no?
- People don't say no to us, Mr Hyde.

506
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,079
Not even you. I mean sure you can kill
a lion with you bare hands, that's cool.

507
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,438
But when it comes right down to it,
we can buy the fucking zoo.

508
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,114
Give me an answer, Mr Hyde.

509
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,348
We've got a man down, Med team here
now, Mr Lennox is on the roof...

510
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:10,034
Shit!

511
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,760
That's not me on the roof.

512
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,394
Start up, we've gotta get out of here!

513
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,092
Sorry, that's enough zoo for today.

514
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,078
My daddy wants a word with you.

515
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,192
<i> Wakey-wakey.</i>

516
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,590
Dr Jackman?

517
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,513
Who are you? What's your name?

518
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,869
Christopher Browning.

519
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,795
Christopher Browning.
You put my son in a cage with lions,

520
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,270
Christopher Browning. Why?

521
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,115
- I was ordered to.
- Why?

522
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,999
- To make you change.
- Why?

523
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,075
- I don't know why.
- One last chance. Why?

524
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,152
- I don't know!
- Don't lie to me. Don't annoy me.

525
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,959
That's not a good way to go.
Heard of good cop, bad cop?

526
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,348
This is the movie!

527
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,638
Look, I'm nobody, me,
I'm nothing and I don't know anything,

528
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,030
and I'm not lying.

529
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,997
Please don't let him
in here again, eh?

530
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,631
Forget Hyde! I don't need Hyde.
All I've got to do, pick up the phone.

531
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,236
You tried to kill a child. Do you
want to go to prison as a child-killer?

532
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,313
Think about that.
That phone there, all I need.

533
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,836
- Do you want me to phone the police?
- Yeah. Yeah, go on phone them.

534
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,958
I mean, you've got me, ain't you.
You've got witnesses.

535
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,590
Go on, phone them.
Turn me in, please!

536
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,880
Otherwise he's gonna come back.
For God's sake just phone them!

537
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,720
- Still can't sleep?
<i>- He's telling the truth.</i>

538
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,553
<i>He's nothing,</i>
<i>just a little man taking orders.</i>

539
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,835
So?

540
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,233
<i>They've got a lot of men like him, so</i>
<i>many men are coming for your family.</i>

541
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,038
<i>Send them a message.</i>

542
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,112
- What message?
<i>- The only message they'll understand.</i>

543
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,397
<i>- "Look what happened to the last one."</i>
- I can't do that.

544
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,278
<i>Of course you can't. You're weak.</i>

545
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,317
<i>Just be weak a moment longer,</i>

546
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,438
<i>- close your eyes and let me fly.</i>
- No.

547
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,955
I hope you're strong enough
to bury your children.

548
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,519
You don't care about them.

549
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,591
<i>I love children, me.</i>
<i>Snack-sized people.</i>

550
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,830
<i>Always leave you wanting more.</i>

551
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,878
<i>I'll tell you what, you're the one</i>
<i>who doesn't care,</i>

552
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,669
<i>if that man walks out of here.</i>

553
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:40,437
What is that? Eh? I mean that
phone's not even connected.

554
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
What is it?

555
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,229
- Bad news!
- No...

556
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,115
- Hi.
- What's that?

557
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,396
Well, it's up to you,
of course, but I'd say...

558
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,352
...the front of the queue.

559
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,397
Oh, my God!

560
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,915
Oh, my God!

561
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,592
- You're still shaking.
- I'm fine.

562
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,955
- No, you're not.
- I'm getting there.

563
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,236
- You told him who you worked for?
- I had to.

564
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,789
- What did he say?
- He laughed.

565
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,599
- Which saved your life.
- Yes.

566
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,911
- Did you think he wouldn't attack you?
- We had an understanding.

567
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,878
- You do. Keep the lights on.
- I thought we had better than that.

568
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,352
He's a wild animal.
Never forget what you're dealing with.

569
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,398
- Or you lose a limb. Or your life.
- It was your idea.

570
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,835
- Not turning off the power.
- It was the only...

571
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,630
- Don't fall in love with Tom Jackman.
- I'm not in love with Dr Jackman.

572
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,509
It's appealing. A man so determined
to beat his own demons.

573
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,630
But he never can. Hyde is
a savage beast, stronger every day.

574
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,157
Jackman is a man who wakes up every day
wondering what he's done this time.

575
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,714
- Hello?
<i>- Are you with Claire?</i>

576
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,233
Hi.

577
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,796
Tom, where are you?

578
00:46:52,932 --> 00:46:54,914
<i>If you're with Claire,
don't tell her it's me.</i>

579
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:57,392
Of course I am.
Where did you go to?

580
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,391
Guess. How's Eddie?

581
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,154
Bit confused.
He doesn't seem to remember much.

582
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,232
Keeps going on about Uncle Billy.
For God's sake, Tom,

583
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,358
what happened? Can't get
sense out of anyone at the zoo,

584
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,192
and then you go and disappear!

585
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,828
- I need to talk to you now.
- Where are you?

586
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,037
Sherringham Hospital. Intensive Care,
head for the visiting area.

587
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,668
- Don't tell Claire.
- I'm on my way.

588
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,773
If you hear anything,
anything at all...

589
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,974
You'll be the first to know.

590
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,593
- You were asking about Mr Browning?
- Yes.

591
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,914
I'm afraid you're going to
have to speak to a doctor.

592
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,595
He's here.

593
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,792
OK, people, let's move it!
Let's everybody not screw up.

594
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,030
Sherringham Hospital, what you got?

595
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,988
Who owns that? Do we own that?

596
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,120
It's NHS.

597
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,474
Speak English!

598
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,516
You were asking
about Christopher Browning.

599
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,557
I heard you with the nurse.

600
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,870
Yes. I'm a...

601
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,512
I know him.

602
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,591
He's never going to walk again.

603
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,910
Or speak, or eat,
except through a straw.

604
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,915
Blind in both eyes, deaf in both ears.
Almost every bone in his body broken.

605
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,959
Who does that to a person?
What kind of man?

606
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,749
You're his mother, aren't you?

607
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,154
Katherine?

608
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,230
It was in the tea. You drugged me.
You're working for them.

609
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,072
No. She's working for me.

610
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,119
I'm not that poor man's mother,
that's not why I'm crying.

611
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,398
I'm yours.

612
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,751
<i> There's a team on the way.
We'll have him here in an hour.</i>

613
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,832
- I'll meet them there.
- Good work, Mr Syme.

614
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,117
You're welcome.
The order's in, then?

615
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,751
Oh, he knows we're coming after him now.
We can't leave him on the loose.

616
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,436
No more kids and lions.
We're done being nice.

617
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,709
So. You're my mother.

618
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,553
- I'm the nearest thing you've got.
- What does that mean?

619
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,995
It means I left you in a station
forty years ago.

620
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,118
With a letter and a photograph.

621
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,831
- What about my father?
- He died many years ago.

622
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,151
What did he die of? Was he like me?

623
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,788
Did he have what I have?
Is that what killed him?

624
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,555
In a way. It's a long story.

625
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,871
- Did you tell Hyde?
- I didn't tell Hyde much of anything.

626
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,669
I know what he is.
I just wanted to meet both my boys.

627
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,798
He wasn't very interested
in me anyway, you know your brother,

628
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,235
anything he can't fuck or eat...

629
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,632
Why did Katherine drug me?

630
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,553
You advertised for someone
to work for you.

631
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,871
I made sure you found someone
you could trust. Once she met you,

632
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,953
she didn't trust me.
Wanted proof I was who I said I was.

633
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,838
But you keep your secrets so close.

634
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,515
Drugging you was the only way
she could get to them.

635
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,399
We didn't know there'd
be side effects, I'm sorry.

636
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,351
I think she's a little bit in love
with you, but I'm sure you know that.

637
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,309
I let him loose today.

638
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,077
On that man. Hyde whispered in my ear

639
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,276
and I let him tear a man apart.

640
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,989
That's how Hyde works.
He reduces you, piece by piece,

641
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,912
all the easy options.

642
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,311
He's evil, that's what evil does.

643
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,549
The nearest thing I've got to a mother.

644
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,951
- What does that mean?
- It's complicated.

645
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,076
Either you're my mother,
or you're not.

646
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,518
You are a direct descendant of
Dr Henry Jekyll of Edinburgh, correct?

647
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,797
- Yes.
- Yet Dr Jekyll had no family, correct?

648
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,837
Yes.

649
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,310
Then how can anything be simple?

650
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,038
- I need to know where I came from!
- Of course you do.

651
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,998
- Are you going to tell me?
- That's why I'm here...

652
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,355
Dr Jackman!

653
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,836
- Did you tell anyone where you were?
- No. Well, a friend.

654
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,035
- Who?
- Peter Syme.

655
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,873
Peter Syme isn't your friend,
he's your keeper.

656
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,446
If they've decided
to pull you in, you've got to disappear.

657
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:20,485
- Who's going to pull me in?
- I'll delay them.

658
00:52:20,594 --> 00:52:23,114
- How?
- Don't go home, don't contact anyone.

659
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,236
Just for God's sake,
please, disappear.

660
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,674
How do I control Hyde?

661
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,400
You can't.

662
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,636
- Who are you?
- Official business.

663
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,032
- Whose official business?
- Sorry, boys, you've just missed him.

664
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,351
Oh, come on, Mr Syme,
you must have seen photographs of me.

665
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,114
Have I really aged that much?

666
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,317
Dear God!

667
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,110
- Hello?
<i>- I've been told</i>

668
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,113
<i>there's no one I can trust,</i>
<i>but I've decided to trust you.</i>

669
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,793
Dr Jackman!

670
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,111
<i>There's a woman called Katherine,</i>
<i>she'll contact you. Help her.</i>

671
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,714
Dr Jackman, where are you?

672
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,996
Gone away.

673
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,397
That was him? Phone him back!

674
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,313
I'm phoning him back.

675
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:09,350
Mrs Jackman?

676
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,999
Good morning.

677
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,869
They'll be down in five minutes.
Do you want a coffee or anything?

678
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,874
No coffee. Tell them five minutes
will be fine.

679
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,357
<i> Then what's going</i>
<i>to happen to me? The truth, please?</i>

680
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,529
He'll get stronger,
you'll get weaker.

681
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:32,196
It's always the same,
every Jekyll, every Hyde.

682
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,318
- Not this time. I'll fight him.
- You can't.

683
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,552
- I won't ever stop fighting him.
- Then he will kill you.

684
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,790
Then I won't die.

685
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,395
How's Mom this morning?

686
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,472
No trouble. Didn't even want coffee.

687
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,950
<i>- I'll fight him.</i>
<i>- You can't.</i>

688
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,032
<i>- I won't ever stop fighting him.</i>
<i>- Then he will kill you.</i>

689
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,589
<i>Then I won't die.</i>

690
00:55:39,831 --> 00:55:41,088
I have a family.

691
00:55:41,266 --> 00:55:45,024
I have a wife and children.
I won't die, I don't have the time!

692
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,915
- Nobody in or out?!
- Nobody.

693
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,435
- But you offered her coffee?
- I used the com.

694
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,229
Two minutes ago
I spoke to her. She was fine.

695
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,755
Then where is she?

696
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,276
Nobody in or out! One door!

697
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,193
Where is she? Huh?

698
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,918
Shit!

699
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,272
Tonight is everything this organisation
has worked towards ever since it began.

700
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,518
Tonight is the culmination of over
100 years of planning.

701
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,033
- It's me.
- It's him.

702
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,200
It's him.

703
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,671
Dr Jackman is coming home.

704
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,599
<i> Let me dream for you.</i>

705
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,113
Get away from me!

706
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,078
I do declare, I'm all a-flutter.

707
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,902
I won't let you tie me up with Hyde.
I know how dangerous he is!

708
00:57:32,002 --> 00:57:34,150
Hyde's an animal, I'm dangerous.

709
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,788
You're locking me in with Hyde?

710
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,029
Yes.

711
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,317
You wanted to know
where your husband goes.

712
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,038
This is where he goes.

713
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,478
Oh, dear, Mrs Jackman. It's going
to take a bit more than that with me.

714
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,993
Fine!

715
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,752
There's been a murder hasn't there?

716
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,317
Fantastiche!
