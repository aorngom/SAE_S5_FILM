1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,340
Previously on "Private Practice".

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,480
what do you say we just 
see how it goes.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,050
tonight?

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,100
He stood me up.

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,890
You and me,friends
with benefits,tonight.

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,880
What time should I come over?

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,590
You're not some random
girl from the internet.

8
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,550
With you it doesn't mean
nothing. It never will.

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,080
All right. Get out.

10
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,890
I am so sick and tired of being the
only person in this practice who thinks!

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,390
is Violet here?

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,960
Uh,no,not yet,but,um. oh,okay.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,150
Oh,Morning. You've got a.

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,440
Morning.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,220
Hi. Good morning.

16
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,320
Hi, uh, here you go...

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,660
-Naomi?
-Uh,yeah. She's right.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,870
Is Naomi.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,870
what's up with everybody? Was there,like,a car
accident on the way to work or something? What.

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,640
Or something.

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,420
-Milk?
-Oh,thanks.

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,760
They're behind closed doors.

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,120
Who?

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,220
The women.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,130
If they're gonna talk about
us,we should talk about them.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,890
Yeah.

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,110
Let's talk.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,340
Let's talk smack.

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,720
I just need ten minutes with naomi.

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,620
I need ten minutes with naomi first.

31
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,170
-Naomi?
-Nai?

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,220
She slept with cooper.
She slept with pete.

33
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,900
Cats out of the bag,all that.

34
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,050
-She didn't sleep with pete.
-She didn't sleep with cooper.

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,860
-How did you know that?
-How'd you know that?

36
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,270
-There are no secrets around here.
-I know!

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,690
Ooh,there are secrets.

38
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,320
I mean,I didn't know.

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,610
Neither one of you? Really?

40
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,040
I didn't. I didn't know.
That's all I'm saying.

41
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,510
Pete literally stood me up.

42
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,620
I don't get stood up. I'm addison.

43
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,400
Uh,which means something.

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,840
in places where.

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,880
things mean things. I was humiliated.

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,410
Were you completely naked?

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,840
Did you stand in front of him like a peeled
banana while he looked over your best parts?

48
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,530
Because I have good parts,and
cooper passed on them.

49
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,020
I have good parts.

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,910
Damn right,you do. And so do I.

51
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,460
I like your breasts.

52
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,340
You have a good ass.

53
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,890
Thank you. I like it.

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,760
The point is we should not
be having sex in the office.

55
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,030
who's having sex in the office?

56
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,820
No one.

57
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,310
No one,that's the point.

58
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,530
It gets complicated.

59
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,130
You just. you. you don't
know where you stand.

60
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,310
What do you think
they're saying about us?

61
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,400
You know what?

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,010
Who cares?

63
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,830
Yeah. Who cares?

64
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,350
the guys are still in the kitchen.

65
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,250
How am I gonna get my
coffee? I need my coffee.

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,310
Can we skip the morning meeting?
What do we do in that meeting anyway?

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,160
-There is no morning meeting today.
-Thank you.

68
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,940
Because charlotte king is
coming by to walk us. all of us.

69
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,710
through the safe surrender program.

70
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,660
-That's today.
-Yeah.

71
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,150
I signed up with pete.

72
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,270
I am in control.

73
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,340
I work here.

74
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,810
I'm moving on.

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,270
But I'm getting my
coffee from downstairs.

76
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,400
-Oh,small nonfat chai latte.
-Frappuccino,extra whipped.

77
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,200
-blame the guy up front.
-Sorry?

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,960
The guy at the front of the line,he
just ordered a coffee with,like,

79
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,430
seven descriptive words in front of it.

80
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,930
you should blame him
if you're running late.

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,110
Oh,I work upstairs. I just
have a meeting to get to.

82
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,720
Not a big deal.

83
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,810
Well,you can go in front of me.

84
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,070
you look important. I'm.

85
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,180
I'm guessing this meeting
won't go on without you.

86
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,720
thank you.

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,010
I'm carl,by the way.

88
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,590
Addison.

89
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,900
stop me now if you had amnesia or
you were bleeding to death in an E.R.

90
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,920
-Addison,I.
-no? Good.

91
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,390
Here's the deal.

92
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,470
I take full responsibility
for last night.

93
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,150
I was warned repeatedly,by you,no less,

94
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,520
and I should know by now that when someone
tells you who they are, you should believe them.

95
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,360
I can work with you,but personally,you've
been downgraded to acquaintance. I'm moving on.

96
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,690
Fair enough.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,730
-We have coffee here.
-Shut up.

98
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,840
What is wrg with everybody?

99
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,660
Okay,safe surrender rundown.
montgomery,you and pete are the go-to team.

100
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,360
Am I wrong? That's what I have here.

101
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,170
No,that's right. We
volunteered last week.

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,250
Good times. Happier times.

103
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,340
so the cell phone,that's all they need?

104
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,350
Well,for the next 48 hours,all calls placed to the
safe surrender hotline will be rerouted to that phone.

105
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,300
Don't stray far from
here or from each other.

106
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,200
Fine. That's fine.

107
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,190
These calls are from women who
want to give up their babies?

108
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,460
Most of 'em have given birth already,and
they can't or don't want to keep their babies.

109
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,430
They call from school
bathrooms,friend's places.

110
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,270
They're too scared to go to hospitals
where they have to provide their names.

111
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,220
so we arrange for a place to meet them,they
surrender the baby to us and then what?

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,970
You can bring the babies back
here. Dr. Freedman can do the exaMs.

113
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,500
And if the babies are healthy?

114
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,990
Then you call social services.

115
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,840
And most important,don't
forget the bracelets.

116
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,660
One to the mom,one on
the baby's wrist or ankle.

117
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,920
If the birth mother changes her mind,she
has two weeks to reclaim the child.

118
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,030
The biggest victory for safe surrender is when
that baby's placed with someone who wants 'em.

119
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,140
If it's the mom,all the better.

120
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,790
That's all I have time for.

121
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,680
Any questions,call me.

122
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,320
Nothing charlotte king likes better
than bossing people around,huh?

123
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,210
Practically glowing.

124
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,240
Cooper,safe surrender saves
hundreds of babies a year.

125
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,520
It's really an amazing
thing that she's doing.

126
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,350
How did you feel about the
homework I gave you last week?

127
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,150
Well,I didn't think ias an "imagine
yourself on a warm beach" kinda guy.

128
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,840
But?

129
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,650
But every time I
started to feel anxious,

130
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,250
I thought about the
mediterranean,it worked.

131
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,920
Well.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,430
maybe you're ready
for some more homework.

133
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,220
Bring it on.

134
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,910
Let's identify something that
would've triggered you in the past,

135
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,160
something you'd like to try again.

136
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,070
Done. I,um.

137
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,840
I met a woman today,and we
exchanged business cards.

138
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,500
I think I'm ready to try dating again.

139
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,480
We didn't forget how.

140
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,690
I tell ya that.

141
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,210
no,we did not.

142
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,590
I think we,uh.

143
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,720
-yeah,we didn't forget.
-Nah.

144
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,710
so.

145
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,720
what do you think?

146
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,640
What do i think?

147
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,870
Yeah. I just. you know,you.

148
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,860
you laid it on me,so,uh,that
gives you the right to speak first.

149
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,760
-What,I laid it on you?
-Ah,well.

150
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,930
what,because I jumped you,and
you were helpless to stop me?

151
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,940
Well,I didn't say that.

152
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,580
I just. was. was this a slip up,like.

153
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,860
like. like a one time thing?

154
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,260
Or,uh,w-would you.

155
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,320
want more here?

156
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,410
I don't know,sam.

157
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,490
I-I don't know. For once,I
hadn't thought it through.

158
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,540
You know,the practice we barely
got through it after the split.

159
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,350
I know.

160
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,320
And,uh,maya.

161
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,890
I mean,it's not.

162
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,800
not fair to Maya.

163
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,440
We. we got divorced for a reason.

164
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,130
So,um.

165
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,650
I think it was just a slipup.

166
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,560
Yeah.

167
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,460
I,uh,I thought that,toO.

168
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,270
Okay,good. Good.

169
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,790
-Okay.
-Okay.

170
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,620
Hey,uh,there was a
message on your voice mail.

171
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,420
Your priest called?

172
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,650
You have a priest?

173
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,660
Uh,had. Uh,we used to.

174
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,550
Okay,yeah,well,he wants to see you,so.

175
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,430
me?

176
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,480
Uh,both of you,together,as soon as
possible. It sounded kind of serious.

177
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,280
What'd you do,commit a mortal sin?

178
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,530
god's trying to tell us something.

179
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,830
It's a coincidence.

180
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,970
No. We. we have sex,and then the
day after,our priest summons us?

181
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,900
That's the fires of
hell,sam. We had sex.

182
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,980
Just don't mention we got a divorce.

183
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,140
I don't need a lecture.

184
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,570
-Play it cool.
-yeah,everything's cool.

185
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,470
Thank you so much for coming.

186
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,870
We had sex,and. and we're divorced.

187
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,790
Oh,Naomi.

188
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,660
I'm sorry. He's. he's. he's our priest.

189
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,630
I can't lie to him.

190
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,180
I,uh,I-I.

191
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,220
I'm gonna let that go for now.

192
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,660
I'm also gonna overlook the fact that you two have
been christmas and eastering it for the last ten years.

193
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,850
look,I called you about one of the nuns.

194
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,910
It's sister helen. She's sick.

195
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,120
Well,don't know what it is.

196
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,280
She's 86. She hates hospitals.

197
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,730
I thought of you two.

198
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,820
Sam,this is your area.

199
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,420
Naomi,I thought having a woman
would make her more comfortable.

200
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,830
H-has she been ill for a while?

201
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,460
Uh,sister amy would know.

202
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,930
The sisters have been
sequestered alone together for.

203
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,140
-sequestered?
-For three weeks.

204
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,990
St. Mary's is our mother house.

205
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,650
We spend most of the year
on missions around the world.

206
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,490
So this is the one time of
year we get to see each other.

207
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,340
This is the first time I've been outside
these walls in the last three weeks.

208
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,870
All right. So,please.

209
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,610
Father mark?

210
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,200
No,I'm not supposed to enter.

211
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,830
No one from outside the sisterhood,but they
need you. You're good catholics,you're doctors.

212
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,230
Well,doctors at least.

213
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,480
Go on. I'll. I'll wait for you here.

214
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,660
oh,it's all right,sister helen.

215
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,560
She's a doctor. It's all right.

216
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,450
when did she start feeling bad?

217
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,280
A week or so ago. She said she
felt like she was getting the flu.

218
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,860
She's the only one of us who doesn't
complain of aches and pains,so we noticed.

219
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,020
Sam?

220
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,330
What's this?

221
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,640
It's definitely not the flu.

00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,730
Still don't want to talk,cooper.

226
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,060
But I want to talk.

227
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,320
Well,there'a world wide web
out there waiting for you.

228
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,450
I'm sure you can find
someone who will listen.

229
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,880
I can just grab the peanut butter and.

230
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,560
men.

231
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,190
They're overrated.

232
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,340
Dating is overrated.

233
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,550
-Sex is.
-don'T.

234
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,270
Don't say something you're gonna regret.

235
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,880
hello,addison montgomery.

236
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,700
Carl. Hi.

237
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,080
Yes,I would love to have coffee.

238
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,570
But I am on call for work today,so.

239
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,620
you sure?

240
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,680
Okay,then. Uh,yes,I will.

241
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,230
see you later.

242
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,180
B-bye.

243
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,000
-I have a date tonight.
-You don'T.

244
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,740
you don't want to move too
fast,addison,not with a guy you barely know.

245
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,320
Unhand me,woman.

246
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,750
I'm getting my date on.

247
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,280
it would help if we could
precisely identify the rash.

248
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,850
Yeah. I don't have my derm atlas on me.

249
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,180
Wait.

250
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,680
Sister virginia,could you,um.

251
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,590
-oh,yes,of course.
-Thank you.

252
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,120
-Sister.
-Okay.

253
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,640
Here we go.

254
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm gonna send it to dell.

255
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,840
See if he can't find
someone to identify it.

256
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,180
how is she feeling?

257
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,490
Well,we may need to get
sister helen to a hospital.

258
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,630
We'll do everything we
can to keep her here.

259
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,530
But we can't treat her until we know
what kind of an infection she has.

260
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,450
Yeah,and we're also gonna need to check
the other sister to see if it's contagious.

261
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,510
You ever seen a rash like this?

262
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,900
Can't say that I have.

263
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,040
I'm tracking down an infectious disease
specialist to see if we can get an answer.

264
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,570
Um,I'm done with my patients for
the day,but I'll be back later.

265
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,910
Uh,ring me if we get
a safe surrender call.

266
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,740
I'll be just down the
street. I've got a thing.

267
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,880
A thing?

268
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,150
Yes.

269
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,840
Well,don't drink. Friends don't
let friends drink and save babies.

270
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,210
I think addison has a dateonight.

271
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,050
Well,good for her. She's
getting back on the horse.

272
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,650
-I'm about to have a date tonight.
-Really?

273
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,410
Yeah,with canóuhandleóme441.

274
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,510
What? I don't believe in dwelling. I
believe in getting back on the horse.

275
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,080
Well,I'll leave you to it.

276
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,250
He's a lucky guy.

277
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,500
-Who is?
-Addison's horse.

278
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,060
you. you feel a little clammy.

279
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,250
I'm fine.

280
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,690
I spend most of the year
ministering to people in uganda.

281
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,430
You ought to see what
I'm exposed to there.

282
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,330
I'll weather sister helen's cold.

283
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,290
Sister virginia,please.

284
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,210
so sister helen's temperature
is 103,her resps 26.

285
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,380
Yeah,and now sister
virginia's getting sick.

286
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,520
And dell still hasn't come
up with anything on that rash.

287
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,880
All right,I think we should just
get sister helen to a hospital.

288
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,630
I'll call the ambulance.

289
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,710
I already did.
Uh,they're 20 minutes out.

290
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,150
Okay.

291
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,140
We make a good team.

292
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,320
Yeah,we do.

293
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,080
and then I moved to L.A.

294
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,960
-And lived happily ever after.
-yes.

295
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,880
The life of addison montgomery
in ten minutes or less.

296
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,290
Well,you can have 11 minutes.

297
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,260
Don't need it. Here goes.

298
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,600
Uh,never been married.

299
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,100
Never had kids.

300
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,680
Want to get married.

301
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,690
Want to have kids.

302
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,940
A man without baggage.

303
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,080
that is rare.

304
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,250
Well,I.

305
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,710
have a little baggage to confess.

306
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,710
I'm,uh,a patient of Dr. Turner'S.

307
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,120
I've been seeing her almost a year,

308
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,880
and I can say,without a doubt,that
she's made me a better man.

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,550
Okay.

310
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,660
Okay.

311
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,520
It's,um,it's refreshing
to meet someone who'S.

312
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,760
interested in being a better man.

313
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,090
-Really?
-Yes,really.

314
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,620
oh,I have to take this.

315
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,130
Exse me.

316
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,760
Hello.

317
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,750
Her name is darcy.

318
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,710
She id to wait,she'd meet us.

319
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,180
Darcy?

320
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,950
It's a girl.

321
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,730
she's not.

322
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,220
she isn't crying.

323
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,240
I can take a look at her.

324
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,620
are you bleeding?

325
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,310
Darcy,why don't you let us
take you back to the clinic?

326
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,990
No,you just have to take it and
go. My mom's upstairs sleeping.

327
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,730
Your mother was here in
the house when you were.

328
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,810
I crawled on the top bunk and played my
steo really loud to cover the contractions.

329
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,700
You cut the cord.

330
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,580
I clipped it.

331
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,330
See? With a barrette.

332
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,780
You made the right decision by calling.

333
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,510
Darcy,why don't you give me
just five minutes,all right?

334
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,260
I'll do an exam very quickly,make sure
theraren't any problems,and then you can go.

335
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,510
darcy. It's a little
late to have friends over.

336
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,180
Sorry,mom.

337
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,520
you have to go,now.

338
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,520
Take my rd and a bracelet.

339
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,750
Your daughter has a matching one.

340
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,640
I. just go.

341
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,180
In case you change your mind.

342
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,140
I won'T.

343
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,010
-Sam.
-The ambulance is here.

344
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,720
Sam. May I show him,please?

345
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,750
I felt fine.

346
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,480
naomi.

347
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,460
Yeah,I know. I see it. Th is not
just sister helen and sister virginia.

348
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,120
Sam.

349
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,840
hey,no,no. Don't come in. Don't co in.

350
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,270
This building is a hot zone.
We have to lock it down.

351
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,640
Until we figure out what this
is,nobody comes in,nobody goes out.

352
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,680
I am not leaving them.

353
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,100
Okay,shut the door then. Shut the door.

354
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,250
Ambrose spoke to the C.D.C.

355
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,440
They said we were right to lock down until the
hospitals can prep some isolation units for them.

356
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,560
Or. us.

357
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,290
What do they think this is?

358
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,850
Uh,probably a viral contagion.

359
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,400
Considering where these nuns have been.

360
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,200
dell forwarded the pictures on to
an infectious disease specialist,

361
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,650
so we'll know as. as
soon as he hears back.

362
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,740
How long until the iso unit's prepped?

363
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,530
Six hours.

364
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:17,380
Three more sisters have a fever.
So that makes 8 of the 12,and.

365
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,740
I'm not feeling too good.

366
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,170
Still don't think god's
trying to tell us something?

367
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,270
You don't really think we're being
punished for what we did last night?

368
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:37,670
what,just because we may have some
rare,tropical probably deadly disease?

369
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,670
The morning after we have sex?

370
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,280
Well,if we are sick.

371
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,840
I'm glad we got some.

372
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,430
how sentimental.

373
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,640
That was a joke. I was joking.

374
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,110
I mean,I gotta say,that kid did a pretty
good job of giving birth in a bunk bed.

375
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,530
I did a primary check,and
she's fine for now.

376
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,610
Her lungs are good,heartbeat's strong.

377
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,690
We'll get cooper to do a
well-baby check tomorrow.

378
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,030
Or you can call him now.

379
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,130
Cooper's,uh.

380
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,170
out on a date.

381
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,450
Oh,god. He's doing his.

382
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,780
get back up on the horse thing.

383
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,770
Addison is,too,right?

384
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,740
You. you had your date?

385
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,400
How did it go?

386
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,980
It's okay,violet.

387
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,220
I know carl's your patient. He told me.

388
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,660
Oh,good.

389
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,310
Good.

390
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,530
Uh,baby blankets. We need baby blankets.

391
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,770
oh,hey,you know,that. that might
be the,uh,the guy,the nun rash.

392
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,150
So you're dating one of violet's
patients? A psych patient?

393
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,920
Oh,please. This is L.A. You're
weird if you're not seeing a shrink.

394
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,080
You all done,kiddo,huh?

395
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,570
Okay.

396
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,790
Good girl.

397
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,120
You sure you don't want me to call
social services to come pick her up?

398
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,940
No,no,no. That's okay.
Uh,I'll stay here tonight.

399
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,960
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.You know,

400
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,970
shshould get to feel
wanted,at least for one night.

401
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,430
Yeah.

402
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,070
Oh,yes,little girl.

403
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,900
That's a little baby.

404
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,720
uh,7 and 7.

405
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,550
More on the first 7,less on the second.

406
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,950
Charlotte king,as I live and breathe.

407
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,560
oh,no,you don'T. That's saved.

408
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,650
Big date?

409
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,330
Not a date.

410
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,050
Far from it. I'm just
meeting someone. Scoot.

411
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,550
I don't want him to see you
and think you're here with me.

412
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,700
What timdid he say?

413
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,340
9:00 P.M.

414
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,060
Mm,I'm meeting someone at 9:00,too

415
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,420
a blonde,petite.

416
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,600
We met on the internet.

417
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,050
What?

418
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,690
No.

419
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,080
oh,god.

420
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,030
Oh,my god.

421
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,800
No,no,no. We should laugh about
the unfortunate coincidence.

422
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,640
Laughing is the way to go.

423
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,900
Let's be clear. This never happened.

424
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,690
Or the opposite of laughing.

425
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,840
Yes,sir. I just got it.

426
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,610
Okay.

427
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,920
I see,yeah.

428
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,750
I'll call 'em right now.

429
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,540
Holy crap.

430
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,050
a patient of yours is dating addison?

431
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,660
I'm not allowed to
discuss it. You know that.

432
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,840
Yes,you are.

433
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,010
Our patients know we share files.

434
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,390
Well,we don't if we don't have to.

435
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,430
Okay,but on a scale from one
to ten,how bad is his thing?

436
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,920
Moving away. Not talking.

437
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,280
Are we talking a three?

438
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,690
Like I'm afraid of seagulls and
I'm considering hypnotherapy?

439
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm closing the door. I'm
closing it in your face.

440
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,820
Oh,it's bad,huh?

441
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,010
We're,like,way beyond mommy issues here?

442
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,570
Ethics,pete. Look it up.

443
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,930
Sam.

444
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,230
She's tachycardic at 130.
I n't get a blood pressure.

445
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,140
She's in septic shock.

446
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,550
We gotta get her to a hospital,I
don't care if they're ready for us.

447
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,800
no,we gotta get everybody to a
hospital right now. Dell just called.

448
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,650
-What is it?
-It's typhoid.

449
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,490
how is sister virginia?

450
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,150
Well,she's still not responding,and
her blood pressure is very unstable.

451
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,270
Typhoid? I didn't.

452
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,570
I-I thought that disappeared
in,like,the early 1900s.

453
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,140
You know,it's.

454
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,410
it's a common disease in exactly the kind
of third world places where the sisters work.

455
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,550
It's transmitted through
skin-to-skin contact or food.

456
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,700
So you think one of the
sisters caught it on a mission?

457
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,170
No,and that's what's troubling.

458
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,110
The incubation period
is two weeks at the most.

459
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,560
And these sisters were
sequestered for longer than that.

460
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,390
So how did they get exposed?

461
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,840
Excuse me just one second.

462
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,620
I spoke with health services.

463
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,130
There have been no other
outbreaks of typhus in this area.

464
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,070
And all the food in the
convent tested clean.

465
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,520
So if it's not the food.

466
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,960
sam,somebody had to have had
contact with an outside carrier.

467
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,930
Well,all the sisters are claiming
that they've been completely isolated.

468
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,460
Nobody in,nobody out.

469
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,850
Sam,what are we saying here?

470
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,610
That one of these nuns.

471
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,940
we're saying that somebody's lying.

472
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,330
You're not ready to date. Y-you're
certainly not ready to quit therapy.

473
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,600
But I feel fine. I feel good.

474
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,450
This is you going off your program.

475
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,240
Hi.

476
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,320
Okay,I'm. I'm just leaving
some flowers for addison.

477
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,290
She's sleeping,so.

478
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,130
make sure she gets these,okay?

479
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,890
Thanks.

480
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,620
seizure?

481
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,200
Addison's date last night was with a patient
of violet'S. Now violet seems worried.

482
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,810
No way.

483
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,760
Awesome. What's his deal?

484
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,900
Well, if it was nothing, she would say.

485
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,570
You know you'd say.

486
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,220
Just a hint.

487
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,480
You don't have to
tell us the whole--

488
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,060
he calls himself "trunk."

489
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,790
okay.

490
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,030
Well,when I think "trunk," in relation
to a guy,not necessarily a bad thing.

491
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,800
elephant's trunks,very large tr.

492
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,170
oh,is he freakishly
large? Is he hideously.

493
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,570
I can't tell you!

494
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,210
Trunk.

495
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,420
Flowers.

496
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,410
How you holdin' up?

497
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,660
Good. Little hungry.

498
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,920
A lot tired.

499
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,130
And I can,um,I can only find one shoe.

500
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,260
every time I tried to put her
down,she started screeching like a bat.

501
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,370
Okay,you realize I didn't
actually give birth.

502
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,470
Uh,from your psych patient.

503
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,140
He just dropped 'em off.

504
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,690
Oh,that's so sweet.
Here,give me the card.

505
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,350
the thing is,I think carl
might have some probleMs.

506
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,730
Everybody has probleMs.

507
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,290
Violet said his nickname is "trunk.

508
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,840
" I don't know what that means.

509
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,930
I think it means.

510
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,810
he's not addison montgomery
material. That's all.

511
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,030
No.

512
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,230
You don't know what my material is.

513
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,470
You've never even seen
my material,remember?

514
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,080
So.

515
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,490
mind your own business.

516
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,600
She isn't getting any better,is she?

517
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,050
No,not yet.

518
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,920
Her lungs are congested.

519
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,670
Pressure's borderline.

520
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,640
I'm putting all the sisters on
an aggresve course of antibiotics.

521
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,880
It's a dangerous disease,but the cure rate
is very high for those with mild cases.

522
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,530
Thank you,sam.

523
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,000
Father,uh.

524
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,980
naomi's gonna be asking
the sisters some questions.

525
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,230
Oh,of course. Anything you need.

526
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,290
Uh,is there anyone you
think we should speak to?

527
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,930
Uh,a sister that might have had contact with a
typhoid carrier in the time they were sequestered?

528
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,260
From the outside?

529
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,280
Maybe a sister was meeting
with someone secretly?

530
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,200
No,no. I can't imagine
someone would lie about that.

531
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,560
Well,people keep secrets,father.

532
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,390
Believe me.

533
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,560
I got a page from the E.R.

534
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,610
Dr. Violet turner.

535
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,540
Oh,hi.

536
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,920
Um,yeah. You have a patient here.

537
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,630
Uh,we were able to remove the
foreign body nonsurgically.

538
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,830
He's on pain meds now.

539
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,320
Seems to be resting comfortably.

540
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,230
Is he gonna be okay?

541
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,450
Yeah. Oh,yeah.

542
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,050
Yeah. He's,um.

543
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,070
he's lucky he didn't
perforate his bowel.

544
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,140
Just one question for you.

545
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,870
you got any idea whose shoe this is?

546
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,900
Given the circumstances of her
birth,this is a very,very healthy baby.

547
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,520
yeah,did you hear that?

548
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,230
I heard we have something to celebrate.

549
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,520
You rescued a baby?

550
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,770
yeah,um,what exactly happens,uh,once
social services takes her?

551
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,470
It's out of our hands.

552
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,680
She'll be placed in foster care
while they start the adoption process.

553
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,540
Come here,batgirl. Yes.

554
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,210
Yes,it's time for a little stroll,huh?

555
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,520
Little stroll around the office? Yeah.

556
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,960
Batgirl?

557
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,840
here's a question. cotton
balls at st.Ambrose.

558
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,930
do you.

559
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,990
uh,triple size.

560
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,030
Hospital grade.

561
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,490
Right. More cotton per ball.

562
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,650
good-bye,Dr. Freedman.

563
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,400
Good-bye,canóuhandleóme.

564
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,210
I didn't mean to take her shoe.

565
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,760
You took her shoe,carl.

566
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,260
And you did what you always do.

567
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,680
Yeah.

568
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,790
You need to come back to therapy.

569
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,290
Because this is not a
good way to live,is it?

570
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,140
No.

571
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,140
One more thing.

572
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,800
Uh,can you tell addison I can't see her?

573
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,150
She's great. She's perfect.

574
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,680
But I don't trust
myself around her shoes.

575
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,310
how do you give up your baby?

576
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,920
how do you give up your whole life?

577
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,050
I mean,falling in love,a family,all
of it,just to go live in a convent.

578
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,920
That's why somebody's lying.

579
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,180
This girl. darcy.

580
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,880
she carried her for nine months.
I've had her for one night.

581
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,960
one night.

582
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,060
and the thought of her being thrown
into some foster home is killing me.

583
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,510
You can't have this baby,addison.

584
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,900
I know.

585
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,100
I named her.

586
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,690
Batgirl.

587
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,960
Okay. you just can't have kids.

588
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,890
oh,nai,I wish you were here.

589
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,060
It's been such a weird day.

590
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,770
Oh,tell me about it.

591
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,600
I'm interrogating nuns.

592
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,750
I wish I were there,too.

593
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,300
damn it. I gotta go.

594
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,780
Bye.

595
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,600
come in.

596
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,470
I thought I heard you in here.

597
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,470
batgirl can only sleep
in total darkness.

598
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,700
O-okay.

599
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,440
Um,can I talk to you?

600
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,670
it's carl.

601
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,570
Carl likes you very much,but he
wanted me to tell you that he.

602
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,090
he's not gonna be calling again.

603
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,120
I don't understand.

604
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,550
He has a medical issue
that worsens under stress.

605
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,240
What te of issue?

606
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,310
It. it doesn't matter.

607
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,840
Why do you call him "trunk"?

608
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,030
Oh,you know about that?

609
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,510
Okay,uh,well,that was very.

610
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,720
unprofessional of me to say that.

611
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:58,940
Uh,a trunk is a place where you
might put all sorts of things,

612
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:05,000
things you might have,uh,taken,or
borrowed from another person.

613
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,290
in an anatomical sense.

614
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,180
Oh,god.

615
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,270
where is my shoe?

616
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,070
We. we can talk about this. It
is nothing to be disturbed by.

617
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,100
It. it's an issue of control.

618
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,840
I am going to get up,and I'm
gonna walk out of this room,

619
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,410
and you and I are never,ever,going
to speak of this again.

620
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,730
I would like that very much.

621
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,050
No change?

622
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,890
no. I'm sorry.

623
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,040
If it's all right with you,I'd like
to give her the sacrament of the sick.

624
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,570
Oh,yeah,of course.

625
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,630
"The graced peace of god our father
and the lord jesus christ be with you.

626
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,450
" "Through this holy anointing,may
the lord,"in his love and mercy,

627
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,360
help you "with the
grace of the holy spirit.

628
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,210
May the lord.

629
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,300
-the way he looks at her.
-I know.

630
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,750
"Save you and raise you up.

631
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,570
don't be mad,but I
called social services.

632
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,930
I meant to call. I just.

633
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,220
forgot. That'S.

634
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,550
good.

635
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,940
I can help you pack up her stuff.

636
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,320
Thanks.

637
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,650
come on,baby.

638
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,800
How long till they get here?

639
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,040
there you go.

640
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,020
Oh,batgirl.

641
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,230
okay.

642
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,280
I'll be back as soon as i can,okay?

643
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,980
Safe surrender hotline.

644
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,170
did she say where,exactly?

645
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,620
No,she just said marine park
past the first parking lot.

646
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,420
Addison.

647
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,470
The baby's not breathing.

648
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,320
There's no pulse.

649
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,380
Let'continue to bring up his temp
with warmed oxygen and fluids.

650
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,440
More saline bags.

651
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,580
What's his core temp?

652
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,670
Core temp is 95.

653
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,580
uh,let's do another round of epi.

654
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,350
Come on,little guy.

655
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,460
Come on,baby. Don't do this.

656
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,740
asystole.

657
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,950
Addison,you've been at
this for almost an hour.

658
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,210
okay.

659
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,240
I'm gonna call it.

660
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,590
Time of death. 10:42 P.M.

661
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,220
We got there as soon as we could.

662
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,410
It's over.

663
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,480
We tried.

664
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,070
It's over,Pete.

665
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,490
-Addison,we did everything we.
-it's over. The baby's dead.

666
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,760
|W tough day.

667
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,100
yeah.

668
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,530
I used to get off on 'em,the tough ones.

669
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:37,110
When I was a resident,I used to
think,I got through this,I survived.

670
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,390
And the next one,I'll
survive even better.

671
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,300
I don'T.

672
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:48,340
It's days like these where
I slip and make mistakes.

673
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,220
Bad mistakes.

674
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,250
These long.

675
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,780
crappy days just.

676
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,840
I just need
something,someone,and I end up.

677
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,870
falling off your wagon.

678
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,650
Whoever your wagon may be.

679
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,880
We have to get back to the practice.

680
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,740
This is the last time
I'm offering to talk.

681
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,220
Cooper,it's not that I
don't want to talk to you.

682
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,360
I-I can'T.

683
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,230
Of course you can. That's what we do.

684
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,010
I know.

685
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,160
But?

686
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,940
Allan obliterates my heart,and you
tell me that he doesn't deserve me.

687
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,710
Some girl named trixie
uses and abuses you,

688
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,230
and I listen to you and I
tell you you're being stupid.

689
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,260
I-I will always be able to
talk to you about someone else.

690
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,010
But I can'T.

691
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,870
I can't talk to you about you.

692
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,990
I-I don't know how to talk about us.

693
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,740
Not like that.

694
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,710
Then talk to me about something else.

695
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,760
Whatever's on your mind.

696
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,440
I went to the E.R.

697
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,310
Carl.

698
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,340
shoved one of addison's shoes up his.

699
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,250
yeah,okay,okay.

700
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,570
Well,you know,you asked.

701
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,610
That's what was on my mind.

702
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,620
maybe carl will nd a girl
who enjoys what he does.

703
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,400
So. so that. that's the answer?

704
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,340
My job has no point?

705
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,660
Freaks should just be with other freaks?

706
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,450
Are you talking about us?

707
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,300
About me?

708
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,310
No.

709
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,390
no.

710
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,570
Uh,sister virginia's doing better.

711
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,180
She,uh.

712
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,380
her pressure has
normalized since last time.

713
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,340
father,we'd like to
test you for typhoid.

714
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,480
Me? I feel fine.

715
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,490
Carriers are asymptomatic.

716
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,550
You wouldn't know you
had it until it spread.

717
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,650
Well,I've done missionary work all
over the world,but that was years ago.

718
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,740
That doesn't matter. This disease
can stay dormant for years.

719
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,690
You think.

720
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,570
you think sister
virginia got it from me?

721
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,100
I know you say you don't
go in the convent,but.

722
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,570
if you had direct contact with her.

723
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,110
I would sneak in at night,and we.

724
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,490
no,you don't have to say.

725
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,930
I would sneak in,and we would.

726
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,030
cook.

727
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,340
Cook?

728
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,700
I couldn't boil water before
she arrived. Never had to.

729
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,580
But then I would see her,and she
was just so graceful and smart.

730
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,890
When no one else was around,I
would ask her for pointers.

731
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,270
It's been years now.

732
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,750
And we have never touched.

733
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,070
I know it was forbidden.

734
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,660
She'd be away on missions,and I'd just.

735
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,470
part of me was always waiting.

736
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,500
For the next time you could be together.

737
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,210
I missed my friend.

738
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,420
all this pain because of me,I just.

739
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,810
oh,no,no. You. you couldn't have known.

740
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,340
We'll get you on a course of
antibiotics,you'll be fine.

741
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,110
Thank you.

742
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,630
Sam,naomi,uh.

743
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,770
we all make choices.

744
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,880
The two of you made a choice.

745
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,440
I know. I was there.

746
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,850
And so was he.

747
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:51,420
I just want you to know that
as far as,uh,we're concerned.

748
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,090
you will always be married.

749
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,650
darcy,are you okay?

750
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,890
You're the doctor
who. you took the baby?

751
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,120
Ma'am,we were offering
your daughter a safe option.

752
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,450
It's called safe surrender.

753
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,480
She's actually protecting
herself and the baby.

754
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,140
She made the right choice to
call. It was the brave choice.

755
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,580
You think we'd ever let
her give this baby away?

756
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,120
My god. This is my grandchild.

757
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,380
I didn't even notice.

758
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,840
I-is she okay?

759
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,770
She's a very healthy baby. Here you go.

760
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,130
Okay?

761
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,440
Got her? Yeah.

762
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,410
hi.

763
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,340
Hi.

764
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,730
Her name is melanie.

765
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,200
My daughter's name is melanie.

766
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,350
That's a perfect name.

767
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,300
Father mark said we're still
married in the eyes of god,

768
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,390
so technically,what we did
the other night,not a sin.

769
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,720
Oh,really?

770
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,580
Yeah,that's what the father said.

771
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,130
Which means if we were to do it again.

772
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,210
charlotte.

773
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,100
I'm going home,Dr. Freedman.

774
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,470
Come have a drink with me.

775
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,970
What?

776
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,150
No.

777
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,700
Come on.

778
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,420
I am not having sex with you just because
I wrote some things on the internet.

779
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,850
No.

780
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,520
A drink. Not sex. Absolutely no sex.

781
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,540
I could get you that drink now.

782
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,800
Not yet.

783
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,370
Ask me again in two hours.

784
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,600
Ahh,yes,ma'am.

785
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,590
You heading out?

786
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,880
I don't think I can be in this day.

787
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,370
Any longer.

788
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,280
You shouldn't be alone tonight.

789
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,320
I won't be.

790
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,130
I'm sorry. I know it's
past neighbor time.

791
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,810
Come in. It's cold.

792
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,510
Uh,can I get you
anything? Some tea or wine?

793
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,910
Wine.

794
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,540
I called naomi,but,uh.

795
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,340
no one answered.

796
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,060
You want to talk about it?

797
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,800
it was,um.

798
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,070
a night,you know?

799
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,110
Just a night.

800
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,150
And,uh.

801
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:35,750
then I c-called naomi,and she
wasn't home,and I-I just couldn'T.

802
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,920
go home yet.

803
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,310
Hey.
