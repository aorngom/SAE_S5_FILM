1
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:08,875
Why is there a letter of
resignation on my desk?

2
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:10,651
I told you. I got a job offer.

3
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:12,165
I don't want to hear this again.

4
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:15,164
Working at a private
medical co-op, moving to L.A.

5
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:16,836
This is not my Addison.

6
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:19,507
My Addison is a world-class
neonatal surgeon.

7
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,285
My Addison lives to cut.

8
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,950
Your Addison would've been
promoted to chief of surgery.

9
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:25,609
So stop "addisoning" me.

10
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:28,635
I want a change, I need a change,
and this is how I'm gonna do it...

11
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,669
In L.A., at that practice,
with those people.

12
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:33,213
- You don't know anything about them.
- I know plenty.

13
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:35,440
My best friend... Naomi...
From med school...

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,491
She's a fertility specialist there,
and she's an amazing woman.

15
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,591
Mother just needs a moment to herself.

16
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:45,027
Her ex-husband Sam is an internist.

17
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:46,986
You wish you had his people skills.

18
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:48,632
We can't keep doing this.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,013
I love you. I do.
We're in this together.

20
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:54,961
But, we gotta make a change.

21
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:58,753
Violet is a psychiatrist,
and she's incredible...

22
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:00,007
Grounded, strong...

23
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:00,903
Hello.

24
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:02,635
Hello?

25
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:05,896
Violet... you have to stop calling here.

26
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:07,516
I'm married now.

27
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:09,892
Cooper, a pediatrician.

28
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:12,114
One of the best in his field... A pro.

29
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,339
Lisa, that... Oh, God,
I'm sorry. Lily, right?

30
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:17,288
Your name's Lily, right?

31
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:18,241
Sorry. Yeah.

32
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:21,906
I'm getting a little uncomfortable,
if you...

33
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:23,263
Lori!

34
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:24,680
Lori!

35
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:26,656
And Pete, he does alternative medicine.

36
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:29,066
As a surgeon, I don't
believe in that kind of thing,

37
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,012
but the man is a healer.

38
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,780
So I know exactly what
I'm getting myself into.

39
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:35,615
You think you're going there
and do what?

40
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:38,998
Wear jeans, walk on the beach,
dance in your underwear?

41
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:40,275
Maybe I'll dance naked.

42
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:41,904
You belong in the O.R.

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,239
You'll be back in a month,
begging for your job.

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,806
No, I won't.

45
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:48,214
I am changing my life.

46
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:49,869
Now I can walk away angry,

47
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,673
or I can walk away with your blessing.

48
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:54,708
Either way, Richard, I'm going.

49
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:05,189
I'll keep your job
open as long as I can.

50
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,366
Come here.

51
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,420
Sam?

52
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:07,041
Addison?

53
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:11,690
<i>What the...</i>

54
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:15,131
How did you end up getting the
house right next door to me?

55
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:17,137
Naomi said that you
had the best realtor.

56
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:18,127
Naomi said?

57
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:20,301
Addison, what... What
are you doing here?

58
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:23,368
It's... not like I look bad naked.

59
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:26,088
A lot of men have
enjoyed seeing me naked.

60
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:28,510
A lot of me... Well, not a lot.

61
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,304
I mean... Eight.

62
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:32,432
Well... Eleven.

63
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:34,297
No, here in Los Angeles.

64
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:35,419
Here.

65
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:36,961
I...

66
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,442
Didn't Naomi tell you?

67
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:43,500
Tell me what?

68
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,369
Oceanside wellness group.

69
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,765
- Hi. Dell, right? Where's Naomi?
- Yes.

70
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:51,784
- Need to know where Naomi is...
- Mr. Wilson.

71
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,335
You guys can come on back now.

72
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,261
- Hey!
- Hi. You moved in, everything good?

73
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:58,245
Yeah, whatever.

74
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,898
Naomi... I need to talk to you.

75
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,251
So, uh... Hey, Dr. Bennett.

76
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,324
Hi. I'm putting my boys in a cup.

77
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,748
I'm gonna get Leslie pregnant.
I'm ovulating, finally.

78
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:11,223
Oh, congratulations. That's great.

79
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,784
Never done it into a cup before.

80
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,873
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

81
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:15,463
That can be kinda... Naomi.

82
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,380
Dell, can you take Ken and Leslie
back to exam room number one?

83
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,874
I'm gonna be right with
you guys, okay? Thanks.

84
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:23,342
- Just in the conference room, please.
- All right!

85
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,458
Don't worry.

86
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:28,664
Addison.

87
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:29,969
Hi.

88
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:30,790
Nice to see you.

89
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:31,465
Hello.

90
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:36,661
So...

91
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,024
What happened to the amicable divorce?

92
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,593
It's progressive decompensation of
repressed rage

93
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,609
secondary to feelings of abandonment.

94
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:47,022
It's shrink talk for Naomi
finally getting pissed off

95
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:48,471
that Sam left her.

96
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:49,585
What are they mad about now?

97
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,623
Naomi didn't tell Sam that she hired me.

98
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:55,844
To work here?

99
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,320
Oh, oh, oh, here he is, all good.

100
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:01,754
Oh, but...

101
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:05,205
Next time you want to hide your
vegetables, feed them to the dog.

102
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:09,739
But you can't shove 'em up your nose.
It's off-limits as a hiding place. Okay?

103
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:19,004
Mommy and daddy are fighting again.

104
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:21,622
- Addison. Cooper.
- Cooper. Remember me?

105
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:22,992
Yeah, I know.

106
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:24,542
Hi, Cooper.

107
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,961
Pete, hello.

108
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,227
You're back in town.

109
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,858
Yes. She works here.

110
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,739
- Naomi hired her.
- You're working here?

111
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:36,490
Yeah.

112
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:37,554
Welcome aboard.

113
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:41,577
So Naomi didn't tell any of you

114
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:42,953
that I was coming?

115
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:46,769
It's a power play.

116
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,175
Naomi's trying to show
that she has the power.

117
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:52,872
Why did Addison take the job anyway?
Wasn't she some big hotshot in Seattle?

118
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,797
Is it just me, or did Naomi just
run over us with a steamroller?

119
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:57,405
- Is she crazy?
- Naomi's insane.

120
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:00,367
I mean Addison. Is she
some kind of crazy person

121
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:03,189
who gets kissed once and
decides to change her whole life?

122
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,096
You kissed Addison? Really?

123
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:07,008
- Focus!
- Focus!

124
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:09,447
Look, I know she has the largest
chunk of this practice,

125
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,087
but we agreed to equal votes.

126
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:13,873
We are supposed to vote.
Sam, you gotta do something.

127
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,122
- Yeah. What, me?
- This divorce is killing us.

128
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,685
You need to apologize.
Just say you were wrong

129
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:21,226
for walking out so we can get
back to being a happy family.

130
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:23,781
I never... I didn't...

131
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:29,413
I am not apologizing
to her. She's the one.

132
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:32,453
Naomi hires Addison and then
moves her in right next door to me.

133
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:35,203
- I saw her naked this morning.
- You saw her naked?

134
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,151
- She look good naked?
- Focus!

135
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:38,977
So I just have to get it in the cup?

136
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:40,426
Yeah, just get it in the cup.

137
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:43,225
I want a kid. I've always wanted a kid.
But this is just...

138
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:45,061
You know, a lot of our clients
are nervous.

139
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:47,391
But just remember, once you
have the baby in your arms.

140
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,472
- How it got here won't matter.
- Eyes on the prize.

141
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:50,755
Yeah, eyes on the prize.

142
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,694
Oh, okay. 5-cent tour.

143
00:06:58,948 --> 00:06:59,785
Exam rooms...

144
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,452
Two is for peds, three
has the gynie exam table in it.

145
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:06,121
- You and I will share it.
- You didn't tell them you hired me.

146
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:07,866
Oh, they'll get over it. It's fine.

147
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:11,032
Scrub sinks are over there.
We contract with the lab downstairs.

148
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:12,994
Nale, I don't think it's right to them.

149
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,938
To them, I am the
interloper. I don't lope.

150
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,351
I own 55% of the practice.
I made a decision.

151
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:18,773
They have to live with that decision.

152
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,891
- I have to...
- They will get over it.

153
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:22,334
Here's your birthing suite.

154
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:27,857
But I deliver babies in a Hospital.

155
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:29,804
You used to deliver babies
in a Hospital.

156
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,370
Now unless it's a C-section,
you deliver babies here.

157
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:34,504
It's very popular with the patients.

158
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,546
Okay.

159
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,688
I guess I should meet my staff.

160
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:45,119
I don't have a staff.

161
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:46,755
Okay.

162
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,078
Let me see if I... understand this.

163
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:52,708
I left a Hospital with a
state-of-the-art

164
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:56,026
- A oBgYN wing and a staff of 60...
- You'll have Dell.

165
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:58,706
- He's studying to be a midwife.
- The cute boy who answers the phone?

166
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:01,065
Plus you'll have Pete.
Laboring moms love Pete.

167
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:03,072
The alternative medicine guru?

168
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,159
Do you know how many
babies I deliver a day?

169
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,097
Well, here you'll be
lucky if you deliver one.

170
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:09,276
One patient the entire day?

171
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:11,185
I told you, we do things
differently here.

172
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:12,446
This may be a big city,

173
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:15,416
but this co-op is about
practicing small-town medicine.

174
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,760
Every patient is special,
every patient gets our full attention.

175
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,684
It's not about surgeries but connecting.
I told you this.

176
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:24,004
Yeah, I know. I know. I just...

177
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,839
I didn't think it'd be
one patient the entire day.

178
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,410
You wanted change. This is it.

179
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:30,880
Yeah.

180
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:33,305
This is it.

181
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,829
Hey, Naomi. We need to talk to you.

182
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:40,783
- I'm just gonna go some...
- No, stay. She is staying.

183
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:45,178
You can't just do this. You can't
bring in her without a vote.

184
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:46,363
Yeah, this is not...

185
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:48,752
This is not a, uh...

186
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,885
- What is that?
- Somebody's getting happy.

187
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:53,727
No, it's Mr. Wilson
giving a sperm deposit.

188
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,740
- Get away from the door.
- That's a loud deposit.

189
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,806
- Go, Mr. Wilson.
- You guys are so immature.

190
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:02,328
- It is... definitely different.
- Do you think he's always that loud?

191
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:04,456
Help! Please, come quick.

192
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,542
I was just trying to help him
get in the mood.

193
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,419
Now he's not moving.
What's wrong with him?

194
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,933
His pupil's blown. He's having a stroke.

195
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:15,155
All right, he's had three rounds of epi
and a 200 lido bolus.

196
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:17,467
Defib times 5 on scene.

197
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:19,883
Get out of my way. Hold C.P.R.
How long has he been down?

198
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:22,589
Uh, at least 20 minutes.

199
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,223
I'm gonna call it.

200
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:30,605
What? What about those? Don't
you want the shocky things?

201
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:33,133
He's been down too long.
No point to make it a show.

202
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:35,258
No! No! Use the shocky things.

203
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:36,170
I'm sorry. He's gone.

204
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,986
Time of death... 9:42 am.

205
00:09:41,844 --> 00:09:42,886
No.

206
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,233
We... We were gonna have a baby.

207
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:47,329
He was... he was gonna be a dad.

208
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:57,635
I... I want... I want...
I want his sperm.

209
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,301
He didn't get a chance to make his...
his donation before he died.

210
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:04,836
But you can take it from him now.

211
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:06,851
- What?
- I want his sperm.

212
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:10,219
I want Ken's sperm now!

213
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:22,331
I get Naomi's mad... Hell
hath no fury and all that.

214
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:25,538
I know the practice needs an oBgYN,
but since when do we not vote?

215
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:29,589
- I had sex with this woman last night.
- The reason we started this practice

216
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:31,383
is to be in charge of our own destiny.

217
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,736
Very real, you know, internet sex.

218
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:36,471
But she wanted me to call her mama,

219
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:39,806
but she promised all
this really freaky stuff,

220
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:42,526
and I'm talking, like, stuff.

221
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:45,391
Okay. Eww. That's it. I'm done.

222
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:48,168
- No. What? Why?
- Because you're a sex addict.

223
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:51,117
Or an internet addict or
some kind of freaky addict.

224
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:54,011
Yeah, you're a stalker. You're
stalking your married ex-boyfriend.

225
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:56,218
I am not. I'm...

226
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,520
Calling him occasionally.

227
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:00,416
- Stalker.
- Okay, you know what? That's it.

228
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:03,136
I'm cutting you off, for your own good.
I won't help you anymore.

229
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:05,657
- Oh, come on, stalker.
- I'm not a stalker!

230
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:10,626
Hey. I, uh...

231
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,282
Just wanted to say
that I am really sorry

232
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:15,731
about Naomi and the job. I...

233
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,115
I got a 911 page.

234
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:28,511
Do you think there's something wrong
with, having sex with a woman

235
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:31,650
who wants you to call her... mama?

236
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:37,213
- There's a patient for you.
- Thank god.

237
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:38,640
No, not him. You.

238
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,982
This is Bill Henderson
and his daughter Lucy.

239
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:45,335
This is Dr. Montgomery.
She'll be delivering your baby.

240
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:50,254
It hurts. It hurts, doesn't it?
It's what you get for getting pregnant.

241
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:52,250
She hid it from me for months, and
all of a sudden it's

242
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:53,425
"Daddy, I'm in labor."

243
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:55,162
How about we get you
into the birthing suite?

244
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,704
Dell, see if we have a chart on Lucy.

245
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,003
Hey, can I get in on this? I haven't
gotten a lot of field experience

246
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:01,243
for my midwife training.
I need the hours.

247
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:02,451
How about you just find the chart?

248
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:05,889
Ken's sperm...

249
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,306
You want us to take Ken's
sperm right out of...

250
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:12,655
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

251
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,354
- I mean, you can do it, right?
- Look here.

252
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,301
You're distressed. I understand.

253
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:19,337
Unless you have written consent
from the deceased,

254
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:21,768
no way am I gonna let you
molest your husband's corpse.

255
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,688
Well... Okay, well, let's not use words

256
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,058
like,"molest" or
"corpse" about her loved one.

257
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:27,961
And it's her boyfriend, not her husband.

258
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:30,088
Well, fine.

259
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:32,730
She wants sperm of a man
she has no legal rights to.

260
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,538
That makes it all better. No.

261
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,956
Okay. Hey, let's...

262
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:40,180
Can we stop... Charlotte, right?

263
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,640
You know my name, Sam.
Don't act like you don't.

264
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:45,110
I'm chief of staff
here, and you know it.

265
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:48,272
You and I, we... We can
work on this together.

266
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,537
We can figure this out
because I'm a good person,

267
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:52,432
you're a good person.

268
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,230
We... I mean we can...
Right? we can... Together?

269
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:57,721
I did read your book, by the way.

270
00:12:57,773 --> 00:13:00,099
- Oh, great.
- I took issue with most of it.

271
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,023
See, now I'm on her side.

272
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:10,744
We want Ken's sperm, or you
got a fight on your hands.

273
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,496
That dead man's swimmers are
staying exactly where they are.

274
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:15,903
You got a way to fight me on
that, I'd like to see you try.

275
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:20,669
I'm calling Naomi on you.

276
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,454
Lucy Henderson.

277
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,840
She was my patient
till she got pregnant.

278
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:28,288
No previous medical
problems. It looks good.

279
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:31,401
Well, the dad is mad as hell.
I could use your help in there.

280
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,782
Oh, Yeah. No. That... down there
is not my area.

281
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:37,172
So when the baby comes out,
I'd be happy to examine it.

282
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,481
Until then, godspeed.

283
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,977
Give me two secs to grab
my kit. I'll join you.

284
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:43,269
For?

285
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,534
If you'd read further in her chart,

286
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,465
you'd see she has a holistic birth plan.

287
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:49,560
- Oh, my god. Are you kidding me?
- Laboring moms love pete.

288
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:51,455
Hey, listen, um...

289
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:53,735
You moving here...

290
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,395
That didn't have anything to do with me
kissing you, did it?

291
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:57,231
What?

292
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,526
It's okay. It's just that...

293
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:00,654
Well, you should know
it was just a kiss.

294
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,992
Wait. You think that I moved
here because you kissed me?

295
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,098
It was a good kiss.

296
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:07,553
It was an excellent kiss. But...

297
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,870
Stop talking.

298
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:09,796
All right.

299
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:12,653
I did not move here
because you kissed me.

300
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,705
Okay.

301
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:15,943
You are actually
deranged enough to think

302
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,658
that I would pick up my entire
life and move because of a kiss?

303
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,302
Let me clear that up
for you. I wouldn't.

304
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:22,087
Okay.

305
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,368
Shut up. Just go in there

306
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:27,033
and do your little eastern
voodoo thing you do,

307
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:30,288
and let's help that girl
have her baby in peace.

308
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:39,325
What do you expect me to do?
He was your patient.

309
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:40,449
My patient's dead.

310
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,104
This is about your patient
who wants a dead man's sperm.

311
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:45,501
- Besides, I got mad.
- You got mad?

312
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:47,157
- I got mad.
- You got mad?

313
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:49,972
Apparently neither one of us can
make good decisions when we're mad.

314
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:52,588
Another doctor in the practice
is a very good decision.

315
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:55,414
We agreed that when we split,
we would not let it affect the work.

316
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,394
My work is fine.

317
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:58,194
In fact, watch me
take care of my patient.

318
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:01,409
Where do you think you're going?

319
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,527
If the hospital's not gonna
touch the body, then I will.

320
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,820
You lay a hand on that man,
and I will have you arrested.

321
00:15:05,877 --> 00:15:08,378
I'm not a person who plays
games, Naomi. You know that.

322
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:10,588
Now please step back.

323
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:19,731
Okay, now I'm mad.

324
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:21,554
I told you.

325
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:29,955
You know, I could
help. You know, with Lucy.

326
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,927
- I'm good.
- You don't take me seriously.

327
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,068
You think I'm dumb surfer boy.
You think I'm eye candy.

328
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:38,493
You have no respect for
me or my midwifery skills.

329
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:45,151
I have... total respect for you
and your... midwifery skills?

330
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,077
Is... Is that even a word, midwifery?

331
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:48,157
It's a word.

332
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:51,305
It's definitely a word.

333
00:16:02,623 --> 00:16:03,838
Jenny?

334
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,135
She's been counting the
tiles for over an hour.

335
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:08,638
You know this lady?

336
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:10,823
Yes, i do.

337
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:15,095
What the hell happened to her?

338
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,473
She had your card in her wallet.

339
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,217
Well, thank you.
Thank you for calling me.

340
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:30,999
My sister, she's got mental problems.

341
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:34,481
She's a good person, but
she's got mental problems.

342
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:36,938
That's why I called you
before I called the cops.

343
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:39,441
We don't need the
police. I can handle this.

344
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:41,719
Can you do it quick?
She can't stay here like that.

345
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,228
She's obstructing customer
flow and if she's dang...

346
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:44,891
Look, if you give me some time,

347
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:46,350
I will take her out of your hair.

348
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:49,198
Can you do that for me, Paul?
Can you do that?

349
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:51,855
- I guess.
- Thank you.

350
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,694
You're getting charged by the hour,
so you might as well hear me.

351
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:22,641
Inhale.

352
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:25,024
Exhale. ooh.

353
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:26,352
Focus on me. Exhale.

354
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:28,216
Deep breaths.

355
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,993
In. Out.

356
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:31,228
Good.

357
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,887
Good. Much better.

358
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,646
My dad, he... He's just mad.

359
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:39,712
I want this baby.

360
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,287
I just... I screwed up.

361
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:44,447
I'm such a screwup.

362
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:46,680
Hey, lucy...

363
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,680
Listen...

364
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,600
Everyone screws up once in a while.

365
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,791
And in this room, you get a free pass.

366
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:55,424
Okay?

367
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:58,305
Okay.

368
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:03,786
These are ken and
leslie's medical records,

369
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:07,357
including ken's signature
on a contract with my office

370
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:08,765
regarding his donation.

371
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:10,768
Now I think that is more than implied.

372
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:12,650
Live consent is different...

373
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:16,280
- You're considering this?
- It could be persuasive in a court.

374
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:20,179
Your patient will sign something
indemnifying us against legal action?

375
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,785
She just wants her baby.

376
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:27,671
Fine. you do the procedure.
You take possession of the sperm.

377
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:29,102
Thank you for your help.

378
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,636
Well done.

379
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,151
Very badass.

380
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:35,550
I know. Right?

381
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:36,806
Get away from me.

382
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:37,806
It's good.

383
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,612
- Are you Dr. Naomi Bennett?
- I am.

384
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:45,086
You better get that little tramp's
claws off my husband's sperm,

385
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:47,454
or I'll sue you and this place
so fast, your head will spin.

386
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:48,580
Who are you?

387
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:50,207
I'm Ken Wilson's wife.

388
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:56,163
Jenny, did something happen
to make you feel out of control

389
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:57,379
here in the store?

390
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:02,556
We've been working on rage directed
toward your husband for leaving you.

391
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:04,608
Are... Are you angry?

392
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:06,762
That's okay.

393
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,128
Feel the feelings. Get angry.

394
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:10,601
Let's talk about getting angry.

395
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,560
She's not answering.

396
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,129
Yeah, I got that, Paul.

397
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,153
Now what's the deal?

398
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:18,721
She, uh, gets upset, so she
goes crazy with the counting?

399
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,926
Well, for many people
counting establishes...

400
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:24,030
A sense of order. Oh, my God.
When did my knees turn 80?

401
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:25,691
We got knee pads on aisle eight.

402
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:28,730
Hey, Jenny...

403
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:30,169
Can you look up at me?

404
00:19:30,747 --> 00:19:32,217
Can you... can you look into my eyes?

405
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:36,090
Come on, jenny. i know you can do this.

406
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:37,992
Aah! whoa. Whoa.

407
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:39,961
Whoa. Whoa.

408
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:43,835
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

409
00:19:43,957 --> 00:19:44,960
- You sure?
- Yes.

410
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,005
10,168. 10,169.

411
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:51,205
10,170. 10,171.

412
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:53,740
10,172. 10,17...

413
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,479
Just checking to see if
you need anything, any help.

414
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:01,822
We're all good.

415
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:05,174
Okay, Lucy, you ready to push?

416
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,381
Please.

417
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:09,063
Mr. Henderson, your daughter's
gonna start pushing now.

418
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:11,248
Would you like to come
and sit by her side?

419
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:12,689
For what?

420
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:17,657
Why don't you just squeeze my hand,
if you need to?

421
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:20,860
Okay.

422
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:23,851
- Lucy, you ready?
- Yeah.

423
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:25,472
Okay, go ahead and push.

424
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:29,056
Good. Push.

425
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:32,375
Good. Good. Push.

426
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,648
That's good. Push.

427
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,187
Stop. Stop.
She's short of breath with j.V.D.

428
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:43,860
Wasn't eastern medicine your thing?

429
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,268
I have a lot of things.
Now she's short of breath with j.V.D.

430
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,008
Do you want to double-check
or you gonna trust me?

431
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:57,576
The baby's in distress.
Lucy, don't push now, okay?

432
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:59,080
Just give me a minute, okay?

433
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:00,606
Dr. Montgomery,
something's wrong with her.

434
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,702
Lucy? Lucy.

435
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:05,740
Lucy, wake up. lucy, wake up.

436
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,713
Lucy? Get her on high-flow oxygen.
Get an ambulance, Dell.

437
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:11,341
- Just holding her hand.
- She's having a heart failure.

438
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:12,611
Ambulance, now!

439
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:15,797
Lucy, honey?
Her mom died... in childbirth.

440
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,690
She died having Lucy.

441
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:24,588
I'm applying pressure, but
the cord is compressed...

442
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,636
- She's gonna be okay, right?
- And lucy's blood

443
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,311
is flooding her lungs,
and the umbilical cord

444
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,279
is cutting off the baby's blood supply.

445
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:34,798
- I just called the ambulance.
- How long for an ambulance to get here?

446
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:36,349
10 to 20 minutes in traffic.

447
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:38,916
Addison, we don't have 10 to 20 minutes.

448
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:40,581
- I know.
- We're gonna lose her and the baby.

449
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:41,566
I know.

450
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:56,023
I thought you might be hungry.

451
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,792
You'll have to pay for it.

452
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:01,107
That and the ice pack...
and the flip-flops...

453
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:02,744
Thanks.

454
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:04,294
You okay?

455
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:06,118
Yeah. It's just...

456
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:09,454
Look, i know her. She's been
coming to see me for months.

457
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:11,212
And she's gentle.

458
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,427
Paul!

459
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:16,549
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't think...

460
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:18,866
I don't think you know
exactly how to handle this.

461
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:20,448
I do know how to handle this.

462
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:23,186
There has gotta be something here that
I'm not seeing, she's not telling me.

463
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:25,377
No offense, but if she's not telling
her shrink things,

464
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,448
then you must not be
very good at your job.

465
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,519
You know what? Patients hold things in.
They hold things in for years.

466
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:32,452
- What's up?
- Just do... Do not touch her.

467
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:36,244
- I'm sorry, Violet.
- Paul, think of your sister. Please.

468
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:39,166
- I'm working here, Cooper.
- Really? It looks like you're shopping.

469
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:41,700
It's a joke. Dell told me you were here.

470
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,437
I just thought I'd come by,
see if you needed any help.

471
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:45,213
No, I don't need any help, okay?

472
00:22:45,315 --> 00:22:47,738
And you know what? This...
you got in your car, you drove

473
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:50,034
all the way down here to see
if i was still mad at you?

474
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:53,912
Who is the stalker now?
Let's just all settle down.

475
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:55,498
I'm sorry. I gotta let 'em take her.

476
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:56,909
If she gets violent with you again...

477
00:22:56,981 --> 00:22:58,788
Violent? She got violent with you?

478
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:01,501
- Come... Just... Your pupils...
- Not now, Cooper.

479
00:23:02,135 --> 00:23:03,909
This is a psychiatric emergency.

480
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,709
I can handle this. I can stabilize her.

481
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:07,956
Just give me a minute and
give me backup if i need it.

482
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:14,973
I just feel... If i knew how it started
or where she was when it happened...

483
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:17,780
So... How do you figure
out how it started?

484
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,860
You... You have security
cameras, don't you?

485
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:25,626
He told me he wanted to find himself

486
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,015
turns out he wanted to find me,

487
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:29,064
only 15 years younger and half as smart.

488
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:31,568
Any idea what that's like?
I think I can imagine.

489
00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:34,344
Like i don't feel my
age, i don't feel scared?

490
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:36,764
Only I feel it alone
while he's yanking in a cup

491
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:38,672
for some chick he met hiking in sedona.

492
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:41,249
Maria, i-i know this is unfair.
i understand, believe me.

493
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:43,233
You know, i was with him 17 years.

494
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,401
Maria, ken really wanted
leslie to have his baby.

495
00:23:46,494 --> 00:23:49,441
And leslie wants leslie
to have ken's money.

496
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:51,031
I don't think that she would do that.

497
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:53,552
I didn't think my husband
would dump me. So there you go.

498
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:57,542
If you want protection...

499
00:23:58,218 --> 00:23:59,086
Legal protection...

500
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,967
I think that leslie would
agree to whatever you ask.

501
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:04,062
I don't want protection.
i want ken's sperm.

502
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:05,625
What?

503
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:06,822
For myself.

504
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,798
Now we'll see who ends up alone, right?

505
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:15,578
Where the hell is the ambulance?

506
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:18,839
- Addison, you have to make a choice.
- What do you mean, make a choice?

507
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,150
If i wait any longer for the ambulance,

508
00:24:22,238 --> 00:24:23,425
i could lose them both.

509
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:26,048
Or i could get the baby
out and maybe save them.

510
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,304
Save them, of course.

511
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:30,384
Maybe. Maybe save them. Dell, glove up.

512
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:33,644
I need you to decompress
the cord. Come here.

513
00:24:35,902 --> 00:24:38,970
- Like this?
- Yes, that's good. Steady pressure.

514
00:24:39,132 --> 00:24:39,952
Okay.

515
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:47,805
I need to be in a hospital.

516
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:50,061
There's no way i can
perform a c-section here.

517
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,414
It's not sterile. I don't
have any surgical equipment...

518
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:53,388
Addison...

519
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:56,557
No extra blood and an epidural
would take way too long to take effect.

520
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:58,542
Addison, she's a heathly 17 years old.

521
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:00,239
No one could have foreseen this issue.

522
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,410
Do you know what happens to a person

523
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:03,962
when a scalpel slices into
them without anesthesia?

524
00:25:04,021 --> 00:25:05,402
- Addison, I... 
- Shut up!

525
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:07,818
I am trying to talk myself into this,

526
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,281
and i cannot do it when
you keep addisoning me.

527
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,986
So just... hold on.

528
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:25,306
Okay.

529
00:25:26,143 --> 00:25:29,320
Pete, take over for Dell. Dell, go
find a surgical tray from somewhere.

530
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:31,795
She's gonna feel every
slice, but we have to try.

531
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:34,839
I'm going to scrub in
and find sterile drapes.

532
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:37,484
We have a local anesthetic, right?
That will help with the pain.

533
00:25:37,651 --> 00:25:39,833
- Stop Addisoning me.
- I can treat her

534
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:41,601
so she won't feel any pain.

535
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:45,659
The cameras show her on this aisle.

536
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:49,309
She stopped. Next thing,
she's looking at the floor.

537
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:51,540
Maybe some kind of camping accident?

538
00:25:51,824 --> 00:25:53,019
Something traumatic? or may...

539
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:55,740
Maybe, you know, this guy,
uh, he works here,

540
00:25:55,952 --> 00:25:58,253
He told me that
marshmallow gets so hot

541
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,835
it sticks like napalm.

542
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:02,015
That's not that bad, i guess.

543
00:26:02,054 --> 00:26:04,812
Not bad enough for tile counting.

544
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:10,684
They had a house at the lake.

545
00:26:11,249 --> 00:26:13,294
I've stimulated the
needles. Lidocaine's in.

546
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:15,251
Her pain receptors are
blocked. She's ready.

547
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:17,091
Are you sure she's not
gonna feel anything?

548
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:19,530
- I'm sure.
- If she wakes up screaming in pain...

549
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,355
I'm sure. I'm very good at what i do.

550
00:26:21,472 --> 00:26:23,713
Are you really, really, really sure?

551
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:24,915
Trust me.

552
00:26:28,816 --> 00:26:29,665
Okay.

553
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:31,738
Here we go.

554
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:33,713
I'm gonna cut on three.

555
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:39,225
One...

556
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:43,510
Two...

557
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,608
Three...

558
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,090
Okay, okay.

559
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:56,640
Okay.

560
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,537
Did i or did i not say trust me?

561
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:02,154
You did. And I do... Now.

562
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,648
That was good. It was good?

563
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:06,005
There's no time to celebrate.
We have to move fast.

564
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:08,288
Both mom and baby are still in danger.

565
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:13,685
She can't just swoop in and take it.

566
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,335
She was divorcing Ken's sperm.

567
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:17,674
She was with Ken for
17 years, for God sake.

568
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:19,161
I thought we were on Leslie's side.

569
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:21,071
- You would.
- She's your patient.

570
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:22,487
You know, a marriage should
count for something.

571
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:24,139
And it doesn't. He just moved on.

572
00:27:24,316 --> 00:27:26,887
Oh, come on. Could we please
not make this about us right now?

573
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:29,396
I'm talking about ken. he
bailed, she got nothing.

574
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:32,830
He died. All things
considered, I'd rather be her.

575
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:34,798
You wanna be the one
people feel sorry for?

576
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,420
- The one who got left?
- I didn't...

577
00:27:37,134 --> 00:27:40,239
Don't you think for one moment that
I have been taking any of this lightly.

578
00:27:40,336 --> 00:27:41,816
Oh, no. You walked out.

579
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:43,544
I did not walk out.

580
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:47,916
I said I was unhappy,
that I was questioning.

581
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:51,002
And instead of trying, instead of
working on it, you just shut the door.

582
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:52,375
You weren't in love anymore.

583
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,633
Now how are we supposed to work on that?

584
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:55,176
I never said that.

585
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,061
I am not an idiot.
I knew exactly what you were saying.

586
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,237
So then you fight.

587
00:28:00,438 --> 00:28:01,909
You have some passion about the thing.

588
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:05,798
I wanted to see you
fight... just once... For us.

589
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:11,757
Naomi, I'm sorry...

590
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:13,918
Profoundly... for hurting you.

591
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:17,386
But you're fooling yourself if you
think you're the only one who got left.

592
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:23,704
What are we looking for?

593
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:25,630
Stop talking so i can think.

594
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,246
Something in the ad...

595
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:31,757
That's what triggered her.

596
00:28:57,189 --> 00:28:58,579
Did you have a boy?

597
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:02,506
Jenny, did you have a son
that we haven't talked about?

598
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:05,866
Did something happen to him?

599
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:06,909
Jenny...

600
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:08,833
Did he...

601
00:29:09,444 --> 00:29:12,181
Did... Did you lose your
son? did he pass away?

602
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,706
You're gonna make me lose my place!

603
00:29:14,946 --> 00:29:16,250
25,136.

604
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:18,002
25,137. 25...

605
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:21,731
- He died.
- One. Two. three. One. Two. Three.

606
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,522
One. Two. Three. Four.
one. Two. Three. Four.

607
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:26,138
One. Two. Three. Four.
one. Two. Three...

608
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:35,022
If you really want Ken's sperm,
you can fight it out.

609
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:37,546
You probably have more
rights than Leslie.

610
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,067
But with all the legal wrangling,

611
00:29:39,638 --> 00:29:42,975
most likely 24 hours will
pass, Ken won't be viable...

612
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,914
Nobody gets anything.

613
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:46,226
Okay.

614
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:47,962
Let's do that.

615
00:29:51,782 --> 00:29:56,200
You honestly never thought about it
in all those years, leaving him?

616
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,978
Nothing's perfect.

617
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:00,257
But I made my peace.

618
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:01,617
Yeah, I did, too.

619
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:05,387
At least i thought I did.

620
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,157
I yelled at him so much...

621
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:13,888
Last time I saw him.

622
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:15,165
God.

623
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:19,470
Maria... At some point,
you have to let him go.

624
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,647
Oh, okay.

625
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:29,366
Oh, it's a girl. come on, baby.

626
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:33,360
You want to come hold
your granddaughter?

627
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,210
Welcome, little girl.

628
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:40,115
She looks just like Lucy.

629
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:43,187
- She's in V-tach.
- I'm on it.

630
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:46,352
I've gotta close. If she has
any chance, I have to close.

631
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:49,922
Charging to 200. clear.

632
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,492
- Again. 300.
- The paramedics are here.

633
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,322
They're bringing in a stretcher.

634
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:56,711
- No!
- Clear.

635
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,386
We've got an open body cavity
in a barely sterile environment.

636
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:02,049
Do not let them cross the
threshold until i say so.

637
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,525
- Understand?
- Got it.

638
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:06,489
- How are you doing there, Pete?
- I'm kicking ass and taking names. You?

639
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:09,109
Ass kicking and name
taking are on my résumé.

640
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,667
Charging to 360. Clear.

641
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,233
Start her on a lidocaine
drip, 2 migs per minute.

642
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,946
0-2 at 10 liters. hey there.

643
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:23,931
Did I have the baby?

644
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,171
Yes, you did.

645
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:28,802
Is my dad... is he mad?

646
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,777
No, your dad is not mad at you.

647
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,250
Thank you...

648
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:37,777
For...

649
00:31:42,408 --> 00:31:43,433
Thank you.

650
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,296
Well, that was...

651
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,930
Pretty cool.

652
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:55,713
Oh.

653
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:57,097
Dell.

654
00:31:57,763 --> 00:31:59,145
Good work in there.

655
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,681
I didn't come down here
because you kissed me.

656
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:11,738
- Okay.
- I didn't.

657
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:13,945
- Okay.
- I need you to say it.

658
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:17,161
You did not move down
here because I kissed you.

659
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:23,218
You so moved down here
because I kissed you.

660
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,552
I heard that.

661
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,658
Uh, Maria's gonna let Leslie have it.

662
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:31,314
We can do the extraction on Ken.

663
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:32,539
What'd you say?

664
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,059
Just that it was time...

665
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:36,370
To let him go.

666
00:32:39,443 --> 00:32:40,176
Good.

667
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,106
That's, uh, that's good.

668
00:32:42,664 --> 00:32:43,676
Okay.

669
00:32:44,478 --> 00:32:45,851
Oh, and my book...

670
00:32:47,188 --> 00:32:48,259
Was brilliant.

671
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:56,050
His name was Will.

672
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:05,283
Hey, Paul, do you think you
could clear out this area,

673
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:07,803
just for a little while... for Jenny?

674
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:11,111
Yeah. i could do that for Jenny.

675
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:18,543
Hey, Jenny.

676
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:22,246
This is... this is Dr. Freedman.

677
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,830
He's a... he's a pediatrician.

678
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:25,837
And he's my friend.

679
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:27,575
Hi.

680
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:29,639
I have Will's file here.

681
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:34,421
It says he was suffering from double
vision when you brought him in.

682
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,296
He was 10. Diagnosed
with a brain em glioma.

683
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,312
Is that something they
could've caught earlier?

684
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:43,032
No, they got it early.

685
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:45,903
But because of the location
of the tumor in the brain,

686
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,392
it was inoperable.

687
00:33:47,473 --> 00:33:50,239
So will started chemo and radiation,

688
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,680
and the tumor responded at first.

689
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,072
But then... Will
developed kidney failure.

690
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:58,905
Well, that happens with chemo a lot.

691
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,647
At that point, you and your husband
decided to stop treatment.

692
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:06,009
Is that right, Jenny?

693
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:08,994
574. 575. 576...

694
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:11,691
Making that choice...

695
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:14,003
A lot of people aren't
strong enough to do that.

696
00:34:14,214 --> 00:34:16,994
These tumors don't quit.

697
00:34:18,116 --> 00:34:21,226
Treatment makes kids so
sick they can't do anything.

698
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:26,696
And then you didn't come back
to the hospital for a few months.

699
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:28,754
Did you go away...

700
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:31,061
To the lake?

701
00:34:46,455 --> 00:34:48,050
We all went together.

702
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:56,890
That's what i would've done, exactly.

703
00:35:00,084 --> 00:35:04,201
When you came back to the hospital,
Will was having trouble speaking...

704
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:06,419
But his spirits were high.
His spirits were good.

705
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:09,303
- Sounds like he was a great kid.
- Yes, it does.

706
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:11,851
And then?

707
00:35:13,585 --> 00:35:14,835
He went into a coma.

708
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:17,757
They made him comfortable.

709
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:21,603
Made sure everyone had
a chance to say good-bye.

710
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:27,403
And on the 16th at 5:13 am...

711
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:29,804
They took him off the machines.

712
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:34,765
And...

713
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:39,781
It says you held him and...

714
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:46,561
He breathed on his own
for over four hours.

715
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,466
That was hard...

716
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:54,530
Holding him like that...

717
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,761
For all that time.

718
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,049
Will...

719
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,646
He had the most aggressive kind of brain
cancer that a kid can have.

720
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:18,329
You didn't make it happen.

721
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:20,502
And there's no cure...

722
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:23,421
Only the choice in how
you're gonna ride it out.

723
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:27,810
You did everything a great mom could do.

724
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:33,708
No matter how you second-guess yourself,
or what your head tells you,

725
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:36,709
you didn't let your son down.

726
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,782
You did not let your son down.

727
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:46,444
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

728
00:36:46,648 --> 00:36:48,053
My baby.

729
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:27,029
Bye, honey.

730
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:39,772
Thank you.

731
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,394
- She's all right?
- Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

732
00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:17,045
My assistant.

733
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:19,684
Yeah... I was.

734
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:24,714
- Don't forget to...
- Yeah. I'll pay for the stuff, Paul.

735
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:36,613
Thanks...

736
00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:39,713
- For coming down.
- I'm a better person than you are.

737
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,809
The thing is, Cooper...

738
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,292
Okay, the thing is that...

739
00:38:49,112 --> 00:38:51,871
- I am kind of a stalker.
- I know.

740
00:39:03,062 --> 00:39:04,802
Why didn't you tell them i was coming?

741
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:07,113
Truth.

742
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:11,028
All right, fine.

743
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:13,720
I need you here.

744
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:17,413
I need you here... Because i'm...

745
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:23,582
Tired and i'm lonely, and my best friend
divorced me, and i have no one.

746
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:26,601
I need you here to be my someone.

747
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:30,681
Okay.

748
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:41,155
We want to see you
in the conference room...

749
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:43,906
If that's okay... I mean now.

750
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:52,554
We're a team. We're partners, Naomi.

751
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,921
You can't just bring somebody in.
Without asking us.

752
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:56,675
We're a democracy. We vote.

753
00:39:56,757 --> 00:39:59,090
- We vote or it doesn't happen.
- You're right.

754
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:02,091
We should've voted.

755
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,346
I was wrong.

756
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:07,242
Good.

757
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:09,285
Okay, let's vote.

758
00:40:09,362 --> 00:40:11,295
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Hold on a minute.

759
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:17,612
I have been working
here less than 24 hours,

760
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:21,702
and in that time I discovered
that I not welcome here.

761
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:28,300
I learned I am a one-man gynie show,
and I performed crazy MacGyver surgery,

762
00:40:28,454 --> 00:40:31,270
And... Sam saw my booty.

763
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:34,015
So... This has not
been a great day for me.

764
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:36,342
This day kind of sucked.
But you know what?

765
00:40:36,446 --> 00:40:37,775
I had one patient...

766
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:40,951
One patient the entire day...

767
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,142
And I loved it.

768
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:44,966
So you want me gone?

769
00:40:45,303 --> 00:40:47,390
Too bad. I'm in.

770
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:50,366
I'm putting my foot down.
My foot's down.

771
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,999
It's down. I'm not going anywhere.

772
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:55,614
So...

773
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,326
Yeah.

774
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:01,551
I thought I...

775
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,018
I thought I had a big finish but...

776
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:06,875
I don't. So...

777
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,353
I'm done.

778
00:41:16,658 --> 00:41:17,933
No, no.

779
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:20,331
I do have a big finish.

780
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:26,099
If I hadn't been here today,
if you'd had someone else,

781
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:28,609
that girl would've died
delivering her baby.

782
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:30,562
I saved her life.

783
00:41:31,107 --> 00:41:32,409
I saved your asses.

784
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:36,467
I'm a world-class neonatal surgeon.

785
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:39,118
And I'm here to stay.

786
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,614
Welcome to the new Oceanside Wellness.

787
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:54,666
That's why I didn't
tell you she was coming.
