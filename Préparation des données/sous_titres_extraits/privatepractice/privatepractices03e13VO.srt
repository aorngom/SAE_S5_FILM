1
00:00:06,753 --> 00:00:09,751
okay. We're almost there,
renee. You're doing great.

2
00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:11,028
Just a couple more pushes,
all right?

3
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:13,336
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Just get it out.

4
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:15,969
Oh, good. You're here.
It's happening fast.

5
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:17,403
How are the girls?

6
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:18,871
Getting settled.
Good.

7
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:20,707
A nurs
took some blood, though,

8
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:23,076
Which didn't go over too
well with niki. They're okay?

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,945
They're already complaining about
the food. Renee, you ready? On three.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,947
One, two-
aah!

11
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:29,148
Oh!

12
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:30,483
Aah!

13
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:33,720
I guess he's as anxious
as you are.

14
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:36,656
Oh!

15
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:42,195
He's perfect.
Trevor, right?

16
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:44,330
How's the cord look?
It looks good?

17
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:47,300
Yeah.

18
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:49,002
You want to hold him?

19
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:50,937
Let's just do the cord.

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,574
Okay.

21
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:15,261
Now there's the magic.

22
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:18,031
We did it.

23
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:26,072
What are we doing here,
dink?

24
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:28,408
Uh, could I get some water?

25
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:30,610
Maybe after you get
to the point.

26
00:01:30,644 --> 00:01:32,345
R- right, yeah.

27
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,147
Just cut to the chase.

28
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,449
I mean, you're-

29
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:39,952
You're a little scary,
dr. Bennett.

30
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:42,822
And if-if I'm gonna be
a good father,

31
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:45,725
Then, you know, I-I need
to learn to stand up to you,

32
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,627
Say what's on my mind.

33
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:51,197
Anyway, uh, you know,
the reason why I'm here-

34
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:54,133
Or the reason-the reason
why I came here- dink!

35
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:58,404
We've talked,
maya and me-

36
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,739
Maya and I.

37
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:02,375
Well... We want to do
the right thing.

38
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,944
I- I want to do
the right thing.

39
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:09,715
We want to get married, sir.

40
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,120
I've come to ask for your
daughter's hand in marriage.

41
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:18,257
I need coffee.

42
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:21,327
Well, you're gonna have to wait.
Lucas was up half the night. Me, too.

43
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:23,830
I'm seeing someone-
a reference librarian.

44
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:25,665
She's very well-informed.

45
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:28,601
So you're dating, sheldon? I'm going
to assume that was said without sarcasm.

46
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:31,571
So, yes, pete, I am dating.
I have moved on with my life.

47
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,973
I am seeing more women now
than you would believe.

48
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:36,742
I take lucas to the park.
He's like a magnet.

49
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:39,078
Well, that's mature-
using your son to get dates.

50
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:41,848
The only problem is,
after I get home from work

51
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:43,783
And get him down,
I'm-I'm too exhausted.

52
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:46,686
I guess that's w you've
got, um... On your shirt?

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,422
Oh. Spit-up. I'm turning
into "that guy," aren't I?

54
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:52,024
Naomi,
I need to talk to you.

55
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:53,893
Dink came over to see me.

56
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:56,295
I don't want to talk about
anything named dink.

57
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,731
Well, we need to talk,
because dink w-

58
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:02,168
He wants to marry maya.

59
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:07,406
I'm sorry. I have a patient. We need to
figure out what's going on with our daughter,

60
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:10,176
Who is pregnant, in love
and wants to get married.

61
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,979
I can't, not now.

62
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,391
Oh.

63
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,027
What's her name?

64
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,295
Monica.

65
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,796
Monica.
Mm.

66
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:32,598
What happened to serena?

67
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,867
Really? You're gonna
give me a lecture?

68
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:36,903
I'm trying to get
my life back.

69
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:39,805
No. I was gonna say, it's nice
to see you in a good mood again.

70
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,441
well, it's easy
to be in a better mood.

71
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:45,011
Oh, my god. Monica...
She can, uh...

72
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:47,914
Ooh. You think I care
about your sex life, cooper?

73
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:51,484
I'm sure you can click a mouse, google a
bimbo. No. You know what? I wouldn't do that,

74
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:53,452
Because I think talkin
about my dating life

75
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:55,388
In front of you at work
would be inappropriate.

76
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:56,822
But you know why

77
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:58,824
I'm talking to my friend violet
about it at work?

78
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,326
Because I can't talk to her

79
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,328
About it at her home
becausyou live there.

80
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:04,630
Yes. I was invited to stay.
You're getting back at me,

81
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:07,133
Punishing me by taking
my best friend. Cooper-

82
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,135
See, this is the problem
with you.

83
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:12,138
You think everything
in the world is about you.

84
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:14,840
Sorry. Not about you.

85
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,709
I don't-you don't-
you don't see this?

86
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:19,445
I mean, you are enabling her. Are
we gonna have that fight again?

87
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,014
You should've been happy
that we broke up.

88
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:24,050
You should've been helping me dump
her stuff out.

89
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:26,552
Instead... You're letting her get
between us. She's not between us.

90
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:28,387
She is.

91
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:38,030
Hey.

92
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:40,132
Who's this?

93
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,968
Oh.

94
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,303
hello, niki.
Hello, kelli.

95
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:47,273
I'm your little brother. Nice to
meet you. You're weird, dr. Freedman.

96
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,141
But my brother's cute.

97
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:51,844
Oh, thanks a lot, big sister.
Thank you, doctor.

98
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:54,080
you're welcome, sir.

99
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:56,882
We have leukemia. We're
not stupid. Fair enough.

100
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,852
Well, your mom and dad are up
in the birthing suite,

101
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:02,221
And they said they'd be down
in a minute.

102
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:04,657
How long do you think
till they start our chemo?

103
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,792
Well, uh, we have to
check the cord blood

104
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:09,195
And count the cells
- hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

105
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:14,900
Yeah. All right.
I will be right back.

106
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:20,273
So
- hello, dr. Montgomery.

107
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:22,408
Do you need a consult or...

108
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:25,011
no? It's a little
shtick I'm doing with the girls.

109
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:27,546
I don't have to... The cord
blood is a perfect match,

110
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,582
But the cell volume's low,
really low.

111
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:32,218
I had the lab run it twice,

112
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:34,954
After everything we've done,
but...

113
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:40,026
There's only enough
to save one.

114
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,827
why can't you

115
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:43,763
Split the blood
between the two of 'em?

116
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:46,265
Well, if you give them
less than they need,

117
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,301
They'll reject the graft.
We had a baby.

118
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:50,236
We had a baby
to save their lives,

119
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,704
And it worked.

120
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:53,673
And now what?
What we're saying is,

121
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:57,977
We can only give one of them
the cord blood.

122
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,413
No.

123
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,415
I won't do that.

124
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,983
Renee-

125
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:06,752
I won't choose to let
one child live and another die.

126
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:08,387
I won't!

127
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:10,356
Okay, we could delay
the transplant.

128
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,659
We could try another round of
chemo. The chemo isn't working.

129
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:16,395
I'll have another baby.
It took over a year

130
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,364
To get the embryos
with the right h.L.A.

131
00:06:18,398 --> 00:06:20,733
The girls just don't have
that kind of time. I'm sorry.

132
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,968
We can't do this.

133
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:25,871
Live with the idea
that we, what,

134
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:28,074
Loved one more,
let one die?

135
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:31,210
I... I mean,
what do you suggest,

136
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:33,546
We flip a coin?

137
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,548
I mean, how else
do we choose?

138
00:06:35,582 --> 00:06:38,584
Try to figure out
which one's more deserving,

139
00:06:38,618 --> 00:06:40,886
Which one's gonna live
a better life?

140
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:44,857
I mean,
they're 8 years old!

141
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:48,094
Renee...

142
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:01,352
You're 15 years old.
I thought we were catholic.

143
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,793
Oh, you're really gonna try
use religion against me now?

144
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:06,201
Because as I recall,

145
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:08,308
The church
promotes abstinence.

146
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:10,708
That's no sex before mage.

147
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,025
I made a mistake.
A lot of people make it.

148
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,492
Dink and I...
We're trying to make it right.

149
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:19,193
And the baby should have a
mother and a father. Fine.

150
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:22,084
I will not kill dink.
The baby will have a father.

151
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,591
But you're gonna stay in school.
You're gonna have a life.

152
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:26,378
Your mother and I
will provide for you.

153
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,370
Dink isn't... He doesn't
have to take care of you.

154
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,720
He doesn't have to.
He wants to.

155
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,501
He loves me.
We're m.F.E.O., dad.

156
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:36,490
You're what?
Made for each other.

157
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:37,958
Ugh. No.

158
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,860
I need one of you
to sign a form

159
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,962
To let us do it.
A form?

160
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,999
Well... that is not
going to be happening.

161
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,467
You're not listening.

162
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,436
I love him, daddy.
I'm having his baby.

163
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,238
I'm going to marry him.

164
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,974
No, you are not.

165
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,813
okay.

166
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,815
She is mad at me.

167
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,751
She's the one
who's 15 years old, pregnant

168
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,987
And wants to get married,
her mother won't speak to her,

169
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,956
But I'm the bad guy.
Well, like it or not, sam,

170
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,059
In seven months' time, one of
these is coming out of her.

171
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,094
Huh? Yeah.
There you go, buddy.

172
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,629
Hey, buddy.

173
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,232
Man, it's hard to believe
they all start out like this.

174
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,234
He gonna be okay?
Yeah, aside from the fact

175
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,336
That his parents
don't want to see him.

176
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,073
It's like
they blame him for...

177
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,508
Not being savior enough.

178
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,377
He was all they could talk about
for the last nine months,

179
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,580
And now they just want him for spare parts.
They really have to choose which girl to save?

180
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,315
I know. It's awful.

181
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,384
Right now they're willing
to let both girls die

182
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,852
When they could save one.

183
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,854
I mean,
how's that make sense-

184
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,790
To have a cure
and not use it?

185
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,526
Parents can be
pretty screwed up sometimes.

186
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,394
Mm.

187
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,064
Nai is gonna come around, sam.

188
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,398
Ooh.

189
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,933
There we go.

190
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,503
You guys are gonna
get through this.

191
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,646
Well, sam,
w- why don't you, um...

192
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,781
Tell naomi
what you neefrom her?

193
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,484
And that way,
she can hear it from you.

194
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,585
Okay.

195
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,255
I know, uh,
that this marriage is crazy.

196
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,125
But it's either
that or adoption. No.

197
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,060
Maya could move in
with one of us,

198
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,263
And-and we could help
raise the baby- no.

199
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,232
Or we could
pay for everything

200
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,835
And-and help her live
as-as normally as possible.

201
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,003
No, sam. No. No.

202
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,839
I am sorry.

203
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,341
I am doing the best that I can,
but I'm not like you.

204
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,244
I can't hold her hand through this
process. I'm not holding her hand.

205
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,446
Sam, you are treating
this marriage like it is

206
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,482
A real possibility. I
didn't say that. Did I s-

207
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,951
Did I say that?
I don't think he said that.

208
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,854
I- I didn't hear it
that way.

209
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,089
Uh, I know
an unwanted pregnancy

210
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,759
Can wreak havoc
with a relationship.

211
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,930
Uh, but-but you two
can get through this

212
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:03,001
Without tearing
each other apart.

213
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,970
You wanted me to come up.
I came up.

214
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:09,407
Please. You can't even sit here
and talk about the issue...

215
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,376
This bis coming.
I don't like it.

216
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,445
You don't like it.
But it's coming.

217
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,781
All the choices are bad.
I know that.

218
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,150
But we can't bury our heads
in the sand,

219
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,286
And you can't sit there
and say "no" to every sug-

220
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,388
That's not an option. You know
what? Right now, I'm sorry.

221
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:27,859
Right now, you know what?
That is all that I have.

222
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:31,163
Great. That helped.

223
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,134
Well, you know,
these things take time.

224
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,536
Absolutely, absolutely.

225
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,106
I think that was
a- a good start.

226
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,809
"for till
that was finished"...

227
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,811
She's drawn her line
in the sand.

228
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,647
There's nothing to do.

229
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,115
Hey, you two...

230
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,051
You have hung together
through this from the beginning.

231
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,020
Don't let this
get between you.

232
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,756
It's an impossible choice.
No one could make it.

233
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,561
The thing is...

234
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,263
I can.

235
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,465
We all saywe love,

236
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,102
And I love my girls,
both of 'em.

237
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,672
But put a gun to my head...

238
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,440
And I could.

239
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,509
I could choose.

240
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,180
What does that say
about me, hmm?

241
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,584
What kind of man
does that make me?

242
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,696
Honey.

243
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,200
I love niki
with all of my heart,

244
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,437
And if I could give my life
to save hers, I would.

245
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,572
You know that.

246
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,876
Just-I can't
watch them both die.

247
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,646
This isn't fair, renee. It's
not fair for any of us. No!

248
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,682
Give the cord blood to kelli
before she gets worse.

249
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,317
No. I won't allow it.

250
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,920
Either they both get it
or neither.

251
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,455
Renee-
no!

252
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,123
You're going to hell.

253
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,863
She's probably right.

254
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,986
I've been
doing the same thing...

255
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:25,137
E- ever since dink mentioned
the word "marriage."

256
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:29,107
Doesn't take a doctor
to diagnose my headache.

257
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:30,876
Corinne davis.
Sam bennett.

258
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,477
Please have a seat.

259
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:34,346
Is maya's mother
going to join us?

260
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,449
Uh, no. She-she-
she's tied up.

261
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:38,884
Oh.

262
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:40,719
Okay. Well, um...

263
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:45,123
I- it's just me on...
On our end, so...

264
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:49,194
I- I know this is
all awkward and awful.

265
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,962
But she's lovely,
your daughter...

266
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:52,664
and funny.

267
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:54,766
I- I do love
seeing them together.

268
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,701
You know maya?

269
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,904
All the time
she spends at our house.

270
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:00,739
Huh.

271
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:02,707
They came to me
after you said no,

272
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,109
And we talked.

273
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:07,579
And, um, I have
a guesthouse in the back.

274
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:11,116
It's not huge,
but they could move in there.

275
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,817
I- I work during the week,

276
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:15,420
So we're gonna have to figure
out some kind of day care.

277
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:18,023
But I-I come home early,
so I could help.

278
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,958
And dink-he'll come home
after school

279
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:22,394
Or after his band practice
or something,

280
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:25,163
And-and, um, I don't know
maya's schedule,

281
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:27,365
But between the three of us

282
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,334
And-and you and your-
well, maya's mother,

283
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:31,269
And whatever
you're willing to do,

284
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:34,406
I think that we can try
to help them...

285
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,241
Make this work.

286
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,109
So then,
you're behind this?

287
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:41,246
You're behind 2
15 year olds getting married

288
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,181
And playing house?

289
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:45,951
I know it's crazy.

290
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:47,852
I- I'm just trying
to figure it out

291
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:50,188
For myself, too, you know,
and...

292
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:52,724
M- maybe it's crazy
that it's crazy, you know?

293
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:55,126
I mean, we try and teach
our kids responsibility

294
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:59,798
And-and that family
is important.

295
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:02,100
I mean,
for most of history,

296
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,703
This is
when kids got married.

297
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:07,672
And-and in some parts
of the country, it still is.

298
00:14:07,707 --> 00:14:09,074
Okay. Excuse me.

299
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:11,142
Uh, I don't-
I don't know your son,

300
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:12,811
Hardly at all.

301
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,779
But my daughter?
E's just a little girl.

302
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:16,948
And she doesn't need
a husband.

303
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:20,085
She certainly doesn't need
a house.

304
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:23,321
Uh, what she does need
is a high school education.

305
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:26,391
And she's going to get one.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

306
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:28,293
If she gets married,

307
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,495
She'll have someone else
to think about,

308
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,399
And her choices will be limited. Or she'll
have someone who supports her in those choices.

309
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,568
Look, I know
that you are against this,

310
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:39,004
But if you don't sign
these papers,

311
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:40,972
What happens then?

312
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:44,809
What happens if they run off
or-or worse?

313
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:48,580
Look, this isn't what I wanted
for my kid either.

314
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:52,017
But I would rather have them
close by,

315
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:53,885
Right or wrong,

316
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,990
So we could pick up the pieces
no matter what happens.

317
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:02,127
oh, thank god you're here.

318
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:04,396
You gotta help her.

319
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,865
What's happening? Can someone
take kelli out of the room, please?

320
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,134
I don't want to leave her.
It's okay, baby.

321
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:11,270
Just go with the nurse.
Okay, she's septic.

322
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:13,772
I need a c.B.C.
And a chem panel times two.

323
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:16,842
We're gonna set up a central
line. What's wrong with her?

324
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:20,345
She has an infection. She may
have relapsed. oh, god.

325
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,214
Oh, my god.

326
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:24,049
Get away from her.
Renee.

327
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,985
You said it, and it happened. This is
all your fault. I didn't make this happen.

328
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,855
You said it,d it happened.

329
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,558
Get out!

330
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:35,260
Come on, baby.

331
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:41,066
Who's buying?
I got dying twins.

332
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,068
I just spent
the last three hours

333
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:45,671
Stabilizing one with sepsis. I've
got a pregnant teenage daughter

334
00:15:45,705 --> 00:15:47,673
Who wants to get married.
Family trumps patients.

335
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:49,641
Hey, did I mention that
the dying twins' father

336
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:51,043
Wants to save his favorite,

337
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:53,011
The mother
wants them both to die,

338
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:56,348
No one's talking, no one's getting better?
I've got a pregnant teenage daughter

339
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:58,584
Who wants to get married.
Okay, I'll buy.

340
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:07,192
Oh, no, no, no. I think she's looking
at me. Unh-unh. I just sent her a drink.

341
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,761
Doesn't look like
she needs a father figure.

342
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,296
Don't kid yourself there, pal.

343
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:13,632
Being a single father
is awesome.

344
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:17,336
Now that I finally have a couple of
hours to myself, I'm...

345
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,771
I am that guy.
Mnh-mnh.

346
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:22,174
Aww.
I gotta go.

347
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:27,045
So, um... So would it
be okay if I ditched you?

348
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,315
You're not very good company. Just
buy me another round. I'll be good.

349
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,284
All right.

350
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:43,395
Charlotte.

351
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:54,339
Guess you're not
going out tonight.

352
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:56,308
It's comfortable.

353
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:58,210
And, uh, no, I'm not
going out tonight.

354
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:01,313
I thought you were going out,
moving on from cooper.

355
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:03,582
I don't need to
whore around like cooper

356
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:06,818
To prove I'm over him. Hey,
charlotte, I had a book here.

357
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:10,122
Jane austen? You're
actually reading that? Yes.

358
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:11,456
Snuggie, jane austen...

359
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:13,025
I was gonna make martinis,

360
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,727
But maybe you want
some warm milk.

361
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:18,163
Book's on the shelf
along with the catalogs,

362
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:20,265
Next to the mail
and the coupons.

363
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,200
You ever put anything away?

364
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,703
You gonna make those martinis
or what?

365
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,841
I think you only like me for my
martinis. I think you're right.

366
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:32,377
You know cooper's wrong,
right?

367
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:35,347
About me doing this
to hold on to him?

368
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:36,782
Yeah, absolutely.

369
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:39,217
'cause you did
invite me here.

370
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:41,720
I did. And if you
don't want me here...

371
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:45,357
No, no, no.
We're, uh... We're good.

372
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:57,202
Hey.
Hey.

373
00:17:57,236 --> 00:18:00,505
Would you mind driving me
to work tomorrow?

374
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,076
I have-I left my car
at the bar.

375
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,545
what bar?

376
00:18:10,316 --> 00:18:11,850
I have no idea.

377
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:17,089
I am drunk.
Yeah. I picked up on that.

378
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:19,091
I like-
I- I like being drunk though.

379
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,860
It makes me cl-I feel clear.
It gives me clarity.

380
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,662
Oh, yes.
Well, medically speaking,

381
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:25,797
That's exactly
what alcohol does.

382
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:28,233
It makes you sharper
and more focused.

383
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,869
No, that's for you.
I'm being serious.

384
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,605
Did you figure out
the whole maya thing?

385
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:36,842
No.

386
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,577
That's-that's the clarity.

387
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,012
This whole thing sucks.

388
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,280
I have a 15-year-old daughter
who is pregnant,

389
00:18:42,315 --> 00:18:44,583
And I can't do
a damn thing about it.

390
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:47,853
And I'm pissed.
I'm a little sad.

391
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:50,122
And I keep...

392
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:53,625
Sh-she had this, uh,
gymnastics competition,

393
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:56,061
And she-she fell

394
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:58,597
And she smashed up her foot,

395
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:02,134
But... She wouldn't quit.

396
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,369
Turned out
she had broken a toe.

397
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,538
But she had to finish.

398
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:10,675
Even back then, she was-
she was so stubborn.

399
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,577
She's just...

400
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:15,914
So cute and stubborn
and just...

401
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,649
Determined...

402
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,685
So little.

403
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,088
Sam.

404
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,925
Okay.

405
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,963
Oh.

406
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,203
Sam.
Hmm?

407
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:41,206
This is a bad idea.
Why?

408
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,041
You're drunk.

409
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:45,977
I'm not that drunk.

410
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:00,873
Okay.

411
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,741
Maybe we kiss
when we're upset

412
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:06,478
As, like, a comfort thing,
a safe kissing place.

413
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:08,914
Yeah, okay. We're lonely...

414
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:11,617
Lonely neighbors.
Yes.

415
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:15,788
No. No, that kiss
was not neighborly.

416
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:17,389
That kiss was...
Hot.

417
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,525
Very hot.
Okay.

418
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,161
Do you...

419
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:25,197
Want to keep kissing...

420
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:27,199
See where it goes?

421
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,868
Do you?

422
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,548
Oh, no, no, no. Wait.
I'm having déjà vu.

423
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:45,350
No, I can't do this
here in my office, again.

424
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:47,286
No, no. This ia bad idea.
Why?

425
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,256
Because I-I just think-
we're not thinking about...

426
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:54,426
Naomi. I-

427
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,495
I don't care about naomi.

428
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,163
I'm over naomi.

429
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:02,534
I know, sam. But you're
my best friend's ex-husband.

430
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:04,970
I don't care.

431
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:13,512
Ahem.

432
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:16,014
Do you know where sam-
oh, there you are.

433
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,783
Hey. You found me.

434
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:20,719
I talked to naomi.
I got her to reconsider.

435
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:23,122
She's in there with violet.
So if you're free,

436
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,058
I think we should strike
while the iron is hot.

437
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:27,960
Okay?

438
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,931
Am I gonna be okay?

439
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:35,734
Well, this is really helping.

440
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:39,638
Good. 'cause...
I don't want to die.

441
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,046
I know.

442
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,450
Her fever's down,

443
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,752
And she's stabilized
for the time being.

444
00:21:53,786 --> 00:21:56,255
Maybe renee was right.
I said it out loud and-

445
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,857
You did not will this
to happen. But I chose.

446
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:00,826
God's punishing me.
And niki-

447
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,996
Niki is fighting,
and she's a strong girl.

448
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,698
But, um...This does chang.

449
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,268
I think I could
get her into remission,

450
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:12,137
But we'll need to use the cord blood to
really give her a shot. But the longer we wait,

451
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:14,072
This could happen
to kelli, too.

452
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:16,742
And then we'd be right
back here. I know.

453
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:19,311
No. We need to do this.

454
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:21,480
Do the transfusion on kelli.

455
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:23,015
Okay, I can't do that

456
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,950
Without getting permission
from both of you.

457
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:27,152
Then I'll get a court order.

458
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:29,087
I'm not gonna let kelli die

459
00:22:29,122 --> 00:22:31,456
Because her mother
can't make a choice.

460
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,794
Celebrating
our daughter's marriage

461
00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:38,463
With a bunch
of prep school kids...

462
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:42,901
Having dink and maya
move into your house

463
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:44,903
And have sex
in your guest room

464
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:47,239
Because they're married,

465
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:49,241
Watching you walk
our 15-year-old daughter

466
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:51,877
Down the aisle
to marry some boy named dink...

467
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:54,947
I mean, do we-do we even know
what his real name is, sam,

468
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:57,816
This-this boy-this boy that
wants to marry your daughter?

469
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,818
I'm not saying
that I support it.

470
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:02,020
I just-I...

471
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:05,123
I just think that the, uh,
the baby should have a father.

472
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:07,726
Y- your mother
is a great woman.

473
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,761
I know,
and she worked two jobs

474
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:12,931
And she's overprotective,
and I love her for it.

475
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:15,634
But maybe
it would've been better

476
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:18,036
If my father
werehave been there.

477
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:19,972
I think
sam's just pointing out

478
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:22,274
That two parents
could be better than one.

479
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:23,875
Naomi...

480
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,545
I- I think that sam
just wants you to think about

481
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,280
What the alternatives are.

482
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:34,486
I don't like it, nai.

483
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,892
They say
that they're m.F.E.O.

484
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:42,894
M- m.F.E.O.?
Oh, god.

485
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,298
Made for each other.
And, no, they are not, sam.

486
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:48,367
They are not.

487
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,172
Look, I know you want
to talk about this more,

488
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:56,908
But I just can't.
I can't. I'm sorry.

489
00:23:56,943 --> 00:23:59,011
I wish I could,
but I can't.

490
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,479
Okay. Well...

491
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:03,048
Dink's mother is coming back
this afternoon.

492
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:05,050
If you can't, you can't.

493
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:06,682
But I'm gonna have to make
some decisions

494
00:24:06,717 --> 00:24:08,546
For the both of us.

495
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,643
There's no way!
I won't let this happen.

496
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:18,439
No, you'll just watch
both girls die!

497
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:21,209
Okay. All right. Stop! Stop. This
is awful. I know it is, whoa, whoa.

498
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:23,277
But you need
to take care of this for them.

499
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:26,014
We should let niki die? No,
you should let one of them live.

500
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,017
You should give the cord blood
to niki because she's weak

501
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,219
And she needs it. You should
give it to kelli

502
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:33,354
So you don't lose her, too.
I don't know.

503
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,924
I don't know which one's best, which you can live
with. I can't choose between one child and another.

504
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,393
You already have.

505
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:41,796
You had a baby yesterday.
You haven't even looked at him.

506
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,966
I want to love him.

507
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,970
I just...

508
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:53,174
I feel like
he's gonna replace them.

509
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,611
I can't face that.

510
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,946
no one
wants to face this.

511
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:00,715
But we have to.

512
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,892
Uh, can you come with me
to the exam room?

513
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,660
You need a consult?

514
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:15,463
No. Maya's there.

515
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:19,567
Maya, are you okay?
Dell said you were okay.

516
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,803
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...

517
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:24,238
Show him.
Yep.

518
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:27,608
Okay.

519
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:30,144
Um... Here's the heart.

520
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,246
It's beating strong.

521
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,948
And the head.

522
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:39,821
It's pretty cool, huh?

523
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:49,030
what are you doing?

524
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,898
Uh...

525
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:53,034
Trying not to eat
the chocolate.

526
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,937
How's that going for you?

527
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,939
Not good,
but if I eat it,

528
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,941
I'm gonna have to run
for 5 miles

529
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,576
On the treadmill tonight,

530
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,846
And I don't, uh, I don't think I have
5 miles in me. It's just one chocolate.

531
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,547
No,
it's the gateway chocolate.

532
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:08,449
I eat one, I eat them all.

533
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,518
It's just food, nai.
It's not a solution.

534
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:12,019
But it's what I can do.

535
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:14,789
Everything else, um...

536
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:19,627
It's like I'm 13.

537
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:24,365
Yeah, I know that I am
a calm, rational person

538
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,267
With many graduate degrees.

539
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:27,935
I run my own business,

540
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,606
And I am a strong,
smart adult.

541
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,509
And, uh, yet, I have
a 15-year-old daughter

542
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:37,378
Who was supposed to have
a life.

543
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,013
And, uh...

544
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:42,216
The only way I can cope with
that is this.

545
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,185
Which is what I did
when I was 13.

546
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:46,154
It was always just me
and the chocolate,

547
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,588
Me and the food.

548
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:49,624
And, uh, I know
it's ridiculous, and...

549
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:52,527
I know that I am burying
my head in the sand,

550
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:55,596
But it's...
What I can do.

551
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:57,832
I can do this.
I can do this chocolate.

552
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,301
I can, um... I'm in charge
of this chocolate

553
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:01,769
And my battle with food.

554
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,538
This I can do.

555
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:07,241
I can't do maya
and babies and marriage.

556
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:11,179
I know you can't.

557
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,080
But you... Pulling out,

558
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:15,950
You're leaving sam to
figure this out on his own.

559
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:18,352
And I'm there,
and I'm trying to help,

560
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:22,156
But... I'm not...

561
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,592
Even sure
how you feel about that.

562
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:26,627
Feel about what?

563
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:28,930
Me and sam...
Having these conversations.

564
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:31,499
I mean, it's just
a little weird, you know.

565
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,468
I mean, we live next door
to each other, we sit and talk,

566
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:36,370
And, uh... I don't know.
It's...

567
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,306
It's like-
it's-it's like...

568
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,310
Sam d I are the couple.

569
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:51,352
Oh, that's funny, right?

570
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:54,589
What, you and sam?

571
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:57,959
Yeah, it's funny. Yeah.

572
00:27:57,993 --> 00:27:59,827
thank you for that,

573
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:02,163
For making me laugh.

574
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:05,032
I needed that.
Oh, my god. You and sam.

575
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:08,736
Oh, god. That is just wrong
on so many levels.

576
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,705
Oh!

577
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:13,608
It's like, first you sleep with
your husband's best friend

578
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:16,077
And then you sleep with
your best friend's husband.

579
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:18,112
oh, my god.

580
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:20,381
You-you-you would be
the worst person ever.

581
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,950
<i>You would need
these chocolates.</i>

582
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:25,119
yeah. Nuh.

583
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:27,021
Uh-huh.

584
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:29,557
Mm.

585
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:45,806
I can't do this.

586
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,975
I can't break their hearts.

587
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:51,478
You do it.

588
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:58,118
T me?

589
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:11,431
Are mom and dad
still fighting?

590
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:14,101
No, no. No.

591
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:15,969
Is something wrong
with trevor?

592
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,872
No. He's fine.
Trevor's fine.

593
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,641
But here's the thing-

594
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,576
We were all hoping
threvor's blood

595
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:26,280
Was gonna help you both get better.
We're not going to get better?

596
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:29,583
Well, niki is too sick to have
the treatment right now.

597
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:31,718
Well, I'm feeling better,
though.

598
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:34,955
I know, and that's good.

599
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:38,892
But your body's too weak
for the blood to help you.

600
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:41,695
And so we need to give it
to kelli.

601
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:50,070
How long till I get it?

602
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:53,240
Well, that's the thing,
sweetie.

603
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:55,976
There just isn't enough
for both of you.

604
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:03,650
I can share
so we can both get it.

605
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:06,620
I know. I wish that was
the way that it works.

606
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:08,255
But it doesn't.

607
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:12,025
But...

608
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,262
If we both don't get it...

609
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:19,533
I don't want it.
I don't want it.

610
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,602
We do everything together,
everything the same.

611
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,913
But you have to get better.

612
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:34,815
It's lucky.

613
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:36,516
So you'll get better.

614
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:38,919
Okay?

615
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:02,134
Naomi.
Mom... You came.

616
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:04,603
Yeah, I came.

617
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:07,339
I'm... So glad
to finally meet you.

618
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:09,541
I'm, uh, sorry
that I was late.

619
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,376
Well, I'm-I'm here.

620
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,745
boy,
I- I know that this

621
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:16,214
Has been hard on all of us.

622
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,917
They've put us in
a difficult situation.

623
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:22,988
I know that we all feel
a little... Scared.

624
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:25,123
But we are all
in the same position, so-

625
00:31:25,158 --> 00:31:27,859
Excuse me. No, we are-
we are not,

626
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:29,361
Uh, in the same position.

627
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:31,530
Your son can walk away,
and, uh,

628
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:34,065
My daughter is stuck with this
in her belly for nine months.

629
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,501
I think that you're
missing the point here.

630
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:38,703
<i>My son is not walking away.</i>

631
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:40,906
You're missing my point.
He could.

632
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,641
Mom-
mrs. Bennett,

633
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:44,376
I...

634
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,746
Dr. Bennett, ma'am...

635
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:52,184
I don't want to walk away.

636
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:58,023
I appreciate that.
I do.

637
00:31:58,057 --> 00:32:00,258
But, um, this idea...

638
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,661
This marrie...

639
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:04,596
I said
I would...

640
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,865
Sign the consent.

641
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,333
We all...

642
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:11,236
All of us had
a really good talk.

643
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,040
You weren't here,
so... We decided.

644
00:32:15,074 --> 00:32:16,808
Mom...

645
00:32:16,842 --> 00:32:20,845
<i>I want you to understand.</i>

646
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,216
I want you
to support all of this.

647
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,854
I guess that's not
for me to say.

648
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:36,194
His name is fillmore.

649
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:40,365
Dink-it's just...
Just a nickname...

650
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,067
Ma'am.

651
00:32:58,618 --> 00:33:00,552
Jerry.

652
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:02,954
Hey.

653
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:04,422
Um...

654
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:07,092
Niki needs you.

655
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,802
Daddy.

656
00:33:17,837 --> 00:33:20,872
I am so sorry, baby.

657
00:33:20,906 --> 00:33:23,108
Come here.

658
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:36,288
I wanted niki to spend
some time with her brother.

659
00:34:05,351 --> 00:34:08,119
I tried.

660
00:34:08,154 --> 00:34:12,957
I tried to engage,
but... I was too late.

661
00:34:12,992 --> 00:34:15,727
And now I...

662
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,629
Y- you know, I used to-

663
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:19,998
I used to think of myself
as a good person.

664
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,001
You know, I was-I was
a good friend, a good mother

665
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:25,103
And a good ex-wife.

666
00:34:25,137 --> 00:34:28,406
But something happened,
and now I...

667
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,042
You know, I didn't get it.

668
00:34:31,077 --> 00:34:34,045
What you went through
with lucas and walking away,

669
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,980
I didn't get it.

670
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:38,850
And I know maya's not like that,
but I get it now.

671
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:43,221
I do. I'm sorry.

672
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,156
You don't get it.

673
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:47,192
You don't...

674
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:49,127
I didn't
walk away from my child

675
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:51,096
Because I couldn't
deal with him

676
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,865
Or because I wanted
to control what he did.

677
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:55,667
For me,
walking away was

678
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,936
The... Most awful thing
in my life.

679
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,106
But I-I made a choice...

680
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,944
Because I thought it was
in my child's best interest.

681
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:09,314
I was just...

682
00:35:09,348 --> 00:35:12,617
Too damaged to do anything
but hurt lucas.

683
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:15,887
So I walked away...

684
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:22,160
Not to avoid him
or to...

685
00:35:22,194 --> 00:35:24,162
control him,

686
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:26,698
But to save him.

687
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:29,534
But, nai, you just...

688
00:35:29,568 --> 00:35:31,503
you didn't get your way.

689
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:33,438
So you wanto walk away

690
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:37,142
To avoid figuring out
what comes next.

691
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,277
I didn't get my way.

692
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:41,179
You didn't get your way.

693
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:43,481
I didn't get my way.

694
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:51,289
So what do I do now?

695
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,158
I don't know.

696
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,194
if I had the answer
on how to be a mother,

697
00:35:56,228 --> 00:35:58,797
I'd be doing it myself.

698
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:16,347
If I tell you something,
you can't tell anyone else.

699
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,783
You're my shrink.
Those are the rules, right?

700
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:20,718
Actually,
I'm not your therapist

701
00:36:20,753 --> 00:36:22,120
Or your psychiatrist.

702
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:25,957
As I recall, we talked once,
just briefly.

703
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:27,926
Are you gonna tell anyone
or not?

704
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,361
Well, unless you
killed someone, I...

705
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:36,568
If I can help, I'll help.

706
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:38,570
I do have an office.

707
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:40,338
I like someone... A lot.

708
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:43,641
And my dating life in l.A.
Has been a little... Crazy.

709
00:36:43,676 --> 00:36:45,076
It's been awful and hard.

710
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,045
And suddenly I meet someone
who's easy,

711
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,446
And it's not hard work.

712
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:50,448
And there's not
that awkward dance

713
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:51,883
Of "getting to know you."

714
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,786
It's like... It's like
picking up on the 60th date.

715
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,788
It's like what I've
been looking for

716
00:36:56,822 --> 00:36:59,390
Has been right in front of me
the whole time.

717
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,960
Well, it sounds... Perfect.
It could be.

718
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:05,463
But... Seeing him...

719
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:07,298
Would hurt a friend.

720
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:10,201
You care about this friend?

721
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:13,471
She's my closest friend.

722
00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:15,240
Ah.

723
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,875
Yes, well...

724
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,010
that could be a problem.

725
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:20,678
That's not
a helpful response.

726
00:37:20,713 --> 00:37:23,014
When someone like you
poses a problem like this,

727
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:25,049
I- I think you know
what you want

728
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,651
And that you want it,

729
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:29,587
And you're looking for me to
tell you that it's all right

730
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,523
To do what you want.
And is it?

731
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:33,424
I think friendship
is important.

732
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:36,294
And lord knows, this friend,
this woman you're talking about,

733
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:38,162
I don't want to see her

734
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:40,131
Be put through
anything else right now.

735
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:42,834
But... If this
is really it, right,

736
00:37:42,868 --> 00:37:44,802
The one...

737
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:48,139
I don't know
that I could walk away.

738
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:59,083
You want to live here, you want
to be friends with violet-

739
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,485
That is your business,

740
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,820
And I will not
make it about me.

741
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:05,690
Well... Big of you.

742
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:07,825
she's not home.

743
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:17,835
So I just signed
a piece of paper

744
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,272
Allowing my daughter
to get married.

745
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:22,674
Congratulations

746
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,776
<i>Or I'm sorry.</i>

747
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,611
Which do you want?

748
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:30,548
Okay, I...

749
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:34,519
I want to pour
these two glasses of wine,

750
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:38,690
And then take you upstairs
to my bedroom,

751
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:42,126
Take off
all of your clothes...

752
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:45,830
And I want to stop talking
about what we both...

753
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:48,533
Want to do.

754
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:54,839
That was bold.

755
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:57,442
That-that was a whole lot
of boldness...

756
00:38:57,476 --> 00:38:59,243
Going on there.

757
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:03,481
I'm-I'm freaked out, too.
I am.

758
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:06,217
But... I mean, we can either

759
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:09,487
Talk and talk and talk
and talk about it

760
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:11,923
Or we can stop talking

761
00:39:11,957 --> 00:39:14,525
And just...

762
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,963
Be sam and addison and...

763
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:21,265
See how it goes.

764
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:25,603
Sam...

765
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:27,372
You and naomi-

766
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,841
All right, wait. Look...
Not me and naomi.

767
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,209
Me and you.

768
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,111
<i>Me and naomi-</i>

769
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:36,114
Stop staying that.
Naomi is gone!

770
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:38,383
She walked out...

771
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,851
On me.

772
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,886
She walked out
on her daughter.

773
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,322
Walked out.

774
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:46,257
So I have no allegiance
to naomi.

775
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,259
When I wanted to give it
another try,

776
00:39:48,293 --> 00:39:51,129
She walked out,
and it killed me.

777
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:54,666
Until now.

778
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,634
Now I don't care about naomi.

779
00:39:56,702 --> 00:39:58,403
Now...

780
00:40:00,372 --> 00:40:02,306
Now I want you.

781
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,945
Naomi di't walk out on me.
She's my best friend.

782
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,415
I can't...

783
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,917
Look, I'm a cheater.
It's what I do. Ah, don't-

784
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:15,920
Or what I did. I want it to be
what I did, past tense.

785
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:19,057
Sam, I know that you and I
don't have vows or rules.

786
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:20,958
Still, sleeping with
my best friend's ex-husband-

787
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:22,994
It's cheating.
I'm sorry, but it is.

788
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:24,862
And I can't do that to naomi.

789
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:28,499
And more importantly,
I can't do that to myself.

790
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:31,469
Not anymore. I'm trying
to be a better person.

791
00:40:31,503 --> 00:40:34,405
Why can't just-
just once...

792
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,541
Why can't I get
what I want...

793
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:38,176
What you want?

794
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,511
Sam- you-you- you
don't want this?

795
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:43,581
Your heart doesn't want this?
I can't sten to my heart...

796
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:45,583
Just-
not this time. Sam, sam.

797
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,120
Sam.

798
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:51,289
Please.

799
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:55,293
I'm sorry. Okay, please.
I'm sorry.

800
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:58,496
I'm sorry.

801
00:41:03,535 --> 00:41:05,903
Yeah. O-okay.

802
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:19,217
