1
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,100
You would not believethe day I had.

2
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,350
You look good.

3
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,420
So I had this perp,and I am
running my ass offchasing him,

4
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,610
which is not what I do,but I'm doing
itbecause this guy,he hurt a kid.

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,930
He's scum.

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,620
And he actually shoots at me.

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,500
He fires on me. I mean,I don't
get hit,but now I'm pissed.

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,780
So I keep running him
downtotally against protocol,

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,610
but there is no way this
guyis getting away from me now.

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,350
So I catch him,I grab him,I throw
him to the ground. He's eing gravel.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,690
I so want to kick his
ass,but I hold it in,

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,280
cuff him,'cause I'm the good guy.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,770
I'm the white hat.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,460
Oh,white hat--I
like that.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,390
Wait. There's,uh,there's one more.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,870
You have a second gun...

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,270
hidden on your body?

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,010
I have a second,hidden gun.

19
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,530
You have a second,hidden gun.

20
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,790
I love you.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,620
Okay,her.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,990
No,no,no,no. Her.

23
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,160
What would I say?

24
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,220
-You're a doctor.
-You're a doctor.

25
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,100
No. She's not right. She's not right.

26
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,860
-You're scared?
-No,I'm not afraid.

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,630
It's just--I'm just
out of practice.

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,900
-Okay,when--when did youand naomi
get together,college? -Yeah,college.

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,610
-How'd you pick her up?
-Uh,well,she asked me out.

30
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,320
you got no game.

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,200
He's got no game. You
never had to have game.

32
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,720
Hey,I have game,all right?
I have all types of game.

33
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,550
I'm--I'm handsome.
All right?

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,980
I just... I'd like to
seeone of you two try.

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,810
I have a woman,but if I didn't,I
coulddo this in my sleep.

36
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,700
Cooper.

37
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,100
Okay,her. Right there. That blonde.

38
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,780
Come on. Too easy.

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,450
Not easy. Disturbing.

40
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,460
I thoughtthat she spent
her nightswith her coven.

41
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,810
Yeah,pick a different woman,one
with bloodrunning through her veins.

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,660
Where are you going?

43
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,320
Coop? Cooper?
Cooper,where are you going?

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,330
Leave with me right now.

45
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,440
Don't you dare o me.

46
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,380
Leave with me right now,please.

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,430
I'll do the thingwith
my tongue... twice.

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,960
I've gotta go. I'll call you later.

49
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,160
Are you serious?

50
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,730
this banging has to stop.

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,560
Fourth-floor constructiongot you down

52
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,680
you know,people actually don'tlike to have
their therapyin the midstof incessant banging.

53
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,040
I thought you were gonna
callthe construction company.

54
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,010
I did,and they referred meto the leasing
company,who in turn referred meto the attorney.

55
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,580
Apparently they havea legal rightto carry
out constructionduring business hours.

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,450
-Who is they?
-Violet...

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,150
we rented the floor,they are a
corporation,they need to remodel.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,330
morning.

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,200
-No,I don't want
to--what? Go ahead.

60
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,740
I'm not gonnaif we're not...

61
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,970
we are. Yeah,we are. We are.

62
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,420
He's perfect. He's a good guy.

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,460
-He's sweet and funnyand very
pretty and--and the problem is what?

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,290
He said it.

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,470
Oh,god. He said it? So fast?

66
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,850
I'm freaking out. Why am I freaked out?

67
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,850
-Well,because you haveust issues.
-I don't have trust issues.

68
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,000
You cheated on derek.
Derek cheated on you.

69
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,470
How could you not have trust issues?

70
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,000
This is not about that.

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,740
It's about what kevin said. He said...

72
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,960
what is wrong with himthat
he would say it so soon?

73
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,920
-Maybe he actually
does--no,no,no. Don't y it.

74
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,150
Trust issues.

75
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,000
we've got some news.

76
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,500
Big news.

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,170

samto a bar last night.

78
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,870

-I go to bars...

79
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,660

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,670

81
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,280

82
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,930
C-c--t--cooper slept

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,680
Oh,violet,come on. I know you're mad at meabout

84
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,080
Oh,you--you

85
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,700
You do. You know something.

86
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,060
Violet turner,what is it?

87
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,130

88
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,640
Did it go badly? Did itnot go badly?

89
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,490
Did it go well?

90
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,650
Are they--are they gonna do
itagain? Have they done it before?

91
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,590
How many times have theydone it before?

92
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,700
Are--oh,my god.
They're dating.

93
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,350
-Morning.
-You're dating charlotte king?

94
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,860
I didn't say a word.

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,010
So pete's been helping youwith
your holistic birth plan?

96
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,620
Yeah,he's been great.

97
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,680
I wantto do everything natural,but
daniel wants to knowthe sex.

98
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,740
I want a girl. Love boys,but
I want a little laura.

99
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,250
this may bea little bit cold.

100
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,770
sorry. I'll turn this off.

101
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,250
You can take it,honey.

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,620
He still working too hard?

103
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,640
Yeah,daniel's always working.

104
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,430
And he travels a lot,but he's
tried to cut downsince the baby.

105
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
It's not easy. We just
boughta house in the valley.

106
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,100
-And babies are expensive.
-Exactly.

107
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,370
But whenever he's away,he
always sends flowers.

108
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,200
Roses for meand daisies for the baby.

109
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,320
That's the baby's name--daisy--which
is whyit needs to be a girl.

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,230
A boy named daisy?

111
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,490
daniel,you're just in time.

112
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,890
Here we go.

113
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,700
See,there's a little arm...

114
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,030
and a lile hand.

115
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,740
Oh,my god. That's our baby.

116
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,450
So is it a boyor a girl?

117
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,660
Looks like... a little girl.

118
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,310
what's wrong?

119
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,490
There was a subtle abnormalityon your baby's
ultrasoundthat may indicatedigeorge syndrome.

120
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,610
It's a genetic disorderthat can...

121
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,900
cause heart defects.

122
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,970
So if our baby has it,one
of us gave it to her?

123
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,940
-Technically,yes,but--sometimes
these thingsjust happen.

124
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,210
We don't always know why.

125
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,460
-Danny--now we haven't
madea definitive diagnosis,

126
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,840
so let's just take ita step at a
timeand not jumpto any conclusions.

127
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,570
Let's get you downto the lab.

128
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,360
Franny,please,please take the pills.

129
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,660
Henry,good to see you.
It's beeway too long.

130
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,660
I'm sorry I keep
cancelingmy appointments.

131
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,170
It--it gets harderand
harder to get away.

132
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,590
That's okay. I understand. Frances...

133
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,880
you look lovely today.

134
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,730
She doesn'tremember much anymore.

135
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,690
Well,alzheimer'scan be very unforgiving.

136
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,870
-Hello.
-Oh,the other dr.Bennett.

137
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,440
Hello,frances.

138
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,100
Helen,is that you?

139
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,060
Helen was her sister. She
passed away a few years ago.

140
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,080
I don't need those pills.

141
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,190
Helen,you tl himI don't need those.

142
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,820
Of course you don't,ranny,but
why don't you take them?

143
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,050
Let's just humor him,okay?

144
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,060
She's got the magic touch,your wife.

145
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,300
okay,let's--let's
get you started.

146
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,250
Come on,franny.

147
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,530
Want to stay with helen.

148
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,360
That's okay,you go ahead.

149
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,040
Uh,franny and I have
a--a lot to talk about.

150
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,800
How you doing today,miss lady?

151
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,430
-I'm okay.
-Yeah? Well,you look beautiful.

152
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,320
it's loud.

153
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,820
It's loud in here,very loud.

154
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,320
Louder in here,quieter
in the exam rooms--

155
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,160
it's good for business,betterthan
the other way around.

156
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,720
So I put a rush on danieland
laura's lab results.

157
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,740
You should have somethingby noon,and
you have a new patientat 11:00.

158
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,150
-Thank you.
-I'd like to ask...

159
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,790
I'd like an officeso I could meet with
patientsand finish my midwife hours.

160
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,100
Well,give me some time. I'll
see what I cancome up with.

161
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,100
The thing is,I'd like it now.

162
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,170
-Dell,I wish we hadthe
space,but--actually,um,I made space.

163
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,180
I'll get rid of the boxes.

164
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,450
We will get you an
office,dell,a proper one.

165
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,100
I need an office now,today.

166
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,580
All right,if you have clientsyou need
to see today,you may use my office.

167
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,600
We will work this out,dell.

168
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,050
I don't like this.

169
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,480
You lost weight,you're anemic,your blood
pressure'sway too high. Thiss serious.

170
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,520
I took all of the pillsyou gave me.

171
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,880
They'll kick in soon enough.

172
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,810
You can't go on like this.

173
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,060
-Now I know that thingsare
difficult with frances--every day...

174
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,160
I losea little bit more of her.

175
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,490
She hasn't been lucidin over a year.

176
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,870
You know,there are other waysyou can look
after francesand take care of yourself.

177
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,020
Oh,no,sam. I told you. I'm not
gonna put herin a nursing home.

178
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,230
I promised herthat I wouldn't
years ago. We promised each other.

179
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,480
Circumstanceswere different then.

180
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,210
-You didn't knowabout the alzheimer'S.
-Sam,I promised her.

181
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,420
When she dies,she dies in my
arms--not with strangers,in my arms.

182
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,810
She's the love of my life.

183
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,890
I will not putthe love
of my life... in a home.

184
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,750
-no,addison,wait.
-Hi,there.

185
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,460
Thank you for seeing usso last minute.

186
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,820
Daniel pulled me out of class. He
said we had to havean ultrasound today.

187
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,500
I was tryingto warn you.

188
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,780
I have an O.B.,But daniel
saidyou were the best.

189
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,510
-Uh,I'm sorry.Uh,miss-
-this is amy,my wife.

190
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,590
You have two wives?

191
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,730
-He has two wives. Did you know that?
-No.

192
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,150
-Daniel--I didn't
planfor this to happen.

193
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,070
I've been happily
marriedto amy for 12 years.

194
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,120
But then three years ago,I
met laura. E fell in love.

195
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,480
-Do they know about each other?
-Please. You can't say anything.

196
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,890
It's a pretty dumb move...

197
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,710
bringing two wivesto the
same medical practice.

198
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,780
When you foundthe abnormality,I worried
amy's doctorshad missed something.

199
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,030
Amy's due date'sright around the corner.

200
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,700
I couldn't risk somethinggoing wrong
with her delivery,with our baby.

201
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,230
I should throw you out of here.

202
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,280
I should,but I won'T.

203
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,950
I'll go aheaand do the ultrasoundbecause your wife--that
wife--and her unborn childare the victims here.

204
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,220
I'm doing it for them,not you.

205
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,070
Let me be clear about that.

209
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,460
So,amy,you're a teacher?

210
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,810
Third grade. I love kids. I always have.

211
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,350
We want a big family.

212
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,400
And it looks likeyou're
well on your way.

213
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,980
Everything's okay?

214
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,060
You see that flickeringright
there? That isyour baby's heartbeat.

215
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,650
-It's so fast.
-That's normal.

216
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,610
Your baby isperfectly healthy.

217
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,010
Thank you,dr.Montgomer

218
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,990
thank you.

219
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,640
You're welcome.

220
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,210
Amy.

221
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,730
You told themabout charlotte.

222
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,480
I didn'T. I didn'T. They guessed.

223
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,510
And what do you care? You're the one
who walked outof the bar with cruella.

224
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,630
My relationship with charlotteis
mine,not yours,to shareor mock or...

225
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,300
call cruella.

226
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,340
You're the one who outedyour relationship.
You don't have a rightto be mad at me.

227
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,270
I'm sorry. I had a few too many
drinksand I did a spontaneous thing,

228
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,520
and now everybodyknows
about it,and that'S...

229
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,320
it makes it real.

230
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,190
It's very,very... very real.

231
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,710
Well,real is a good thing,right?

232
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,520
Yeah,I guess.

233
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay,look...

234
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:24,010
it's truethat I don't
like cruella--charlotte--

235
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,990
but that doesn't mean...

236
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,190
coop,you shouldn'tbe afraid
to hope,to want it to work out.

237
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,020
Hoping is healthy.

238
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,710
Real is a good thing?

239
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,560
Real's a good thing.

240
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,080
we are trying to workup here!

241
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,410
That'll help.

242
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,260
It's disrupting the workplace.

243
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,670
I want to know who's behind
it. Addison can't figure it out.

244
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,850
I'm gonna do it myself.
You want to help me?

245
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,510
I wish I could,nancy drew,but
I have children to heal.

246
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,850
Fine,fine. M gonna find out.

247
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,250
-hey,sam.
-Yeah.

248
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,930
I am thinking we should hita bar
tonight after work... Try again.

249
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,940
There are so manybeautiful
women in L. A.

250
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,870
Pete,naomi and I,we just came
outof a long-term relationship.

251
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,850
I don't knowif
I'm ready to--

252
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,960
sam,cooper is dating.

253
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,700
Well,cooper is datingthe antichrist.

254
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,050
Well,at least he's dating.

255
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,430
You gotta get back out there. I am
making it my missionto get you a date.

256
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,430
-we were just--we have
to go to the hospital.

257
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,300
Frances just had an accint.

258
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,960
I was helping herout of the tub,and she fell
and hit her head,and I-I tried to catch her.

259
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,870
Relax,relax.

260
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,410
All right,your blood pressure's
highand your pulse is irregular.

261
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,420
How's franny?

262
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,500
Everything looks good,but,uh,we'll--we'll
talk tothe attending before we go.

263
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,780
Helen... please take me home.

264
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,800
I want to go home.

265
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,240
We're gonna get you
homeas soon as possible.

266
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,800
This situationis getting
dangerousfor the both of you.

267
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,710
Oh,don't start with meagain,sam.

268
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,170
Did they do a C.T.Scanbefore
diagnosing herwith alzheimer's?

269
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,250
Her doctor saidshe
didn't need another test.

270
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,150
Is there something wrong?

271
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,230
Everything's fine,henry. It's fine.

272
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,100
Is the husband here?

273
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh,the husband just
leftwith the other wife.

274
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,190
-laura,hi.I'm dr.Freedman.
-Hi.

275
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,870
Laura...

276
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,530
the baby tested positivefor
digeorge syndrome.

277
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,620
here is some informationyouunderstand the
disorder,and we can go overall of it with you.

278
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,370
Will she... will she survive?

279
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,900
She'll survive delivery,but life...

280
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,680
for a childwith digeorge syndromeis...

281
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,790
difficult.

282
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:01,730
Digeorge syndromeis a genetic
disorder,and facial abnormalities.

283
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,710
She's gonna require
surgery--a number of surgeries.

284
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,120
And she'll need a lifetimeof medical
treatmentwith round-the-clock care.

285
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,620
What am I supposed to do,dr. Wilder?

286
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,880
Parents in your situation--about half of
themdecide to throughwith the pregnancy.

287
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,490
-The other half
de--oh,god. No.

288
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,320
End the pregnancy?

289
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,580
We tried for so longto get pregnant.

290
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,110
It took almost a year. I...

291
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,900
I just... I'm not ready--I'm
not ready to hear this.

292
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,590
I need my husband here.

293
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,500
***For all this drillingand banging?

294
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,020
I try to avoid manual labor,but
I am leasing the space.

295
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,610
For what?

296
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,810
I'm openinga new medical practice.

297
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,850
You're opening a practice here?

298
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,220
What about cooper?

299
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,520
-This has nothingto do with him.
-He's your riend.

300
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,790
This is business,and cooper is personal.

301
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,090
-It's not that simple.
-Maybe not for you,but I am not a therapist.

302
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,620
I don't have totalk about my
feelingsuntil everyone else's earsbleed.

303
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,210
-You need to tell him.
-I don't need to do anything.

304
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,200
If you don't do it,then I will.

305
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,270
Fine. I'll tell him.

306
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,240
It's disgusting.

307
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,390
It's disgusting and cruel.

308
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,060
I mean,he is usingthese two
women. --We have to tell them.

309
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,240
What our patients dooutside this
practiceis none of our business.

310
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,130
Oh,come on,pete. It's illegal.

311
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,280
I'm not saying I like it.

312
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,780
I'm saying we don't havethe right to
say anythingto either of these women.

313
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,530
But if laura does decideto have this
child,she's doing sounder the mistaken beliefthat

314
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,900
she has a loyaland committed
husbandto share the burdenwith her.

315
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,090
I don't condonedaniel's bavior.

316
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,020
but the factthat he's married
to two womendoesn't mean that

317
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,900
he's notcommitted to staying
loyalto both of themand the children.

318
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,900
He is a liar,and he
shouldn't--you know...

319
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,400
he doesn't deserve to
raisethose children.

320
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,420
That's an emotional response,not
a medical one. He's their father.

321
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,930
-So that gives him a free passto do whatever he wants?
-You can't say anything.

322
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,010
Don't you even thinkabout saying
a wordto either of those women,

323
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,280
or I will personally
report youto the A.M.A.

324
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,840
-Are you threatening me?
-Don't say a word.

325
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,720
Fine.

326
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,500
I won't say a word.

327
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,500
Didn't we talk about this?

328
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,740
we did.

329
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,950
-Look,I can make it work.
-Why is this so urgent,dell?

330
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,240
Okay,you don't want to talkabout it.
I still don't want youusing this space.

331
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,860
I need you to get laura larsonand amy
larsonback in here again todayat theame time.

332
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,170
Okay.

333
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,880
listen,uh,about peteand
this dating thing--

334
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,310
I think francesmight
not have alzheimer'S.

335
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,790
"Normal pressurehydrocephalus"?

336
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,930
Yeah,her C.T.Scan showedno
evidence of acute trauma.

337
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,670
But there was marked
dilatationin the ventricles.

338
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,410
Now N.P.H.And alzheimer'shave
similar symptoms.

339
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,930
Okay,but what differencedoes it make?

340
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,370
Her body is too frailfor her to be a
candidatefor a neurosurgical procedure.

341
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,090
Yeah,but there was a studythat
was doneabout ten years agoin

342
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,860
which a spinal tapwas performedto drain
the excess fluidoff of patients with N.P.H.

343
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:33,580
Now if she has this,the tapcould relieve the
symptomsand give hera few brief periods of clarity.

344
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,360
-Well,that's a big if,naomi.
-It's worth a try.

345
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,970
The only blessingof this disease is thatshe's not
cognizant enough tounderstand her own situation.

346
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,800
Do you want her to
understandhow bad things are?

347
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
I nt her to understandhow
bad things are for henry.

348
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,390
So then you'd put her
througha spinal tap?

349
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,610
If--if this were me,if
this were you and me-

350
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,660
-this is not you and me.
-I know that.

351
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,430
Well,this isa shot in the dark,naomi.

352
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,730
The frances I knewwould not have
wanted thisfor either of them,

353
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,750
and she's the only onewho can convince
henryto do what he needs to do.

354
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,640
hey,uh,laura larsonand
amy larson are here.

355
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,040
Put amy in exam room four.

356
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,280
Which exam room do you
wantto put laura in?

357
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,440
Let me worry about laura.

358
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,440
Is theresomething else wrong?

359
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,680
No.

360
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,630
Uh,no. No,no. I-I...

361
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,780
I just wantto make sure that you
haveall the informationthat you need.

362
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,280
Uh,the room's taken. I'm so sorry.
Dell must havemade a mistake.

363
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,650
Um,do the two of you mindhanging out in
here for a momentwhile I clear this up?

364
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,070
That's fine.

365
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,930
Two new moms. I'm sureyou've
got a lot to talk about.

366
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,480
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

367
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,910
-What did you do?
-I did not say a word.

368
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,730
just get away from me!

369
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,570
I've got to get out of here!

370
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,980
What did you do?

371
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,620
I didn't say a word.

372
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,110
You got around itby a legal technicality.

373
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,930
Exactly,because they hadthe right to know.

374
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,240
Whether they did or not,you had rightto orchestrate that.

375
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,630
I did what I would wantsomeone to do for me,pete.

376
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,780
You overstepped.

377
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,430
What is wrong with you today?

378
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,910
do you have any ideawhat you just did?

379
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,900
How long did you thinkyou could keep up this charade?

380
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,860
What part of my lifeare you calling a charade?

381
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,240
Take it easy.

382
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,680
I've been with amysince I was 21.

383
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,470
She's the woman I've beenhappily married to for 12 years.

384
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,430
So happily that you went outlooking for other women?

385
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,950
I never stopped loving amy,but when I met laura,it was...

386
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,700
I--have you ever met someoneand just knownthere was something between you

387
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,660
you couldn't resist,even if you tried?

388
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,480
I could have been one ofthose guys with a wife at homeand a girlfriend on the side,

389
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,080
but I married them bothbecause I wanted to dothe right thing.

390
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,760
You're living a lie,daniel.

391
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,380
You're cheating on two women,and cheating ruins lives.

392
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,490
I'm not the onewho ruined lives here today.

393
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,990
Um,as the kids would say,drama.

394
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,250
Addison's patients?I think it's so sad.

395
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,630
Sad but weird.

396
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,830
Sad but fodder for the bestdinner party story ever.

397
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,520
Addison has--she's gone crazy and...

398
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,150
I love it!

399
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,350
why the cold shoulder?

400
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,590
I'm not--I'm not giving youthe cold shoulder.

401
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,630
I'm just--I'm--I'm distracted.

402
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,990
I know what this is about.

403
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,360
You do?

404
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,550
It's charlotte.

405
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,350
I should have told youbefore I outed us.

406
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm sorry.

407
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,480
you can't walk out.It's your office.

408
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,860
he was nevergonna say anything.

409
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,320
He had these women thinking thathe's one thing,but he's not.

410
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,360
And the worse part is...

411
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,550
he only felt badbecause he'd been exposed,not because of what he'd done.

412
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,560
you don't look surprised.

413
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,300
Well,people lie.It's human nature.

414
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,250
And you're okay with that?

415
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,190
Do you know how many guyon the forcehave something on the side?

416
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,890
I should know.I'm their alibihalf the time.

417
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,920
And you cover for them whilethey're out having affairs?

418
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,650
-These guysare like my brothers.
-What about their wivesback home,

419
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,430
-just too bad for them?
-I'm not encouraging it,addison.

420
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,800
I'm just saying it happe.

421
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,080
Yeah,well,maybe it shouldn't happen.

422
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,070
You want to talk aboutlast night?

423
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,100
What about last night?

424
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,670
I gotta go.It's a work thing.

425
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,770
We'll talk later,okay?

426
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,690
uh,I just talked to henry,and he's agreed to dothe spinal tap.

427
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,820
Oh,all right.

428
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,300
Well,at leastyou got what you wanted.

429
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,540
Look,sam,I know you don'tagree with me on this one--

430
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,010
you're right.I don'T.All right?

431
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,330
You're putting francesat risk.

432
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,400
For henry,f frances.

433
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
I hope it is for them...

434
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,010
and not for you.

435
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,600
-hey,addison.
-I think I may have justgone too far.

436
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,680
With what?

437
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,770
I followed kevin.

438
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,080
What do--what do you mean,you followed him?

439
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,910
At first it was justa routine surveillance.

440
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,790
You are not a cop.

441
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,570
I followed him to work,to the precinct,which is apparentlywhere I should've stopped.

442
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,720
Oh,god.Where--whereare you now,crazy woman?

443
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,100
I'm not insane.I went to the precinct.

444
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,630
Five minutes later,he comes roaring outof the parking garagein another car,a van.

445
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,670
Did it--did it not occur to youthat he might be working?

446
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,610
Of course he could be working.

447
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,150
Only maybe he's not working.

448
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,390
People lie,I.

449
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,750
They lie and they cheatand they ruin people's lives,

450
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,090
and I am not gonna be one ofthose women who gets duped.

451
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,680
Addison--addison,you needto be careful.

452
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,570
or maybe he's working.

453
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,190
-Addison?
-I gotta go.

454
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,250
get out of the car!

455
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,470
I'm sorry.

456
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,350
I-is there--keep your handswhere I can see themand step outof the vehicle now!

457
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,690
No,no,no,no.I'm not partof any of this,though.

458
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,740
Step out of the vehicle now.

459
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,630
Open the doorfrom the outside.

460
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,550
Turn around.

461
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,550
What?

462
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,290
Wh--oh!

463
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,310
Oh,not handcuffs.You can't be serious.

464
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,300
Who were youon the phone with?

465
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,390
Oh,no.I was talkingto my friend.

466
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,790
Were you calling someoneinside that building?

467
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,130
No,no,no,no.I'm a doctor.

468
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,100
I'm--I'm a surgeon.

469
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,890
-I can show--
-whoever you are,you're obstructing justice.

470
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,400
-No,I can show you--
-addison?

471
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,360
Hey,kev.

472
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,050
you were spying on me?

473
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,250
Not spying.

474
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,920
Okay,yes,spying.

475
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,080
You want to tell mewhat's going on?

476
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,900
I just...

477
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,220
I spent all day dealing witha seemingly normal guy

478
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,790
who's the liarof all liars,so...

479
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,390
I checked your blackberrybefore you left.

480
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,320
You did what?

481
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,350
Yes,and I sawthe missed calls from leslie,and I wanted to seewho she was.

482
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,860
Well,you already have.

483
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,240
Officer leslie davis.

484
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,920
And I wouldn't call him "she"to his face.

485
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,340
Oh.

486
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,190
Why are you lookingfor reasons not to trust me?

487
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,840
Fine.

488
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,610
-kev--
-get out.

489
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,820
Kevin...

490
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,790
just...just go.

491
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,310
cooper the internet dateris in a healthy relationship,

492
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,370
and my too-good-to-be-trueboyfriendthinks I'm a psychoticbunny boiler.

493
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,220
He'll come around.

494
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,560
I screwed up.

495
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,770
I mean,he said what he saidand I...

496
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,040
lost my mind.

497
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,910
Addison,amy and lauraare here.

498
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,640
-Why?
-I called them.

499
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,800
Why'd you bring us here?

500
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,670
I thought you should talk.

501
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,130
I don't want to talkabout this.

502
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,050
I was up all night.I felt sick to my stomach.

503
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,020
I feel likethis is my fault somehow.

504
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,100
I-I should've known.

505
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,180
Neither of youdid anything wrong.

506
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,450
You trusted the person you love.

507
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,860
Th's the normal thing to do.

508
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,340
Pete's right.

509
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,070
Daniel is the only person herewho's done anything wrong.

510
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,020
Bastard.

511
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,600
Look,you've both been burned,but maybe there's a waythat you can help each other.

512
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,670
I don't want help from her.

513
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,030
-Pete,we shouldn't--
-we should.

514
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,730
You share a common bond.

515
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,740
Your childrenare going to be siblings.

516
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,100
Each of you understandswhat the other one is feelingbetter than anyone else.

517
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,130
I feel lost.

518
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,470
Daniel was...

519
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,450
my one constant,the only thing I couldalways depend on.

520
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,690
We should've made this decisionabout our baby together.

521
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,950
I don't knowif I can do this by myself.

522
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,250
No,no.

523
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,760
I-I don't know her,and I don't want to know her.

524
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,400
Look,amy,you're bothhurting right now,

525
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,880
but maybe there's a chanceyou can help each otherwork through this.

526
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Damn it!

527
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,280
I think...

528
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,680
I-I thinkmy water broke.

529
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,140
How much longer?

530
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,260
just another minute.

531
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,450
I promise.

532
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,880
Thank you,helen.

533
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,260
How do you feel,frances?

534
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,710
What?

535
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,860
Are you...

536
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,360
where's the music?

537
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,420
I thought there wassupposed to be music.

538
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,970
She's gonna be fine.

539
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,110
The worst isver.

540
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,920
No,look at her.I nevershould've put her through this.

541
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,890
This may work,henry,and it could give you...

542
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,870
at least something.

543
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,910
If only I can talk with her,even for a minute,

544
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:29,060
look into her eyesand know that she sees me,really sees me.

545
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,270
Okay,amy...

546
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,170
you're about8 centimeters dilated.How are you feeling?

547
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,950
Daniel was supposedto be here.

548
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,830
If you want me to,I'll call him.

549
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,700
I don't want to see him.

550
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,780
but I don't wantto be alone.

551
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,230
you haven't told cooperthe truth yet.

552
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,620
You're not very good atletting things go,are you?

553
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,170
You know what I think?

554
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,960
I think you're scared.

555
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,950
Of what?

556
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,840
I think this relationshipis getting real,

557
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,860
so you're just as scaredas cooper is.

558
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,260
So you're tryingto sabotage it.

559
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,950
Take a new job,rent the floor under him,keep it from him--

560
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:18,290
you want thisto blow up in your face.

561
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,410
You know what I think?

562
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,460
I think you're nothalf the shrinkyou think you are.

563
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,320
Where are you going?

564
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,360
To tell cooper the truth.

565
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,390
Why isn't she responding?

566
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,270
We knew we could only try,henry.

567
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,620
Frances...

568
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:49,540
remember theay last november,we were at home?

569
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,540
It was raining and cold.

570
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,280
You were reading in your chair.

571
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,790
I saw you shivering,and I asked you if you wanted meto turn the heat up.

572
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,420
And you smiled,and you said yes.

573
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,450
So I went downstairsand turned the thermostat up.

574
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,560
And when I came back up,I told you I-I hadone it.

575
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,170
But you didn't know me.

576
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,050
That was the last timewe spoke.

577
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:17,040
Please don't let that beour last memory together.

578
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,960
We need a new memory.

579
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,250
This is too hard for him.

580
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,650
Frances,it's me...

581
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,040
helen.

582
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,050
Your husband is hereand he needs your help.

583
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,370
You--you need to do thisfor him.

584
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,890
I'm sorry,henry.

585
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:41,070
I'm so sorry there wasn't morethat we could do for her.

586
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,840
I understand.

587
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,850
Henry.

588
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,060
Henry...

589
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,670
-where am I?
-You're here now.

590
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,640
That's what's important.

591
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,150
You look so beautiful.

592
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,190
You look so tired.

593
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,410
I've missed you.

594
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,590
I've missed you every day.

595
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,200
Frances,henry promised youthat he would never put youin a nursing home.

596
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,760
I'm sick,aren't I?

597
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,780
Yeah.

598
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,770
You'll visit me every day.

599
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,620
You'll come see me every dayand hold my hand.

600
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,000
You promise me that?

601
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,530
-But,franny--
-you promise me that,henry.

602
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,290
And then...

603
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,140
you let me go.

604
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,790
Promise me,my love.

605
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,300
I promise.

606
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,850
Okay,amy,on three,I'm gonnaneed you to push,all right?

607
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,770
Ready?One,two,three.

608
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,720
Push.

609
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,880
good.That's good.Good.

610
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,320
Now take a breath.

611
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,990
I hate him!

612
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,200
Concentrateon your baby.

613
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,470
I'm trying.

614
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,600
-Breathe.
-It's--it's so hard.

615
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,980
Laura?

616
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,590
No.

617
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,010
No.

618
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,000
Take my hand.

619
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,270
-No.
-Just take my hand.

620
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,260
We'll do this together,okay?

621
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,450
You can trust me.

622
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,120
Okay,when I say push again,you're gonna push,amy,all right?

623
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,510
-And ready?
-You can do this.

624
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,480
no.

625
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,920
Push.

626
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,460
we need to talk.

627
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,810
Thank god.

628
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,260
What--what do you mean,thank god?

629
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,730
I mean something's beenbothering you.

630
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,040
You haven't been yourself.

631
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,510
Okay,I feel like you thinkthat because I'm with charlotteand things are going well

632
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,390
that I'm not gonnabe there for you,

633
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,180
but I--I'm here for you,violet.

634
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,270
And the fact that charlotteand I are greatdoesn't change that.

635
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,990
Okay?

636
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,550
Let's talk.

637
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,730
Oh,okay.

638
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,660
I've...

639
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,650
just...

640
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,550
you know what?You just said it.

641
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:07,360
I-I think I was worriedabout you and charlotteand what that meant,but...

642
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,770
I just wantto see you happy,coop.

643
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,130
it'sa wonderful facility,henry.

644
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,980
She'll have her own roomwith 24-hour care.

645
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,230
For the first timein almost 50 years,we won't be living together.

646
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,020
You gonna be okay?

647
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,000
I have to be.

648
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,920
I promised her.

649
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,020
what's wrong?

650
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,500
That man loves that womanmore than anythingin the world.

651
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:50,350
He stayed with her,for better,for worse,and,uh,nowthey're gonna be apart.

652
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,930
Sam...

653
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,870
just becausethey're not gonna beliving together anymore,just because...

654
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:00,020
they won'tbe sleeping in the same bedor havingthe same conversations,

655
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,950
it doesn't meanhe's gonna stop loving her.

656
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,260
That man is going tolove her always.

657
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,750
He's gonna love heruntil the day he dies,but...

658
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,920
he needs to move on.

659
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,150
I need to knoweverything there is to knowabout digeorge syndrome

660
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,910
because I'm gonna keep my baby,and I need to be prepared.

661
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,640
I can't stay with somebodyI can't trust.

662
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,250
We are gonna be there for you,for whatever you need.

663
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,520
Amy,laura,hear me out.

664
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,460
Stay away from me.

665
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,170
You need to leave.

666
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,930
Hey,I'm talking to them,not you.

667
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,130
No,not anymore.

668
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,180
Please.I need to see them.

669
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,670
They don't want to see you.

670
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,420
-Don't make this worse by--
-I love them.

671
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,730
I want to help.

672
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,880
Amy just gave rth.

673
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,680
Laura is dealing witha pregnancythat's takena very difficult turn.

674
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,530
And they both just found outthe man they love is a liar.

675
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,630
Don't make this worse.

676
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,410
If you really love them,if you want to help...

677
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,870
leave.

678
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,890
You want me to walk away,to walk away from them?

679
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,110
Right now,yes.

680
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,840
And they maynever want to see you again.

681
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,270
That's something you're gonnahave to live with.

682
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,940
But you married them,you made commitments,and you have children.

683
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,770
What I'm saying is thatyou are gonna spendthe rest of your life

684
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:28,730
making sure that amy and laura and these childrenare taken care of.

685
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,210
He still hasn't called?

686
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,630
No.

687
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,020
I'm sure it's notas bad as it seems.

688
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,380
Oh,no,it is.

689
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,490
I will never hear that sexy,S.W.A.T.-Y voice again.

690
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:46,120
this here is my desk,and this is my chair.

691
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,730
-pretty cool,right?
-I like it.

692
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,850
Can I spin?

693
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,730
Yeah,you can spin.

694
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,070

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,230

696
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,560

697
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,020
Hi.

698
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,820

699
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,100

701
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,300
I'll put you here.

702
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,190
Well,I wanted to,um...

703
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,440
but...

704
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,390
it'sa little compliced.

705
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,010
I was 17...

706
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,760
and her mom and iweren't together very long.

707
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,670
And now?

708
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,380
well,uh,her mother's an addict,and last month,she relapsed.

709
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,240
I just...

710
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,230
I just wanted herto be proud of me,um,you know,

711
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,860
to seethat one of her parentshad it together.

712
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,510
That's whyI brought her here.

713
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,010
Addison,I promiseI'll have it all cleared outby tomorrow,okay?

714
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,630
Hey,betsey.

715
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,710
How do you likeyour daddy's office?

716
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,530
I love it.

717
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,500
Yeah?

718
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,220
I think I'm ready.

719
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,090
To leave?

720
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,670
To date.

721
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,170
Okay.Yeah.

722
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,890
so what happens now?

723
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,050
This is gonna be harderthan I thought.

724
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,120
So...

725
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,230
I told them...

726
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,670
you're my girlfriend,and if they didn't like that,

727
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,750
they were gonnahave to deal with me.

728
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,600
You did?

729
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,250
What about violet?

730
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,800
I think she was worriedabout us coming out,but...

731
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,700
I took care of it.

732
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,570
That's it?

733
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,060
She's happy for me...

734
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,940
for us.

735
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,110
I guess I misjudged her.

736
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,030
did you bring your squad car?

737
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,140
I need an explanation,addison.

738
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,380
I chted on my husband...

739
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,930
with his best friend.

740
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,110
And after that...

741
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,240
my ex-husbandcheated on me,too.

742
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,190
So when you said,uh,you said...

743
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:57,350
"I love you,"it took everythingto this whole other place,

744
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:03,680
this dark placewhere the stakes were high.

745
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:10,490
I couldn't trust you--not because of you--because of me.

746
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,390
And I think I was aredbecause I do like you.

747
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,430
I like you...

748
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:22,560
a lot,kevin,and I am...

749
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,070
not in a placewhere I can say what you said,but...

750
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,610
I think if you wereto stick around a little while,

751
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:40,720
I might be able to get there,because you arehonest and loyaland worthy of trust.

752
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,580
I messed up.

753
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,430
but I think...

754
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,900
I might get there.
