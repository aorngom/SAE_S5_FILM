1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,870
hello. do not hang up on me this time.

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,140
what,addison?

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,950
she still won't talk to me.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,950
hello.

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,470
hey,so listen,just
hear me out,all right?

6
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,950
so?

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,800
hates me,too.

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,670
bing u?m violet's meeting.

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,330
violet's super secret meeting
to overthrow the government.

10
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,720
you people are odd.

11
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,000
now that sam's running
things,he's pushing us to book more

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,430
and change things,and so
- and so i don't get properly laid.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,930
yes,you're the victim.
you're the silent victim.

14
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,470
you know,it's not like
you've given me permission

15
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,180
to tell violet why i can't come to her
meeting. do not tell violet about us.

16
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,960
i know. i have to go.
i'll make it up to you.

17
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,720
what are you doing for
lunch? we don't do public.

18
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,750
peppone. 1:00.

19
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,240
it's a symptom of the disease.

20
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,310
it's a board with dots on it.

21
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,860
this practice used to be
about people working together.

22
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,340
this board is about people
looking out for themselves.

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,050
it's profit-centric.
it's not patient-centric.

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,100
it's about unilateral decision making

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,810
and assembly-line medicine,

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,770
like-like sam's "executive physicals"

27
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,840
and the cheetah girl temp.

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,000
she's another symptom,hormone man.

29
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,500
she's a cute symptom. naomi?

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,120
i am not in charge anymore.
let sam try it sam's way.

31
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,610
sam and addison pulled off a coup.

32
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,510
dell's gone. we-we
have to do something.

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,780
looks like we missed the secret meeting.

34
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,300
we weren't invited. we
did the right thing,right?

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,580
yes,we did the right thing.

36
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,820
we did the only thing we could do.

37
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,160
this is just a small
storm. it will blow over.

38
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,950
oh,storm's coming. oh.

39
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,130
can i have my messages?

40
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,120
yes. morning,sam,addison.

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,390
oh,i... thought you
weren't talking to us.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,290
while i am not talking to you socially,

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,330
i am talking to you professionally

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,170
because this is a place of business.

45
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,550
so morning,sam,addison.

46
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,690
hey,you guys.

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,570
morning.

48
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,510
nice board,sam. oh,thanks.
yeah,dell's gone,

49
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,270
so i'm just trying to keep
track of,uh,scheduling.

50
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,390
oh,i-i... i thought it was
something different. what?

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,790
i thought that you wanted
to publicly humiliate

52
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,930
everyone who wasn't booking enough

53
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,030
so you put your big,showy board of shame

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,930
in this fish bowl for everyone to see.

55
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,910
no,it's-that's not...
it's not a board of...

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,630
a board of shame.

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,840
it's a... board of accomplishment. yeah.

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,960
well,you would say that.
it's a board with dots on it.

59
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,880
what do you mean,i would say
that? well,you're on sam's side.

60
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,860
no,no,violet. i'm on the
practice's side. wait,hey,hey.

61
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,700
now this board is a
- it's a useful tool.

62
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,050
all right? now just give it a chance.

63
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,060
the dots,they tell me who's busy.

64
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,770
now if we look over
here,pete is all empty here.

65
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,740
i can tell that he's
available to help me

66
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,280
with the executive physicals.

67
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,010
that's a big group deal
we cut. cash influx.

68
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,890
i'm sorry,but i don't have time.

69
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,930
the-the board would indicate otherwise.

70
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,260
oh,pete-well,you can't
just make up patients,pete.

71
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,080
i'm not. i made a few calls,and
i'm trying something new

72
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,310
to drum up business.

73
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,240
what the hell is that?

74
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,400
it's a cutting-edge,noninvasive cellulite
reduction system. it's a defatalator?

75
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,590
good thinking. your column's
weak,coop. i'm on it.

76
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,750
do you see what this
board of shame is doing?

77
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,430
cooper can't even look at it.

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,610
you've forced pete to
de-fat innocent people.

79
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,230
noninvasive cellulite re-

80
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,510
if this is where this
practice is headed-

81
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,730
we're headed toward bankruptcy.

82
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,500
i hope this is an acceptable detour.

83
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,340
i can't take it. i
honestly cannot take it.

84
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,870
don't you care?

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,990
well,you didn't even show up for the meeting. i was doing
- i was doing something.

86
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,960
what?

87
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,920
cooper,i just want to say that,um,

88
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,020
if there is something
that you want to tell me,

89
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,210
but you're afraid to tell
me,you could tell me anyway.

90
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,340
i won't get mad.

91
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,660
we're friends. i'm your friend.

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,730
so anything you would like to...

93
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,120
not keep secret,i'm open.

94
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,710
i'm sorry i wasn't... at the meeting.

95
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,280
i just-i need to stay under the radar.

96
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,570
i don't want to be the dead weight

97
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,360
that gets traded out for the plastic
surgeon. hey,coop,come on. that's an excuse.

98
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,060
tell me. do we have
to share every detail?

99
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,430
do we have to be joined at the hip?

100
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,370
we're not 12. oh,glad you
could clear that up for me.

101
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,260
i was so sure we were 12.

102
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,860
i know we're young,but we've
been married for five years,

103
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,470
and we've been dreaming about kids
for longer. yeah,since junior high.

104
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,110
junior high? that's where we met.

105
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,860
one day i was a complete loner,

106
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,340
and then the next day,i had lisa.

107
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,110
it's like looking into a mirror-

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,990
same interests,same
cds,same books,movies.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,140
we even have the same
allergies. mm-hmm.

110
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,700
grass and peanuts. and peanuts,yeah.

111
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,410
i found my best friend.

112
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,230
do you know how rare that
is,to find a best friend?

113
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,220
yeah.

114
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,160
we already decorated the nursery.

115
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,460
we just need the baby. please.

116
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,300
okay.

117
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,060
so you're really not
going to speak to me

118
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,760
about anything other than work?

119
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,720
for instance,the
cop,kevin,he hasn't called.

120
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,310
we had a date.

121
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,550
i thought it was a good
date,and then he didn't call,

122
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,330
which is something you and
i would normally talk about.

123
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,310
really? you really want to do this?

124
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,720
i'll take brian. you take lisa?

125
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,280
fine.

126
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,760
i gotta thank you.

127
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,310
my day is filled with
your company's employees.

128
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,070
oh,well... if anyone
else had tried to sell me

129
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,360
on executive physicals,

130
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,850
i would've thought it
was a crock sales pitch,

131
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,100
but i've watched you
with my son for so long...

132
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,680
well,kirk is amazing given
all that he's been through.

133
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,930
well,and it turns out your good
businessis my good business.

134
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,220
morale is up,

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,170
productivity this quarter
is through the roof,so...

136
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,280
well,i'm glad that your
employees are happy.

137
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,120
they love seeing you.

138
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,960
i wish kirk did,too. i
had to drag him here today.

139
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,720
does he need another
lecture on taking his meds?

140
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,330
17 years old,thinks he
knows better than everyone.

141
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,540
i hate this disease.

142
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,150
i didn't know it could damage
his lung tissue so badly.

143
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,010
yeah,bronchiolitis
obliterans can be brutal.

144
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,550
he still getting dizzy from the meds?

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,050
his breathing's getting
worse,and i stay on him.

146
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,030
if his mother was still alive,

147
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,460
she would know how to talk to him.

148
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,930
see,the more i push,the
more he pushes back-

149
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,700
kirk? help me get him on the table.

150
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,820
i need some help in here!

151
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,690
i need an intubation kit now.

152
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,510
he's not breathing. he's
in respiratory arrest.

153
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,750
i got brian and lisa's
genetic tests back.

154
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,460
you know why they can't get pregnant?

155
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,130
no,but i know why they shouldn't.

156
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,080
what am i looking for here?

157
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,110
there's no marker for
down syndrome,tay-sachs.

158
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,970
they look healthy.

159
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,270
individually they are,but...

160
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,480
as a couple...

161
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,720
almost a quarter of
their genes are the same.

162
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,160
they're not just husband and wife.

163
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,480
they're brother and sister.

164
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,260
is that how the defatalator works?

165
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,860
you lose weight by pushing
it up and down the hallway?

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,380
i need dell or an extra set of hands.

167
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,550
is this a unitard?

168
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,750
it gets 'em in the door.

169
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,840
it says they wanna... start living
a healthier lifestyle. by melting fat?

170
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,800
it doesn't melt fat,violet,but
it does break it down.

171
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,010
and with exercise and diet,herbs
- oh,it's a quick fix,pete.

172
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,330
this is not us.

173
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,380
patients come to see us because
we take care of all of them-

174
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,710
body,mind,soul.

175
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,300
sam is paving the road to
hell. it's just a machine.

176
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,470
it's hamburger. we
used to give them steak.

177
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,740
people like hamburger.

178
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,450
the scarring from the
virus has gotten much worse,

179
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,210
and his lung function
tests show a large decline.

180
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,570
but you can get him through
this,right,get him back home?

181
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,950
well,being on a ventilator
will help heal his lungs.

182
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,150
hopefully we can get him home,

183
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,670
but he's gonna need
a lot more attention-

184
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,010
oxygen supplementation,i.v. meds.

185
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,660
well,i'll scale back
at work. i don't care.

186
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,460
the idea of losing him,too... hey.

187
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,580
hey,hey!

188
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,370
hey,whoa! kirk.

189
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,660
i don't want this.

190
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,590
i told you already,i can't do it again.

191
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,860
don't say that.

192
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,770
just... put this back in,now.

193
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,120
no,it hurts. this is
the fourth time,dad.

194
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,510
i can't do it.

195
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,380
i can't talk. i can't do anything.

196
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,520
kirk,the intubation is only
temporary. i'm getting worse.

197
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,030
dad,the tracheotomy is
next. i can't do that.

198
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,090
i will throw everything i have
at this. we will find something.

199
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,190
this gives us time. do it.

200
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,890
don't! all right.

201
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,610
fine,kirk,all right?
no tube,not right now.

202
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,100
just... just breathe.

203
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,040
there we go.

204
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,530
i don't want this life.

205
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,080
not this way.

206
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,260
let me die.

210
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,370
thanks,dr. nayar.

211
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,030
sperm donor.

212
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,430
the parents used the same sperm donor.

213
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,740
what are the chances? well,25 years ago,

214
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,070
there were only a couple of
fertility clinics in this town.

215
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,690
so everybody who was having
trouble getting pregnant

216
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,570
went to the same doctor?
and the doctors used

217
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,710
the same batch of donors over and over
again. yeah,it makes you think twice

218
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,700
about messing with mother nature,huh?

219
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,290
i don't mess with mother
nature. i use science-

220
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,860
no,i wasn't say-i...

221
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,690
i was just saying that
- right.

222
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,150
so how do we tell them?

223
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,130
how do we tell a couple
that's meant to be together

224
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,340
that... they're not?

225
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,260
well,everything they
know is gonna be tainted-

226
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,210
their childhood,their families.

227
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,250
we have to let them know that it's
not their fault. well,it isn't.

228
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,440
i mean,they didn't know that
they were brother and sister.

229
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,750
and no one else needs to know.

230
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,060
who they tell,what the
say,that's their choice.

231
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,760
so not only do they have to split up,

232
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,420
they have to lie to everyone they know.

233
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,320
well,incest is a loaded word.

234
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,960
the visceral response
is revulsion,ostracism.

235
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,180
they look like... any
other young couple in love.

236
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,650
and we get to be the ones
to break their hearts.

237
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,700
you coach two little league teams.

238
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,640
you're telling me you
don't know one sick kid?

239
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,940
not even a cold?

240
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,730
oh,okay. gotta go. bye.

241
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,470
oh,that's your plan to get
new business,cold-calling?

242
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,470
no.

243
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,670
it worked for pete. wanna get some
lunch,take a break from the madness?

244
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,210
i can't. i'm already booked. with?

245
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,240
a friend.

246
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,820
i know you're lying to me.
you know you're lying to me.

247
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,150
we both know,and yet lying.

248
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,230
what is wrong with you?

249
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,840
it's crazy,but i feel lighter already.

250
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,640
well,that's only step one.

251
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,220
to really see results,you have to stick

252
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,380
to the exercise and diet
we discussed,and the herbs.

253
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,370
maybe i'll just come back every day.

254
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,820
that seems easier.

255
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,010
did you get kirk stabilized?

256
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,990
uh,temporarily.

257
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,600
when he came to,he extubated himself.

258
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,180
ohh. i know. he's letting himself die.

259
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,150
he is dying. maybe it's time
to start thinking about hospice

260
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,200
instead of hospital. no.
charlie won't do that.

261
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,290
come on,sam. how old is kirk?

262
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,110
he won't be 18 until next month.
who's not 18,that new receptionist?

263
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,020
no,my patient. and because the
poor kid crashes a few weeks shy

264
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,840
of his 18th birthday,

265
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,510
you're gonna force him to
indulge his father's grief

266
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,010
and lie in bed with an intubation tube

267
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,520
jammed down his throat? until what,

268
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,750
the ulcers and the hemorrhaging
get so bad,he needs a trach?

269
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,290
no 17-year-old kid should be
making life and death decisions.

270
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,390
he's been fighting this
sine he was 12. he's done.

271
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,560
look,charlie's wife died two years ago.

272
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,200
now you want me to fault him
for wanting to buy his son

273
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,120
just... a little more time?

274
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,880
time for kirk to live...
or for charlie to hold on?

275
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,570
we're brother and sister?

276
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,830
my parents never even told
me my father wasn't my father.

277
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,200
well,i'm sure they didn't think

278
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,980
it was anything that
would ever be relevant.

279
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,110
and for all intents
and purposes,it wasn't.

280
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,470
this is a nightmare.

281
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,190
look,this is a lot to absorb.

282
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,990
why don't we... give you a few minutes?

283
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,040
did you see the look on her face?

284
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,350
you were very good with them,though.

285
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,750
see,normally this would be the part

286
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,260
where i'd be asking
you about kevin again,

287
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,590
if you think i should call him
even though he hasn't called me.

288
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,540
normally that's what
we'd be doing right now

289
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,020
<i>if you were talking to me,nal. don't.</i>

290
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,450
nal
- look,i'm being an adult about this,addison.

291
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,380
it does not mean that i forgive you.

292
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,360
thank you for telling us.

293
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,800
if there's anything that we can do...

294
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,460
you can help us get pregnant.

295
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,940
but we just told you that-

296
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,870
we heard what you
said,but we're soul mates.

297
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,200
we love each other.

298
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,100
we're staying together.

299
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,240
cousins get married all the time.

300
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,980
they have kids. why can't we?

301
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,870
because your children would have
a 300 times greater chance of

302
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,880
developing a genetic
disorder,which could be fatal.

303
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,200
what about sperm donation?

304
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,790
for a couple who,by
law,shouldn't be married? i can't.

305
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,790
then we'll adopt. the first thing
an adoption agency will look at

306
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,980
is your medical history.

307
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,120
they'll see your relationship
and they won't-i-i'm sorry.

308
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,920
so no kids.

309
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,780
hey.

310
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,960
we just forget about kids.

311
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,990
as long as we can be together-

312
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,360
without sex?

313
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,500
because no birth control is 100%.

314
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,130
then tie my tubes.

315
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,750
lisa,you're 23 years old. i...

316
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,830
just tie them

317
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,340
so i never have to
think about this again.

318
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,700
you were supposed to remind me

319
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,050
about the,uh,the health fair.

320
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,600
oh! sorry. wait.

321
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,270
the company that rents your
ultrasound machines did call.

322
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,760
and they're gonna send a truck
to pick them up around 1:00.

323
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,290
pick them up? did they mention why?
you haven't paid in three months.

324
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,260
what? are you okay?

325
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,490
hey. can you cover at
the health fair please?

326
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,520
uh,no. uh,i'm working through lunch.

327
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,500
check the board.

328
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,770
ha ha. cooper,my man. health fair-

329
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,800
great way to get new patients.
i,uh,i have lunch plans.

330
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,890
lunch plans are more important
than the practice? really?

331
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,170
what web site did you find her
on? yeah,cooper,which web site?

332
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,920
i have a limit to how far you
can push,violet. all right,cooper,

333
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,010
grab a stethoscope,go
get some damn balloons

334
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,370
and go charm some mothers
who don't know any better.

335
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,638
cann't make it. sorry

336
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,580
i'm,uh,hiding medical equipment.

337
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,000
i've been reduced to...

338
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,870
hiding medical equipment.

339
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,340
well,i have been asked to tie the tubes

340
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,570
of a perfectly healthy young woman

341
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,410
so that she can sleep with her brother.

342
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,460
incest trumps equipment hiding.

343
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,720
oh... incest? that's-that's nasty.

344
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,140
so what does naomi say?

345
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,170
that is a very good question,sam.

346
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,440
what does naomi say?

347
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,990
as little as possible

348
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:13,280
because she is professional
and courteous,and she hates me.

349
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,140
and i can't even talk to her
about the fact that she hates me

350
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,670
or about the practice
or kevin- or-or kevin?

351
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,060
my cop. no,s.w.a.t.,actually.

352
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,810
um,we had a date. it
was a good date,you know?

353
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:27,370
and he hasn't called
and... you're a man.

354
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,570
why do you guys do that?

355
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,910
uh,well,did you
- did you try calling him?

356
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,860
no. why should i? he knows
i want to talk to him.

357
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,130
well,he would if you
- you called him. mm.

358
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,490
you suck at being naomi.

359
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,120
yeah,got that right.

360
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,570
what kind of a defect
do you have? i'm sorry.

361
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,620
i get one hour for lunch.
i was halfway across town.

362
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,350
i ordered wine,i found a quiet
corner booth,which was good,

363
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,350
because otherwise,i might have missed
your text. i should have called.

364
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,240
no. you never should
have invited me to a lunch

365
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,500
you didn't plan on attending.

366
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,150
i'm not looking for
a relationship or love

367
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,630
or any of that garbage,

368
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,620
but i won't be treated
like i don't matter.

369
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,190
ugh. please tell me you didn't
just piss off charlotte king.

370
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,430
oceanside wellness group. of course not.

371
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,310
what was she doing here?

372
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,800
i don't know,but i told her i
couldn't talk 'cause we're busy.

373
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,200
sam,you have a call. just
take a message,please.

374
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,300
oh,yeah. um,can i take a message?

375
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,520
which collection
agency was it this time?

376
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,590
it was the hospital. the hospital?

377
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,510
well,why didn't you
- i'm standing... what was it?

378
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,870
some guy-charlie jensen? he
wanted you to meet him there.

379
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,580
you gotta put the tube back in.

380
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,320
kirk's right. he's
not getting any better.

381
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,420
kirk's tired of being sick.
you think i don't get that?

382
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,040
but he doesn't see this
from every angle like i do.

383
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,840
i know how to approach a problem.

384
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,810
i don't care how much money

385
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,350
or time we have to put into this.

386
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,430
we're gonna fight this.
he's a teenager,sam.

387
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,810
he's a teenager whose
life isn't over yet.

388
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,320
he's a month away from being 18.

389
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,930
you're not the only doctor in town,sam.

390
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,360
i could take my son and my business.

391
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,440
you chased me hard for those executive
physicals. are you threatening me?

392
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,060
you have a lot of expenses,sam.
you really wanna let

393
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,500
a huge chunk of business
walk out the door?

394
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,240
if there was someone you loved,

395
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,410
wouldn't you do everything to save them? his
sats are dropping. they're dangerously low.

396
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,970
you gotta put the tube back in. he's
just gonna pull it back out again.

397
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,150
then restrain him.

398
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,420
all right,

399
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,500
give him 20 milligrams of
etomidate and 100 of sux.

400
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,820
kirk,we're gonna give you a
little something to relax you,

401
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,420
and then we're gonna have to intubate
you again. i don't-i don't want-

402
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,880
all right,relax. no,i don't want it. no.

403
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,650
hey,easy. give me those restraints.

404
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,550
i'm sorry,but i have to do this. do you?

405
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,010
all right,i'm gonna
need an 8-0,an e.t. tube

406
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,740
and a mac blade,please.

407
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,060
dr. montgomery.

408
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,170
i wanted to talk to
you alone,without brian.

409
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,350
lisa... if you get your tubes tied...

410
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,550
you wanted a child.

411
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,990
no,don't. please just hear me out.

412
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,140
i know what you say we are,

413
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,060
and i know that...

414
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,430
this is disgusting
to you- it's not-

415
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,770
he's all i have.

416
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,070
brian
- he's all i've ever had.

417
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,400
i was shy... before him.

418
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,220
i was shy and... brian sees me.

419
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,820
he sees me and he knows
me and he loves me.

420
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,330
my whole life,i felt like

421
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,070
there was this missing piece of me,

422
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,440
like i didn't fit,

423
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,820
and brian...

424
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,910
he's my missing piece,

425
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,540
so before you say no to the surgery,

426
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,500
consider...

427
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,410
just consider what you're asking of me.

428
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,630
you're asking me to
make myself less whole,

429
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,630
to lose a part of me.

430
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,550
he's... my missing piece.

431
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,310
my best friend is my missing piece.

432
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,260
hey,sam. you make a decision about kirk?

433
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,700
yeah,i reintubated him.

434
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,730
against his wishes.
against his expressed wi-

435
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,420
i did what his father-
his legal guardian-wanted.

436
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,370
now kirk's underage. i had no choice.

437
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,940
yes,you did. you chose to
ignore your patient's wishes

438
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,840
to keep his father happy because
keeping charlie jensen happy

439
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,600
is good for business.
pete,you're not being fair.

440
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,320
how much are we taking
in on these physicals,sam?

441
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,440
enough to put his kid through
hell? i made my decision.

442
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,620
you made the wrong one.

443
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,890
hey... i'm in charge here.
okay? me. i am in charge.

444
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,270
so why don't you go back

445
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,210
to sucking the fat out of
people and making us money,

446
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,600
and let me do what i need to do to save this
place? it's a cellulite reduction system.

447
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,810
pete,pete
- no,don't.

448
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,950
what's the most important question,sam,

449
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,140
what's best for the practice

450
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,640
or what's best for the patient?

451
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,260
i wish i had what they have. you-you
want to sleep with your brother?

452
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,430
no,that kind of devotion.

453
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,520
they're a team,best
friends,joined at the hip.

454
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,400
they deserve to be happy.
they are a brother and sister

455
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,860
who want to have sex with
each other. oh,come on.

456
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,340
it's not like they were
raised as brother and sister.

457
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,030
you're actually considering this?

458
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,270
the client wants what they want.

459
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,140
and so you're gonna sterilize them

460
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,140
so they can stay incestuous?
well,stepchildren who grow up together

461
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,980
end up marrying.

462
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,060
i
- i think that's worse. they're raised as brother and sister.

463
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,240
yeah,well,you're a shrink,

464
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,710
and you believe that nurture
is more important than nature,

465
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,600
<i>but,but biology says this is wrong.</i>

466
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,950
is it really ours to decide?

467
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,950
i mean,these people are
everything to each other.

468
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,790
i've never seen a couple so
close. because they found love,

469
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,600
or because they're genetically similar?

470
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,070
um,i just heard. how did
hansel and gretel take the news?

471
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,830
gretel wants her tubes tied.

472
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,080
you guys are actually considering
this? uh,"they" guys,not "me" guy.

473
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,600
you want to sponsor
inbreeding? that is gross,

474
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,080
and,you know,i know gross.

475
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,710
it's not inbreeding if we do a
tubal ligation. interesting point,

476
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,530
but as the american medical
association guideline

477
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,500
points out...

478
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,300
stop it! they probably
tell each other everything.

479
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,980
they don't lie to each other.

480
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,080
sounds nice.

481
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
oh,do i get a dot for
the consult? get out.

482
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,320
listen,

483
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,030
you-you cannot consider this.

484
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,020
kids are the one thing
that they both wanted.

485
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,850
that and each other.

486
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,350
<i>conference room,12:00. ay,mis ojos.</i>

487
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,250
i don't think this is
how hansel and gretel

488
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,650
is supposed to end.

489
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,260
no,no,no! wrong way.

490
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,330
whoa! oh,oh. watch out for the doctor.

491
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,090
oh,uh,right. uh,scrub hard.

492
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,980
i'll talk to you soon.

493
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,840
lice. no,doesn't count.

494
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,520
cooper,you had those kids
since they were babies.

495
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,790
we need new business.

496
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,970
don't say it.

497
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,580
say what? that,uh,what,i've
been chasing cases,

498
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,490
that i'm running this
place like a factory,

499
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,910
'cause,all right,i've
been doing the best i can.

500
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,800
and somebody had to do something.
i was going to fix this.

501
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,080
i just needed time. i
needed a little faith.

502
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,460
what,whoa,whoa. what about
a little faith in us,huh,

503
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,680
and telling us the truth?

504
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,560
addison and i- you know,when-when
did this become about you and addison?

505
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,810
when you started keeping things from us.

506
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,190
you know,addison didn't
start this practice with you

507
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,310
from nothing.

508
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,360
she didn't work
saturdays to pay the bills

509
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,860
while you wrote your book.

510
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,300
she didn't have to play
traffic cop and den mother

511
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,700
<i>while all of you got to play idealistic
doctor. i'm just trying to save what we started.</i>

512
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,250
well,if we keep doing
things your way,sam,

513
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,140
is it worth saving?

514
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,040
come on,charlotte.

515
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,960
call me back or leave me a message

516
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,280
or send me an obnoxious
text. we'll,uh...

517
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,240
sorry,yeah.

518
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,800
uh,leave me a message.

519
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,860
actually,the treatment is
performed on the whole body,

520
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,740
adapted for the skin sensitivity

521
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,470
of each individual,so
- this place is bad enough

522
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,340
without you trying to sell
your magic beans to everyone.

523
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,840
i mean,does she really
look like she needs help?

524
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,190
does that body need...

525
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,410
anything?

526
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,820
i mean,does any body really
need its fat pulverized

527
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,930
into submission?

528
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,530
violet,violet,you know what you are?

529
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,550
you are a...
a-a-a judger.

530
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,840
you're a judgy judger
who has no right to judge

531
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,860
until she tries it for herself.

532
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,130
she-she can't be. well,she is.

533
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,490
violet. you really think it's her?

534
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,740
oh,it's her. you really think it works?

535
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,450
you okay? yeah. here,switch.

536
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,900
why would she stoop to
this? she hates that thing?

537
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,430
i don't know w-oh,and
right there,please.

538
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,430
and again.

539
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,310
is violet defatalating?

540
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,260
sorry? huh?

541
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,840
she better be paying.

542
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,870
maybe i was too judgmental.

543
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,770
see?

544
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,780
maybe i'm wrong about everything.

545
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,290
you're bringing in new clients,

546
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,930
sam has his physicals,

547
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,110
even cooper got some new business

548
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,990
at that stupid health fair.

549
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,610
and i...

550
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,220
i actually think i'm getting thinner.

551
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,880
violet.

552
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,810
you don't lose weight just...

553
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,220
by w-waving the wand.

554
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,410
everyone who comes through that door,

555
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,100
they don't want to talk
about a healthy life plan.

556
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,350
all they want is magic.

557
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,240
this isn't magic. this is a...

558
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,800
this is crap.

559
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,430
i
- hey.

560
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,740
hey,it doesn't matter.

561
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,380
you don't need to lose weight.

562
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,680
your... your ass looks fantastic.

563
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,510
i know my ass looks fantastic.

564
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,520
but thank you... for
saying it,not for thinking

565
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,830
that i don't have enough
self-esteem to love my own ass.

566
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,300
i love my ass.

567
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,890
it is round and firm

568
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,110
and,like,like,ten years
younger than the rest of me.

569
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,830
it's a fantastic ass.

570
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,800
men cannot keep their hands off my ass.

571
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,210
stop touching my ass!

572
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,230
damn it.

573
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,110
the practice is going to
hell,and cooper is lying to me,

574
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,150
and i am sitting here encouraging you

575
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,990
to rub fat off my ass.

576
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,510
life is not ass fat,and if it is,

577
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,020
it's not ass fat that can
magically disappear with a wand.

578
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,250
what are we gonna do?

579
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,310
they're here.

580
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,600
you know what you're gonna tell 'em?

581
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,860
if i tell them no,

582
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,440
they're just gonna go to someone else.

583
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,880
well,i guess you'll do
what you feel is best.

584
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,780
okay,what do you want me to
say to you,that i am sorry?

585
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,640
because i'm not. i was
trying to save the practice.

586
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,870
i was trying to help you. oh,wow.
well,thanks for helping me.

587
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,540
you know what? this is my practice,too.

588
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,450
i gave up a hell of a
lot to come down here.

589
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,950
and i came down here
for you,for you and sam.

590
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,150
you went behind my back and you hurt me,

591
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,150
and it can't be undone.

592
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,850
some things just can't be undone.

593
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,240
well,will you tie my tubes?

594
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,770
because if so,we thought
maybe you could do it today.

595
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,790
we can't-

596
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,580
we can't take another
day of this,another night.

597
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,790
we didn't sleep.

598
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,680
we just want everything back
the way it was. so will you?

599
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,300
will you?

600
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,740
you're brother and sister.

601
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,440
now how can you go back
to the way things were

602
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,430
when you know you're brother and sister?

603
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,550
knowing doesn't change anything.

604
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,870
it doesn't change how we
feel about one another.

605
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,950
it changes everything,and it
can't be undone. because we know?

606
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,280
you're wrong. it doesn't matter.

607
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,560
you think if we'd known
before we got married,

608
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,360
we wouldn't have? well,we would.

609
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,100
i
- i don't think so.

610
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,870
it didn't matter to me when i found out.

611
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,440
i still married her.

612
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,880
you still married me?

613
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,240
i- i mean-i'm just-
i'm just saying-

614
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,890
you knew that she was your sister?

615
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,150
you knew?

616
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,370
we're both allergic to grass,

617
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,420
we have the same toes,we
have the same blood type.

618
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,320
we're the same.

619
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,920
i knew there was
something,and i looked into it.

620
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,610
but i thought... i thought
that you were my soul mate.

621
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,540
i thought that...

622
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,160
y
- you knew and you never told me?

623
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,370
because it doesn't matter.
we found each other.

624
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,780
out of all the people in the
world,we found each other.

625
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,480
oh,don't touch me. nothing's changed.

626
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,580
don't,don't,don't!
nothing has to change!

627
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,010
don't touch me! get away from me!

628
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,890
you-this is disgusting.
you are my brother.

629
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,750
i had sex with you. you
took my virginity. lisa-

630
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,680
brian,it's over.

631
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,890
we're best friends.

632
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,430
it's over,brian.

633
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,890
i,um...

634
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,900
need you.

635
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,800
ow. deal with it,coop.

636
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,130
you know,there's no one else
i would let do this to me.

637
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,710
that supposed to make
me feel special? yes.

638
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,430
because the only thing
you need me for anymore

639
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,180
is picking lice outta your hair?

640
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,530
in monkeys,it's a sign of affection.

641
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,490
this sucks,cooper.

642
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,260
i used to like to come to work.

643
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,450
i used to like to talk to you,

644
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,970
tell you everything,vice versa.

645
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,480
and now it just...

646
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,110
it all sucks.

647
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,910
all you do is lie.

648
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,030
i'm sleeping with charlotte king.

649
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,970
and i didn't tell you because...

650
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,920
she said i couldn't,but also because-

651
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,480
more because-i was scared
of what you'd think.

652
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,030
i'm scared of what i
think because i like her.

653
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:48,690
i really like her.

654
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,030
i might almost kind of... love her.

655
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,930
and she's mean and she won't
let me tell you about her,

656
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,050
and she's bossy and rude
and all southern twangy.

657
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,360
and now i got lice,which i got

658
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,960
because i don't have any patients,

659
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,380
which sam never fails to point out.

660
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,750
and do you think charlotte
would pick lice out of my head?

661
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,770
charlotte would burn me alive
if i came near her with lice.

662
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,510
and i want to dump her so hard.

663
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,760
i want to dump her on
her ass and walk away,

664
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,090
but the idea of dumping her
gives me this pain in my stomach

665
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,260
that makes me feel like i want to vomit,

666
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,860
so i can't dump her because
of the maybe loving her.

667
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,060
and it is killing me not telling you.

668
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,120
so i'm telling you.

669
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,410
i'm sleeping with charlotte king.

670
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,400
thank you.

671
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,830
i set lisa up with an
appointment to see violet.

672
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,340
brian's staying at a hotel.

673
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,010
i still don't think he
understands what he did wrong.

674
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,900
yeah,well,in his mind,they
were best friends.

675
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,310
that was more important.

676
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,980
hey,officer,uh,s.w.a.t... kevin.

677
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,630
um... it's
- it's me,addison...

678
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,360
addison forbes montgomery...

679
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,780
the doctor.

680
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,440
uh,anyway,i,um...

681
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,980
i noticed that there were a
few missed calls on my cell,

682
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,710
and,um,i didn't know if-

683
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,910
if one of them might have been you.

684
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,110
i mean,sometimes i do that.

685
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,250
you know,i get the voice mail,

686
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,050
and then i debate whether or
not i should leave a message.

687
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,020
you know,sometimes it's just
better to call back later.

688
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,000
but,um,anyway,if you did call,

689
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,130
uh,i'm sorry that i didn't pick up.

690
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,900
but then maybe you didn't... call.

691
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,200
i think i just lost my best friend,

692
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,850
and,um...

693
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,660
i needed somebody to talk to,

694
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,460
and you just seem like such a good guy

695
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,200
and such a good person to talk to,

696
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,940
and i,uh... and i...

697
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,780
i now am realizing that
we've only gone out once,

698
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,220
and so why would you be
the person that i'm calling?

699
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,330
and so now i'm just this weird person

700
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,070
leaving a message on your voice mail.

701
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,320
and you don't... know me,

702
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,520
so this seems really like...

703
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,600
i should hang up now.

704
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,140
nice knowing you.

705
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,250
what,you need the conference room

706
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,750
for another one of your secret meetings?

707
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,710
hey,pete.

708
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,610
oh,no,no,no.

709
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,450
you were my one bright spot.

710
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,620
i'm just not a-
a-a defatalator.

711
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,870
i- i'll-i'll try
something new,

712
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,560
i'll even help you with
the executive physicals,

713
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,730
but the- c- cooper also has
something that he'd like to say.

714
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,950
look,i'm
- i'm a pediatrician,sam.

715
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,620
kids get sick,they come
to me,i take care of 'em.

716
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:48,180
i don't do health fairs.
i don't cold-call patients.

717
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,550
i don't... shill.

718
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,350
i'm just... i'm a doctor.

719
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,270
addison,naomi.

720
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,220
this is not how we act.

721
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,020
it's not who we are.

722
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,580
sam... we can do better. i know we can.

723
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,090
i know we need money,but
at the end of the day,

724
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,430
if we can't treat patients
the way they should be treated,

725
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,360
then what's the point?

726
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,880
i just need a little faith.

727
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,330
what do you want?

728
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,410
i did what you asked because
i had convinced myself

729
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,320
that it was the right
thing to do for kirk.

730
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,740
but the truth was,i was
protecting the wrong person.

731
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,430
this isn't about protecting
me. no,i meant me.

732
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,520
i was protecting
myself from your threat.

733
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,150
and that's not the kind of doctor i am.

734
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,470
that's not the kind of
doctor that i want to be.

735
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,030
you asked me if it was somebody i loved,

736
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,100
what i would do.

737
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,850
and... it would kill me,charlie,

738
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,510
but i wouldn't want to force someone

739
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,010
to live a way that
they couldn't live with,

740
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,390
because that would be
for me and not for them.

741
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,420
it's the only thing keeping him alive.

742
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,400
but that's not the life that he wants.

743
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,500
we haven't done
everything we can here,sam.

744
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,160
i understand

745
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,540
wanting to throw everything
at a problem,charlie.

746
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,600
in business,maybe you do
that,and-and maybe it works,

747
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,930
but... you end up
losing a bit of yourself

748
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,280
along the way.

749
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,320
and this isn't a business,charlie.

750
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,660
this is your son.

751
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,310
uh,no,go ahead.

752
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,280
you're gonna forgive me eventually,nal.

753
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,220
it's okay.

754
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,680
i'm here.

755
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,790
it's okay.

756
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,000
tonight's not a good night.

757
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,800
i told violet about us.

758
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,750
she was hounding me,and i told her.

759
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,250
i'm sorry.

760
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,950
i hate you.

761
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,180
yeah,i hate you,too,but you do matter.

762
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,560
i wouldn't have told
violet if you didn't matter.

763
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,740
get your clothes off.

764
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,640
i know.

765
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,680
i mean,wow.

766
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,840
i didn't know older
guys could be so good.

767
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,840
older guys?

768
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,250
you're,like,the oldest
guy i've ever had sex with.

769
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,530
a patient died today.

770
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,420
i'm sorry.

771
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,560
and i am not helping the practice.

772
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,930
you're doing a good job.

773
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,410
you're just saying that.

774
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,820
i'm just saying that,

775
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,700
but it's what naomi would've said.

776
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,240
i have faith in you,sam.
things will get better.

777
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,120
this is just a bump in the road.

778
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,860
before you know it,it'll be just like
- shh.

779
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,880
old times.

780
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,420
i'm furious.

781
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,800
i know.

782
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,160
i'm gonna be furious
for a very long time.

783
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,140
i know.

784
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,080
this is hate sex.

785
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,290
i know.

786
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,240
