1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,210
 Hey.

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,360
What?

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,050
You kissed me,and then you walked away.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,400
Messes with your head,huh?

5
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,620
So it was a revenge kiss.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:30,040
No,no,not intentionally,but then,uh,watching
you get all swirly since then?

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,410
It is kind of gratifying.

8
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,820
I think we should stop kissing.

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,960
I mean,come on.

10
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,370
What are we,12?

11
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,480
No,we definitely are not.

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,270
Which is why.

13
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:13,360
I. do not want to be just another
notch in your acupuncture table.

14
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,170
I want more.

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,870
What do you say we just see how it goes.

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,070
tonight?

17
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,780
I can work with at.

18
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,620
we.

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,270
-were just talking about a case.
-Uh,she needed a consult on the.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,740
locked in the,uh,dell vault,all right?

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,910
Your patients are here.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,110
we're in the dell vault.

23
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,060
Locked in the dell vault.

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,480
who keeps sticking bananas
in the refrigerator?

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,710
I,um,that. that would be me.

26
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,820
Bananas need the climate of the tropical equator.
You never stick bananas in the refrigerator.

27
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,270
Susan mccullough is on her way in.

28
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,380
Hey,how'd she sound?

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,700
I believe her exact words were,"you
guys better not screw this up.

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,300
" Blocking the toaster. Hello.

31
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,410
Wow,okay. That toast
needs to happen right now.

32
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,670
Somebody really needs to get.

33
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,720
-don't say it.
-I wasn't.

34
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,270
I wasn't going to say "laid.

35
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,780
" so we're inducing susan today,right?

36
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,330
Yes. It is very important to her
that we follow her labor plan.

37
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,430
That means pete's stress-reduction
techniques,the birthing tub.

38
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,240
Honestly,not a big fan of the tub.

39
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,360
There are fluids in there.

40
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,880
blood,uterine
tissue,sometimes fecal matter.

41
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,120
Okay,you made me think about it.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,940
Well,you know,I mean they're just big
and wet and difficult to work with.

43
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,160
I mean,the's a reason they don't
use those things in hospitals.

44
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,430
She's my patient,and we're
gonna do it the way she wants.

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,920
Well,I'm not really comfortable
being a,uh,birth coach.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,960
That's not what I do.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,620
Really? Because.

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,880
addison,susan was widowed
few months into her pregnancy.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,180
Her husband jason was a
cop. He was killed on duty.

50
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,650
Oh,that's.

51
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,600
she's had panic attacks,and that
would be a problem during a birth.

52
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,040
She doesn't have any other
family,so she's on her own here.

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,670
I promised her we'd take care of her.

54
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,860
Okay.

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,060
Okay,I'llave dell go ahead
and prepare the bathtub.

56
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,310
yeah.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,240
Hey,Dr. Bennett. It's sara hill.

58
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,120
Hey,sara. How you doing?

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,720
Is there any chance you
could do a house call now?

60
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,380
I kind of hurt my leg.

61
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,090
I'm afraid it might
get worse,a lot worse.

62
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,310
Okay,I guess I can run over
there and check you out.

63
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,760
The address is 5600
alverson. And can you hurry?

64
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,900
So you moved away from the marina,huh?

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,160
alverson. hello?

66
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,030
Okay,uh,I'm gonna need the lights dimmed,and
we can put the birthing ball right here.

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,100
Where's the music I
asked for? I need the cd.

68
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,960
Oh,I have it. Why don't you just relax?

69
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,440
We'll get everything taken care of.

70
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,900
Oh,I know. We've got a
plan,and we're following it.

71
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,830
But as we discussed,not
everything is under our control.

72
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,500
Babies often have plans of their own.

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,930
I'm prepared for that,too. I
wrote down all the contingencies.

74
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,860
Dr. Montgomery,it's baby day.

75
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,700
Hi,susan. Uh,as soon as pete does his
relaxation therapy,then I will be back to.

76
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,320
to administer the pitocin after
you remove the prostaglandin insert.

77
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,370
That's exactly right.

78
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,080
Okay. So let's do this.

79
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,550
Cooper!

80
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,260
Hey,malcolm,you got a game today?

81
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,260
I caught a fly in the toilet!

82
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,190
You did? No way.

83
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,740
Really? good work.

84
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,590
Patrick,can you keep them kind of.

85
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,060
doc,spider web,3:00.

86
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,920
-How you holdin' up?
-Hangin' in.

87
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,360
Uh,her due date is right around the
corner,and it's time to stop by for a checkup.

88
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,140
You're having a girl.

89
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,270
It's about time. I'm so excited.

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,090
Danny,give mal back his mit.

91
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,560
I'll show you back.

92
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,860
All right,team. Let's go. Come on.

93
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,680
Okay,the baby's heartbeat looks good.

94
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,510
Good.

95
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,070
This is my fourth baby,so i
should know the drill by now.

96
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,450
Come on,mom,hurry up.
I gotta go to the game.

97
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,070
Todd,todd,todd,honey,not in here.

98
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,150
Just a minute,and then we'll go.

99
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,610
Ya ashley,you may be here
longer than you think.

100
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,000
You're in labor.

101
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,450
You're having this baby now.

102
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,350
you leaving?

103
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,970
Yeah,sara hill wants me to
drop by her place,a leg injury.

104
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,910
Uh,what about your
patients on the books?

105
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,780
I moved some things
around. I like getting air.

106
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,930
I know going off schedule is
something that's hard for you to grasp.

107
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,950
I can grasp it just fine,thank you.

108
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,430
-Oh,really?
-Really.

109
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,520
Go. Enjoy.

110
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,590
-Where's he going?
-House call.

111
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,150
Whatever.

112
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,050
Hey,you need to do something about pete.

113
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,720
Does he know what he's
doing with addison?

114
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,310
What is he doing with addison?

115
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,320
Oh,no. Did they?

116
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,960
It's imminent.

117
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,710
So none of my business.

118
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,960
All right. It's none
of my business either.

119
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,360
Except pete already proved
he shouldn't date at work.

120
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,990
M-maybe addison decided
to enjoy herself.

121
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,890
Men do it all the time.

122
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,230
Right,that's. that's fine.

123
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,370
It's empowering for women,actually.

124
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,070
casu sex. It can be,as long
as the boundaries are clear.

125
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,450
And I'm very,very good
with boundaries,aren't I?

126
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,250
Not really,no.

127
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,760
But you're looking right through me,so I'm
guessing you're not hearing a word I'm saying. So.

128
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,480
5600 alverson.

129
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,770
This can't be right.

130
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,500
Sara.

131
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,550
ClOSED CERRADO

132
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,940
It's him.

133
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,010
Thanks for coming.

134
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,070
Yeah.

135
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,420
I'm so sorry.

136
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,520
Uh,are you okay? Your leg.

137
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,140
I-I didn't call you here for
me. I-I called you here for him.

138
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,440
sara,what's going on?

139
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,970
it's my leg.

140
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,580
What happened to you?

141
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,690
She shot me.

142
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,470
She. you shot him?

143
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,690
Not her,me.

144
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,030
I shot him.

145
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,740
Okay.

150
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,170
She said you were a
doctor. You gotta fix him.

151
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,920
Is,uh,is everybody else okay?

152
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,060
Everyone else is fine! Except for her.

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,570
She's crazy! She shot me.

154
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,150
It was an accident. I'm
sorry. I said I was sorry.

155
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,910
Okay,everybody,let's be calm.

156
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,820
-Sara?
-She wanted a doctor.

157
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,980
You're the only one I know that
makes house calls,so I called you.

158
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,780
After you called the police?

159
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,130
She didn't want the police.

160
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,650
Of course not,because she's crazy!

161
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,000
hi,I'm,uh,officer kevin nelson. I'm
here for susan mccullough's delivery.

162
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,760
Is she expecting you?

163
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,050
No,I'm just here,uh,to support susan.

164
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,610
She said she didn't want anybody,but I wanted to
come down in case,uh,uh,uh,she changed her mind.

165
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,660
-I'll let her know.
-Thank you.

166
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,110

uh,ms. Mccullough,there's an
officer kevin nelson hereor you.

174
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,030
Are you serious?

175
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,960
he was jason's parer.

176
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,600
Well,that's nice of him to
come check on you,isn't it?

177
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,410
It is,but.

178
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,000
he's gonna get emotional,turn
this into a memorial for jason.

179
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,130
I don't want that. Jason
wouldn't have wanted that.

180
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,470
This should be about the baby.

181
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,850
Can you just tell him I'm fine?

182
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,760
He can go back to work.

183
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,860
you okay?

184
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,260
yeah. I just.

185
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,120
feel a little anxious.

186
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,570
He shouldn't be here.

187
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,140
I didn't want to think about it.

188
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,810
God.

189
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,140
Remember the visualizations we
worked on? Focus on those images.

190
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,490
Okay?

191
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,890
We're following the plan.

192
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,890
Everything's right on schedule.

193
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,050
I'm fine.

194
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,140
I'm totally fine.

195
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,100
When you have sex.

196
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,360
I mean,when there's no romantic
entanglement,which is never.

197
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,810
yes,thank you.

198
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,830
I just wanted an apple,but now get to talk
about the fact that I'm an emotional dwarf?

199
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,500
No,that's not what I'm talking about.

200
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,770
Is it about that I said that you needed
to get laid,which i didn't say. verbally?

201
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,240
No,listen,listen,I've been.
I've been thinking about this.

202
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,310
When you do it,it's just
no-nonsense,uncomplicated sex,right?

203
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,990
Just simple,stress-reducing fun.

204
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,740
That's the idea.

205
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,220
What,are you asking me
to have sex with you?

206
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,030
Yeah. Why not?

207
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,780
You and me. friends
with benefits,tonight.

208
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,850
I mean,you're right,you're right.

209
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,460
I am. I'm stressed out,and I just.

210
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,900
I just need some. touch.

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,140
and you're perfect because unemotional
sex is the only kind you have.

212
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,920
And.

213
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,900
What time should I come over?

214
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,850
-Really?
-Really.

215
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,260
Oh,hey,cooper,can you take
sam's 11:30? I gotta help with.

216
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,960
I'm getting laid tonight.

217
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,690
Congratulations. What's her screen name?

218
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,810
No.

219
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,090
Me and violet.

220
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,840

Friends with benefits. her idea.

222
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,220
No strings,no expectations,no downside.

223
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,650
You really think that's smart?

224
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,770
Glass house,stone thrower.

225
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,840
You remember the last time you
dated a doctor in this practice?

226
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,510
-Oh,that was fun for everybody.
-Oh,I don't. that was one.

227
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,190
and now you and addison
have this whole weird thing.

228
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,360
I can make it work with addison.

229
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,920
Based on what? "Oh,addison,you
moved down here 'cause I kissed you.

230
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,120
" "Oh,pete,you fake
doctor. Your touch heals.

231
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,720
" You've been friends
with violet for years.

232
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,160
U really think things are gonna be
the same after you've seen her naked?

233
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,400
No,I think things are gonna be better
because I will have seen her naked.

234
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,750
I'm getting laid

235
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,520

236
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,880
Things are a little busy here today,so
she's gonna be monitoring your case.

237
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,250
-Hi.
-Hello.

238
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,700
Maybe mommy would like some time alone?

239
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,210
Uh,hi. We can have someone watch your kids
if you want to stay here with your wife.

240
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,700
Oh,no,I get queasy during these things.

241
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,110
Trust me,he'll be
more trouble than good.

242
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,340
Can you take the boys to the lobby?

243
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,850
What am I supposed to do with 'em?

244
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,950
Well,I don't know,honey.
Just occupy 'em.

245
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,430
-Come on,guys.
-Bye,sweeties.

246
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,690
Uh,naomi,addison,we have a situation.

247
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,470
I-I told them that susan said
no,but,uh,then a bunch more of 'em showed up.

248
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,390
uh,what's going on?

249
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,320
I know susan doesn't
want anybody in there,

250
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,180
but she's part of our family,and we're
not gonna leave one of our own alone.

251
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,860
Guys coming off shift,uh,they want
to they want to be here for her.

252
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,220
Now I'm not comfortable with
this whole birthing myself,

253
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,760
but keith here,he's got two kids,another
one on the way,so he's good to go in.

254
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,950
I.

255
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,970
I don't think susan is
going to change her mind.

256
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,460
But susan. she's. she's just a kid.

257
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,820
Yeah,but she. she needs
to do this her own way.

258
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,720
All right. Well,uh,we'll wait here.

259
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,560
We're staying.

260
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,260
How do you feel?

261
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,510
How do you think I feel?

262
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,460
I feel like I got shot.

263
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,560
we're closed.

264
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,350
Sorry. I'm sorry.

265
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,630
I'm sorry about that.

266
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,880
It's,uh,it's been awhile since I've
had to deal with a-a bullet wound.

267
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,670
He's more of a mind-body doctor.

268
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,000
Dr. Feelgood?

269
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,950
Uh,yeah. Hi. Hello.

270
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,730
Mind-body? Uh.

271
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,900
I need a doctor.

272
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,780
Do you even know what you're doing?

273
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,040
Yeah,I know exactly what I'm doing.

274
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,390
All right,it's a good
color. I feel a strong pulse.

275
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,170
I need a doctor!

276
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,080
I am a doctor.

277
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,810
All right,it looks like the
bullet missed the artery.

278
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,960
Probably just nicked
the muscle. He's lucky.

279
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,630
I need a doctor for me.

280
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,710
My water just broke.

281
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,600
What's taking so long?

282
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,930
Okay,okay. All right,just take this,put
it there,and apply pressure,okay?

283
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,760
Wait,wait,you're helping her?

284
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,910
Will you shut up? It's a flesh wound.

285
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,530
You're gonna be fine.

286
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,350
Okay,ma'am,you're in labor.

287
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,670
All right,we really should
try to get you to a hospital.

288
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,020
-No.
-ok ok

289
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,550
Well,then let me
just call 9-1-1.

290
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,830
No,no
cops,no 9-1-1.

291
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,350
You're delivering this
baby,and you're doing it now!

292
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,570
Okay.

293
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,780
Okay.

294
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,440
Okay,if you don't mind,I'm
just gonna make one quick call.

295
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,470
I said no cops.

296
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't try anything. I said no cops!

297
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,220
I just want to call a colleague so that
I can give you the help that you need.

298
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,720
Please.

299
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,190
You dial,and you hande the phone,okay?

300
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,430
Okay,I'm dialing. See?

301
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,640
all right.

302
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,340
Don't try and take the
gun. That's how I got shot.

303
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,430
-Okay.
-Okay.

304
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,350
Hey,naomi,it's sam.

305
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,230
Uh,I need your help.

306
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,630
I'm about to,uh,deliver a baby.

307
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,160
I thought you were on a house call.

308
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,310
I am. Well,I was.

309
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,630
But then I ran into a really
nice lady,and she is in labor.

310
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,170
Uh,h-hold on,sam.

311
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,300
Hey,dell,I need you to monitor
ashley minnehan's contractions,

312
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,530
and you tell me the second
she's dilated to 4 centimeters.

313
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,720
Really? A-a birth?

314
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,960
You. you bring me in as
soon as she's ready to go.

315
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,190
Okay? Thanks,yeah.

316
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,490
Understand?

317
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,490
All right,now,sam,wait,where are you?

318
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,890
Okay,I really don't have the time to talk
right now,so if we could just get to it?

319
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,340
O-okay,fine. Um,is she fully dilated?

320
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,910
Uh,just a minute.

321
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,770
I'm here to monitor your contractions.

322
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,720
All right.

323
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,620
Uh,any questions or concerns?
Anything I can do to help?

324
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,740
Oh,no,no. I've. I've
done three of these.

325
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:35,020
I just say a little prayer and go,and you just sit
there and catch the baby like it's a football,okay?

326
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,730
can I just say,it's a good thing that
pete is getting me now,because I am hot.

327
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
I am on fuego.

328
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,310
This place is crawling with cops.

329
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,270
And that cute one over
there,he's totally.

330
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,570
what?

331
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,570
Sam just called. He's delivering a baby.

332
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,740
He is? What's with all the births today?

333
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,870
It's like babypaloozA.

334
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,260
God,how does he get
himself into these things?

335
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,310
I-I should just mind my own
business,right? About sam?

336
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,130
Yeah,about sam,and about
you on fuego and pete.

337
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,510
You all. you all just.

338
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,070
leap.

339
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,580
And you are a thinker.

340
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,270
So.

341
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,960
what do you think.

342
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,180
about me and pete?

343
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,470
Come on,nai.

344
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,340
you're my friend.

345
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,310
Okay. Fine.

346
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,430
You said you want
change and you pick pete?

347
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,980
What,a cute doctor boy with
nice eyes? That's not change.

348
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,300
That's your M.O. You're just.

349
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,760
you're rushing into something new.

350
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,130
I'm not. I'M.

351
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,830
making a decision,uh,to take a
chance on something that feels right.

352
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,280
Because you're afraid to be alone.

353
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,840
So what if I am? Surprise,naomi.

354
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,660
I'm susceptible to the human condition.

355
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,630
I mean,look,there are other men.

356
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,230
I mean,there are men in uniform that
I can not be alone with right now.

357
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,340
I did not pick pete because
I'm desperate and lonely.

358
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,220
Pete is my choice.

359
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,750
You asked.

360
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,490
Are you okay?

361
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,350
The baby's coming now.

362
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,020
What? No,um.

363
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,710
are you sure?

364
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,220
It's coming.

365
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,390
U have to catch the baby.

366
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,450
Okay.

367
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,620
No,no,I-I can't do this.
I have to call naomi.

368
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,090
Now would be a good time!

369
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,970
naomi!

370
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,450
Susan,your contractions
are five minutes apart. So.

371
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,640
it won't be too much longer.

372
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,690
I'm ready.

373
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,110
You really are,susan. You
are totally prepared for this.

374
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,820
Oh,god.

375
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,270
Today. My son's birthday is today.

376
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,760
what are you doing?

377
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,770
Timing your contractions.

378
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,740
You been having pain long?

379
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,930
Yeah,since I got up this morning.

380
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,910
What were you thinking?

381
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:18,800
I was thinking that I need to rob a convenience store because I have
no money for diapers or food or to put a roof over my baby's head!

382
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,100
-Okay,ma'am.
-that's not a reason.

383
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,050
Normal people don't
hold up stores,kelly.

384
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,640
Kelly?

385
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,260
So you two didn't just
meet today,did you?

386
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,710
That's my baby you're delivering.

387
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,600
okay,okay,okay.

388
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,320
dell.

389
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,390
it just. it just happened.

390
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,960
I-I-I
swear.

391
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,740
It was the fastest
delivery I've ever seen.

392
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,830
Okay,it's all right. All right,dell.

393
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,390
Okay,first what we're gonna do is
we're gonna cut the umbilical cord.

394
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,510
Yeah. All right,see?

395
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,420
Right here. You see?

396
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,170
-About a half an inch.
-You got it?

397
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,750
There we go. Yeah.

398
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,270
Keep the baby low for me.

399
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,400
There you go. All right.

400
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,540
there you go.

401
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,480
-How is she?
-oh,she's great.

402
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,610
She's great. She's,um,oh!

403
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,660
She's. she's a boy.

404
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,570
congratulations. It's a. it's a boy.

405
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,830
No!

406
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,880
You shove that boy back up
there and pull out a girl!

407
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,390
 one girl.

408
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,990
Is that too much to ask?

409
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,780
Well,uh,your. your ultrasound
was quite a while ago

410
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,690
,and,uh,misinterpretations can
happen that early on in the pregnancy.

411
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,840
I bought a little pink dress with some
little pink shoes for a little pink girl.

412
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,580
And I'm not leaving
until I get some pinkness!

413
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,880
all right,kelly,I need you
to take slow,deep breaths.

414
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,150
Babies take money,damon.

415
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,910
What,you think I wasn't gonna
turn you into the police?

416
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,080
What,you think I was just gonna let you rob
the place where I work and not turn you in?

417
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,160
You owe me.

418
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,080
you're crazy!

419
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,780
I'm not crazy. I'm hormonal.

420
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,080
Tell him I'm hormonal.

421
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,470
Uh,I think that maybe there's
a new word for what you are.

422
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,960
I couldn't raise this baby on my own.

423
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,960
You wouldn't give me any money,so
I had to come and take it.

424
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,330
You left me with nothing.

425
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,880
Why do you think I took
this job in the first place?

426
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,420
I told you,I'm gonna
take care of this baby.

427
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,080
But you left me.

428
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,410
Yes. I left you.

429
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,890
But I won't leave our baby. Let me help.

430
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,820
I have.

431
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,600
I have to just say,it sounds
like damon's an okay guy.

432
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,630
So,you know,maybe you should let.

433
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,320
stay back! Stay back!

434
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,310
Okay,everybody,stoP.

435
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,450
just stop.

436
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,830
We are going to listen
to the lady with the gun.

437
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,870
I can't take it.

438
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,760
Does everybody understand?

439
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,590
keep taking those
long,slow,deep breaths,okay?

440
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,480
there we go.

441
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,330
Ashley minnehan will not bond with
this baby. She won't even look at him.

442
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,690
She was expecting a girl.

443
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,470
She's hormonal,so she's at
risk for postpartum depression.

444
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,540
-Can you talk to her?
-Sure.

445
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,470
Let me just make sure
susan's ready for me to go.

446
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,870
Okay.

447
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,110
-My place,8:00.
-Done.

448
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,070
I can't raise four boys on my own.

449
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,650
Well,have you,uh. you have your husband.

450
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,530
He can help.

451
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,450
Oh,yeah,sure. Yesterday he taught the
boys how to burp the national anthem.

452
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,520
Not the right kind of help.

453
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:31,140
I'm the only one who puts batteries in the smoke alarm,the
one who puts the cover on the swimming pool at night.

454
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,190
Have you tried talking to patrick?

455
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,110
Oh,he says I'm just being silly
because nothing bad ever happens.

456
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,120
But that's only because I make
sure nothing bad ever happens.

457
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,180
Ashley. you are a great mom.

458
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,850
the boys likhim better than
me because he plays with them.

459
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:55,930
I just wanted one girl
so she could be mine.

460
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,770
And then I wouldn't care so much
about having to do it all myself.

461
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,750
Well,maybe you have
another boy for a reason.

462
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,990
Maybe it's because you're a great mom,and
you're going to raise your boys to be good men.

463
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,280
And the world needs good men.

464
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,080
I want a girl.

465
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,240
I've been kind of a pain in the ass.

466
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,730
No,you haven'T.

467
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,120
Yes,I have. all my rules.

468
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,190
but things work out better when I
stay focused,don't let my mind wander.

469
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,840
You have nothing to apologize for.

470
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,280
you can't really. I mean.

471
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,570
there's no plan for
doing this alone,is there?

472
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,510
Look,there's a roomful of jason's
friends from the force here for you.

473
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,740
You could bring someone in.

474
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,400
They don't get how lonely
it is since he died.

475
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,110
Probably not.

476
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,730
I lost my wife a while ago.

477
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,600
I'm sorry.

478
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,990
It gets better.

479
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,660
Does it really get better?

480
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,640
Or do you just bury it deeper?

481
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,910
I don't know.

482
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,140
Maybe it depends on how you left things.

483
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,080
They were good.

484
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,970
He was so excited about this baby.

485
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,490
Hold on to that.

486
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,930
Oh,here comes another one.

487
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,750
Stand up?

488
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,510
Okay.

489
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,200
-You're doing good.
-Breathe.

490
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,580
that's it.

491
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,750
That's it. That's good.
Just like that,kelly.

492
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,490
Oh,god.

493
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,320
Uh,you may be fully
dilated. Here you go.

494
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,800
Is the baby okay?

495
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,170
Please make it stop.
Make it stop,Dr. Phil.

496
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,770
Well,not. it's not phil.

497
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,910
It's feel,like "feel good.

498
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,750
" Okay,never mind.

499
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,490
I want an epidural. Oh,please.

500
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,260
Epi. yeah,well,we're in
a convenience store so.

501
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,320
oh,god.

502
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,700
She's in pain. Do something.

503
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,170
all right,all right. Kelly,listen to me.

504
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,110
your mind is a very
powerful healing tool.

505
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,160
So if you can relax your mind,you'll
be able to relax your body.

506
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,900
All right? You understand what I'm
saying? So try to relax your mind.

507
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,840
I just wanted a home to raise my baby in,and now I've
ruined everything,and you're telling me to relax my mind!

508
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,300
Okay,good.

509
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,590
You're ready to start pushing.

510
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,730
Nice and easy.

511
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,330
I dropped it.

512
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,690
I dropped the list.

513
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,890
Well,it's all right. We know what to do.

514
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,830
No,I. you know,I should've laminated
it. Why didn't I think of that?

515
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,700
We don't need it,susan.

516
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,930
I need it. I need to get
outta here. I need it.

517
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,340
Whoa,whoa,susan,stay where you are.

518
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,390
Just grab on to the
handles if you need support.

519
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,900
Try to relax. Relax.

520
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,040
No,I can'T.

521
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,760
-I can't push.
-Yes,you can.

522
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,310
Susan,the baby's coming.

523
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,550
No,something's wrong. I can feel it.

524
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,800
Nothing is wrong,susan.
You're doing great.

525
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,060
Where the hell is jason?

526
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,630
-You're in control.
-No!

527
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,540
Just stay with it.

528
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,050
He's supposed to be here! He's.

529
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,980
where is he?

530
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,990
okay,susan.

531
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,750
Susan,this little baby is
ready to come right now.

532
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,860
We are ready,just like you planned.

533
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,940
No,no. He's.

534
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,330
Oh,my god.

535
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,060
-Try to breathe.
-My jason.

536
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,520
my.

537
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,650
oh,he's dead.

538
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,440
Oh,he's dead!

539
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,610
He's dead.

540
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,880
He's really dead.

541
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,810
Okay,susan,susan,when you hyperventilate,you
lower the baby's heart rate.

542
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,720
All right,if we don't start pushing right
now,there's a chance you will lose the baby.

543
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,970
Do you understand?

544
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,950
I can'T. I can'T.

545
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,240
I didn't want to be alone.

546
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,770
Oh,this wasn't my choice.

547
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,650
No! I chose jason!

548
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,280
I didn't want this.

549
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,540
Susan,honey,listen to me.

550
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,780
You're not alone.

551
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,120
Okay? I am right here with you.

552
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,570
Okay?

553
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,810
Now.

554
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,270
you're not alone,and we're gonna push.

555
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,920
Keep breathing.

556
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,720
Push.

557
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,830
good girl. Good,good.

558
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,830
Good. Good.

559
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,240
You're dng great.

560
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,520
Now let's bring your son out here,okay?

561
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,210
All right. Ready.

562
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,190
oh,god.

563
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,360
Please,please,please,please,please.
Oh,god.

564
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,960
-I can help.
-You stay back.

565
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,350
You want to kill me,then kill me.

566
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,390
No,no,no,no,no,no.

567
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,210
We don't have to go there.
We don't have to go there.

568
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,390
I'm not gonna leave our baby.

569
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,750
Hey,hey,hey,man. S-sit down,sit down.

570
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,100
Kelly.

571
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,110
I got news for you.

572
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,730
You tried to rob a
convenience store today.

573
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:30,790
When this is all done,you're
gonna have to answer to the cops.

574
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,420
And they're probably gonna try
and take your baby away from you.

575
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,030
But I think that,uh,that
maybe you're lucky because.

576
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,900
your baby's father,he really
wants to take care of your child.

577
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,400
No,he left me.

578
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:56,570
Okay,if you want what's best for
your baby,you gotta put down that gun.

579
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,400
I can'T. You'll call the cops.

580
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,280
I'm not gonna call the cops.

581
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,340
You're gonna have to trust me.

582
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,080
Can you trust me?

583
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,200
All right,then put down the gun.

584
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,810
okay,now,uh,let's get this baby out.

585
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,400
-You didn't call the cops.
-Nope.

586
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,170
I didn't call the cops.

587
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,430
All right.

588
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,220
time to see my new boy?

589
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,770
How awesome is that?

590
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,940
Another little dude.

591
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,460
He's. he's with the nurse
right now,getting cleaned up.

592
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,050
Is something wrong?

593
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,690
You need to grow up.

594
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,600
I'm sorry?

595
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,170
-You don't.
-patrick,he,uh,he's right.

596
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,650
Um,you need to help
out around the house.

597
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,800
I help. I hang with the boys.

598
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,680
Upside down,out windows.
that's not any help.

599
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,470
Honey.

600
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:27,040
Ashley really needs you to not
play so much,do more parenting.

601
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,190
You know what? You need to grow up,too.

602
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,850
Me?

603
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,320
What did I do?

604
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,710
You knew going in that the odds
of having a girl were 50-50.

605
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,760
You decided to populate,and
that boy is yours.

606
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,420
You get what you get,and
you don't get upset.

607
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,610
Or,if you'd like,I can introduce you to one of the
many families I treat who can't even have a child.

608
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,820
All right?

609
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,860
All right.

610
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,340
I'm sorry.

611
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,020
Are you two ready to see that
beautiful baby boy I delivered?

612
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,070
We're ready.

613
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,540
That's good. That's real good,kelly.

614
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,990
That'S.

615
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,550
what? What is it?

616
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,860
Uh,okay. You just hang tight,kelly.

617
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,060
Hang tight. You're doing real good.

618
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,280
yeah,naomi. There's a problem.

619
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,730
The head is out,but the
baby's not delivering.

620
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,340
That's shoulder dystocia.

621
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,790
Sam,you're gonna have to release that
shoulder quickly,or she's gonna lose the baby.

622
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,630
You're gonna need forceps,you're gonna
need anesthetic,and you need to make sure.

623
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,770
no,no,no. I don't have any
equipment,o anesthetics.

624
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,190
I don't. I don't. I don't have anything.

625
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,270
Sam,where are you?

626
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,720
Please don't ask questions. Ju
tell me how to fix this,fast.

627
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,680
Okay,okay,sam.

628
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:49,350
You need to reach in and you need to
rotate the baby's shoulder counterclockwise.

629
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,400
Right now she's probably.

630
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,980
okay,that's all I got
time for. I gotta go.

631
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,970
okay,listen,listen,listen to me.

632
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,180
I'm gonna have to
rotate this baby myself.

633
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,160
You're gonna what?

634
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,340
All right,now we have to do this now.

635
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,530
I'm gonna count to three,and
then I'm gonna reach in.

636
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,060
All right,now this is gonna hurt.

637
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,530
-No,no,no,I can'T.
-Get behind her. Hold up her legs.

638
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,960
-No,I can'T. I can'T.
-Yes,you can. Yes,you can.

639
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,840
Stay with me.

what time tonight?

689
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,260
Well,my place,8.

690
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,890
Great. It's a date at 8.

691
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,990
It's not a date,Dr. Seuss.

692
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,580
it's sex.

693
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,100
your help with susan,it.

694
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,250
it means a lot to me.

695
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,450
Well,to all of us.

696
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,400
Oh,I'm. I'm glad to help.

697
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,070
Well,thank you,Dr. Montgomery.

698
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,940
Addison.

699
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,220
Addison,I was wondering if you would be
interested in having a drink with me tonight.

700
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,550
I,uh.

701
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,340
that's,um.

702
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,380
very nice of you.
I,uh,already have plans.

703
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,850
maybe another time.
But,uh,thank you again.

704
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,610
Thank you.

705
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,830
I'm gonna take my clothes off now.

706
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,030
I love that family. Don't you?

707
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,130
Take your clothes off,cooper.

708
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,270
I want a big family like that.

709
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,830
whole bunch of kids,little
rug rats,you know?

710
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,540
I want to be a dad. I want.

711
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,970
-I want to be a.
-I'm trying to have sex here.

712
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,020
I don't really want to talk
about kids or big families.

713
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,780
Sorry.

714
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,190
Oh,you're.

715
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,430
You're naked.

716
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,460
Yeah,it makes the sex easier.

717
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,140
It's just. I've never seen you naked.

718
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,820
In the office,you always
have your clothes on.

719
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,700
Well,yeah. I-I try
to be a professional.

720
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,770
Rip off the band-aid,coop. I did.

721
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,740
Yeah,I can'T.

722
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,000
Y-you have to. You've
already seen me naked.

723
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,690
I know,and you're.

724
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,470
beautiful.

725
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,410
I'm sorry. I th-thought I could,but.

726
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,310
you can't reject me.
You have low standards.

727
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,310
You have no standards.

728
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,820
-It's different,violet.
-No,it's not different.

729
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,000
I-I am offering you
uncomplicated,unemotional sex.

730
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,450
No! I. you're not some
random girl from the internet.

731
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,680
With you,it doesn't mean
nothing. It never will.

732
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,860
all right. Get out.

733
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,020
oh,damn it.

734
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,290
hi.

735
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,050
Okay. Hi,uh,cooper.

736
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,540
Uh,I came to talk to
sam. He wasn't home.

737
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,030
I just thought. I saw you through
the window,that you were alone.

738
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,880
,It's. it's fine. Come in.

739
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,760
Pete said you had a date.

740
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,330
Yeah,we do. We did.

741
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,030
an hour ago,we did.

742
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,230
oh,damn it.

743
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,020
He stood me up.

744
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,270
He actually.

745
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,820
stood me up.

746
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,010
If it helps,I was
colossally stupid today.

747
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,670
I mean colossally. with violet.

748
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,820
Friends with benefits. she wanted us to.

749
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,060
you know,uh,together.

750
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,310
-And?
-I couldn'T.

751
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,790
No benefits.

752
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,770
I just. couldn't mess with it.

753
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,550
Stupid.

754
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,420
I think I win that award today.

755
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,850
No,I am the most stupidest.

756
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,490
Stupider.

757
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,450
Or more stupid.

758
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,010
Stupidiest.

759
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,000
Let's call it a tie.

760
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,440
Would you like to order some
pizza and get really fat with me?

761
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,980
Yes,please.

762
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,120
cooper,not now.

763
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,710
I can'T.

764
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,180
pete.

765
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,290
Sorry it's so late.

766
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,990
What's wrong?

767
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,970
When she died,anna
and i had been trying.

768
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,840
to have a baby?

769
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,830
Yeah.

770
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,950
You're here late.

771
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,890
Oh,my god. Sam,are you
all right? What happened?

772
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:49,820
Uh,she had a healthy
baby girl,thanks to you.

773
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,250
I don't understand. How do you.

774
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,810
how do you get those
bruises delivering a baby?

775
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,050
Oh,yeah. The mom.

776
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,650
she hit me.

777
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,140
She hit you?

778
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,440
-With her gun.
-With her what?

779
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,720
It was sort of a. like
a hostage situation.

780
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,820
I didn't mention that to you on the phon

781
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,600
no,sam,no.You did not mention
that to me on the phone.

782
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,850
I,uh,didn't want you to worry.

783
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,330
God,sam,you could've been hurt.

784
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,610
You.

785
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,940
-you could've.
-I'm fine.

786
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,760
Everything's fine.

787
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,640
Everything is not fine,sam.

788
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,990
Everything is very,very not fine.

789
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,640
You got beaten up by a pregnant lady.

790
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,680
this is what happens when you
do things without thinking.

791
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,080
-I. naomi,I.
-I am sick of it.

792
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,230
I am so sick and tired of being the
only person in this practice who thinks.

793
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,950
who thinks and thinks and.
