1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,460
The power...the
speed,the control--

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,700
I mean,who knewgo-cart
racingcould be better than sex?

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,780
well,if it'sbetter than
sex,I'm not taking you again.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,280
okay,almost better than sex.

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,940
the door's open.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,550
Kevin...

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,000
whoa,be careful,kevin.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,460
stay put.

9
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,960
L.A.P.D.! Get on the ground!

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,700
-archer?
-You're dating a cop?

11
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,970
Archer,this is kevin.
Kevin,this ismy brother archer.

12
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,780
Will you putsome clothes on,please?

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,830
what are you doing here?

14
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,640
I missed you.

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,540
And you said you're happierwhen
I'm here,so I took some time off.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600
Here I am.

17
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,020
I figure that we can seewhat this is.

18
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,590
Right now,it's a great surprise.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,910
I have another surprisefor you.

20
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,460
Does it involvethe kama sutra?

21
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,340
Hey,that is great,but there
aremore natural waysto quit smoking.

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,600
Oh,well,you're the
expert. Where do we start?

23
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,870
I went for a swim. I
think she's a neighbor.

24
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,800
So I invited her into be neighborly.

25
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,150
this is L.A. No one is neighborly.

26
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,270
Well,in that case,you really should
do somethingabout your alarm system.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,010
Then again,you do haveyour own
private copto keep you safe.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,750
Oh,god.

29
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,530
it's good to have you
here. I missed you.

30
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,790
I can't findthe barolo.

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,250
-Top shelf.
-The writing's italian.

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,510
he's nota moron. He's smart and funny.

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,260
And by the way,he not
a cop. He's S.W.A.T.

34
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,260
That's so very different.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,140
-oh,you are such a snob.
-Takes one to know one.

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,950
-So you in townfor long,archer?
-No.

37
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,350
My publisher suckered meinto
attendinghis winter launch party.

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,750
They parade new authorsand their
booksto foreign buyersand agents.

39
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,760
He needed sometar power,so I figured it wouldgive
me an opportunityto come see you and get drunk.

40
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,070
yes. See,archer used to
bea world-class neurologist.

41
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,530
But now he makes his livingtelling tall
talesabout hismost disturbing patients.

42
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,780
But really,he's hereto
spy on me for bizzy.

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,830
Bizzy?

44
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,870
God forbidshe should let her childrendefine
her identityby calling her mother.

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,120
She's not happy with you.

46
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,550
Youleft derek. You left seattle.

47
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,780
She thought you'd come
backto civilization.

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,310
L.A.'S not civilization?

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,750
L.A.'S sodom andomorrahas
far as she's concerned.

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,070
And wait until I tell hera
forbes montgomeryis dating a cop.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,100
-no offense.
-None taken.

52
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,430
so in your sessionswith mr.Jarvis,

53
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,060
did he give youany reason to believehe
harbored inappropriatefeelings toward children?

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,370
I only had three sessionswith hal.

55
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,640
We discussed his divorce,his
job,his feeling isolated.

56
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,220
So they weren't
aboutpedophilia,child abuse?

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,200
Was he strugglingwith any sexual issues?

58
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,850
-Not that we discussed.
-Great.

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,240
Now in yourprofessional opinion,does the fact that mr.Jarvis was
found in possessionof pictures depicting childrenin minimal clothing

60
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,100
indicate that he'sa danger to children?

61
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,910
Well,any psychiatristwill tell youthat simply
possessing materialsdoesn't make someone a threat,

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,190
but...it's a
risk factor--

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,760
but risk factor's don't
mean's a predator,do they?

64
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,140
No.

65
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,690
So is it plausiblethat mr.Jarvis could
havea pleasant conversationwith a young girl

66
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,070
like jody sampicawithout
her being in danger?

67
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,720
It's possible.

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,400
No further questions,your honor.

69
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,710
Attorns?

70
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,790
uh,dr. Turner,not so fast.

71
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,070
-okay,so the office is nice.
-Quit spying and sit.

72
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,390
I'm just taking it all in. We
gave her the onewith the best view.

73
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,200
Mine has a palm treeright
in the middle of it.

74
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,140
A generous doctor.

75
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,940
Now he's appropriate.
Bizzy would love him.

76
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,220
Why aren't you dating him?

77
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,090
pete,this is my brother archer.

78
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,990
Archer,this is pete wilder,our
alternative medicine guru.

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,780
Wait a minute. Archer montgomery?

80
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,840
You didn't tell me your
brotherwas archer montgomer

81
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,720
well,you know,I'm justso
very,very proud of him.

82
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,340
Come on. Let's go to the
kitchenand get some coffee.

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,040
You know,I've read your books. The
one about amnesiacs--forgettable.

84
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,180
Oh,god.

85
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,040
-archer,addison didn'ttell us you were coming.
-Surprise inspection.

86
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,070
-Look at you.
-HellO.

87
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,840
-Last time I saw you--she had her headover
the toiletin bizzy's country house,puking.

88
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,800
We're wasps.We drink. Naomi's
just gonnahave to learn to keep up.

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,860
Unbelievable. You try to do your civic
duty--I should not have to do this.

90
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,390
-What's up?
-You guys like pedophiles?

91
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,790
'Cause you're about
tohave one here,every day.

92
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,720
what? pedophiles?

93
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,540
Is this the court caseyou were
subpoenaed for,your ex-client?

94
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,030
They gave hima suspended sentence,mandated
therapy with me,starting today,here.

95
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,270
No.This is a pediatric
office. We have children here.

96
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,630
Well,it's after hours. He has
to be out by 9:00,in after 7:00.

97
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,150
You--I'm--I'm sorry.I
didn't realize--

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,610
uh,my brother archer. Archer,violet.

99
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,060
Hello.

100
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,360
H-hi.

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,780
Stop that.

102
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,750
-Okay,back to the pedophile.
-Yeah,yeah,this is wrong.

103
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,100
A-a sex offender hereat this office?

104
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,050
He's violet's patient. He needs help.

105
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,740
You'd rather have himroaming the
hallslooking at my wallof kid photos?

106
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,930
And what if,god forbid,he
should target one of them?

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,010
Oh,damn it. Dell.

108
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,670
I'll talk to him.

109
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,430
Is thisa bad time to mention,you're
all invitedto a party tonight?

110
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,570
Look,dell,I know this mightbe
particularly hard on you--you know,

111
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,440
I got hit a lot,okay,by someone who made
me feel likeif I told,I'd get it even worse.

112
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,410
So I can only imagineif
it was sexual abuse.

113
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,530
All abuse is bad. I know that.

114
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,560
-But most abuserswere themselves
abused--no,that's a crap excuse.

115
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,750
Well,I-I don't like thisany
more than you do,dell,

116
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,960
-but if you wantto talk about
it--he's coming in tonight,right?

117
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,670
I'm leaving early.

118
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,450
los li I'm notthe only one
who objectsto your new patient.

119
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,310
Why are you all mad at
me? It was a court mandate.

120
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,440
Did something else happen?

121
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,610
Besides the pedophile?
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,780
-You know,I came in herein
a great mood--really?

123
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,450
-So you and charlotte
are--are great.***

124
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,980
I'm thinking about asking
herto move in with me.

125
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,170
Great.

126
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,530
don't worry about money.
The clients will be rich.

127
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,870
We want the officesto feel rich.

128
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,690
You haven't told cooper.

129
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,020
Excuse mewhile I handle something.

130
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm not somethingto be handled. I
thought we were onthe same side here.

131
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,220
You're opening up a practicethat competes
with yourboyfriend's in his building,

132
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,860
you're in charge,and
you haven't told him?

133
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,310
I will find the right
moment,and when I--oh,

134
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,490
you know,I don't like
you,charlotte,but cooper does.

135
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,440
So do us both a favor.
Just tell him,tonight.

136
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,050
So... tell us.

137
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,130
Two of your triplets aresharing the
same blood vesselsand circulation system.

138
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,620
This baby's heartis pumping too
hardbecause it's not gettingenough blood.

139
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,020
It's becoming starved.

140
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,040
This baby's heart is failingbecause
it's gettingtoo mu blood.

141
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,050
Oh,my god.

142
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,170
Wh-what about the third one?

143
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,090
Luckily,she doesn't sharethe same blood
supply,so she doesn'tseem to be affected.

144
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,760
What I'd like to dois operateto
separatethe blood supplies.

145
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,380
You--you want
tocut into me?

146
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,960
The babies are showing signsof
early heart failure,tess.

147
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,900
If we wait on surgery,in 90% of the
cases,one or both babieswon't survive,

148
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,910
and it could affectthe third.

149
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,800
Is is my fault.

150
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,070
Everyone kept askingwhen
it was gonna be my turn.

151
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,360
I wanted a baby so badly.

152
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,990
We should've waited.

153
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,220
Doing I.V.F.,We were tempting god.

154
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,650
God is not punishing you
fortrying to have these children.

155
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,330
Dr.Bennett put inone embryo,and
it dividedinto three babies.

156
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,160
Now that's a miracle.

157
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,900
They could all die fromthe
surgery,couldn't they?

158
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,380
That's alwaysa possibility,yes.

159
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,250
And if we do nothing,there's
a chanceit's all okay?

160
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,100
A small one.

161
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,510
I'm sorry. We can't do the surgery.

162
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,390
We can't interfere again.

163
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,130
God will provide for them.

164
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,470
He--he
has to.

168
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,270
I'm sayinglaparoscopic
surgerycomes with inherent risks.

169
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,060
Fetal survival rate is what,50% at best?

170
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,010
Which is 40% betterthan doing
nothing at all. We should push them.

171
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,680
Well,you can't push a coupleto
go against their beliefs.

172
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,420
T.T.T.S.Syndrome in triplets.

173
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,260
Two of the babies are
affected. Surgery or not?

174
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,230
The couple has faith
thateverything is gonna work out.

175
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,060
Surgery or not?

176
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,710
I like this. It's like doctor "jeopardy!

177
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,120
"There's definitely
somethingto be said about faith.

178
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,160
We've all seen cases
whereoucan't explain the healing.

179
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,780
And we've all seen those caseswhere
we do nothingand the patient dies.

180
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,610
You did your due diligence.
You laid out the options.

181
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,180
You gave your recommendation.
It's over to them.

182
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,970
You really feel qualifiedto
judge their beliefs?

183
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,480
I'm not sayingthat there isn't
a placefor religion in medicine.

184
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,520
I'm just saying that I prefer
toput my faith in what we can do.

185
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,150
Maybe it's not your patient'sfaith
that's being tested. It's yours.

186
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,530
-He'd be good for you.
-shut up.

187
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,490
Excuse me.

188
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,290
I'm here to see dr.Turner.

189
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,620
Hal. Hal,why don't wego back?

190
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,230
I don't blame them.

191
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,070
What I am...

192
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,010
I know it's sick.

193
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,510
Well,that's why you're here.

194
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,110
I'm sorry I didn'ttell you
the truthwhen I came before.

195
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,730
That's whyI was so depressed.

196
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,120
The secret was crushing me.

197
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,840
Do you knowwhat that's
like,hiding a piece of yourself,

198
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,480
especially a pieceyou hate?

199
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,220
Well,secrets are hardon everyone.

200
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,660
This may sound crazy,but
getting caught...

201
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,440
it's been freeing'cause I-I can't hide.

202
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,320
I have to get help.

203
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,470
I just want to getthe
thoughts out of my head,

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,640
thoughts of these girls.

205
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,280
It's awful.

206
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,780
It's sick.

207
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,010
And if I--if I
did anything...

208
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,100
what? What would happen?

209
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,420
They would becomewhat I am.

210
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,770
Because you were abused?

211
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,330
and I hated it.

212
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,980
And I liked it.

213
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,380
And it tore me apart.

214
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,950
And I don't want to do thatto anyone.

215
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,090
can you help me?

216
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,850
I hate L.A.

217
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,720

222
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,660
-And I have to put a needlein your tim mee.
-Oh,that sounds dirty.

223
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,780
It's a specific pointon your
wristto help you quit smoking.

224
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
What I need is more of you.

How about you take tomorrow

226
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,450

00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,370

00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,930
I knowhe can be arrogantokay?

282
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,080
But he's justhis mother's
son,and he's my big brother...

283
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,280
and he'd do anything for me.

284
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,630
I've got an early day. Uh,maybe I'll go.

285
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,400
But archercan get you back,right?

286
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,220
Hey,guys. Great party,right?

287
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,070
Uh,actually,you know,I

288
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,890
-Oh,you don't have to.
-No,I want to.

289
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,070
Is that okay,nai?

290
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,430
Yeah,I'll just get my wrap.

291
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,790
Well,wait a minute. You're leaving,too?

292
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,370
-Kevin and addisonpicked me
up,so--I'll take you home.

293
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,910
You sure it's okay?

294
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,620
Totally not a problem.

295
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,680
A polite houseguestwould have
calledto saythey weren't coming home.

296
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,330
Good thing i'm not polite.

297
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,090
I thought I was doing youa favor staying
out,not interfering with youand your boy in blue.

298
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,700
He's a man in black. S.W.A.T.Is black.

299
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,040
And unfortunately,you wouldn't have interfered.
He called things off early lastnight.

300
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,910
-What did you say to him?
-Nothing.

301
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,040
Well,I at least hopyou
got naomi home okay

302
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,260
beforewhat I can only imaginewas
a nightof drunken debauchery.

303
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,640
Yeah,I absolutelygot her home.

304
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,210
-did you sleepwith my brother?
-Yes.

305
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,830
You know him. You know what he's like.

306
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,700
Yes. He's fun.

307
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,880
It doesn't mean anything. It's not
gonna go anywhere.And it was great.

308
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,380
God,who knew?

309
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,710
Who knew that meaningless
sexcould be amazing?

310
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,760
You had meaningless sex?

311
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,530
Congratulations!

312
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,590

-oh,nice.

313
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,700
-Yes.Yeah.Yes,well,you
know,he's very--

314
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,600
-violet!
-Sorry.

315
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,290
Uh,I-I kn it's difficultto view
family membersin a sexual context--

316
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,240
stop,stop,okay? My brother and
sexin the same sentence--eww.

317
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,000
I thought you and iwere past all
this stuff. I thought we were good.

318
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,910
I know you're feelingthat this
is personal,but,uh,but it's not.

319
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,120
no,this is not about
you. This is about me.

320
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:22,800
This is about meand a really handsome
manwho I was attracted towho wanted me,

321
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,920
and--and for once in my life,instead
of second-guessing,I just let go.

322
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,050
-god.
-Why aren't you madat him?

323
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,020
Because there isa differencebetween
my brotherbeing a whore

324
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,230
and best friendconsciously
choosingto sleep with him.

325
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,770
I'm not your best friend.
Can I sleep with him?

326
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,770
What happened?

327
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,300
Tess faintedat the airport.

328
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,900
One of the babies developeda
fluid collectionaround his heart.

329
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,530
Tess was havingmirroring symptoms.

330
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,400
But I'm feelingmuch better now.

331
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,170
So is the baby. See?

332
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,850
The baby's heart is
stabilizedbecause you're resting.

333
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,750
Well,I'll justkeep resting then.

334
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,020
this is a sign ofincreasing
stress on the babies.

335
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Things are getting worse.

336
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,820
I know what you're
thinking,but you know I can'T.

337
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,340
Excuse me,doctor. I
need to take her vitals.

338
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,480
Gregory,I knowyou think god is
testing youbecause of the I.V.F

339
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,230
it'sa saint gerard
majella medal--

340
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,430
the patron saint of
childbirthand expectant mothers.

341
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,960
"Pray for us,"and we all are,gregory.

342
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,360
But sometimes prayerisn't
enough,like prayingfor a car to stop.

343
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,050
Unless you put on the
brakes,it isn't going to.

344
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:40,990
I know that.

345
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,350
I admire your faith,gregory. I do.

346
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:49,430
And I have faith,too,faith that
god haslots of way to help people.

347
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,400
Prayer is good,but so is medicine.

348
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,290
I can help them,gregory. Please...

349
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,190
help tess see that.

350
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,510
Morning.

351
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,780
Something wrongwith that tea?

352
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,100
I hate secrets.

353
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,990
You have secrets?

354
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,930
I have somethingthat shouldn't be
a seet,but I've made it into one.

355
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,040
And now I think the her shoeis gonna
drop,and it makesmy stomach feel all...

356
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,240
you know what? Maybe
I'll skip food today.

357
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,660
I ate enough at that party fora week.

358
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,190
-Hey,we missed you.
-Oh,I was doing acupuncture.

359
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,540
-Meg is trying to quit smoking.
-Good for her.

360
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,910
What?

361
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,180
I think she's quitting for me.
I don't know what that means.

362
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,410
-M-maybe that
she cares. -Maybe.

363
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,830
You don't like having her back.

364
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,040
I don't thinkshe likes being
back,except when she's with me.

365
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,950
'Cause you're good company.

366
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:47,430
She's quitting for me,she came back for
me,and I just don't feel likeit's about me.

367
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,320
the vasculatureis more
complicatedthan the ultrasound showed.

368
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,350
Yeah,but you can get it.

369
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,160
I can,if I
could just--

370
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,100
she's having a hyperthermicreaction
to the anesthetic.

371
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,900
All right,get some
iceand a cooling blanket.

372
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,620
Let's start an I.V.Dripof
dantrolene. I'm removing the trocars.

373
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,330
We gotta get her off the tableor
we're gonna lose them all.

374
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,830
Tess is okay,and so
are the babiesfor now.

375
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,870
But I wasn't ableto complete the
procedure,and tess is too weakto try again.

376
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,530
-So--so you--you can't--we
can't do anythingright now.

377
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,940
You talked me into it,and
I talked tess into it.

378
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,210
I made her go againstwhat she believes.

379
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,530
And now...

380
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,870
now they're gonna die.

381
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,380
You're in a good mood?

382
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,330
You took the morning off. I thght***

383
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,750
The constructionon the fourth flooris for a competingmedical practice

384
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,840
that charlotteis going to be running.

385
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,800
I wanted to tell you.

386
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,210
It's beenkilling me to keep it a secret.

387
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,350
But she saidthat she would tell you,and you've been so happy.

388
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,430
And you've known thisfor how long?

389
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,260
I wanted to tell you!

390
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,310
Well,you should've!

391
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,120
this is bad,isn't it?

392
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,190
yes,dell,it's bad.

393
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,320
Come on.How badis it really?

394
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,830
Well,let's see.Charlotte is the chiefof staff at st.Ambrose.

395
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,080
How many of ushave gotten referralsfrom doctors at st.Ambrose?

396
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,910
Well,you can kissall those good-bye.

397
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,950
Charlotte king--of allthe pains in the asses.

398
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,140
God,poor cooper.

399
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,340
how'd he find out?

400
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,810
I-I told him.

401
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,200
-I've known a couple days.
-What?

402
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,040
Charlotte's his girlfriend,and she wanted to tell him,so--

403
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,000
why wouldn't you tell us?

404
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,330
Oh,okay.Anybody elsearound here held secretsthe last couple months?

405
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,360
-I'm on your side.
-Oh,good.

406
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,430
We're all on the same side,and we are still screwed.

407
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,890
Can this day get any worse?

408
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,560
Yeah,well,I think ifmaybe we hadn't--

409
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,070
if you tell me I shouldn'thave rented the fourth floor,I may break a door.

410
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,400
Hey,you can't go back there.

411
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,830
-Cooper.
-You used me.You slept with me.

412
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,300
You heard aboutour financial problems,our fourth floor problems,

413
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,090
and you swooped in and what?What is this about?

414
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,050
Don't you dare come down hereusing that tone with me.

415
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,010
This is business,and we're personal.

416
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,750
And I couldn't tell youbecause I signeda nondisclosure agreementwhen they hired me,

417
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,480
and untilthis place was staffed,I couldn't tell anyone.

418
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,610
-But violet's known for--
-violet found out somethingshe shouldn'T.

419
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,360
I told her I would find the timeto tell you when I could.

420
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,400
Now you know.

421
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,360
I'm glad you know.

422
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,910
so when youlook at the pictures,the picturesof the little girls,what do you feel?

423
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,180
Like...

424
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,420
I want to be with them.

425
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,400
You want to hurt them?

426
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,140
No.No.

427
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,130
Just touch them sexually?

428
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,400
The girls in the pictus...

429
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,990
They're fantasies.

430
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,800
I don't feel...

431
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,840
as guilty...

432
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,830
about wanting to touch them.

433
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,310
As guilty as?

434
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,950
Jody.

435
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,180
Jody sampica.

436
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,510
What do you think aboutwhen you think about jody?

437
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,570
Come on.Now is the timeto be honest.

438
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,960
We have to face this.

439
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,570
I don't want to hurt her.

440
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,740
I-I just...

441
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,690
I just want to be with her.

442
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,700
I,uh...

443
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:55,050
I imagine driving overto her houseand,

444
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,870
you know,stopping and talkingand...

445
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,010
and then...

446
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,760
she gets into the car...

447
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,740
and I take her.

448
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,950
And we drive somewhere...

449
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,130
away from everyone else.

450
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,030
It seems like you thoughta lot about this.

451
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,180
I-I-I just want to...

452
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,450
talk to her.

453
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,240
Just talk?

454
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,310
Is that what he told you,the man who abused you?

455
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,340
He just wanted to talk.

456
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,840
hal,you want to do morethan just talk to jody.

457
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,580
I don'T...

458
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,990
I don't want to doanything wrong.

459
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,830
okay.

460
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,020
All right,I'm gonna go get my wallet.

461
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,160
You hang here.I'll be right back.

462
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,270
Okay,I'm fine.

463
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,890
hey,kevin.It's me.

464
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,420
Look,I knowyou didn't have a good timeat that party last night,

465
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,180
but I haven't heard from youall day.

466
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,280
Will you call me,please?

467
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,790
Bye.

468
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,710
charlotte stands readyto eat away at our practice,

469
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,210
those three babiesare probably gonna die,and I can't do anything.

470
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,460
What are you doing hereso late?

471
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,360
Please don't ask me that.

472
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,710
You're seeing archer again?

473
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,270
Look,look,I-I know we werejust getting back to normal,

474
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,670
and I--and I don't wantto upset that.

475
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,640
But I want to be able tosit down with my best friendand tell herwhat's happened to me.

476
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,750
I've never had sex with anyoneother than sam,

477
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,280
and I didn't know that sexwithout love could be any good,but it...

478
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,180
it was great.

479
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,760
I'm sorry it was your brother.

480
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,180
You slept with archer?

481
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,640
-Look,sam--
-and you're okay with this?

482
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,950
'Cause I'm not okay with this.

483
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,360
Hey,sam.

484
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,500

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,020

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,640

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,010
-Dr.Turner!

502
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,350
-He didn't do anything.
-what did he say to you?

503
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,300
nothing.

504
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,070
It's okay.

505
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,910
I just--I saw him there,and--

506
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,000
I know,I know.We allthought the same thing.

507
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,950
No,okay.

508
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,200
I thought aboutmy daughter.

509
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,330
It's not just about me.

510
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:44,170
I have a 6-year-old girlwhose mother is a drug addicthanging around bad people,

511
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,610
and I can't control it.

512
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,320
And all I can do is praythat betsey's safefrom people like hal,

513
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,120
but I can't protect herand I te it.

514
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,810
Because you know whatit's like to be victimized.

515
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,430
I was 20,in college...

516
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:12,150
and,uh,a man broke into my dorm...

517
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,410
and it was awful...

518
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,720
and violent...

519
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,510
and...

520
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,480
awful.

521
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:30,810
People like you and me,we turn a negativeinto something positive,helping people.

522
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,160
But people like hal...

523
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,940
they're victimized,and theyjust hurt more people.

524
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,730
They cause more pain.

525
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,530
I saw him with maya and...

526
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,610
I know what he thinks about.

527
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,000
I mean,there's--there's thisgirl he keeps thinking about,

528
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,280
and I don't know if what he'sthinking about is a planor

529
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,080
if it's just somethingthat's gonna stay in his head.

530
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,240
You have to stop him.

531
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,750
Well,it's not a crimeto think bad things.

532
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,540
He hasn't done anything.

533
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,760
Yeah,but he wants to.

534
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
He wants to get better.

535
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,640
Is that enough?

536
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,360
Did,uh,mayafinally get to sleep?

537
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,070
Yeah.

538
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,780
She said she felt dumbthat she couldn't figure outthat he was a bad guy.

539
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,260
I should've neverleft her alone.

540
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,360
You know,I'm not sorrythat I punched archer.

541
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,960
Well,you know,you flirtwith girls in front of my faceand get set up on datesin the office.

542
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,230
I know.I mean,I know it here.

543
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,010
I just--I...

544
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:35,350
I never expected youto be the first one of usto move on.

545
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,340
Neither did I.

546
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,750
Did ithave to be archer?

547
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,410
I didn't plan it,sam.

548
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,920
But it happened.

549
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,690
And I'm not sorry it did.

550
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,630
I mean,you're always talkingabout wanting to live your life.

551
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,350
I'm not gonna feel badfor doing the same.

552
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,120
That's why we got divorced,isn't it,to live our lives,to be alive?

553
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,740
It's good.

554
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,650
You should try it.

555
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,670
You know what?I'm glad it was me first

556
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:05,790
because now when it's you,I'll know it's okay.

557
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,070
I want my key back.

558
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,880
I brought you a present.

559
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,900
It's all edible.

560
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,360
In fact,that's chocolatefrosting you're staring at.

561
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,700
Bon appétit.

562
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,260
You want me to melt?

563
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,210
Supposed to spying on me...

564
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,050
Not sabotaging my life.

565
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,740
Look,I'm--if I knewit was such a big deal--

566
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,050
did it have to bemy best friend?

567
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,910
It was just sex.

568
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,010
At least withsomeone appropriate--bizzy likes naomi.

569
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,610
Stop about kevin.

570
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,200
Then help me understand it.

571
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,450
Because I want you to be happy.

572
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,910
I do.But I know you.

573
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:12,260
I know who you are,maybe better than anyone else,and this guy...

574
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,580
he's not you.

575
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,230
He's nowhere near you.

576
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,470
I don't know,archer.

577
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,710
kevin,finally.

578
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,540
Who is this?

579
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,850
Kevi kevin,hey.

580
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,740
I told leslienot to call you.

581
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,570
Shh,shh,shh,shh.

582
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,830
I'm here now.We're gonna take care of you.

583
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,580
This isn't right,addison.

584
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,610
You need to go.

585
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,550
Please,just--just--just go.

586
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,230
his pressure's down to 80and his sats are dropping.

587
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,860
Put a chest tube inand stabilize him.

588
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,600
-That's what I'm doing.
-Well,do it faster.

589
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,110
I told youyou should've stayed hometo make sure I behaved.

590
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,310
I don't careabout the cigarette.

591
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,200
What are youdoing here,meg?

592
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
You don't want me here?

593
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,870
I do,but you don't wantto be here.

594
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,570
You hate it here.

595
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,380
I love itwhen you're around.

596
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,950
Oh,that'S...

597
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,640
it'S...you--y can't put thisall on me.

598
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,020
I mean,you don't call,you show up,you blow in,you blow out,

599
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,510
you exct me todrop everything,and I can'T.

600
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,950
You say that you want us to figure things out,but that's not what you want.

601
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,410
You wantto figure things out.

602
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:45,030
And when I know that youdon't want to quit smokingand you don't wantto be in L.A.

603
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:49,020
,All that leaves is me,and that's too much pressure.

604
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,470
And...

605
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,100
it doesn't leave meany room to figure outwhat I want.

606
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,490
there.

607
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,410
Upper right.Perihepatic hematoma.

608
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,010
I see it,dr.Montgomery.

609
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,820
-If you just--
-I see it.

610
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,710
Addison.

611
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,270
I'm fi.It's okay.

612
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,000
Addison,it's tess.

613
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,100
I've got the bullet.

614
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,810
go to your patient.

615
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,410
Go.Go.

616
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,170
I willmake sure he's okay.Go.

617
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,500
Okay.

618
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,560
her heart stopped beating.

619
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,900
The healthy one died?How?

620
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,000
Tess' body reactedto the anesthea.

621
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,400
Her blood pressureand temperaturewent critically high.

622
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,910
The babyjust couldn't take it.

623
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,450
I'm so sorry,tess.

624
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,810
It's all we wanted,these babies,and now...

625
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,050
I shouldn't have talked youinto that surgery.

626
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,870
This isn't god,gregory.

627
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:05,000
It can't be,because I know--I know he did not put uson this journeyto take all threeof our babies.

628
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,050
She said it,tess.

629
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,000
There's nothing we can do.

630
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,360
two of my babiesare still fighting.

631
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,290
You said to trust in medicine,to trust you.

632
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,800
Please,you have to help them.

633
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,200
You nearly dieda couple of hours ago,tess.

634
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,730
Your body can't takeanother surgery.

635
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,800
My body can't takelosing all of them.

636
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,920
we could use local,but she'd be awake.

637
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,180
There's a riskof hemorrhaging.

638
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,240
You could havea heart attack,a stroke.

639
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,540
It's too dangerous.

640
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,760
I know you putthe mother's life first.

641
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,800
I don't want that.

642
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,500
You talked me into the surgery.

643
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,480
You told me letting her do itwas god providing.

644
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,170
I believe that.

645
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,360
I have to believe that.

646
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,900
And if you believe that,if there's a chance that youcan save these babies,

647
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,700
you have to do it.

648
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,000
You have to do something.

649
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,800
Yes,uh,judge ortiz.

650
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,840
I--I'm sorry to call youso late.

651
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,620
This is dr.Violet turner.

652
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,920
It's about hal jarvis.

653
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,920
I thinkjody sampica's in danger.

654
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,620
How e they doing?

655
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,420
Good.

656
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,350
Hang in therejust a little bit longer.

657
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,660
I'm scared.

658
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,850
I need you tostay with me,tess,okay?

659
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,220
Look at the monitor.

660
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,810
See the connecting vessels?

661
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,670
We're almost there.

662
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,720
Laser.

663
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,440
in place.

664
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,610
And...

665
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,700
what happened?

666
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,490
I just separatedthe babies' arteries.

667
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,160
They're beatingon their own now.

668
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,390
You did it.

669
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,640
you were supposed to behelping me.

670
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,650
All I did was talk to that girl in the lobby.

671
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,790
I know that.

672
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:37,430
And I know thatwhatever goes on in your head,you didn't putthose thoughts there.

673
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,270
But you and I both knowthat they're there.

674
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,610
And when you weretalking to her,they're there.

675
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,990
And what starts outas just wanting to talkleads to wantingto do more...

676
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,800
like with jody.

677
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,510
It's a fantasy.

678
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,760
It sounded like a plan,hal.

679
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,970
I have an ethical duty toprotect anyone in harm's way,and you know that.

680
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,930
And I know youwell enough to knowthat you'd want meto protect jody.

681
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,320
You don't want to doanything to hurt her.

682
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,360
But you can't control it yet.

683
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,190
I haven't done anything.

684
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,440
I haven't done anything.

685
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,580
I haven'T.

686
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,110
I know.

687
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,000
I got shot.

688
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,920
And I could get shot again.

689
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,710
I'm a cop.

690
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,130
S.W.A.T.

691
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,490
I'm a cop,addison.

692
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,790
Stop trying to class it up.

693
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,770
I'm a cop who's got a coupleof grand in credit card debt,

694
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,980
who goes go-cart racingand gets his news from yahoo!

695
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,730
Instead of"the new york times.

696
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,330
"I don't fit into your life,and I don'tfeel comfortable in it.

697
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,410
So what,you're just...

698
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:28,640
you're justgonna quit on mebecause somebodyput the idea in your headthat you're not good enough?

699
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,760
This is my life.

700
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,030
And have I ever said oncethat you are not good enough?

701
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,000
Don't quit on me.

702
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,240
Don't quit on us.

703
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,590
you did the right thing,turning hal in

704
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,910
I hope so.

705
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,390
I wanted to ask youfor a name.

706
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,720
Oh,good,good.I'm glad.

707
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,180
You know,there are therapistswho specialize in--

708
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,420
I don't want a therapist.

709
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,320
I need a lawyer.

710
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,040
I'm gonna get custody.

711
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,610
I'm gonna protect my daughter.

712
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,660
Char.

713
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:27,990
I came down here yesterdayto tell you off,tell you I hated you,and you turned it around.

714
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,970
You do this to me,and you pretend that it's okay,that things are normal,and I let you.

715
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,870
I slept with you,and I atechocolate off your naked body.

716
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,750
But...

717
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,660
this is not normal.

718
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,220
This is not okay.

719
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,360
This isn't about us.

720
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,870
I asked you to move in.

721
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,910
I was ready for youto be part of my life.

722
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,470
But clearly,I'm not part of yours.

723
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,640
I'm done,charlotte.

724
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,320
you were right.

725
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,200
I didn't call because I didn'twant you to say no.

726
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,630
I love my work,but there's a hole in my life,and I thought maybe you mightfill it,

727
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,750
so here I am.

728
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,240
And when you're here,it's great.

729
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,640
But when you're not,it's hell.

730
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,620
I don't know who I am,I have nothing to do,and I think about work,

731
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,210
and I think abouthow pissed I am thatall I can think about is work,

732
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,470
and cigarettes are aboutthe only thingthat can calm me down,

733
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,930
but if I smoke them...

734
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:44,200
I'm sorry I pushed.

735
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,140
I want this to work,peter.

736
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,540
I'm sorry I pushed back.

737
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,840
But...

738
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,300
I don't want yougiving up anything for me.

739
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,150
I won'T.

740
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,160
You've been around bizzytoo long.

741
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,060
You're becoming one of them.

742
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,130
We are them.

743
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,010
You know what I likeabout kevin?

744
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,780
He's real.

745
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,300
And he makes me happy.

746
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,730
And he doesn't carethat I'm a forbes montgomery.

747
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,840
He cares about me--addison.

748
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,490
He's not justsome meaningless flingI picked up on the beach,archer.

00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,670
He's my boyfriend.

750
