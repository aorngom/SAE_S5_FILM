1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,280
-Morning,neighbor.
-Hey.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,590
You look fancy

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,610
I have to be on live tv this morning.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,880
I thought maybe you were
dressed for something later.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,580
A special event?

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,540
I've never been on live tv before.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,870
It's actually more of a
get-together than an event,but--

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,030
I had a dream I was on
camera and I was talking and.

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,900
all of my teeth fell out.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,530
Okay,why has nobody,including
you,responded to my invitaon tonight?

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,150
I've invited everyone from work
to my home over a week ago,a week.

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,470
Addison,I live 3 feet
away from your new home.

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,410
If you have a party,I'm gonna be
there even if I don't wanna be.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,060
What a delightful acceptance.

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,610
I have to be on live tv.

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,680
Do you want me to come
with you? Moral support?

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,330
Yes. Yes.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,310
Well,all you have to do is invite me.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,560
-I would like you to come.
-And I rsvp yes.

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,910
Okay. Like any decent person would.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,870
Hey! Hands out of the mouth.

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,980
Now you been sick a lot this year,right?

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,300
Now my exam didn't turn
up anything medically.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
What else has changed this year?

25
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,220
Job,home?

26
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,220
I'm going bald.

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,980
okay.

28
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,790
See,now this is what I'm talking about in
my book-- the whole mind body connection.

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,450
Now your body is trying to talk to you,trying to get
you to pay attention with what's going on up here.

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,670
Now hair loss or no,it's the head
that's messing with the machine.

31
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,430
You think the ladies are lining up
to choose me over some guy with hair?

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,360
louis,my man,look at my head.

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,470
Bald is beautiful. Bald is sexy.

34
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,730
Virile men are bald.

35
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,850
The arm & hammer guy is bald

36
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,830
louis,you're a bald
man. Come on. Say it.

37
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm a bald man.

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,540
You are a strong,proud bald man.

39
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,960
I am a strong,proud bald man.

40
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,170
you are a strong,proud bald man.

41
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,550
I'm a strong,proud bald man.

42
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,900
One more time with fervor.

43
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,730
-Are a strong proud- - I
am a strong,proud bald man!

44
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,460
Yes! That's what I'm talking
about. Bald is beautiful.

45
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,500
hey,how was the tv thing?

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,460
he was very inspiring.

47
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,900
-I'm a fraud.
-You were inspiring.

48
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,700
Listening to the patient,the mind
body connection-- you inspired me,okay?

49
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,350
Wasn't he inspiring on tv?

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,350
The arm & hammer guy's
not bald,by the way.

51
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,180
He is,too. He's bald.

52
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,950
-Arm & hammer guy--
definitely not bald. -Yeah--

53
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,720
-hey,everybody- -
Mr. Clean's bald.

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,040
Hey,guys. I'm just trying to
get a-- a head count for tonight.

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,150
-What's tonight?
-My party.

56
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,420
Uh,is anybody coming?

57
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,820
Oops. Um.

58
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,440
-I forgot.
-Yeah.

59
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,910
-I made plans to- -
I'm there.I,uh,I rsvp'D.

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,710
hey,I'm sorry I'm late.

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,030
-Arm & hammer guy is not bald.
-I know.

62
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,880
He's just an arm.

63
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,500
and a hammer.

64
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,010
Okay,today's cases?

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,280
What's this?

66
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,090
Uh,naomi's wall of miracles.

67
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,890
This one,uh,this one here
is my favorite--jamie.

68
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,000
I mean,the mother had hardly any
eggs left,you know,borderline F.S.H.

69
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,720
She'd given up.

70
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,060
But,you know,naomi did her thing,and.

71
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,830
pow.

72
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,280
I mean,she made every baby up there.

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,980
Or,you
know,she--she helped.

74
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,880
Those are her miracles.

75
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,810
Miracles.

76
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,100
Wow. That's a beaut.

77
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,200
My first husband thought engagement
rings were too extravagant.

78
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,330
So this is my one and only.

79
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,920
And this is him. This is my stan.

80
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,510
You should get back out
there,pete. Find yourself a stan.

81
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,810
I'M. out there.

82
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,870
I'm not talking about the girls
you date. I'm talking about love.

83
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,490
I'm talking about
marriage,soul mates,like us.

84
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,660
You worry too much,sylvie.

85
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,790
Stan's been falling asleep.

86
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,510
Falling asleep?

87
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,520
Tell the doctor,stan.

88
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,600
Sometimes I just go to sleep.

89
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,460
When I'm talking to him,in
the middle of the day.

90
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,930
First time,I thought he was
dead. I almost had a heart attack.

91
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,880
I always wake up in a couple of seconds.

92
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,360
It's no big deal,but sylvie has to go
and drag me to see the wacko doctor.

93
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,380
Stan.

94
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,540
He's a little more traditional
than I am,but he'll warm to you.

95
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,360
Now before you fall asleep,do you
have any dizziness or palpitations?

96
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,800
This is a waste of time.

97
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,490
No,when he wakes up,he's good.

98
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,220
It's almost like it never happened.

99
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,860
you think.

100
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,200
there he goes.

101
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,120
Come on.

102
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,830
No signs of infection.

103
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,110
You got a little swelling.

104
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,900
What does that mean?

105
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,460
Combined with the lack of energy
and appetite,could be mononucleosis.

106
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,170
Wait,the kissing disease?

107
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,670
Have you been kissing someone?

108
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,890
Gross. No.

109
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,240
There are plenty of other
ways to contract mono.

110
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,260
I'm gonna have to take some blood
to find out,though. Sorry,dude.

111
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,180
But I can still skateboard,right?

112
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,860
No,not until you're better.

113
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,030
And until then,you get plenty of sleep.

114
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,970
no making out.

115
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,430
Like anybody'd want to kiss me anyway.

116
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,440
I don't have a lot
of domain around here.

117
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,680
I'm stepping on your domain.

118
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,320
Little bit. But can I help?

119
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,940
I need me.

120
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,050
The me file.

121
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,760
I,uh.

122
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,740
I would be one of naomi's patients.

123
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,490
Oh,okay. Yeah. Um.

124
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,820
is everything okay?

125
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,700
-lady problems?
-Just give me the file.

126
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,740
'cause I might be able to help.

127
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,770
Um,I'm like the hub
in the oceanside wheel.

128
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,330
The file. dell.

129
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,390
Are you going to this addison thing?

130
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,530
I'll go if you go?

131
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,040
You know what? There comes a
point when your life is set.

132
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,150
You know,you're done with new people.

133
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,750
I mean,honestly do i
really need a new friend?

134
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,590
No,not with me around. I
mean,I'm a lot of friend.

135
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,710
I'm like two double patties worth of friend.

136
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,700
-That's what I'm saying.
-That's what I'm saying.

137
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,670
Whoa. What? What are we hiding from?

138
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,940
it's cami.

139
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,450
Cami? The woman allan
dumped you for cami?

140
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,390
he didn't dump me.

141
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,990
He just married her
right after he left me.

142
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,780
What the hell is she doing with naomi?

143
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,370
Cami davis is a patient here?

144
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,500
You should ask naomi.

145
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,230
What is cami davis here for?

146
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,180
You should ask naomi.

147
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,550
Fine. I will.

148
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,390
Okay,freak show,um.

149
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,850
oh,my god. I'm pathetic.

150
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,360
I need to let this go.

151
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,390
I'm gonna let this go.

152
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,970
-who cares why cami is here?
-Oh,yeah. hey.

153
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,160
Did you find what you were looking for?

154
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,970
Kind of.

155
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,430
Did I mention I'm a total
whiz at the female anatomy?

156
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,990
I-I am--I am acing my midwifery
classes. I got it all up here.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,610
Oh,yeah. Keep it up there.

158
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,400
vulva.

159
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,220
Labium majus.

160
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,610
If that's flirting,you need new skills.

161
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,430
Can you run these labs for me,please?

162
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,720
Dr. Bennett? Dr. Sam bennett?

163
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,530
I'm Dr. Bennett. Whoa,okay. We got you.

164
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,580
Let's get you to a chair.

165
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,800
-Right over here.
-nice and easy.

166
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,840
Have a seat. Nice and slow.

167
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,920
There we go. Whoa.

168
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,200
Did you just walk right
out of the hospital?

169
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,430
We had to get out of there.

170
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,010
We? You and.

171
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,730
me and my baby.

172
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,120
They were trying to kill us.

176
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,500
I saw you on tv.

177
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,800
Those things you said about listening
to the patient,was that just tv crap?

178
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,870
No,I meant it.

179
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,570
Except for the arm & hammer part.

180
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,700
So you said the hospital's
trying to kill you?

181
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,470
Everything they do just makes me sicker.

182
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,080
-How far along are you?
-Five months.

183
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,790
I know I look thin,but I'm eating. I am.

184
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,640
I've always had stomach stuff,this
pain,but nobody can figure out what's wrong.

185
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,880
I'm doing what you said,Dr. Bennett.

186
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,460
I'm listening to my
body,but nobo believes me.

187
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,170
All right. Why don't you give
me your name and your hospital?

188
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,510
I'll talk to your doctor.

189
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,250
I can'T. I can't give you that.

190
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,980
You scratched your name
off your hospital bracelet?

191
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,940
She won't give us any
of her information.

192
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,410
She's afraid we're gonna send her back.

193
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,530
You're damn right,we're sending her back. I'm
gonna get dell to call all the area hospitals.

194
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,830
She came here because of sam.
She was inspired by Dr. Sam.

195
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,660
Well,then she's gonna want to go
back,because Dr. Sam is an idiot.

196
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,170
I'd like to run some tests.

197
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,110
Okay,fine. But just until we
figure out where she belongs.

198
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,500
You had to go on tv.

199
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,880
Thank you,sam.

200
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,210
-Does she seem a little- -
did you rsvp to her thing?

201
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,620
Oh. Yeah.

202
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,230
the damn floor got off balance.

203
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,240
Were you dizzy right before it happened?

204
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,890
Maybe a little.

205
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,420
What's happening to him?

206
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,010
Is he gonna have to go to the hospital?

207
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,710
Stan,I'd like to send you
downstairs and run some basic tests.

208
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,030
We'll get an E.K.G,An M.R.I.,And
see if we find anything.

209
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,470
You fix stan,hear me?

210
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,340
Like I said,he's my one and only.

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,240
Hey,I've got a 70-year-olmale
presenting with syncope.

212
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,030
These what you'd run?

213
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,580
Okay,he's hypertensive,diabetic-- could
be a T.I.A.Or an occult arrhythmia.

214
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,920
I hope not.

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,110
-Okay. Thanks.
-Yeah.

216
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,810
Oh,you should rsvp for addison's thing.

217
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,490
She's starting to get
a little squirrelly.

218
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,340
Yeah. I'm not sure.

219
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,990
-She's getting to you.
-She is not.

220
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,490
I'm not going there.

221
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,000
she's defitely getting to you.

222
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,450
So he doesn't have mono?

223
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,920
Test came back negative.

224
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,470
Oh,thank god. I'm gonna call dad.

225
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,630
You don't seem too happy.

226
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,500
You hoping for a contagious disease?

227
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,960
I knew I didn't have it.

228
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,950
I know what's wrong with me.

229
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,100
What's that?

230
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,830
I'm in love.

231
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,490
And what,is that
awful? It's great,right?

232
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,820
Not when the person you're in
love with doesn't like you back.

233
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,410
-Who is she?
-Someone at the skate park.

234
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,540
-Does she know you like her?
-no.

235
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,780
If I tell,it'll change everying.

236
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,500
I don't know,man. Don't
you gotta go for it?

237
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,150
I mean,ask her to do
something or hang out or.

238
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,760
yeah,I thought about it,but I
don't want to mess everything up.

239
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,670
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

240
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,450
I mean,I know. I've. I gotta.

241
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,050
what?

242
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,560
this girl I like,I been trying to get up
the nerve to say something for a long time.

243
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,890
I mean,a long time.

244
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,930
-For real?
-Yeah.

245
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,670
I'll tell you what,a pact--
I'll do it if you do it.

246
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,750
We'll spill our guts,see what happens.

247
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,750
Pact.

248
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,970
Boom.

249
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,790
Violet?

250
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,730
Why is cami davis here? I
mean,why was she seeing you?

251
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,770
-Violet.
-I know.

252
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,650
But why was she here?

253
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,380
-Do you really want to ow?
-Okay,don't tell me.

254
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,540
I will tell you if you
really want to know.

255
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,500
No. No matter what I say,no
matter what I do,don't tell me.

256
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,240
Because it's not smart and it's
unhealthy,and I should mind my own business.

257
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,060
-Swear you won't tell me.
-I swear.

258
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,100
Okay.

259
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,490
You okay?

260
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,480
What if.

261
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,590
stan doesn't really want to marry me?

262
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,980
-Why would you think that?
-Just hear me out.

263
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,820
These attacks,what if they're caused by
stress about getting hitched to me for life?

264
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,290
Sylvie,there are a lot
of possible reasons this--

265
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,390
they started right after he proposed.

266
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,580
Hey,I just checked on our jane doe.

267
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,380
What are you doing
checking on my patient?

268
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,900
-This is not midwiff school-
- she's having contractions.

269
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,070
Is the baby okay?

270
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,920
The dication I'm giving you
will stop the contractions.

271
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,980
Just focus on your breathing.

272
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,350
Okay. Breathing.

273
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,770
Here we go.

274
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,980
The fetal weight is low for five months.

275
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:53,000
But. the heartbeat
is present and strong.

276
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,480
for now.

277
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,840
Nobody thought I could get pregnant.

278
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,100
Not my doctors,my boyfriend.

279
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,820
My body's been messed up my whole life.

280
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,930
This baby.

281
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,710
it's a miracle.

282
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,560
total clich? right?

283
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,160
No.

284
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,080
No,I get it.

285
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,350
I'll do whatever you say.

286
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,880
I can't lose my baby.

287
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,310
I hear you have something of ours.

288
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,060
She came here on her own,and we called you and every other
hospital in the city to try and find out where she came from.

289
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,350
You know our jane doe?

290
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,680
Her name's rebecca hobart,and I'm going to arrange
transportation bacto st.Ambrose immediately.

291
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,010
Rebecca wants to stay
here. We are keeping her.

292
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,360
Is that so? I think your guest
left out more than her name.

293
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,030
What do you mean?

294
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,410
Rebecca hobart's a 5150.

295
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,820
-She's on involuntary hold?
-That's right.

296
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,230
The patient you are aiding and
abetting,she's straight out of the psych ward.

297
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,840
she doesn't seem crazy to me.

298
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,420
She's very convincing,like
all good munchausen patients.

299
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,990
-Wait,munchausen?
-She's making herself sick for the attention?

300
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,670
She's been in and out of
psych wards since she was 18.

301
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,730
Joint pain,stomach problems-- all kinds of
vague symptoms,but her tests don't back her up.

302
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,170
Maybe,but she wants to be treated here.

303
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,940
Her mother is her medical guardian.

304
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,660
Under state law,if her mother wants her
back at the hospital,rebecca goes back.

305
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,830
Agreed. She goes.

306
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,290
She's having contractions. You want to move
her now,make her lose the baby,be my guest.

307
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,120
Why would you light a fire under
charlotte king's ass for a 5150?

308
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,380
I oughta 5150
your skinny--

309
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,950
rebecca is not-- have you even
talked to her? I believe her.

310
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,290
Munchausen. These people are
exceptional,spectacular liars.

311
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,820
You two,maybe we
couldtake it down a notch.

312
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,300
People get angry,sam. It's normal.

313
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,560
-Sam is just trying to help.
-Sam doesn't like conflict.

314
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,980
Whoa,ladies. Off topic.

315
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,250
I think violet should do
a psych eval on rebecca.

316
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,650
The woman has a
long,documented history--

317
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,460
sam,do you agree with me?

318
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,660
Your next patient is in room two.

319
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,240
Bless you,dell.

320
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,310
Addison. Addison.

321
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,930
Why are you fighting
so hard for this woman?

322
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,270
Since when do you give up on people?

323
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm just trying to look out for you.

324
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,180
Well,don'T.

325
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,850
Hey,addison. I'm coming,okay?

326
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,160
Don't tell me this is because
I forgot to rsvp to your party.

327
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,680
Can I ask violet to do
the psych eval or not?

328
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,970
Fine.

329
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,850
I don't need another shrink.

330
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,780
This is exactly why I didn't
tell you about the psych ward.

331
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,240
I need you to be off your feet.
Your contractions just eased up.

332
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,330
If no one can figure out what's wrong with me,they'll keep
saying I'm crazy,and they'll take my baby away from me.

333
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,270
We are gonna do everything we
can to keep that from happening.

334
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,880
But we need you to help us. Now come on.

335
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,870
Sit down.

336
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,460
Talk.

337
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,720
My first marriage was lonely. You know.

338
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,410
I can't get stuck in another marriage
with a man who doesn't love me.

339
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,390
You really believe st doesn't love you?

340
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,300
Well,I'm not.

341
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,280
don't know.

342
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,980
he could just be using
me for the sex,I suppose.

343
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,350
The--the
sex?

344
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,410
We have damn good sex.

345
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,630
Sylvie,your first marriage.

346
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,950
it has nothing to do with stan.

347
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,240
You know you can't let the
past hang over you like that.

348
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,120
Neither can you,kid.

349
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,760
You're not as screwed up as I am.

350
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,930
You deserve better.

351
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,720
But beonest,pete.

352
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,140
The timing of these
spells and the proposal.

353
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,060
pretty damning,isn't it?

354
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,990
Okay,I know I seem like this guy
that dates women from the internet--

355
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,290
okay,I am this guy that dates women from
the internet,but that's only because.

356
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,680
No,scrap that. No good. Okay.

357
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,460
Um,you're beautiful
and you're funny and.

358
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,520
well,you're annoying,but in a way that's
endearing when it's not driving me crazy.

359
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,920
And the point
is-- the point is.

360
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,750
I love you.

361
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,470
I'm in love with you
and have been for. ever.

362
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,480
I just--I
love you.

363
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,040
I love you.

364
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,400
Were you just saying I
love you to your genitals?

365
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,280
N-no.

366
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,710
There's-- I want to talk to
you,tell you something that I,uh.

367
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,700
what are you doing?

368
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,950
uh,that-- that's
cami's urine sample.

369
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,120
-You're spying on cami's pee?
-No.

370
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,870
this--this,um,this cami thing
is eating at me,all right?

371
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,420
It's really all I can think about.

372
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,560
So if I were a patient,what
would I tell myself?

373
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,520
Hopefully that talking to yourself like
you're two people is a sign of insanity.

374
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:45,780
No,I would tell my patient that they need to figure out a way
to move on,to get some information so that they can move on.

375
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,390
And that relates to
cami's bodily fluids how?

376
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,720
What if cami's pregnant?

377
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:58,980
I mean,if I know that cami is pregnant,that would be big step
in really solidifying that it's over between me and allan.

378
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,320
Okay,do not steal that urine.

379
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,360
Right. Okay.

380
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,900
All right. What did you
want to talk to me about?

381
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,800
It's,uh,it would be better later.

382
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,800
No,no,just tell me now. I need to
focus on something other than cami.

383
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:20,160
It's just,you know,I made this pact,and
there are some feelings that,uh,uh.

384
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,170
violet!

385
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,310
Step away from the pee pee.

386
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,850
Right. Right.

387
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,560
Right. I am removing
myself from the situation.

388
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,270
That went perfectly.

389
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,370
from what I could see,rebecca doesn't
totally fit the munchausen profile.

390
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,070
Do you think I'm
personalizing this case?

391
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,910
Like maybe I need to believe
in the happy miracle baby?

392
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,720
Well,instinct's a bitch,right?

393
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,180
You only know if you can
trust it after the fact.

394
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,790
Okay,look. you and I don't
know each other that well.

395
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,450
We're not friends,but.

396
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,350
you could.

397
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,340
share.

398
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,020
I guess.

399
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,540
No. N-no,no,no.
I-I don't wanna--

400
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,350
yes,yes.Let'S.

401
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,400
-share.
-Yeah?

402
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,750
Oh,it's just.

403
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,490
I have fertility issues.

404
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,880
And naomi--
I don't know.

405
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,710
And I'm all cranky about it,and
I have a right to be,a right.

406
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,840
I'm right.

407
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,790
and all. I know. You know?

408
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,130
Uh,the sharing,it'S.

409
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,910
-it's--it's not
so good. -No.

410
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,860
but,hey,I don't even want kids.

411
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,330
But the idea of my ex's new wife
having one. it's making me nuts.

412
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,920
No,it's better to
know,just get through it.

413
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,850
well,she's seeing naomi.
Naomi won't tell me anything.

414
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,570
Let me tell you something about naomi.

415
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,400
Don't let her tell you what
you can and cannot know.

416
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,760
In fact.

417
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,620
go look at the file yoself.

418
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,570
Yeah.

419
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:08,100
I mean,you just wait until dell is away
from his domain,and then you go for it.

420
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,500
You go get your answers.

421
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,650
You're a little bit of
a crazy,you know that?

422
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,810
-Yeah.
-I like you.

423
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,250
Michael,what happened?

424
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,760
Why did you tell me to do that?

425
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,370
Do what?

426
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,750
I knew I shouldn't have
said anything. I knew it.

427
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,370
Michael,who did this to you?

428
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,100
-Brian.
-Okay,who's brian?

429
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,050
He's the one I asked out.

430
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,350
the one I love.

431
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,220
  N you imagine being 10 and
already knowing who you are?

432
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,350
Some kids know. They just know.

433
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,930
This poor guy,he--he came out,and he got his
heart broken and his ass kicked all in one day.

434
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,180
I gotta do something.

435
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,680
You--you should do
what you're doing.

436
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,490
You gotta listen,stay
on top of the situation.

437
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,870
Kids like michael are at a high
risk for self-destructive behavior.

438
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,590
I know,but that's usually
when they're teenagers.

439
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,620
You don't think he
might hurt himself now?

440
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,330
It happens.

441
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,070
Okay.

442
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,700
Okay. I'll talk to his parents. Thanks.

443
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,980
Hello,closure.

444
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:37,980
I'm having them run an echo to check for heart abnormalities
and tests to rule out artery obstructions and seizure activities.

445
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,150
All these tests.

446
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,790
you're not doing this
just for me,are you?

447
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,590
I know i'm pushing
for an answer,ut--

448
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,160
as much as I adore
you,I wouldn't do that.

449
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,760
I'm ing it for stan,the
guy that called me a wacko.

450
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,640
Pete.

451
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Oh,um,sylvie,this is
addison. She's our G.Y.N.

452
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,580
You're new.

453
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,880
How do you?

454
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Uh,pete,uh,if you get a moment later,I could use you
for,um,a consult on my patient's nutritional status.

455
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,070
At whi time,I'd also
like an rsvp to my party.

456
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,990
Okay.

457
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,280
Or you could rsvp now.

458
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,870
I'll wait.

459
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,620
Or I could uninvite you.

460
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,480
you like that one.

461
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,170
Don't do that. Don't mother me.

462
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,710
She reminds me a little of your anna.

463
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,930
My wife was nothing like addison.

464
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,750
Well,there are
similarities,but addison is.

465
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,740
tougher.

466
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,750
Addison doesn't need.

467
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,580
she--she
doesn't need.

468
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,060
Which makes her seem perfect for you.

469
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,760
Can we focus on stan?

470
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,590
This is cami davis' file.

471
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,500
Just.

472
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,680
I gotta know. Tell me.

473
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,820
No. I told you I wouldn'T.

474
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,120
I know,but now I'm
telling you to tell me.

475
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,390
No. I swore I wouldn'T.

476
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,740
Well,just give me the file,and then
you won't have to tell me anything.

477
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,310
Don't ma me hurt you.

478
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,180
You're faking out a little.

479
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,010
I am freaking out a little.

480
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,620
Michael's missing?

481
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,400
We got home,and he went to lie down.
But when I checked on him,he was gone.

482
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,770
We've been all over.

483
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,570
I thought maybe he went to settle
the score with those kids who hit him.

484
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,090
I've left him a dozen
messages. I texted him.

485
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,510
He usually calls right back.

486
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,410
Do we call the police?

487
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,980
No,you know what? Let me
check the school again first.

488
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,720
I'll check the skate park.

489
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,210
Are you sure? You've got patients.

490
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,790
Let'S. let's just find michael.

491
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,440
Come here. I felt the baby moving.

492
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,350
This is mrS.Hobart,rebecca's mother.

493
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,600
Get her out of here.

494
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,030
Mrs.Hobart,she's had a rough day.

495
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,710
You have no idea.

496
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,220
You want to hear how rebecca operates?

497
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,320
Shut up,mom!

498
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,420
-All right,let's just take this slow.
-She starves.

499
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,310
Or she eats god knows what to get sick.

500
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,280
Then she dupes another hospital into believing
her until they figure out what's really going on.

501
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,560
Get her out of here!

502
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,110
That's enough.

503
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,370
Okay,remember our breathing?

504
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,220
Good. Good.

505
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,090
What? Wh-what is it?

506
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,620
These labs show us you
haven't eaten in days.

507
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,320
She lied.

508
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,010
She has been making herself sk.

509
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,640
What a shock.

510
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,560
No,no. I did eat.

511
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:15,210
I'll make sure her contractions
are gone,then she's yours.

512
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,360
I th-- I thought
you believed me.

513
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,300
I did.

514
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,220
Oh,god.

515
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,320
okay,I have stan's labs.

516
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,960
M.R.I.Looks good.

517
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,330
The blood levels are good.

518
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,380
All the tests check out okay.

519
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,630
Thank god.

520
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,440
Right?

521
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:52,050
Sylvie,you don't know-- we don't know
that this has anything to do with you.

522
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,330
Then find me another answer.

523
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,340
So much for being inspired,huh?

524
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,700
Oh,crap. Addison,wait.

525
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,550
Wait up.

526
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,810
Uh,we need a little bit
more time with your daughter.

527
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,500
Sam.

528
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,220
Dr.
Bennett,this is--

529
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,000
I know that you've been through hell,and
maybe your daughter is a master manipulator.

530
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:44,010
But,uh,she risked a lot to come here
because she thought we were different.

531
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,400
and better.

532
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,060
And I believe we are.

533
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,960
We can figure out what's
wrong with your daughter.

534
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,160
We just need a little bit more ti.

535
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,360
Do you
honestly think--

536
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,170
sam,please don't indulge this

537
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,740
-
- we just want to help your daughter. That's all we ask.

538
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,940
Okay.

539
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,100
One hour.

540
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,650
You get one more hour.

541
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,330
brian.

542
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,340
Do you know where michael is?

543
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,770
Hey,hey,whoa.

544
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,360
Where's michael?

545
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,730
I don't know. He's a freak.

546
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,800
-He's your friend.
-No,he's not.

547
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,240
I thought he was until
he said all that stuff.

548
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,020
So you hit him just
'cause he said something?

549
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,080
He asked me out on a date.

550
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,600
And I'll bet he wishes
he didn't,but he did.

551
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,570
So he's gonna have to
live with that. Can you?

552
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,930
You can't just go around
saying stuff like that,not here.

553
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,940
Brian,michael's missing.
I need to find him.

554
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,320
-He's what?
-He's missing.

555
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,790
Do you know where he could be?

556
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,570
No.

557
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,620
Hey,brian,come on.

558
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,490
There's a parking lot where we hang at.

559
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,720
There's a cool ramp that we skate on.

560
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,140
Maybe he'd go there.

561
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,140
I didn't mean to hit him so hard.

562
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,030
-Tell him I'm sorry. Okay?

563
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:14,820
Sam,I appreciate what you're trying to
do,but what can we possibly find in an hour?

564
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,020
Why did you make promises to
this woman you know we can't keep?

565
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,640
Because maybe we can. Okay?

566
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,290
Now is there anything else we need to cover
before we can get our heads in the game?

567
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,890
I-I have a need.

568
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,680
I need to know why cami is here.

569
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,150
-Look,you made me promise
not to tell y -- spill.

570
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,620
it's a bladder infection.
from having too much sex.

571
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,560
Cami and allan have
been having a lot of sex.

572
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,300
Oh,good. It's not cancer.

573
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,980
I was just afraid it might be cancer.

574
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,270
Well,it isn'T. Good. Done.

575
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,950
Now rebecca.

576
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,860
michael.

577
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,530
I was gonna run away.

578
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,810
but I don't have any money.

579
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,090
Plus,running away is lame.

580
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,050
So then I thought I'd just jump.

581
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,240
Michael.

582
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,110
and jumping's evenamer
than running away.

583
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,000
I talked to brian.

584
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,700
He feels pretty bad.

585
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,340
Yeah,well.

586
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,620
-he doesn't love me bac 
-no.

587
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,650
Look,some kids are cool with it.

588
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,890
Yeah,but I don't want
to hang out with them.

589
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,530
I want to hang out with brian.

590
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,190
I wish I was somebody se.

591
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,990
What are you talking about?

592
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,670
I wish I was you.

593
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,280
-you're old.
-Yeah,I am old. I am elderly.

594
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,780
But you're young.

595
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:21,460
You will have a lot of chances to fall in love
again with someone who's really into you big-time.

596
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,400
Me,being so old an all,right,I'm done.

597
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:30,160
This one,this girl,this
love,that's probably it for me.

598
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,230
And I didn't have the guts to tell her
how I felt. I looked at her,and I just.

599
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,850
I couldn'T.

600
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,330
You told brian.

601
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,810
And--and you're a
lot braver than I am.

602
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,570
Damn.

603
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,170
You little punk.

604
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,170
I,uh,i don't want to go home yet.

605
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,690
We can hang out for a while.

606
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:02,370
And then we need to tell
your folks you're okay.

607
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,910
I don't ow. don'T.

608
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,920
nothing's jumping out at me.

609
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,810
You're the one who believed. Why?

610
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,510
Because I thought she
was telling the truth.

611
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:31,350
Ignore the files,ignore all the preconceptions,and let's look
at the facts as if everything rebecca has told us is the truth.

612
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,270
Which would mean that the hospital
missed something right from the start.

613
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,470
And then she's saddled
with a psych diagnosis.

614
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:42,680
So the doctors would assume that her worsening symptoms
 are just signs of increasingly destructive behavior.

615
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,910
But that could also indicate a
worsening of her real physical condition.

616
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,890
So then what's the missing
illness that started it all?

617
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,450
Well,one that--that makes her feel
stomach spasms and pain after she eats.

618
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,110
Associated with occasional
joint pains and fevers.

619
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,780
and comes and goes in cycles.

620
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,550
Did they ever get a G.I. Camera study?

621
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,930
-I didn't see it in her records.
-How would that help?

622
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:07,450
The camera could get to places in rebecca's
body that previous workups couldn't have seen.

623
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,300
It's a relatively new procedure.

624
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,100
And if she had an occult
form of an autoimmune disease.

625
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,520
affecting deep sectionsof the intestine.

626
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,790
it would flare up during times
of stress,like during pregnancy.

627
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,500
Which means she wouldn't
absorb nutrients properly.

628
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,960
And explains why she says she's
eating,but the labs say she's not.

629
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,770
So they could've missed it?

630
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,590
They definitely could've missed it.

631
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,030
All right.

632
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,710
Look,I was playing tug-of-war with the wheelchair,okay?
But charlotte is stronger than she looks.

633
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,200
They took her back to the hospital?

634
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,210
Rebecca's gone?

635
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,440
She's gone.

636
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,630
Do you know what this girl's mother will say if she
finds out I ran another test without her consent?

637
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,460
What will she say if the test could
save rebecca's life,hers and the baby's?

638
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,670
Y'all really want me
to get fired,don't you?

639
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:56,480
If youeed a win to get the hospital off your back
for rebecca walking,take full credit for the fix.

640
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,500
I don't care about the credit.

641
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,310
Okay,I do care about the credit.

642
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,600
But I care about helping this girl more.

643
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,060
We'll set up for the camera study.

644
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,160
All right.

645
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,470
Something sylvie said has me wondering.

646
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,830
I spoke to you in confidence.

647
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,470
-
-Sylvie,I think I might know what's wrong with stan.

648
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,400
You do?

649
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,050
You two have been having a lot of sex?

650
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,560
-A gentleman doesn't
discuss- - yes.

651
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,800
Different positions?

652
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,730
I'm not going to stand here and get
the third degree from this pervert.

653
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,510
Mostly one position. Because
of his sciatica,I'm on top.

654
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,660
Show me.

655
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,290
Aw,for the love
of-- ah,sylvie.

656
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,860
He holds me here,supporting
me on account of my hip.

657
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,940
Okay. Good.

658
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,960
This is where I draw the line.

659
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,750
stan,you okay?

660
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,580
Does that happen every
time you press there?

661
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:10,470
All that repetitive motion formed a trigger
point in the muscle,'causing a painless migraine.

662
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,820
You move the wrong way
and boom,you pass out.

663
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,110
Painless migraines?

664
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,780
You get all the neurological signs,but
you never develop the headache.

665
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,890
And that's all it was?

666
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,260
A few sessions of my intensive
muscle therapy should do it.

667
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:26,810
And we can treat that sciatica so
that,uh,you can try some new sexual positiS.

668
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,190
he loves me.

669
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,500
-I told you.
-Thank you,pete.

670
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,470
You don't know how much this means.

671
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,420
Or.yes,you do.

672
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,390
Why are you here in my practice,throwing
your too-much-sex-itis in my face?

673
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,310
You know about that?

674
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,600
There are a million other doctors
in L.A. You could've gone to.

675
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,950
Why did you come to the
place where I worked?

676
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,840
Just to mess with me?

677
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,090
I just needed to pick up
the results of my labs.

678
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,570
That still doesn't answer
the question. Why here?

679
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,870
He talks about you-- mean,all
of you,how good you are.

680
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,600
I wanted the best.

681
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,380
You're here to scope me out.

682
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,230
I shouldn't have come. I'm sorry.

683
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,560
Cami.

684
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,900
cami.

685
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,350
you don't need to worry.

686
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,850
Yore,like,2 years old.

687
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,330
You're pretty.

688
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,690
You're the.

689
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,970
barbie dream house.

690
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,240
I am not your competition. Trust me.

691
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,410
I wouldn't be so sure.

692
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,250
We've got the results.

693
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,170
And?

694
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,020
You have crohn's disease.

695
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,620
You were eating,and
it was making you sick.

696
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,330
So you believe me?

697
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,600
I believe you.

698
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,990
You believe me. you believe me.

699
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,470
The chances of your baby
being healthy are very good.

700
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,920
I'm sorry.

701
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,570
How did it go? How's rebecca?

702
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,530
Dr. Sam hasn't lost his touch.

703
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,540
All right.

704
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,790
You? I'm the one.

705
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,980
fine. Dr. Sam is a god.

706
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,520
today.

707
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,540
Do you want me wine?

708
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,460
You guys are hanging out here?

709
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,590
Yeah,we have red and,uh,I can
get some white from the fridge.

710
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,870
You know,no. Wait.No.

711
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,510
I got food.

712
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,600
I bought a barbecue grill.

713
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,940
I dragged bags of ice across the beach.

714
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:45,580
And I invited all of you people,and none of you even
bothered to rsvp because your lives are so busy and great,

715
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,010
and yet here you sit drinking
wine in the lobby like animals.

716
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,290
We're coming.

717
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:56,760
Yeah,we were waiting for you guys
to get back from the hospital and.

718
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,970
oh.

719
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,420
I. well,then.

720
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,020
There is no way she's right. He
is not still thinking about me.

721
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,670
Of course he's still
thinking about you,you idiot.

722
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,560
You don't have to be mean about it.

723
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,190
You're hard to forget.

724
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,590
cooper.

725
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,700
What? I'm just saying you are very
loud,you have a lot of curly hair.

726
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,150
boys.

727
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,480
Okay,you have been
pissed off at me all day.

728
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,880
I was wrong about
rebecca. I'M. I'm sorry.

729
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,720
Why did you tell me there was no
hope for me to ever have a baby?

730
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,510
because.

731
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,380
I have two eggs left.

732
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,030
Two.

733
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,330
I looked at my chart.

734
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,340
Why didn't you tell me that
my F.S.H.Was borderline?

735
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,570
It means there's still a chance.

736
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,930
I just--I didn't want you hanging on to
something that's probably never gonna happen.

737
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,370
Okay,you need to stop protecting me.

738
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:16,930
You don't get to decide
what I hang on to.

739
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,880
What,and sam. with is mind body thing.

740
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,390
what,he inspired you to
look again,ask for more?

741
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,920
Yeah,that's his thing now.

742
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,800
Yeah.

743
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,960
Itade me feel like.

744
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,160
there's hope.

745
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,970
like I'm not alone.

746
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,010
You think you're alone.

747
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,100
Look around.

748
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,560
hey,what y'all talking about?

749
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,710
I'm a strong,proud bald man.

750
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,000
it really is just an arm and a hammer.

751
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,170
Let it go,sam.
