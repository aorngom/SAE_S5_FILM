1
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,299
so, um... i was thinking

2
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,867
of new ways to generate
business for the practice.

3
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,549
how about... billboards?

4
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,182
right?

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,567
what? bad idea?

6
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,249
what?

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,249
i don't know, sam. i mean, i cut
expenses, right? i cut expenses.

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,633
even still,
profit's only up 2%.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,499
so, i mean, the consults
should help. don't you think?

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,033
yeah.
right?

11
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:49,999
yeah, they should.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,300
this is a lot of pressure,

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,500
a lot of pressure.

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,820
hey.

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,967
what are you doing here
so early?

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,966
running.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,234
you're running like you're
trying to get someplace.

18
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,529
naomi still isn't talking
to me outside of work.

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,064
and that makes you run?

20
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:25,797
i'm her... friend.

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,000
friends are supposed to talk.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,167
so yeah, i'm here, running,

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,999
avoiding the office.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,966
i had to force myself
to go in.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,799
yeah,
the office has been odd.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,733
it's kinda like we're
going through a divorce,

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,533
only we have to
keep living together.

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,699
you running
to get somewhere?

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,433
no, i...

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,834
do you think i'm old?

31
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,483
tell me you did not
sleep with that temp.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,899
(ighou.u hey, it seemed like
thod t ta good idea at the time.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,066
yeah, well, at least
you're getting out there.

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,079
me? two dates seems to
be my limit. the cop?

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,880
he didn't call after
our last date, so i called him,

36
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:12,047
left him a message,

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,646
a horrifying,
embarrassing message.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,413
probably scared him off.
not that i care.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,049
you know, i'm...

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,150
glad to not be talking
to him.

41
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,999
well, at least he didn't
tell you you were old.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
although... she did say
that i was great.

43
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,217
i'm fine.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,149
you ever feel like
you're not pulling your weight,

45
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,349
everybody at work is talking
about you behind your back?

46
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,750
how the hell
did my perfectly arched back

47
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,183
make you think of that?

48
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,429
um... loofah to scrub,
scrub to surgery,

49
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,963
surgery to patients,
patients to my lack there of.

50
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,929
we're drowning. i'm drowning.
i am making us drown.

51
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,359
and when the raft
is sinking,

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,649
who do you think
gets thrown overboard first?

53
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,149
oh, the pediatrician
who can't bring in the bucks.

54
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,917
stay here and drown.
i'm going to work.

55
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,966
dell?
what are you doing here?

56
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,765
i work here.
wow.

57
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,099
gotta pay the rent...
eat and-

58
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,700
what are you doing here? uh,
where's-where's the patient?

59
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,400
i, uh, am the patient. i-
i hurt my knee. it's- okay.

60
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:28,867
it's not... just, uh... you didn't want
to get this patched up at the office?

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,401
well, you know,
well, it's just a silly-

62
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,999
it's just-
they're very busy there.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,199
you know, it's great. it's great
that you're here, you know?

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,533
hospitals are great.
it used to be my happy place.

65
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,246
how's, uh, how's everyone?
you mean how's naomi?

66
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,749
she misses you.
montgomery.

67
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,699
so you're good?

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,733
yeah.
dell works here.

69
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,514
who?
blond, receptionist.

70
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,066
he was the talking human

71
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,999
who greeted you
when you came to the practice.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,699
never mind. i just had a
surgeon called away last-minute.

73
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,649
patient needs a-a myomectomy.
you interested? can't.

74
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,982
got a whole fun-filled day
back at the ranch.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,149
come on, montgomery.
you love surgery.

76
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,029
it's messy and bloody,
and you get to save lives,

77
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,431
not to mention the coin.

78
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,000
i'll give you
your own o.r. for a day.

79
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,549
no. no.

80
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,383
i... am off to work...

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,466
fun-filled work.

82
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,040
here you go.
good luck to you. okay.

83
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,318
hey.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,549
it took you 45 minutes
to write that prescription.

85
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,651
consults are supposed to take
15 minutes max.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,049
you're a stalker, sam.

87
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,416
15 minutes, $180, 4 consults
an hour, $720 each hour.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,149
do i look like
a money machine?

89
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,999
you look like you could be
working a lot faster.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,466
i agreed to do consults. i did
not agree to do malpractice.

91
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:45,129
and i'm not gonna write
a prescription

92
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,164
every time someone's doctor
or therapist

93
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,159
says they need prozac.

94
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,392
i need to do a history
- do the history, all right? just do it in 15 minutes.

95
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,083
did someone shove rocks

96
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,819
down his pants
on the playground?

97
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,587
he-he's compensating-
all this bossiness.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,134
i liked him better
when you were in charge.

99
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,033
i'm sleeping with him.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,699
you're-
sleeping with the enemy.

101
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,933
so let me get this straight-
he went behind my back

102
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,299
took my job, made me feel like crap
- and now you're sleeping with him.

103
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,732
yeah. what's wrong with me?

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,901
w- what's wrong with you?

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,901
uh... you're-you're-
you're a traitor,

106
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,767
and you are letting him
run all over you

107
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,249
and change everything
about this place-

108
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,999
he sits there

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,966
and he asks me questions
about the practice,

110
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,816
like what should he do,
as if these aren't things

111
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,116
that i hadn't thought of when i was running
it. he's using you as a sounding board?

112
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,199
i can't stand it
and-and...

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,601
dell's gone and addison...

114
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:44,300
i have no one to talk to.

115
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,049
i- i-i know it's wrong,

116
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,050
it's just that sam
has this way of-

117
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:50,999
you know what?
i don't want to know.

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,533
no, no, no, no, no. it's just that he really
- i don't want to hear it.

119
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:56,500
i- i'm just saying that he-
well, don't say.

120
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,499
<i>that's what we do.</i>

121
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,934
<i>we're a family,
and this practice is our home.</i>

122
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,999
<i>the life we save
could be your child's...</i>

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,649
<i>your wife's...
your husband's.</i>

124
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,999
<i>at oceanside wellness,</i>

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,399
<i>our family
takes care of your family.</i>

126
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:12,033
morning.
sorry. not in the mood.

127
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,699
hey, nal.

128
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,199
hey, i-i saw dell today.

129
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,079
he's working at, uh,
st. ambrose.

130
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,281
dell's working
at st. ambrose?

131
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,349
coop. hey. morning.

132
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,284
yeah, not now. can't talk.

133
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,899
you're still talking to me,
right?

134
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,529
no time.
no money, no time.

135
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,399
i'm gonna go do a surgery.
surgery brings income.

136
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,800
it is messy and bloody

137
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,599
and a whole lot more pleasant
than being around here.

138
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,034
okay. thanks.

139
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,251
okay. thanks.

140
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,999
morning.
how are you, addison?

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,200
i'm great. and you?

142
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,100
how are you, mr. scrub cap?

143
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,299
hi.

144
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,866
you having a tough time?

145
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,049
i hate
this time of year-

146
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,999
brush fire season.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,934
everyone's a little on edge.

148
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,999
panic attacks again?

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,366
no. no blackouts,
no nightmares.

150
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,684
mostly i'm handling it good.

151
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,799
i was out
at the 1,500-acre burn

152
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,249
in santa cruz last month.

153
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,999
everyone made it out, but it was a lot like
- malibu.

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,466
yeah, i saw the news.

155
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,600
you should be proud of yourself
for making it through, though.

156
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,267
post-traumatic stress
takes some people years.

157
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,299
yeah, well, all that stuff
you gave me-

158
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,634
herbs, exercises,
acupuncture-

159
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,115
it helped, but the stress
started creeping up on me,

160
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,849
every time i saw my men
go into the fire.

161
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,549
but you got through it.

162
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,683
i did, because i found
something else to...

163
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,549
help me cope.

164
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,084
so what's the problem?

165
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,616
i'm wearing bras...

166
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,784
panties now.

167
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,150
i need you to cure me.

168
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,699
addison.

169
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,133
oh, hey. it's you.

170
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,301
s.w.a.t. guy.

171
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,584
yeah, hey, hey.

172
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:18,986
uh, listen,
about that message i left...

173
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,999
yeah,
that was, um-

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,099
humiliating.

175
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,533
no, i-i liked it.

176
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,517
yeah. oh, god, well...
that explains a lot.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,967
you torture women to the point
of them calling you

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,449
and leaving horrifying messages
because you like it.

179
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,549
you're... you're sick.

180
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,229
yeah, i'm sorry.
i've been working like a dog.

181
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,230
i get on a case and...
i promise to do better.

182
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,649
i came to woo.

183
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,549
woo?
i got sprinkles.

184
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,617
this is you, wooing?
this is me being charmed

185
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,567
by your rambling
and incoherent message...

186
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,399
and asking you to lunch.

187
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,533
yeah.
i'm-i'm off to surgery.

188
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,099
don't write me off.

189
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,712
get to know me.

190
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,899
okay, uh, your doctor
sent me over your file.

191
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,534
you've been
having trouble sleeping?

192
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,299
on a good night,
i get four hours.

193
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,000
i figured sleeping pills
might help.

194
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,683
any idea of what's
preventing you from sleeping?

195
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,249
two jobs, past due bills,
a teenage son...

196
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,550
oh, a teenager. that will
do it right there, huh?

197
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,799
and how long has this been
going on, the insomnia?

198
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,767
uh, since my husband died
last year.

199
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,599
but lately, it's worse.

200
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,159
anything changed?

201
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,860
aren't you just supposed
to write a prescription?

202
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,867
sure.

203
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,999
i think it's important
to understand

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,833
what's behind the insomnia,

205
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,900
to talk about it.

206
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,549
i, uh...

207
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,999
you know, i, um,

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,749
i really-
i just need to sleep.

209
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,483
linda, the-the medication
will help,

210
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,933
but whatever's keeping you
from sleeping,

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,079
it's not
gonna take that away.

212
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,247
talk to me.
see if i can help.

213
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,999
i'm afraid of him.

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,801
afraid of whom?

215
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,549
my son.

216
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,783
i think he's a sociopath.

217
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,184
he killed our dog.

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,967
i just-
i found it in the garage.

222
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,519
he was wrapped in a blanket,
and i think his neck was broken.

223
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,153
and it was just a little beagle. why do you
think jesse would do something like that?

224
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,349
i don't know.
did you ask him?

225
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,619
yes, and he just looked at me.
he gave me this funny look.

226
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,999
but he's the only one who had access to the garage.
is he ever violent? have you ever seen this before?

227
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,234
no. see, that's the thing.
he was so...

228
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,749
but when
his father died, he changed.

229
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,716
he got, um, cold.

230
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,699
like he...
he doesn't react.

231
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,799
he doesn't laugh.
he doesn't cry.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,501
he just has this cold,
hard stare,

233
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,767
and i-it just...

234
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,049
you know, he's my own son,
and i can't-

235
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,250
everyone has their own way
of responding to grief.

236
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,150
it's not grief.

237
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,099
i- i just need to sleep.

238
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,999
i'd like to talk to him.

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,766
no. i-i really want
those pills.

240
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,933
linda, you don't need the pills.
you need some help.

241
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,850
let me help.

242
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,600
fishing, the boat,

243
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,600
the sun on the water...

244
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,499
if any of my guys find out,

245
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,434
it's gonna be
the end of me, done.

246
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,049
keep trying to relax.
focus on fishing.

247
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,917
it doesn't work anymore.
i need the panties and bra.

248
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,899
how did this start, frank?

249
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,200
it was just knee-highs
around the house at first.

250
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,317
and then i got my hands
on a mail order catalog,

251
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,899
and... pages and pages
of pretty little things-

252
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,568
lace bras...

253
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,517
silk panties...

254
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
garters.

255
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,779
i see what you mean.

256
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,767
i have to live with these guys
24 hours at a time.

257
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,149
i almost got caught
twice already.

258
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,150
if they find out...

259
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,767
my credibility...

260
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,899
they won't trust me.

261
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,299
they won't listen.

262
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,199
and if i have to look
at a man's family

263
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,399
and tell them he's not
coming home because-

264
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,367
cross-dressing could go
to something deeper,

265
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,549
something a therapist
could help with.

266
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,699
no.
i can't tell anybody else.

267
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,467
frank, i'm-
please.

268
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,399
look, i trust you.
you helped me before.

269
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,333
i know you can help me now.

270
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,099
you have to...

271
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,500
or i'm... done.

272
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,069
how'd it go?

273
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,638
the fibroid's history.

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,967
it was nice to be back
in the saddle again.

275
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,699
i have a newborn with
a diaphragmatic hernia

276
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,100
being airlifted in.

277
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,399
don't you have someone else?
i do have patients.

278
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,433
double board certified
neonatal surgeons

279
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:07,934
aren't exactly
walking the streets, montgomery.

280
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,599
look, i hate to take you away
from all the fun at the office,

281
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,767
but on the bright side, you get
to save a life and work with me.

282
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
okay, i'm in.

283
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,999
charlotte, that newborn
being airlifted...

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,099
you don't have somebody else.
you knew i'd say yes. i hoped.

285
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,332
you're wooing me with surgery.
i am.

286
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,899
hey, did you hear about dell?

287
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,399
he's nursing at st. ambrose.

288
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,634
so now you want to talk
about dell? well, yeah.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,733
naomi
- hey, nal, addison's staying

290
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:39,329
at the hospital
to do another surgery.

291
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,149
could you cover her patients?
uh, sure.

292
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,099
cool.
sam.

293
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,332
yes. good ol' boss sam,
you will be glad to know,

294
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,999
i have a new patient.
hey, one new patient.

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,100
maybe we can build
a new wing.

296
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,230
what about you?
don't you have a consult?

297
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,079
i can't do it.
my morning consult-major drama.

298
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,399
it may take the rest of the day,

299
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,933
so cancel everyone else
you had booked.

300
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,799
i know he's only a year old,

301
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,299
but you wait all this time
to have a baby,

302
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,399
you want him to be perfect,

303
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,133
and i'm-i'm just really worried
that he's-that-

304
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,996
that there's something wrong
with him, you know, with...

305
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,549
his head.
his head?

306
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,449
his head.
what's wrong with his head?

307
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,584
it's... big. not "big for
a 1-year-old body" big,

308
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:24,185
but "big for anybody's body"
big.

309
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:26,999
babies are sometimes born
with large heads,

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,549
but if you give it some time,
they usually grow into 'em.

311
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,083
it's not-
it's a really big head.

312
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,101
okay. let's take a look.

313
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,934
hey there, little fella.

314
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,399
you know, just to be
on the safe side,

315
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,460
i'm gonna run some tests, see if
there's anything going on.

316
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,799
so your mom said

317
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,600
it looked like the dog's neck
had been broken.

318
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,271
any idea how that happened?

319
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,899
it-it was in your garage.

320
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,599
any idea about that?

321
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,299
it was a beagle, right?

322
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,667
dodger?

323
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,139
your mom said you had it
since, uh, you were 6.

324
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,999
is that right?

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,270
okay. the dog's
too loaded a topic.

326
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,600
uh...

327
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,299
why don't we talk about
your father?

328
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,299
were the two of you close?

329
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,267
did he coach
any of your teams?

330
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,099
i hear you're
a great baseball player.

331
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,833
okay, i get it.
you don't want to be here.

332
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,549
a lot of people

333
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,349
don't like to talk
about difficult things.

334
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,099
but i have a job to do,

335
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,634
and that is to find out
if there's a problem here,

336
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,133
and to do that,
i need for us to talk...

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,549
about anything.

338
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,216
i want to get to know you,
jesse.

339
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,049
can i go now?

340
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,616
please.

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
dell?

342
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:15,620
hey.

343
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,220
so you're working here?

344
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,499
you look nice...
in your scrubs.

345
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,189
what are you doing here,
naomi?

346
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,256
i just came by to say hi.

347
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,449
it's great to see you.

348
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,483
we've missed you.

349
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,999
i've missed
- i really can't talk right now. i got a ton of patients.

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,866
dell.
i'm sorry. i gotta go.

351
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,383
i just saw this kid who had
a head the size of...

352
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,454
it was ginormous.
it was huge.

353
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,549
which is bigger,
ginormous or huge?

354
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,350
is it...

355
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,049
who's the truant?

356
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,983
consult's son.

357
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,034
he won't talk,
so i'm lettin' him stew.

358
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,099
is stewing a real
therapeutic technique?

359
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,034
usually works with you.

360
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,199
what's he stewing about?

361
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,632
his mother thinks he killed
the family dog.

362
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,934
oh. step one, right?
i mean, that's what they say

363
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:22,934
about serial killers, am i right?
oh, he's not a serial killer. i-

364
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:25,249
well, not now. i don't
even know if he did it.

365
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,183
is the mom lying?
she believes he did it.

366
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:28,999
i- i don't know his side
'cause he won't talk to me.

367
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,699
he-his father's dead,
his dog is dead.

368
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,499
he's got a lot of reason
to be angry.

369
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,299
you know, his mother thinks
he's a sociopath.

370
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,333
she goes on the internet, she puts together the signs
- is he?

371
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,129
i don't know.
i guess i could test him...

372
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,100
give him the m.m.p.i.

373
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,149
it would be so much easier

374
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,299
if he just had a pipe bomb
in his book bag.

375
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,220
you know-do you know how rare
a true sociopath is?

376
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,470
you don't want to be the one
that missed columbine.

377
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,500
you don't want to talk.
i get it.

378
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,199
leaves me
with a problem, though.

379
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,933
i have concerns about you,

380
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,849
and i'm not comfortable

381
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,000
with just watching you
walk out that door.

382
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,900
don't talk to me.
just fill this out.

383
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,134
true/false.

384
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,533
or we can sit here
all day.

385
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,329
okay, just so we're clear,
this is not a date.

386
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,330
this is a sandwich
between surgeries.

387
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,419
point is, it's getting
to know each other

388
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,586
without all that date crap.
mm.

389
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,299
tell me about this case
you've been working on.

390
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,399
you know, the one
that's kept you from calling.

391
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,366
i watched two people die.
it kinda made for a bad week.

392
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,419
yeah. i have been having
a run of those myself.

393
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,287
not people dying, just people
not talking to me...

394
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,999
mm-hmm.

395
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,399
people not talking
to each other.

396
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,400
all the people in my office
are walking around pissed off,

397
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,293
and nobody's talking about it.

398
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,699
that's why i'm here...
cutting people open.

399
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,799
getting out your hostilities.

400
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,434
actually... you put
a scalpel in my palm,

401
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,469
and i feel centered.

402
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,783
all the other problems
in the world just fall away.

403
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,999
it's hard to explain.

404
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,300
well, you can explain it to me
tomorrow night

405
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
when i take you out.
you're taking me out?

406
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,479
i am.
on a date?

407
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
yes. you're not going anywhere.

408
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,999
pregnant lady
with ovarian torsion.

409
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,399
o.r.'s ready. you up for
it, montgomery? yeah. mm.

410
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,434
yeah, no, go. cut people open. all
right. i'll see you, um, tomorrow night.

411
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,483
tomorrow night.
okay.

412
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,549
you know, we could use you.

413
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,799
sorry. excuse me?

414
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,767
here.
you could be a surgeon.

415
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,849
i could keep the o.r. full
and the board happy.

416
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,617
it's a symbiotic relationship.

417
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,699
i have a job, charlotte.

418
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,634
you're a surgeon, addison.

419
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,466
i'll think about it.

420
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,567
big.

421
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,069
how big?

422
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,420
mount rushmore big.

423
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,799
i'm thinking, like,
paget's disease

424
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,767
or acromegaly
or tuberous sclerosis.

425
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,919
i mean, this poor kid's
gonna be, like, a bobblehead

426
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,799
if i can't fix him.

427
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,735
at least he won't be
wearing a bra.

428
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:32,549
unless it's to give
his head more support.

429
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,151
i keep telling you,
it's not that unusual.

430
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,549
it's a coping mechanism, and
you said he's coping. yeah, but-

431
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,883
i got a maybe sociopath
who maybe killed his dog

432
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,699
who maybe i should lock up.

433
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,367
you got a bra and panties. you want
to trade? what happened with your test?

434
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,499
it's inconclusive.

435
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,649
does he like to smash things?
yes. does he feel anger? yes.

436
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,519
the only way to know
if he's a true sociopath

437
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
is to do a comprehensive
clinical evaluation,

438
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:55,749
and the kid's not talking.
so based on this test,

439
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,750
he doesn't meet the criteria
for me to hold him.

440
00:20:57,784 --> 00:20:59,750
he's not a clear danger
to anyone.

441
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:01,750
there's not
a credible threat...

442
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,370
except i still don't know
what happened to the dog.

443
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,733
does anyone
have anything helpful to say?

444
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,299
yeah. at least
he doesn't have a big head.

445
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,201
or wear panties.

446
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,850
i've resected the cyst.

447
00:21:20,883 --> 00:21:23,484
i just have to
detorse this ovary.

448
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,999
montgomery, they need you
in nicu now.

449
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,866
baby you worked on before,
0-2 sats are dropping.

450
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:31,588
crap. okay, let me just finish
ligating this vessel.

451
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,875
let me just take a look at
the baby, make sure it's okay.

452
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:38,929
done.

453
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,417
go ahead and close her up.

454
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,132
doctor.

455
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,557
oh, uh, she's fine.

456
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,557
i untwisted the ovary,
removed the cyst.

457
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:53,149
the baby's doing well.
they're gonna be okay.

458
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,299
is there any way i can- i
can g- not now. maybe later.

459
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,734
what about if i just
- i'm in the middle of an emergency,

460
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,999
but i'll come back to you. how
many surgeries have you done?

461
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,249
four.
what about your knee?

462
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,799
can't even feel it.
wow. you're a badass.

463
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,099
what, all you thought i did
was deliver babies?

464
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,700
hey, nal. so what's up?

465
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,899
i, uh, just finished
going over the budget.

466
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,399
i can't believe
there's all this paperwork.

467
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,899
i feel like
i'm doing six jobs now,

468
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,999
and none of 'em
is seeing my patients.

469
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,399
yeah, well, it's, uh,
it's tough being the boss.

470
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,699
what do you think about hiring a marketing
consultant? if you think it'll help.

471
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,049
right?
mm-hmm.

472
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,016
all right. thanks.

473
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,467
can you believe him?

474
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,299
i mean, does he not think

475
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,999
that i did the exact same things
when i was in charge?

476
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,699
only i wasn't stupid enough
to try and do it all by myself.

477
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,599
at least i had dell to help
me manage to run things

478
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,700
so that i could see patients.

479
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,700
i saw him today-dell-
at the hospital.

480
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,249
it was really weird-

481
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,150
i have a patient.
i gotta go.

482
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,499
so you're telling me
he's normal?

483
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,734
one test over one hour
is not gonna answer that,

484
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,533
but this does evaluate personality and
psychopathology. what about the dog?

485
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,549
he won't talk to me
about that right now.

486
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,799
but maybe if the two of you came in together, then
- no, i can't confront him.

487
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,399
you told me
to bring him in here.

488
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,399
you said that-
that you could help me,

489
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,300
and now he knows that i'm scared
of him. it's- no, i didn't tell him-

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,866
he's smart.

491
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,799
you think he's not
gonna figure this out?

492
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,599
look, i can't...

493
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,766
he had that dog
for ten years, and he...

494
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,299
he didn't
shed a tear when it died.

495
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,800
he snapped its neck
and hid it in the garage,

496
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:35,267
and he didn't shed a tear
because he didn't care.

497
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,830
linda-
i can't sleep.

498
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,766
i can't sleep.

499
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,893
i lie awake with a h-

500
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:46,199
with a hammer
under my pillow

501
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,599
because i'm afraid of what
he's gonna do to me.

502
00:23:48,632 --> 00:23:51,449
and now you're telling me
that you can't help me?

503
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,099
you told me
you would help me.

504
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,449
you should have
given me those pills,

505
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,350
'cause i could've buried it.

506
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,134
i need you
to help me, please.

507
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,960
i'm afrid of my own son

508
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,000
dell.

509
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,200
um, i know
you were busy before,

510
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:17,867
and, uh, i had to see
some patients.

511
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,401
and i thought
you might be getting off.

512
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:22,701
i'm doing a double shift.

513
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,334
i took you for granted.

514
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,001
i didn't listen,
and i should have.

515
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:32,000
you were trying to help me,
and i didn't let you.

516
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,049
i want you to come back.

517
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:40,050
i have a job, naomi,
a place where i'm respected.

518
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,549
the practice has been...
adrift, dell,

519
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,016
since you left.

520
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,179
i've been adrift.

521
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,280
you know, i'm not talking
to addison,

522
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,199
barely talking to sam,

523
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,549
and violet doesn't want
to hear from me.

524
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,817
you're not there...
to talk to.

525
00:24:57,851 --> 00:24:59,917
no. no, i'm here,
doing things i love

526
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:01,099
and-and learning a lot

527
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,799
from people who aren't
afraid to teach me. dell.

528
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,267
i'm working, okay?

529
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,934
i work here.

530
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,184
excuse me.

531
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,799
i think
he's happy here, nal.

532
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,866
it seems like a lot of people are
happy here. just trying to do my part.

533
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,399
that's nice.

534
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,767
thanks for doing that for me
when i was in charge.

535
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:23,667
you never asked, naomi.

536
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,367
that's the problem.
you never asked.

537
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,749
you're in a good mood.

538
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,649
your montgomery's a real star.
cash cow for me today.

539
00:25:34,683 --> 00:25:36,079
she's really
making me look good.

540
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,447
i'm glad someone does.

541
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,034
stop mopin'.
i don't like mopin' sex.

542
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,433
i have a kid with a big head,
who, as it turns out,

543
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,550
has nothing wrong with him,

544
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,083
except that he's going to be
mocked and ridiculed

545
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,049
and looked down on for the rest
of his life. and that's your fault?

546
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,651
no, that's me. i'm the one
who doesn't fit in,

547
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,199
who's gonna be
first out of the practice

548
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,399
because they don't want me
on their team anymore.

549
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,299
i am the bighead kid. oh, my god. you
are pathetic. you are crazy and pathetic.

550
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,867
a big head's not a problem.
it's a virtue, moron.

551
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,499
you know who had a big head?

552
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,999
lincoln, j.f.k., elvis,
einstein.

553
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,399
plenty of people have big heads,

554
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,899
and they don't sit and mope
that they have a big head.

555
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,900
so don't you sit and mope
that you're a pediatrician.

556
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:18,267
do your job, do it well,
and screw everyone else.

557
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,734
you're the bighead kid.
more power to you.

558
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,749
can we get
our clothes off now?

559
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,000
hmm?

560
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,349
oh, i rescheduled
your consults for tomorrow.

561
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,749
no.

562
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,799
n- no?

563
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,449
life is not 15 minutes, sam.

564
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,783
this woman and her son cannot
be fixed in 15 minutes.

565
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,016
well, i'm sure you did
everything that you could.

566
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,549
not yet. tomorrow i'm going
to the kid's school,

567
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,383
i'm talking to his teachers
and his counselors,

568
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:45,399
and i am trying to get answers
to the questions

569
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,649
he won't talk to me
about today.

570
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,684
cost-effective? no.
but if it helps the kid...

571
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:50,799
i'm sorry

572
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,733
<i>if this does not fit into
the new way of doing things.</i>

573
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,499
where's the fire?
it's no joke.

574
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,200
my fire captain,
he's in the e.r.

575
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,266
hey, hey, pete.

576
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:08,999
hey.

577
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,899
what are you doing here?

578
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,000
firefighter patient.
i got paged.

579
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
what about you? you've
been here all day. yep.

580
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,529
you ever gonna come back
to the practice?

581
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,463
maybe. one day.
see you.

582
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:18,999
good luck.

583
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
dr. montgomery,
the ovarian torsion you fixed,

584
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,049
her pressure's down
to 80 over 40.

585
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,579
post-op crit's 26
and dropping.

586
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,019
she's bleeding out.
what about the baby?

587
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,953
it's in distress.
open the o.r.

588
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,817
extensive
partial thickness burns,

589
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,149
but he won't let anybody
touch him except for you.

590
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,484
he's over here.

591
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,433
i'm here, frank. i
couldn't let anyone see me.

592
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,059
okay. get me a blood gas kit
and run a carboxyheme level.

593
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,999
i need a chem panel, c.b.c.
and chest x-ray,

594
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,899
and set me up
for a subclavian.

595
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,868
5- story blaze...
beam came down...

596
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,034
everybody get out okay?

597
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,786
you're not getting air,
frank.

598
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,067
you gotta stay with me.

599
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,683
hang on.
i'm almost there.

600
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,633
you're gonna be okay.

601
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,717
no.

602
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,266
i'm done.

603
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,159
are they okay?

604
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,179
oh. your wife had some,
uh, post-op bleeding,

605
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,499
but she's safe, and the baby should be
fine. when you came out of surgery before,

606
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,500
you said they were fine then. they were,
but then your wife started hemorrhaging.

607
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,629
i had to go back in. and it's not
because you ran out to some other surgery?

608
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,531
no. no. it's not.

609
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,299
what about now?
i mean, you're-

610
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,999
you're saying she's fine now,
but how do i know?

611
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,899
right now, your wife,
she's doing as well as she can.

612
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:02,400
she's a fighter.
she's gonna come through this.

613
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,484
what's her name?

614
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,319
excuse me?
my wife's name.

615
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,353
you keep talking about "she"
and "her" and "your wife,"

616
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,999
and you're running
up and down this hall,

617
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,549
and you're popping in
and you're cutting people open,

618
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,719
and you're talking about her
like you know her,

619
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,187
but you haven't mentioned her name. i...

620
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,399
i don't know her name.

621
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,233
it's heather.
her name's heather.

622
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,019
and this is the third time
she's been pregnant.

623
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,086
we lost two babies before.

624
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,199
she keeps redecorating
the nursery,

625
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,167
hoping that
that's gonna change things.

626
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,799
it's red now. who... who ever
heard of a red nursery?

627
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,232
but her students-

628
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:43,049
her students told her
that it would be good luck,

629
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,017
and she wanted
to believe them.

630
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,318
you operated
on her twice today.

631
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:51,650
you should've known her name.

632
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,999
a few weeks, you should be
you'rup and around.frank.

633
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,299
and then what?

634
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,700
i told you, i'm done.

635
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,432
i can't believe that's true.
i'm resigning.

636
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,649
these guys depend on me.

637
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,683
if they can't
feel comfortable with me,

638
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,999
if they think i'm a freak...

639
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,466
we all feel stress, frank.
you more than most.

640
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,833
but you know what? you found
a way to deal with it.

641
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,300
some people drink too much,
some eat too much,

642
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,200
some people... run.

643
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,267
i wish i had a thing
that worked.

644
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,233
when everything around you
is falling apart

645
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:39,299
and you need
to keep it together,

646
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,767
<i>a thing is good.</i>

647
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,867
so i wear
a bra and panties forever?

648
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,579
maybe if you talked
to someone,

649
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,147
maybe if you didn't shoulder
all of that stress yourself,

650
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,379
it might be better.

651
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,180
fine. i'll go to therapy.

652
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,701
but it's still too late.

653
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,049
you run into burning buildings
and save lives.

654
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:07,383
how many of your men
have you gone in after?

655
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,068
if it's me...

656
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,554
i don't care
what you're wearing

657
00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:15,189
as long
as you get me out alive.

658
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:21,344
6 surgeries in 24 hours.

659
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,434
what's it like?

660
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,199
to be a surgeon?

661
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,249
to be the best.

662
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,149
i came here to get away from
a bunch of people not talking,

663
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,817
and i ended up
being the one not talking...

664
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:40,016
not talking
to a single patient.

665
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,850
i cut 'em open, sewed 'em up,

666
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,899
and i didn't have any idea
who they were.

667
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,399
that's not a doctor,

668
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,180
and it's certainly not
the best.

669
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,079
thanks for the job offer,
charlotte,

670
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,581
but i have a job, a home.

671
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,400
i've run every lab
i can think of.

672
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,967
there's nothing wrong with
miles' head. so it's...

673
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,999
that's just the way he is.

674
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,501
your son's fine,
and he may grow into it.

675
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,100
what if he doesn't?

676
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,799
you must think i'm awful.

677
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,034
i should be elated that my
son is fine, it's just-

678
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:28,034
he's different.
yes.

679
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,159
me? i was slow.

680
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,799
the other kids could all
run faster. i hated p.e.

681
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,700
my best friend brad, he had
two teeth that never grew in.

682
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,799
he's the c.e.o.
of a fortune 500 company now.

683
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,249
i see a lot of kids,

684
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,417
and they're all different
in one way or another.

685
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,183
he'll be picked on.
maybe.

686
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,389
maybe he'll be a bully.
maybe he'll be president.

687
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,999
you know, a lot of
the presidents had big heads-

688
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,540
j.f.k., lincoln.

689
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,216
he's on mount rushmore now.

690
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,749
thanks.

691
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,832
you made my mom cry.

692
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,137
what did you ???

693
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,667
i- i told her that i
didn't think i could help you

694
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,149
if you wouldn't talk to me.
what are you doing here?

695
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,616
i'm trying to figure out what you
won't tell me. no. you let this go.

696
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,867
my job is to help people,
and i-i want to help you.

697
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,934
and i am not gonna stop
talking or asking questions

698
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,433
until you answer some.

699
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,267
what happened to the dog?

700
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,189
what happened to the dog,
jesse?

701
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,124
jesse... you loved
that dog, didn't you?

702
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:39,557
you loved that dog,
you didn't shed a tear,

703
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,549
and i want to know why.

704
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,129
tell me why.

705
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,297
do you know how much it costs
to put a dog down?

706
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,599
do you?

707
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,999
he had cancer.

708
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,449
it was thousands of dollars
to treat him,

709
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,749
and she was gonna do it.

710
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,749
my dad's cancer
almost bankrupted us,

711
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,199
but she was gonna do it

712
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,999
because she couldn't bear

713
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,933
to see another thing
die again.

714
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,299
she didn't want me to
have to go through it again.

715
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,733
we couldn't afford it.

716
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,616
it was $385 to put him down.
we didn't have that either.

717
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,400
so i did what i had to do.

718
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,232
it was my dog...

719
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,534
and i killed him...

720
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,900
because my dad said
i had to be the man.

721
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,284
i had to be responsible.

722
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,999
still here?

723
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,799
just leaving.

724
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,766
naomi wants me
to come back.

725
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,899
she misses you.

726
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,079
she just wants me to come back
for her, not for me.

727
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,080
dell, when a friend asks you
to step up, you do it.

728
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,999
it's just what you do.
you're part of the family.

729
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,899
yeah.

730
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,149
i'm the part of the family
they're embarrassed by.

731
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,282
that is not true.
you ran away.

732
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,899
you got your feelings hurt,
and you ran away.

733
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,533
now you may have reason,

734
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,717
but hiding out here,
avoiding your problems,

735
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,617
not talking to the people
that need you...

736
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,733
how are you ever gonna get
what you want?

737
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,300
talking is important...
okay.

738
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,966
because when you don't talk,

739
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,417
when you don't say what's on your mind
- what are you talking about?

740
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:12,917
i meyo, you-youd old me
not to talk to you about sam,

741
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,249
and when i tried to talk to you
about dell, you walkedy.way.

742
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:19,250
bee use you were using measasr.our.dd

743
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,199
m i'm yot yodd add,on,

744
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,867
not anymore.

745
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,234
i used to be,
before addison got here.

746
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,867
and then you just started...

747
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,367
talking to her.

748
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,793
you hurt my feelings.

749
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,193
and... i know
i'm a therapist,

750
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:40,699
and i'm supposed to say
that it's all right,

751
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,600
but it's not all right.

752
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,699
and you can't just make me
your addison again

753
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,301
and think
that makes it all better.

754
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,333
work it out with addison.

755
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,999
and for god sake,
stop sleeping with sam

756
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
unless you can tell him
how wrong this all is,

757
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,899
his stealing your job

758
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,200
and using you
as a sounding board.

759
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,966
and then come talk to me...

760
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,835
<i>when you want to talk to me.</i>

761
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,584
you came back.

762
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,850
yeah.

763
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,249
so is this the new you?

764
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,899
you gonna hide out
and do surgery

765
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,249
and leave
your old friends behind?

766
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,283
i wish i felt like my
old friends were my old friends.

767
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,749
you did what you had to,

768
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,184
telling sam,
breaking your word to naomi.

769
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,867
i never said that.
i thought i should say that.

770
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,917
thanks.

771
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,280
please

772
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,379
well, this is nice.

773
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,899
it's nice, yeah.

774
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,499
us... as friends.

775
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,201
now that we're past all that,
you know, awkwardness.

776
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,449
yeah.
it's good.

777
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,299
and if we keep at it
for a few months,

778
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,133
we could be old friends.

779
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,999
dell.

780
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,549
yeah.

781
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,617
i hear you're in charge now.

782
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,749
what's this?

783
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,499
it's a list of demands-
what i need to come back.

784
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,699
patients? supervised. i need the
hours for my midwife's license.

785
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,899
sorry, no.

786
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,499
sam.
hey, he walked out.

787
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,299
and it's been worse
since he's been gone.

788
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,400
no. we can't afford it.

789
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,233
can you give us
a minute, please?

790
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,079
naomi, we can't add staff-

791
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,749
i am talking now.
you took my job.

792
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,554
you went behind my back,
conspired with my best friend,

793
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:01,649
took over the practice,

794
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,449
and now you think you can just
unilaterally make decisions,

795
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,316
or worse-run ideas by me
like none of it ever happened.

796
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,200
well, guess what, sam?
i don't want to hear your ideas.

797
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,933
i'm not your sounding board,
and i am not going to help you.

798
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,233
you find somebody else.

799
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,499
at least i was smart enough
to find the person

800
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,634
who is standing
right outside your door.

801
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,999
you start today.

802
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,300
you see patients only supervised
by naomi or addison or pete,

803
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,649
and we see.
i can live with that.

804
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,817
you resume being office manager.
vendors, filing,

805
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,499
equipment leasing,
scheduling, ordering supplies-

806
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,749
that's yours.

807
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,850
that's what i need
from you.

808
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,325
and one last demand.
it's not on the list.

809
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:57,649
i want scrubs
in a better color.

810
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,699
i'm a man. i'm not wearing
those damn pink scrubs.

811
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,865
welcome back, dell.

812
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,000
good. you're here.

813
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,934
can you
get your clothes off?

814
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,649
what's wrong?

815
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,317
nothing.

816
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,966
there's something wrong.
i can tell.

817
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,149
we don't do
the talking thing, cooper.

818
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,217
yes, we do. you yelled at me.
you confirmed i had a big head.

819
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,299
it made me feel better.

820
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,500
let me yell at you,
make you feel better.

821
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,899
i'm not letting you
get a piece of this

822
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,566
until you start talking.

823
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,179
i offered addison a job...

824
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,180
and she turned me down.

825
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,283
can you
take your clothes off now?

826
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,779
you like knives.

827
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,079
i like guns.

828
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,499
centered?

829
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,834
wow.
all that not talking...

830
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,363
talking is overrated.

831
