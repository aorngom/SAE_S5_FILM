1
00:00:01,282 --> 00:00:02,384
You planned this?

2
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,537
- So we'd get caught.
- Comes down to choosing

3
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:06,110
between friends and brothers.

4
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:08,799
- You have to choose brothers.
- Your choice is pretty clear.

5
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,427
- What are you doing here?
- Rain check. Remember?

6
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,263
<i>We'd like to congratulate
Russell Cartwright on being</i>

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,057
<i>this year's grand recipient.</i>

8
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,142
There's a reason
it didn't work out with Fisher.

9
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:20,353
- He cheated on me again.
- What?

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,897
- Jasmine.
- Someone gave us a 0/100?

11
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,275
This one judge, Ryan.
He also gave the Gamma Psi's a 100.

12
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,040
- That's so shady.
- We determined the fire was started

13
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:31,197
accidentally by a candle.
Jasmine, I believe.

14
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,987
You know you're in for a hard class
it's still this is a "Nine Pages".

15
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:39,651
You're in for a hard class
when you sign up to be an engineer,

16
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:42,799
so get it together,
Gary Wyatt Grant winner.

17
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,555
You want to go grab
some coffee before lab?

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,375
No can do.
My hot cocoa money

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,335
is going directly
into the piggy bank

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,223
so I can fund my project research.

21
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:56,889
We don't all have forty grand
burning a hole in our pockets.

22
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:01,631
Is your fly open or something?
Everybody keeps staring at you.

23
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,399
- This is a new shirt.
- Rusty?

24
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:08,413
It's Dana?
From Space Plasma Physics?

25
00:01:08,538 --> 00:01:10,902
- We met at orientation?
- Freshman orientation?

26
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,197
I had the shirt
with the butterflies on it.

27
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,807
- Why am I talking to you?
- I have no idea.

28
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:19,829
To congratulate you on winning
the Gary Wyatt Grant. It's...

29
00:01:20,195 --> 00:01:22,995
Well, I have to get to
the science lab, so...

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,568
I wonder if they're gonna have
snacks today.

31
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,357
- All this because of the Grant?
- You know what they say,

32
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:30,673
more money, more problems.
Which one of these hotties

33
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,008
are you gonna hit?
Why not Dana's digits?

34
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,261
I don't know. She seemed
kinda odd, didn't she?

35
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,887
Don't get too picky, Rus.

36
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:39,551
I got a feeling those sorority
row brainiacs you consort with

37
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:43,083
- aren't gonna have the same reaction.
- Okay, very funny.

38
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:51,240
Hi, Katherine.
How are you?

39
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:53,446
Did you have fun
at the Fairy Tale Ball?

40
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,904
It was fine.
You know how I feel about parties.

41
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,743
Right, I know.
But how do you feel about today?

42
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,829
IFC/Panhellenic meeting, first one.
Big day.

43
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,218
- It could be a very big day for you.
- Really.

44
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:07,113
- Like how big of a day?
- I think you know what I'm getting at,

45
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:09,191
I'm not gonna keep it
from you any longer.

46
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:10,337
Yeah, I know.

47
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,791
The Vice President of Judicial
position is still open.

48
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,776
You turned it down last semester,
but I was gonna give it another ask.

49
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,053
You've been so supportive
with the Gamma Psi fire

50
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,086
and so patient
with the SongFest judging,

51
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:23,142
I thought I could trust you
of all people to help me.

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,020
- As your VPJ?
- Without delay.

53
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:29,079
Did you see that? I'm so excited

54
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:31,984
to have you in the position,
I'm resorting to silly rhymes.

55
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,153
- So are you in?
- Of course.

56
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,030
Great, I already have your 1st task.

57
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,398
I need you to look into the events
surrounding the Gamma Psi fire.

58
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:42,354
Really? I thought the police
said it was just an accident.

59
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,383
I told them I blew out the candle,
but they're not taking me seriously.

60
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,327
Something fishy went on that night

61
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:50,448
and it's driving me crazy not knowing
what it is, and I am sure,

62
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:52,129
you can find out what happened.

63
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,685
Of course, Katherine, I will...

64
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:58,928
get to the bottom of this mystery.

65
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:00,929
- One more thing...
- Yeah?

66
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:03,974
My own clipboard?

67
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,437
- Oh, my...
- Commencing, people, let's start.

68
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:13,787
Old business: the tutoring
program was a roaring success.

69
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:16,195
We received rave reviews
from all local teachers.

70
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,513
Moving on...

71
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:43,691
So...

72
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:46,183
- big class.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:48,720
My sorority calls it
"Marketing for Dummies",

74
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,218
because Professor Clarissa's
so desperate to be cool,

75
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:54,483
she gives everyone A's.
Awesome, right?

76
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,086
I myself could use an easy A.
Got a pretty heavy load this semester,

77
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:01,240
since I won the Gary Wyatt
Innovation in Engineering Grant.

78
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,258
I'm gonna be pretty busy
doing extra research.

79
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,189
Well, I won't keep you.

80
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,249
I see my friend!

81
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:18,757
Baby Brother Cartwright!

82
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,325
You're taking
Marketing for Dummies?

83
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,305
You seem crabby.

84
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,558
I just got shot down by a girl
that I talked about science.

85
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:30,269
Oh, no. Which one?

86
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:32,146
That one. The blonde.

87
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:33,993
Erika Miller?

88
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:35,858
She is hot.

89
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,776
So one girl thought you were a geek.

90
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:41,091
One of the guys who asked me out
last week thought I was a sophomore.

91
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:44,408
- Can you believe that?
- That's not quite the same situation.

92
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:48,120
Stupid laptop!
I think I got a virus

93
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:51,225
downloading a picture of what was
supposed to be Robert Pattinson naked,

94
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,600
but it was a cat playing the piano.

95
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,379
Let me take a look at it.

96
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,631
Might as well put my nerdiness
to some use, right?

97
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:03,135
- I haven't had a date since,
- Jordan? Right?

98
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:05,930
Well,

99
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,898
I took my cheating boyfriend back
and got cheated on again, so...

100
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,005
I'm sorry, Ash.

101
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:25,081
Just trying to get your attention!
Can I get a what-what?

102
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:34,967
Marketing Rule Number One:

103
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:37,419
know your target audience.

104
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:46,220
Case! Case, come on,
where's the fire?

105
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:48,956
I don't think it's a good idea
that we talk, Evan.

106
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:52,181
What, Cappie hates me,
so you have to hate me too?

107
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:56,230
- I'm mad at you 'cause I'm mad at you!
- And you won't give me a way

108
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,331
- to apologize?
- There's nothing you can say!

109
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:00,830
We were all friends again.
Why'd you have to screw it up?

110
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:03,338
You screwed it up!
By getting back together with Cappie

111
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,527
and expecting me to be third wheel
in your fantasy re-creation

112
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,450
of freshman year. Look!

113
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,746
Case, you know how important it was
to me to win my house back.

114
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:15,454
Way to rationalize.

115
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:22,770
See? In honor of Fisher.

116
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,967
- It's called Burnt Betrayal.
- Burnt?

117
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:28,512
- Did they find out? Are we screwed?
- No, Betsy. You're safe.

118
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:34,184
Everyone is still really on edge
about the fire.

119
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,146
Sorry!

120
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,023
What fire?

121
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:43,986
The Gamma Psi fire.
The one that your candle started.

122
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,322
Come on, you're not worried
we're gonna get in trouble?

123
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:50,718
The only worry I have right now is
having to wake up at seven tomorrow

124
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,409
to try to add another class.
I hate waiting in lines.

125
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:54,941
It's so Midwest.

126
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,754
Heather and Reagan nearly came
to blows over

127
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,252
a parking space.
I think the girls are still nervous.

128
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,880
Affirmative.
How was the meeting?

129
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,215
Was Katherine weird?
You know, more than usual?

130
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,647
Is it weird she gave me the VP
of Judicial position

131
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:11,472
and my first task is to investigate
the Gamma Psi fire?

132
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,098
- My God!
- Yeah.

133
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,466
No more fire talk for me, thanks.
I'm gonna watch TV.

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,920
Complete and utter denial.
It's almost pathological.

135
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,195
It's Rebecca.

136
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:27,696
You know, if you're in charge
of the investigation,

137
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,032
you could always investigate it
away from us.

138
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:32,703
And abuse my authority
and continue to lie to Katherine,

139
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,370
which is killing me inside?
I can't stand the guilt anymore!

140
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,635
Yeah.
All the sisters are on edge, too.

141
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,115
We need to give them
something else to focus on.

142
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,502
Maybe, philanthropy?

143
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,254
For Gamma Psi!
Maybe that could help us feel better.

144
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:47,340
Maybe trot out the old
bachelor auction fundraiser.

145
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:50,174
- The cops are here!
- It's just General Hospital.

146
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:51,512
Turn it off!

147
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,705
The philanthropy is a good idea.
You take care of that,

148
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,437
and I'm gonna start
my big fake investigation.

149
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,590
Over the holidays, Brother Barry
and I were fortunate enough

150
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:07,703
to attend a secret conference.
In Akron.

151
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,482
Birthplace of the United
States trucking industry.

152
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:13,218
I can't say more. Anyone
else do anything interesting?

153
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:16,698
I traveled to South
America with my family

154
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:20,181
and assisted in a ritual sacrifice.

155
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,848
You know who didn't assist
people over break?

156
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,732
- Drop it,.
- Why? Don't you stand by your actions?

157
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:32,261
Or are you embarrassed to have these people
find out what an ass-clown you really are?

158
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,108
I'm not gonna apologize for
doing what I had to do for my house.

159
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,373
- You'd do the same if.
- My house would never ask me

160
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:40,852
to screw with people's lives because we
aren't a bunch of whiney, spoiled brats!

161
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,583
No, you're just a bunch of losers
who will still be living there

162
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,691
while the rest of us, including
your girlfriend, have real lives.

163
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,886
The sacred urn!
Don't let it touch the ground!

164
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:52,111
My gosh!

165
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:59,188
Not the sacred robe, Jenna!

166
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:03,192
Amphora does not tolerate personal
conflict to the detriment of the group.

167
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,604
Brother Brett, is there a
procedure to remove an Amphora

168
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:07,821
who has betrayed another Amphora?

169
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:11,147
Or to remove one who never deserved
to be here in the first place?

170
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,543
- You fixed it!
- Yeah,

171
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,718
we just had to r e-install
some software.

172
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:22,770
- And I helped.
- Thank you!

173
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,597
Dale Kettlewell.
We've met a couple times...

174
00:09:29,722 --> 00:09:32,854
At the End of the World party. And I
saw you at the Espresso Farm one time.

175
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:35,531
- Welcome to ZBZ!
- Actually, I've been here before, too.

176
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:38,591
To talk to Casey about Bible Bunch.
And remember that time when you.

177
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,735
I get it! You're being funny!

178
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,238
OK, so guys, thank you so much for all
of your help. I really appreciate it.

179
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:47,207
Just think of us as your
own personal Geek Squad.

180
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:49,442
Spread the word.
I could use the cash.

181
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,863
- Not that you offered to pay.
- Another good one!

182
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:55,989
Wait!

183
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,220
I just had a great idea. We were gonna
do this bachelor auction with normal guys

184
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:03,142
but why don't we do,
like, a nerd auction?

185
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,583
That way we can help Gamma Psi and
the Cyprus-Rhodes nerd population.

186
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,252
Nerd auction?

187
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,585
I'll do it for ten
percent of the profits.

188
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,063
- You're too much!
- OK, five.

189
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:16,232
I could invite the
entire campus, including Erika.

190
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:19,059
How will it help me get a date
to advertise myself as a nerd?

191
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:21,008
Girls like Erika don't like nerds.

192
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,290
Weren't you listening
to Professor Clarissa today?

193
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,604
I was distracted when she
kept doing the robot.

194
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:27,570
You can market anything
in the right package.

195
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,701
Nerds make great boyfriends.
They are funny,

196
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:33,709
they are smart and loyal, and they
can address all your high-tech needs.

197
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,350
Which includes you,
Rusty Cartwright.

198
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:38,470
Why not?

199
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,952
Erika Miller, watch out. Here comes
Rusty Cartwright on the chopping block!

200
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:44,387
- Auction block.
- You...

201
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:46,956
are gonna bring in big money
with that sense of humor.

202
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,300
- Have you ever done stand-up?
- No.

203
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:51,289
No, I have not.

204
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:56,331
"You will succeed
where others fail."

205
00:10:56,456 --> 00:11:00,460
Sounds like after three years, I'm finally
getting into Human Sexuality class.

206
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,836
What is the big deal
with that class, anyway?

207
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:06,877
An entire class dedicated to sex
complete with pictures of lady-parts

208
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:10,209
and man-business? I won't look at the lady
parts if you don't want me to, though.

209
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,139
You'd do that for me?

210
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:15,841
Except that just leaves man-business.
So that's weird.

211
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:19,324
Casey,
I'm ready for my bedtime story.

212
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,717
I have to read Mayor A
n-JELL-O by Thursday,

213
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:23,552
and I couldn't find
the book on tape.

214
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:26,345
- I'll be right there.
- OK.

215
00:11:29,494 --> 00:11:32,333
Is that blood on your pants?

216
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,063
No, no, no.
Wine of the ancients.

217
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:40,318
Evan and I got into an
altercation at Amphora today.

218
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:44,003
Brett said he was gonna consider
how to "address our conflict."

219
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,473
I hope he just kicks him out like the
university did Wade, Ferret and Jeremy.

220
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:49,741
At least you only
have to see him once a week.

221
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:52,086
He and I are in the same
poli-sci class this semester

222
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,885
not to mention our joint
IFC/Panhel meetings,

223
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,048
- where I saw him today.
- Did you talk to him?

224
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:01,518
He tried to get me to forgive him.

225
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:05,311
He just keeps rationalizing by
saying he did it for the house.

226
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:10,291
What? What'd I say?

227
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:14,076
Hurting others for
the sake of the house.

228
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,774
Isn't that kind of what
I did to Gamma Psi?

229
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,032
- It's totally different.
- How?

230
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:24,102
Because... Evan is a douche.

231
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:28,231
While you are my amazing
and great girlfriend

232
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:32,176
who promised me an erotic backrub
before we go to sleep tonight.

233
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:35,645
Evan set out to screw us, OK?

234
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,348
You only broke in to Gamma Psi
because you knew they cheated.

235
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:42,785
- The rest was an accident.
- Right.

236
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:44,942
So...?

237
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:49,213
So, I'll be back in 15 minutes.
Twenty if Beaver's fussy.

238
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:03,664
It feels so crunchy.
What is wrong with my old hair?

239
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:06,426
We don't have time to get into it.

240
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:10,555
I thought the whole point of the nerd
auction was to celebrate my nerdiness.

241
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,460
So why do I need a makeover?

242
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:15,599
Think of me as your
own personal Photoshop.

243
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:17,753
We are just retouching
your nerdiness.

244
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,474
Taking you from nerd to nerd-chic!

245
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,116
Think Harry Potter or Tina Fey.

246
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,718
Those are just people with glasses.

247
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:28,509
Glasses.
We have to get you some glasses.

248
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:32,638
Are you kidding me? The one no
nerdy thing I have is perfect vision.

249
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,646
These will be nerd-chic glasses.
It's all in the packaging.

250
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,320
But isn't it what's on the
inside that really counts?

251
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:42,463
You're serious.

252
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:45,857
Erika will never notice
your great interior

253
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:49,618
until she is lured in by
a nerd-chic exterior.

254
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,095
It's uto you though.
Get the date with the dream girl

255
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,463
or spend the rest of your life reading
Us Weekly,

256
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:57,866
pretending you're the one
caught between two hot co-stars.

257
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,130
- I don't read Us Weekly.
- Sorry, that was me last night.

258
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,633
So what's it gonna be?
Crunchy, or lonely?

259
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,831
- I guess crunchy.
- Good answer.

260
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:21,118
- What is that smell?
- Angie had a little too much to drink

261
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:25,112
and I guess I can't expect her to
clean it up because she's passed out.

262
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,790
- Katherine, I am so sorry.
- She's gonna be fine.

263
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:31,991
- I rolled her on her stomach.
- Not that.

264
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,029
I want to talk to
you about the fire.

265
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,571
Do you have any new details?

266
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:40,267
And I want to thank you so
much for looking into this.

267
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:43,336
I want to reassure you that I haven't
forgotten about the SongFest investigation.

268
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,383
I'm gonna get into that just
as soon as I can because I know that

269
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:49,476
Ryan, the theater judge,
gave ZBZ a zero,

270
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:53,686
- which is highly suspicious.
- You know what? Don't worry about it.

271
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:56,583
SongFest is no big deal.
It's not a fire.

272
00:14:56,814 --> 00:15:00,731
No, but it is an injustice.
So about your findings?

273
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,905
I'm still finding, actually.
I haven't found much.

274
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,028
It's only been a day,
so I won't expect a miracle.

275
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:12,098
But I wanna tell you, Casey,
that I believe in you.

276
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,311
And I really misunderstood you when
we first met. I thought you were a vapid

277
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:20,100
amoral sorority stereotype
but you proved me wrong.

278
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:22,748
That seldom happens, so...

279
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,480
Pardon me.
I'm a professor.

280
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:43,902
I'm narcoleptic. I need to
sign in before I fall asleep. Thanks.

281
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:49,121
My girlfriend's
in labor aCounty General.

282
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:51,770
Can I cut in before the baby crowns?
If that's even the right term.

283
00:15:51,895 --> 00:15:54,243
See how badly I need this class?
Thanks.

284
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:56,468
Can I...

285
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:59,230
So you knocked Casey up?

286
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,586
Now what? Move to the suburbs,
live on love?

287
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,018
You're not cutting in front of me.
I've been here since 7.

288
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:06,065
Come on, I'd bet my own man-business

289
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,537
that you tricked your way up the line,
too, little missy.

290
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:10,735
Who needs trickery when
you look like this?

291
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
No more banter?

292
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,180
Things have to be awkward between
us now you're dating Casey?

293
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,303
No, but...

294
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:21,370
Let's hope we both don't
get into the class.

295
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:23,102
She'll freak. It's a sex class.

296
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,191
- She trusts me.
- Barf.

297
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:28,074
Don't "barf" me, Rebecca.
I've seen your soft side.

298
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,821
You're not completely alone type.

299
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:34,280
No. And it just so happens
I did recently have an encounter.

300
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,411
Sounds... like an alien.

301
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,522
- Do I know space invader in question?
- Who cares?

302
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,459
{\It's not like}It's going anywhere.
It's just sex, which is the only thing

303
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,520
that actually works
between men and women.

304
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:45,895
Don't say that.

305
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:50,335
My God. I can't be friends with you
while you're in love.

306
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,690
It's really unsightly.

307
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:54,641
You can make fun of me all you want,
but I'd hate to see you blow a chance

308
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:56,514
- to be happy.
- Do I should go for it?

309
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,599
I really do.

310
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:01,615
The space invader is Evan Chambers.

311
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:03,521
Barf.

312
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:08,063
Thanks everyone for waiting.
But you might as well go home.

313
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,566
There is only one ad
d-in spot for the class,

314
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:13,736
and Professor Dabia is very choosy.

315
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:18,949
- Mine.
- That's what you think.

316
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,961
- Who are you playing Risk with?
- Me, myself and Kettlewell.

317
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:33,380
Nice glasses, J.J.

318
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,050
Tell me, have you figured out how
Lost is gonna end yet?

319
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,925
For your information,
it's called nerd-chic,

320
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,042
and Ashleigh said it's just the ticket
to getting me a date with Erika.

321
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,516
She's picking out an
outfit for me, too.

322
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:48,941
Congratulations.

323
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,713
And congratulations to the
left side of my brain,

324
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,449
which has conquered Australasia.

325
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,070
Come on, Dale, why don't
you let her make you over?

326
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,943
Samir and all those
other guys are doing it.

327
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:03,072
As groovy as that sounds, I'm not gonna
go behind A&P with you to smoke grass.

328
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:05,829
Come on. Peer pressure?
That's beneath you, Rusty.

329
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:09,239
And I don't need a makeover.
I already have glasses.

330
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:12,015
It's about capturing the best
part of your nerd essence.

331
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,850
So let me get this straight.

332
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:17,125
You're a nerd, who wants
to look like a better nerd,

333
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:19,885
in order to attract
someone who's not a nerd.

334
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:23,453
You'd sing a different tune if you
experienced the magic of retouching

335
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:25,943
- for yourself.
- We don't believe in that in my church.

336
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,268
- Turns you blind.
- Is that why you need glasses?

337
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:29,701
Touché.

338
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:39,655
Look, if you're here
to yell at me again...

339
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:42,658
I'm sorry about that.
I wasn't being fair.

340
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,993
So you're here to apologize?

341
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:47,083
Kinda.

342
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,624
And to ask you how you deal
with the guilt. Because...

343
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:53,250
- Because why?
- Because I feel guilty, too.

344
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,937
About blowing me off
at Panhellenic?

345
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:59,508
For... burning down
the Gamma Psi house.

346
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:02,085
You burned down the
Gamma Psi house?

347
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,431
Inadvertently. But yes, kind of.
It was my idea.

348
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:09,397
We broke in, and you're the only person
on this campus who can understand.

349
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,103
So I need to know.

350
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,381
How do you deal with the guilt
of getting those Kts expelled?

351
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,482
Well... it happened.

352
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:21,600
And there's nothing I
can do about it now.

353
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,747
Well, the guilt is
eating away at me.

354
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,914
Especially because
Katherine is being so nice.

355
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:28,370
And the Zbzs are,
like, falling apart.

356
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,976
It's getting so bad
that I think I...

357
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:35,113
I think I have to confess.
Is it like that for you, too?

358
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:38,255
No. It's not. Because I know
why I did what I did.

359
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:41,021
- But people got hurt.
- And I feel sorry for them.

360
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:43,677
But how would confessing help?

361
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:45,889
Maybe if I explain
that it was an accident?

362
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:49,229
I should have {\probably}done that to begin with
and then everything would be fine.

363
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:52,862
Listen to me, Okay?
This is a big mistake.

364
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:55,862
Maybe it is. But I can't
live with it anymore.

365
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,027
Ashleigh.
You sure I don't look stupid?

366
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:16,496
Dale was making fun of me.

367
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:18,883
He's just jealous.
How could you look stupid?

368
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:22,007
- You look like a nerd. A chic one.
- There she is.

369
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:26,047
Go.

370
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,125
Work that sweater vest.

371
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:37,314
Do we know each other?

372
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:39,975
We talked in marketing
the other day...

373
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:42,198
about my engineering grant?

374
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:45,493
Right, the research guy.

375
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:48,700
- You look different.
- I didn't have glasses then.

376
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,780
I'm Rusty and this is for you.

377
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:54,373
A nerd auction.
The Zbzs are selling you guys?

378
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:59,523
- Will you be up for auction?
- I sure will be.

379
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:03,382
- Three o'clock.
- Then I'll definitely be there.

380
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:06,761
I'll see you then. Thanks.

381
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:18,615
- What an oddly-shaped room.
- Yeah, the trash chute cuts in a little,

382
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,924
but I'm the only one of us
displaced gals with a single.

383
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:24,299
- Presidential privilege?
- Yep!

384
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:27,289
So, I'm surprised to see you, Casey.

385
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:29,575
But I'm glad you're here
so we can clear the air.

386
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:32,828
Things got a little hostile last
semester and I really hate that.

387
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:35,541
The fire made me realize
what was really important,

388
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,529
so I was hoping we
could start fresh.

389
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:42,383
Funny you should mention the fire,

390
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,010
because I...

391
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:47,994
Look, Fiddler.

392
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,137
You were saying?

393
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:55,392
I was the one who broke
into the Gamma Psi house

394
00:21:55,652 --> 00:21:58,404
and lit the candle that started the
fire that burned the house down.

395
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:00,522
- But it was an accident!
- You what?

396
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:03,400
I know. I'm so sorry,
but I just meant to break in.

397
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,614
Why?

398
00:22:05,552 --> 00:22:08,233
I guess I was just so surprised
that Gamma Psi won SongFest, so...

399
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:09,883
You burned down our house?

400
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:13,076
But I'm here now,
and I am taking responsibility

401
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:15,495
and I am willing to
face the consequences.

402
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:19,875
I appreciate you coming forward.

403
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,629
I can only assume you're here
to try and make it up to us?

404
00:22:24,683 --> 00:22:26,970
Make it up to you? I guess...

405
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,096
Like how?

406
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:33,347
Wait, I have an idea.
You could give us your house.

407
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:36,007
- You mean, like, for the weekend?
- Don't be silly

408
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:38,731
How is that gonna help?
I mean until ours is rebuilt.

409
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,563
The contractor says it'll take a year
but you know how they are.

410
00:22:41,823 --> 00:22:43,899
Seems like a fair trade.
You burned ours down.

411
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,154
That's crazy.

412
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,486
Which seems like a big job
for such a slender girl.

413
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:50,788
I don't think you acted alone.

414
00:22:50,928 --> 00:22:52,881
- But I did.
- Not buying it.

415
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:55,957
So unless you want me to implicate
the entire ZBZ sisterhood,

416
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,918
you're gonna have to give up your house.
Then we'll call it even.

417
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:02,046
But we're doing
a philanthropy for you

418
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,002
And we really appreciate it.

419
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:19,897
Let me guess. You're staking our Prof
Dabia's car to flirt your way into class

420
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:22,950
Sex professors are
notoriously ambisexual.

421
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:25,119
So I figured I'd give it a shot.

422
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:26,795
Great minds think alike.

423
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,195
See, that's where we part ways, because
I would never think of dating Evan.

424
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:31,813
Why do you even care?

425
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,375
You and I barely talk, so who says
you have right to tell me what to do?

426
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,497
Maybe I don't.

427
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:39,259
But I do care about you and getting
involved with Evan would be

428
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,945
- a big mistake.
- If you really care about me

429
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,589
let me have the spot in class
and stop telling me what to do.

430
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,591
- Not a chance.
- Hi, Professor Dabia.

431
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,425
You kids these days are shameless.

432
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:13,905
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

433
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:17,060
I'm just trying to figure
out how to tell Ashleigh

434
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:19,494
I just lost the ZBZ house.
Or how to tell Cappie

435
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:22,706
that I'm getting expelled,
and I am talking to you about it.

436
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:27,924
- What happened?
- I confessed, and Natalie

437
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,322
wants the ZBZ house in exchange for her
silence. Of course she wants our house!

438
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:34,473
- How did I not see this coming?
- How could you, it's completely insane.

439
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,016
I know and I'm starting to think
Natalie is, too!

440
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,038
Having our house, on top of all the
sympathy they got from the fire,

441
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:42,772
is exactly what she wants right now.
She's hell-bent on keeping

442
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,731
Gamma Psi #1 and I'm still convinced
one of them, probably her,

443
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:49,860
- rigged SongFest.
- Well then, you know what?

444
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:53,653
- You might not be totally screwed.
- What do you mean?

445
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:56,691
Natalie clearly
doesn't want to turn you in.

446
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:59,628
It serves her needs to
work outside of the system.

447
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:02,204
So maybe you fight fire with fire.

448
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:06,227
That's bad choice of words.
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:08,483
What I'm trying to say is:
if you do think

450
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,012
that Natalie was up to something
shady during SongFest,

451
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:12,923
maybe you should
find out what it was.

452
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,095
It's a really good place to start.
Thanks, Evan.

453
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,964
Erika's not here yet.

454
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:44,429
Really? But you wore glasses.

455
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,818
Look, some of our ladies are here.

456
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,961
- What are you doing here?
- Ash, I didn't know you'd...

457
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,763
This is a private party. And my bar.

458
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:16,167
- Yeah, I'm sorry. We can just go.
- Good idea.

459
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,620
He looked puffy anyway.

460
00:26:26,803 --> 00:26:30,807
- Ashleigh, are you Okay?
- Yeah, I had to run into him sometime.

461
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:34,049
All right, guys, ready to do this?

462
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:40,181
Is it Diana?

463
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:42,996
Dana. For the second time.

464
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,558
She's here.

465
00:26:53,198 --> 00:26:54,831
Let's go.

466
00:26:57,235 --> 00:26:59,874
Good afternoon, everyone.

467
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:02,484
So let's get started.

468
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:08,773
OK, great. So, all the proceeds...

469
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:14,086
Ninety-five percent of the proceeds

470
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:17,756
go to help Gamma Psi rebuild
from their tragic fire.

471
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,975
So, ladies of CRU, why settle for
the same old fraternity guys?

472
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:27,056
Our nerds can impress your parents
and program your computers.

473
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:31,439
So, let's start with...
Rusty Cartwright.

474
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:41,371
Rusty is the winner of
an engineering grant.

475
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,623
Which is a really big deal.
He once built his own DVR

476
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,378
and look how cute he is.

477
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,647
- So, do I have any bidders?
- Twenty dollars!

478
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:53,928
- Twenty-five!
- Thirty!

479
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:56,506
Maybe I'll get two girls tonight.

480
00:27:58,148 --> 00:27:59,648
Nice.

481
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:02,189
- Forty dollars!
- Fifty dollars!

482
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:06,729
Going once, going twice
and sold to Erika from Tri-Pi.

483
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:14,768
How sweet.

484
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:18,874
But don't be fooled! He looks nice
but as soon as he gets a chance,

485
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:23,003
Rusty will cheat on you, just like every
other guy in the history of the planet!

486
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:33,160
Do we have thirty? Thirty for thi
sizzling electrical engineer?

487
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:37,289
What was that all about?
You sabotaged me in front of everyone.

488
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,942
You were supposed to
help me get a date.

489
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:44,071
One date with one girl But the minute
another girl bid on you,

490
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,282
- you were all over that.
- It's an auction. It was a joke!

491
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,264
Is this about Fisher?

492
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:54,233
- OK, I'm not Fisher.
- I'm starting to think

493
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:58,362
- all guys are potential Fishers.
- That's not fair.

494
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:01,317
I saw you blow off that science
girl who tried to talk to you.

495
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:04,213
You may be a nerd,
but you're not very nice.

496
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:07,781
- Yes, I am!
- And sold!

497
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:10,795
To the vixen with the
retainer in the front row.

498
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:18,594
My God!

499
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:23,746
In la flesh. Do I know you?

500
00:29:23,871 --> 00:29:26,313
I guess you could say I'm a fan.

501
00:29:26,438 --> 00:29:29,982
You're such a talented actor.
Are you rehearsing a new play?

502
00:29:30,107 --> 00:29:31,607
<i>Hair.</i>

503
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:34,487
Is that the one where
everyone gets naked?

504
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:38,616
It's so much more than that.
But yes, I will be nude in it.

505
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:41,195
Awesome.

506
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:45,231
Is it cheesy if I ask
you for your autograph?

507
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:48,133
You're kind of famous on campus.

508
00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:51,838
Weren't you one of the
celebrity SongFest judges?

509
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:55,964
I was going to ask you there,
but I got kind of star-struck.

510
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:59,185
- You were at SongFest.
- Yes.

511
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,884
And I'm wondering as an actor
and celebrity SongFest judge,

512
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:09,771
how does one, prepare?

513
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:13,754
- In the theater.
- And in SongFest judging?

514
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,855
It's all about authenticity.

515
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,857
For instance, last semester when I did
Fiddler,

516
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,610
I was able to transport myself to
fin de siècle tsarist Russia

517
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,895
by eating nothing but
beet soup for two months

518
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,024
- and growing a beard.
- "Fiddler"... on the Roof?

519
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,498
Yes. So, are we gonna
go get a drink, or what?

520
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:36,124
I'd love to, but won't Natalie mind?

521
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,253
Yeah, I think I saw you with her?
Isn't she your girlfriend?

522
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:45,169
No, I am single and available.
Natalie and I just made love.

523
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:49,306
In exchange for giving ZBZ
a zero in SongFest, right?

524
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:55,895
Sex as a negotiating
tactic in the theater is universal.

525
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,889
We're noas puritanical
as the rest of you.

526
00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:01,535
And you can't prove ything.

527
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,152
Maybe I can. It was so nice
to meet you.

528
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:15,068
I thought you might be a little
hungry after all that bidding.

529
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:19,378
That's nice,
but I'm actually on this cleanse.

530
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,843
No problem.

531
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:25,972
I wanna reassure you, despite what
Ashleigh said, I'm no cheater.

532
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:30,389
That's fine. So how's tomorrow night
Can you come by Tri-Pi around eight?

533
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:35,102
Eight is great. It's a date.

534
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,083
And don't forget your tools.

535
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,756
- Tools?
- A few of the other girls might

536
00:31:41,881 --> 00:31:45,137
need you, too. We all pooled our money
together to bid on you.

537
00:31:45,262 --> 00:31:49,266
- How many of you?
- 6, 7? You can start with my TiVo

538
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:53,244
I know Pam's laptop has been acting up
Would you also be willing to tutor?

539
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,274
Our house GPA sucks this year.

540
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,752
I can't believe we missed the nerd
auction. I always wanted my own nerd.

541
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:05,620
Maybe next year.

542
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:08,212
Easy for you to say. You have Rusty.

543
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:12,607
Bing just landed.

544
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,442
I don't like that look in your eye

545
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,386
You shouldn't have tried so
hard to get me not to date Evan.

546
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:30,490
You can have the spot in human
sexuality class. Just walk away.

547
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,971
I hate following orders.
Sorry, Cap.

548
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,586
I can't believe she's gonna hook
up with Chambers just to spite me.

549
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:41,785
When someone's a friend, you have
to let them make their own mistakes.

550
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,822
Like when you let
me lick that battery.

551
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:50,670
Three times.

552
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,762
It's good to see you.

553
00:32:58,887 --> 00:33:02,765
Yeah, sorry to leave
you hanging like that.

554
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,882
At the Fairy Tale Ball.
Maybe I can make it up to you?

555
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:09,778
You mean, like a date?

556
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,751
- Yeah, like a date.
- Then it's a date.

557
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,184
Thank you so much for meeting
me on such short notice.

558
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,009
Sorry.

559
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:36,680
I assume you're here
to offer me the ZBZ house?

560
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,241
We're waiting for
one other person to meet us.

561
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:43,370
Sorry I'm late.
So, what is this all about?

562
00:33:44,303 --> 00:33:47,943
I'm here to give you
my final report about the fire.

563
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,145
- Really?
- I really didn't need to investigate.

564
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:55,199
Because I know who started the fire.
I did.

565
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,328
But it was an accident. I was
investigating the SongFest judging.

566
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,865
That is not an excuse,
but I hope it's a mitigating factor

567
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,727
- and maybe someday you'll forgive me.
- For burning down my house?

568
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,203
Fair enough, fair enough.

569
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:10,573
I just couldn't stand keeping the
truth from you anymore.

570
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:13,534
Because I respect you so much.
So much, I think that there is

571
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,545
- something else you need to know.
- What could possibly top that?

572
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,848
I confessed everything
to Natalie yesterday

573
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:23,727
and in exchange, she blackmailed
me for the ZBZ house.

574
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:26,788
And she was so
obsessed with beating ZBZ

575
00:34:26,913 --> 00:34:29,454
that she slept with
Judge Ryan Yarlbrough

576
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:33,361
in exchange for Gamma
Psi's SongFest victory.

577
00:34:33,486 --> 00:34:36,631
Is that what all your provocative
lingerie is for?

578
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:39,867
You running around trading sexual
favors for Blue Ribbon points?

579
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:42,612
You may think you're above
sorority politics

580
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:45,840
but I am the one keeping us on top.
And you can't prove anything.

581
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:48,676
Those score sheets
burned in the fire.

582
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:52,650
Do you mean these score sheets?

583
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:58,219
Like I said,
do you mean these score sheets?

584
00:34:58,344 --> 00:35:00,955
- Where did you get those?
- Where else?

585
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,084
Your house, the night of the fire.
Looks like we both screwed up.

586
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,051
But if your mistake comes out,
Gamma Psi's reputation will be ruined.

587
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:11,150
Maybe for good.

588
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,898
I think before, you mentioned something
about

589
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:18,073
the possibility of calling it even?

590
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,399
Right?

591
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,886
And I was like:
"I burnt down your house by accident,

592
00:35:27,011 --> 00:35:29,084
but you're a devious slut
on purpose".

593
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,224
Cappie will be here any minute.

594
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:35,760
My God. So I can finally
tell the sisters it's over?

595
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,453
Yep. Katherine will never
speak to me again,

596
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:40,999
but there's nothing
I can do about that.

597
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:44,338
Can you believe Casey?
She's like a sorority vigilante!

598
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:48,470
I figured out a solution
to our Gamma Psi problem

599
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:50,826
and I had some help
from an unlikely source.

600
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:52,929
Hang on, I'm sorry.
I'm still imagining you

601
00:35:53,054 --> 00:35:55,813
as a sorority vigilante.
You're sweaty, hanging out in...

602
00:35:55,938 --> 00:35:59,929
a air-conditioning duct,
with your biceps just ripped to shreds.

603
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:01,054
It's sexy.

604
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:03,739
The unlikely source...

605
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:06,497
was Evan.
Don't be mad.

606
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,315
I thought he would understand.
You think what I did is different

607
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,895
than what he did, but let's face it.
You can't be objective

608
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,588
because you're my awesome boyfriend.

609
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:19,092
What is with the women in my life
giving this douche endless 2nd chances?

610
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:20,886
The women in your life?

611
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,181
That came out wrong.
I meant Rebecca.

612
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:26,683
That really came out wrong.

613
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:30,833
Okay, when you were asking Ev's
for advice,

614
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,898
I was trying to give some
to Rebecca.

615
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,168
Advice, that is.

616
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:37,569
Give some advice
to stay away from Evan,

617
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,279
and she wouldn't listen.

618
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,436
Rebecca not listen to someone
telling her what to do?

619
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:43,784
I'm shocked.

620
00:36:44,394 --> 00:36:46,620
Is that weird for you?
Me and Rebecca talking?

621
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,122
We both might get into
that human sexuality class.

622
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,584
Human sexuality? Perfect!

623
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,170
And why would it be weird for me?

624
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:57,548
It's not weird for you
that I talked to Evan?

625
00:36:58,525 --> 00:36:59,591
Of course not.

626
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,010
I mean,
that would make me a hypocrite.

627
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:05,076
Yeah. It's not weird. It's normal.

628
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:09,393
So normal, it's mundane!
Yeah, I'm bored by it.

629
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:13,420
All these girls are fawning over me,

630
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:15,645
but to Erika, I was just a nerd.

631
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,880
I warned you.

632
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:20,946
I, on the other hand, had a great night
with Bridget the biomedical engineer.

633
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:23,758
Sure, she's got a couple
of facial tics,

634
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:25,770
but they were only
mildly off-putting.

635
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:28,693
And that retainer comes out,
if you know what I mean.

636
00:37:28,818 --> 00:37:30,068
No, not really.

637
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:32,913
I hate to rub it in,
but I'm{\actually} going to meet her now.

638
00:37:33,038 --> 00:37:36,169
Gonna use some of my cut
from the auction to buy her a coco.

639
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:39,923
See ya.

640
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:51,059
I'm sorry for not remembering
your name at Dobler's.

641
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:55,718
Well, you should be sorry.

642
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,724
We actually have a lot in common.

643
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:01,945
And did you know that I've had a crush
on you since we met at orientation?

644
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:03,460
Of course not!

645
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:06,235
I liked you even
when you were The Anchor.

646
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:08,774
You did?

647
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:12,739
Guys like you are the reason my mother
wanted me to be a kindergarten teacher.

648
00:38:12,864 --> 00:38:13,832
Wait, what?

649
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,648
Kindergarten teachers
are girly and nonthreatening.

650
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:19,494
But, oh boy,
you become a female engineer

651
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,215
and you just sentence yourself
to dying alone in a lab!

652
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,857
- I don't want you to die.
- Because even guys who are dorks,

653
00:38:24,982 --> 00:38:28,847
like you, they think they're too good
for you and want, you know,

654
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,870
some hot sorority chick instead!

655
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:34,058
Where does that leave
girls like me, Rusty?

656
00:38:34,183 --> 00:38:37,356
Yes, I know I'm a little off-putting
when you first meet me.

657
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,651
And yes, I had a lazy eye
until corrective surgery at age ten.

658
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,669
And yes, I have two pet salamanders,
which some people find weird, and...

659
00:38:44,794 --> 00:38:48,155
sometimes I have gum in my mouth
and it falls out while I'm talking!

660
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,326
But, you know...

661
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:53,164
does that mean I don't deserve
a chance from a fellow nerd?

662
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,258
That I'm not worth getting to know?

663
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:57,292
Because I'm not just a nerd, Rusty.

664
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,808
I'm a woman.

665
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,583
I'm a woman with needs.

666
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:09,858
I will never forget your name again.

667
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,234
Maybe I could...

668
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:16,003
buy you a cup of coffee?

669
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,346
Are you freaking kidding me?
You blew it, Rusty.

670
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:21,971
It is way too late!

671
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:30,242
Sorry I'm late, brethren.
I was just delivering a crowning baby...

672
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:37,106
Am I in the wrong
abandoned water pumping station?

673
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:39,292
Looks like we're both out.

674
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:03,907
Hi.

675
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,702
Sorry I yelled at you.

676
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:09,208
In front of every girl in school.

677
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:14,161
How did it go with Erika anyway?

678
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,245
It didn't.

679
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,529
And Ash, I should have been
more sensitive

680
00:40:18,654 --> 00:40:20,792
to how it felt for you
to have to see Fisher.

681
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,670
You deserve so much better
than that jerk.

682
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:25,338
Thanks.

683
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,300
Maybe I should have bid
on a nerd myself.

684
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,168
Nerds can be jerks, too.

685
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,972
I've been a jerk. You know
that engineering girl from Dobler's?

686
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,740
She liked me for a year and a half
and I didn't even notice.

687
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:40,812
She's awkward when you first meet her,
but so am I.

688
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:44,328
I'm sure you can get her
to give you another chance.

689
00:40:44,453 --> 00:40:46,860
I think she has too much
self-respect for that.

690
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,228
Well, then she's missing out.

691
00:40:49,353 --> 00:40:51,999
Because any girl
would be lucky to have you.

692
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:57,077
You're welcome.

693
00:40:58,213 --> 00:41:00,463
I can't believe you got us both in.

694
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:03,736
- So Professor Dabia's straight.
- Oh, no. He's gay.

695
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,679
Sorry, you're not his type.

696
00:41:06,804 --> 00:41:09,298
- But he thinks I'm fabulous.
- Of course.

697
00:41:09,882 --> 00:41:12,302
And Casey really won't mind us
both being in a sex class?

698
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,162
I'd tell you how much she trusts me,
but I don't want you to vomit

699
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:17,640
- all over yourself before class.
- Thanks.

700
00:41:17,765 --> 00:41:21,520
Speaking of Casey,
she said I have to apologize to you.

701
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:25,290
I'm supposed to let the women
in my life make their own choices

702
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:27,624
when it comes to the people
they associate with.

703
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:30,899
Even if those people are douches
like Evan Chambers.

704
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:32,901
Fine.

705
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,526
Tell Casey I accept.

706
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,318
You going out with Chambers or not?

707
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:40,825
- So much for butting out.
- All right. Fine.

708
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,551
But just know, as your man friend,

709
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:45,220
I will be there when he inevitably
screws you over.

710
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:46,895
Don't worry about it.

711
00:41:48,931 --> 00:41:49,981
But thanks.

712
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:54,838
Hi.

713
00:41:58,259 --> 00:41:59,376
I'm here to return

714
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:02,752
my VPJ clipboard and I'm assuming
you'll need to replace me.

715
00:42:02,877 --> 00:42:03,883
Indeed.

716
00:42:08,978 --> 00:42:10,527
Okay, I'm just gonna...

717
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,156
Which is a shame, considering you are
clearly clever enough for the job,

718
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,491
given the way you bluffed
Natalie yesterday.

719
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,967
- What do you mean?
- I know those were not

720
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:22,747
the real judges' score sheets,
because that was not my clipboard.

721
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:27,085
Yours is hidden... too well.
I couldn't find it.

722
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,297
So I bought an identical one.

723
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:32,841
I'm... How did you know?

724
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,932
The spring on mine
is slightly rusted.

725
00:42:35,057 --> 00:42:38,513
It makes a very appealing
sproingy sound when opened.

726
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,266
And I miss it.

727
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:42,809
Sorry.

728
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:46,855
So, you're not gonna turn me in?
Why?

729
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:49,983
Can't you see the headline?
"Sorority Mayhem.

730
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,110
Sexual favors and fiery revenge".

731
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:54,840
Lifetime would probably make
several movie adaptations

732
00:42:54,965 --> 00:42:57,699
and they'd hire some mannish starlet
to play me because I'm tall.

733
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,536
- I don't need that kind of publicity.
- Right.

734
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,751
I bet I could find your clipboard,
if I keep looking.

735
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:10,837
You know what? Don't bother.
