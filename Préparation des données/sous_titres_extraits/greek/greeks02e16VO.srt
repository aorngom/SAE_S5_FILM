1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,334
<i>Previously.</i>

2
00:00:01,503 --> 00:00:03,085
I'll always be here to protect you.

3
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:06,589
Proud to be
your Zeta Beta Zeta big sis.

4
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:09,792
You know, it's been four months
since we broke up.

5
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:12,708
So, you can officiallyly categorize me
as a a friend.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,139
I met a girl. She's beautiful,
and smart, and funny.

7
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:17,391
That's great.

8
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:21,462
- Did your girl ever show up?
- I just met this awesome chick.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,315
You're dating
Rusty's little brother.

10
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,776
Oh, my God, you totally like him.

11
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:29,623
What happened, Evan?
Why'd you cheat on me?

12
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:32,347
It can really make you crazy
when you doubt

13
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:34,867
whether the people close
to you really care about you.

14
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:37,761
- I'm sorry it didn't work out.
- Me, too.

15
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:40,706
I got accepted to grad school.
Caltech, in California.

16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,327
I turned down the grant
so I can stay at CRU with Casey.

17
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:46,237
She doesn't know. You can't tell her.
I don't want her to feel some

18
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:47,505
kind of obligation.

19
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:50,011
- I love you, Casey.
- I love you, too.

20
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:56,050
Aren't weddings great?

21
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:59,462
The promise of renewal,
unlimited possibilities...

22
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:03,013
- lots of wedding cake.
- I look like a walking glow stick.

23
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:05,327
Actually, you look like...

24
00:01:07,697 --> 00:01:09,482
Not really, exactly.

25
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:10,869
It's more like...

26
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:13,670
Remember when you told me
my hair looked better down?

27
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:15,325
Or when I doubted that gamma rays

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,414
could've really turned
Bruce Banner into the Hulk?

29
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:19,161
Because there's no
scientific evidence

30
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,164
- to indicate...
- My point is, we've always been honest.

31
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:24,323
The dress is horrible

32
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:25,937
and it's too long, right?

33
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:28,921
Unless I strap on stilts, I'm going
to stumble my way down the aisle.

34
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,619
I...

35
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:32,466
love you?

36
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,552
Nice save.

37
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,401
I wish I could be as enthusiastic as you
about Kiki's wedding.

38
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:40,885
Don't get me wrong,

39
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,805
I'm really happy my grand-big-sis
is coming back to ZBZ

40
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,856
and getting married.
But the fact that Kiki's little sis...

41
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,031
Is Frannie?

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,651
I'd feel better if my dress
was made of Kevlar.

43
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:57,710
When I first tried it on,
I thought... munchkin couture.

44
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:00,727
Then I remembered
you were invited, too.

45
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,551
Andy's not here.
The football team's in Wisconsin.

46
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,835
I know. I'm here to see you.

47
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,076
The house is really quiet.

48
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,019
Nap time.
From 6:00 to 8:00,

49
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,313
the KT house
is the quietest place on campus.

50
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:31,437
Are you up for a wedding?

51
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:32,978
With you?

52
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:37,674
I'm still a little fuzzy
on the details, but apparently

53
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,587
Casey's grand sis...

54
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:42,249
- Your great-grand sis.
- OK, sure.

55
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:44,201
She's coming back to get married, 

56
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:47,113
which means I need
an escort to the wedding.

57
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,390
No, can't. I'm sorry.

58
00:02:50,058 --> 00:02:53,847
- I'm gonna be defibrillating a...
- Transpolymer orgasmitroid?

59
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:55,970
I looked that up.

60
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:59,376
Not only does it sound dirty,
but it doesn't exist.

61
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:03,265
Come on Rusty, I told Andy
I hate going to these things by myself.

62
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,434
Plus, it would be way more fun
with a friend.

63
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:10,075
I know. Right, we're friends.
And Andy's my little brother, but...

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Thank you.

65
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,109
I was looking at that last night.

66
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,941
"Sacred and Profane Love,"
by Titian.

67
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,444
"Forbidden desires
and earthly wants."

68
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,657
So, eternal happiness in heaven

69
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:26,052
versus fleeting happiness on earth.

70
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:30,556
- I guess you have to choose.
- That's a toughie.

71
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:33,605
I'm going to have to think about it.

72
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,165
I was so sleepy.

73
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,000
VO: -Ori-, Arrow,
Jujuleder, Walid20-101

74
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,480
seriessub.com/sub-way.fr

75
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:55,444
I don't even know Kiki,
why do I have to go to her wedding?

76
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:57,603
Kiki loves ZBZ.

77
00:03:57,728 --> 00:04:00,809
She practically bleeds pink.
And we're her direct descendents,

78
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:04,410
which is why she wants both of you to be
at her bachelorette party and wedding.

79
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,697
I'm getting married!
Are you so excited?

80
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,817
- My God! I'm so excited!
- Me too.

81
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:18,613
It's so beautiful.

82
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:22,374
Four carats, D color, flawless.
It's no big thing.

83
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:25,510
I read in my psychology class that men
who spend large amounts of money

84
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:27,446
on women
are over-compensating for small...

85
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:30,697
And this is Rebecca.
She's your great-grand little sis.

86
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,858
Great-grand big sis Kiki.
We've heard so much about you.

87
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:40,112
And you must be Jordan,
my new great-grand little.

88
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,658
Which actually makes me feel really old.
I know. You can both call me Bubby.

89
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,202
Cause calling you Kiki
would be so weird.

90
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,121
I'll... go help Ashleigh
with your luggage.

91
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:56,383
It's so great to be back
in the old house again.

92
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:59,350
And really sweet that my little sis
could come pick me up.

93
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,659
- Where are you going, Frannie?
- Maybe Frannie forgot to mention

94
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:04,536
this tiny morsel of ZBZ history that

95
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,402
she  tried to torpedo the house

96
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:08,798
by starting a rival sorority
across the street.

97
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,477
Maybe I wouldn't have done
it if ZBZ wasn't falling apart.

98
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:12,561
Is that true?

99
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,919
And who was responsible for that,
Fran-Fran?

100
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:17,816
- Sure, blame me because...
- Will you two bitches just shut up?

101
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:22,154
Don't you forget this is my wedding, not
some stupid-ass date-dash at Dobler's.

102
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,995
And if either of you
screw up my big day,

103
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,406
I will personally rip off your heads

104
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:29,938
and tinkle down your necks. Got it?

105
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,372
Got it.

106
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:35,824
Because weddings
are supposed to be special

107
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,499
and filled with love.

108
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:39,745
And this is doubly-special
because I can come back here

109
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,674
and share it with my entire
ZBZ family,

110
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,925
and all my littles.

111
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:45,600
Which brings me to you.

112
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:48,628
On my way in, the flower shop called and
they're not able to deliver the flowers.

113
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:50,528
I need you to pick them up.

114
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:56,039
- We're almost done Kiki.
- Thanks Ash, you're the best.

115
00:05:56,164 --> 00:05:58,675
- Bring help. It's a lot of flowers.
- Maybe you could take Rebecca?

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,234
Still helping with the luggage.

117
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,123
It's all right.
I'll just call Rusty.

118
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:05,986
He's going to the wedding with me.
I'm sure helping won't be a big deal.

119
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:07,992
Hold on. Rusty's your date?

120
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:12,663
Let's see what you've done
with the house.

121
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:16,250
It's so much stuff.
Here, let's start in the kitchen.

122
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,240
Before we continue the Kappa Tau

123
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:21,677
"I am drunk, and how do I get back
to Kappa Tau before I pass out" tour,

124
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:23,852
does anyone have any questions?

125
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:26,370
Moving on.
To your right, Marty's Deli.

126
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:27,990
Daytime, avoid the pastrami.

127
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:31,233
Nighttime,
ignore the blinking red and green sign.

128
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,855
Many a beery-eyed KT
has been stuck for hours,

129
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,938
unsure whether to stop or go.

130
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,037
- That'd be me.
- To your left, a public restroom

131
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,418
for emergency pit stops in case
you can't make it back to the house.

132
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:45,679
- That's an alley.
- That's why there are no stalls.

133
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:48,767
If you look ahead,
you'll see the Espresso Farm and...

134
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:51,547
Robin Wylie.

135
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,011
CRU grad, ZBZ alum.
God, I had such a crush on her.

136
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:58,512
She purty.

137
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,911
Strike everything
after the Espresso Farm.

138
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,036
Beaver, finish the expedition.

139
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,588
The last time,
I got lost on the way home.

140
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:07,825
Seriously?

141
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,040
You've gotta stop drinking
in the middle of the day.

142
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:13,412
I'm not drinking, I just have
no sense of direction.

143
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:15,787
We need to work on that, don't we?

144
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:24,258
As I live and breathe heavily.

145
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:27,488
You look great.
Not a day over...

146
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:30,032
Twenty-four. And you are?

147
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,489
You don't remember me?

148
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:36,955
I was that dashing freshmen
at Kappa Tau.

149
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,208
You were a dreamy senior.
Remember?

150
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:43,796
Crazy Cappie?

151
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,924
Fun, sexy Cappie?

152
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,967
No, to all three.

153
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,508
Wait. Now, I do.

154
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,792
You were that scrawny kid
with the funny hair

155
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:55,933
who dated one of our pledges
until she dumped you.

156
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,485
The one who stood outside
our house in a trench coat,

157
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,878
holding a boom box over your head,
playing Peter Gabriel.

158
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:05,292
- Or... maybe that was someone else.
- No, that'd be me.

159
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,570
Personally, I appreciated
the movie reference.

160
00:08:09,673 --> 00:08:10,489
Really?

161
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:12,953
So what brings you back to Cyprus?

162
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:16,776
Besides a chance to fulfill old
fantasies. Specifically, mine.

163
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,986
My pledge sister's getting married
on campus this weekend,

164
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:22,143
and I'm just back for the wedding.

165
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:25,291
If you're looking for a date,

166
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,382
I know someone
who's completely available.

167
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,119
I prefer flying solo at weddings.

168
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,680
You never know
who you're gonna go home with.

169
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:42,396
I've gotta get to that wedding.

170
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,898
- You're crazy.
- No, It makes total sense.

171
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,773
If I go to the wedding with Jordan
and keep my feelings in check,

172
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:50,712
then I can finally stop worrying
about doing something stupid.

173
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:52,727
- Like tell her how you feel?
- Exactly.

174
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:55,487
"That which does not kill us
makes us stronger."

175
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:56,612
Nietzsche.

176
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,927
Nietzsche never had to go to a wedding
with his little brother's girlfriend.

177
00:09:00,052 --> 00:09:01,914
Are you saying I can't do this?

178
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,918
Nietzsche knew better than to tempt
himself with moonlight, a beautiful girl

179
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,290
and wedding cake.

180
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:08,845
You're right. I'm crazy.

181
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:12,759
What do I know? I'm not exactly
an expert on these kinda things.

182
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,017
In fact, I was kinda hoping
you could help me out.

183
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:17,325
I've been thinking,
if I'm gonna ask Casey...

184
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,317
if we're gonna take our relationship
to the next level,

185
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:23,058
- It's time I tell her about Caltech.
- What do you mean "next level?"

186
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:26,607
That's where I need you. I have some
questions about the Greek system.

187
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:27,733
<i>Bonne grippe.</i>

188
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,861
This is embarrassing, but to get home,
do we go left or right on Briarwood?

189
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:38,903
- Right.
- OK, thanks.

190
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:41,476
Pledges.

191
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:44,583
I want the leads to set anchor bolts
and belays for a pendulum swing.

192
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:45,929
Do it quickly.

193
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:48,879
'Cause if we're not home by nightfall,
we will sleep on this mountain!

194
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,519
I feel sorry for her husband.

195
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,507
Actually, I feel sorry
for anyone dumb enough to get married.

196
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:58,689
"Bonds of holy matrimony," my ass.

197
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:01,183
My parents are still happy.

198
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,310
Maybe they want you to think that.

199
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,229
So, last night's date
didn't go well?

200
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:08,565
When he saw "coming attractions,"
he thought it was his cue to feel me up.

201
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:14,385
- You know what your problem is?
- I'm too hot.

202
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,739
You are a guy fang.

203
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,105
And since Fisher is writing
a paper this weekend,

204
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,904
I happen to have a ton
of free time on my hands.

205
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,163
I am going to find you
a slump-buster.

206
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,291
A boy friend to jump-start
your hormonal happiness.

207
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:34,521
- Oh, my God, I missed you so much.
- You're so grown up.

208
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:38,257
This is Robin Wylie, my big sis.

209
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:40,389
And reluctant wedding guest.

210
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,057
Robin, this is Rebecca Logan,
Casey's little sis.

211
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:45,515
And even more reluctant
wedding guest.

212
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,090
- Where are my suitcase?
- I'll be right there!

213
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:52,261
Don't worry. A boyfriend
is on the way.

214
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,581
Things haven't changed
at all at ZBZ.

215
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:57,823
Kiki spent years trying
to find me Mr. Right.

216
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,907
What happened?

217
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:01,201
Nothing stuck.

218
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,592
First it was the crappy bridesmaid dress
and now Frannie's trying

219
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:08,691
to take over the bachelorette party.

220
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:11,012
- She is Kiki's little sister.
- Really?

221
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,896
I've been thinking about that,
and since she de-pledged ZBZ,

222
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:17,551
she's technically more like
Kiki's illegitimate step-sibling.

223
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:19,864
Funny.

224
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:21,928
Really.

225
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,907
You know when you said it's important
we're honest with each other?

226
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:28,312
That we don't have secrets?

227
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:32,109
I knew it. You're finally going to admit
that my dress is ugly, aren't you?

228
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,942
- Of course not.
- So, you like my dress?

229
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,432
Actually, I hate it.
No, what I'm trying to say...

230
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:38,238
I can't believe you hate it.

231
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,575
I lied to you about graduate school.

232
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:44,911
I was accepted to Caltech,
got a full-ride scholarship.

233
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,371
But, I turned it down.

234
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:49,643
Why... would you do that?

235
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:51,918
Because I wanted to be with you.

236
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,123
And you were so set against having
a long-distance relationship.

237
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,176
I know this is a lot to dump on you,

238
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,800
and I know it's unfair.

239
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:04,485
I had to tell you in order for us
to move forward with our relationship.

240
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,996
You seem to be handling
Max's news pretty well.

241
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:30,643
If it were me,
I'd be a little freaked out right now.

242
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:32,829
It's fine. I mean,

243
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:35,921
Max not going to Caltech
was unbelievably romantic, right?

244
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:39,312
Figures Frannie
dump the party favors on us,

245
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:41,481
so she could go
and decocorate Dobler's by herself.

246
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:45,597
I know what Max did was romantic,
but it was also...

247
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:48,477
a little crazy, right?

248
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,259
I mean, giving up everything for
someone you've only known for a month?

249
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:54,398
But you guys are perfect together.

250
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:57,692
We are perfect together.

251
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,364
It's amazing how many things made
for a bachelorette party resemble...

252
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:05,659
That one's huge.

253
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:09,957
Are you sure
you're OK with what Max did?

254
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:11,669
Of course.

255
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,950
I'm fine with it.

256
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:18,338
I'm not.
I'm confused.

257
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:22,144
I mean, I love him,
but what Max did...

258
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,262
is kinda overwhelming.

259
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,933
- It was romantic, wonderful...
- And a little freaky?

260
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,679
That too.

261
00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:54,515
Thanks again for helping me.

262
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,870
- It's been fun hanging out.
- Yeah, sure it's Fun.

263
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,967
We're here to pick up the flowers
for the philbrick wedding.

264
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,640
I was hoping you wouldn't show.

265
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:14,069
- Why not?
- 'Cause there's nothing to pick up.

266
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,064
I kinda messed up the delivery date.

267
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,075
You wrote it down for next year?

268
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,795
Well...
I got the month right.

269
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:28,658
If you come back, same time,
in a year from now...

270
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,368
We need whatever you have today.

271
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:33,929
Well, I have a nice funeral wreath.

272
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:36,303
Turned out the dude
wasn't terminal after all.

273
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,413
Wait,
I think I also got a bon voyage basket.

274
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:41,880
I'll go check.

275
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,731
I guess you better call kiki
and tell her problem.

276
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:51,351
Are you kidding? She scares
the crap out of me.

277
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,808
No, I have to handle this on my own.

278
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:55,433
That's not your fault.

279
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:58,770
Yeah, I know, but I still feel like
an outsider in the house.

280
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:01,825
I just want to prove to casey
that I belong.

281
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:03,818
Dumb, right?

282
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:05,720
No, not dumb at all.

283
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,090
You know, I think there's
a flower shop on elm street.

284
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:14,479
So, no one under five feet.
Vegetarians, maybe. Vegans, no.

285
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Hair?

286
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:17,158
Right.

287
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,344
Head yes, back no. Perfect.

288
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:23,338
- That enough for your profile.
- An internet ad?

289
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:25,543
How desperate do you think I am?

290
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:29,123
You don't want me to answer that.
But don't worry, your picture is hot

291
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:30,851
and I'll weed out the pervs.

292
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,379
If this doesn't work,
I'll find you a boyfriend.

293
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:36,601
Lots of eligible bachelors,
an open bar... I can't miss.

294
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:38,979
Don't worry.

295
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:44,943
I have been looking for you.

296
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:48,572
They have these things now
called phones. They work pretty well.

297
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:50,859
- We're friends, right?
- Yes...

298
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,983
just friends, only friends,
friends who can tell anything, right?

299
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,939
What do you want?

300
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:59,165
Get me on the guest list
to the wedding.

301
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,418
It's a wedding,
not a date-dash at Dobler's.

302
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,964
Guess I'll have to go as a waiter,
or a chef or something.

303
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:09,134
Why are you fixated
on going to this wedding?

304
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:10,601
Robin Wylie.

305
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,971
She's way out of your league.

306
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,474
Then, cliché as it is,
I'm gonna have to crash that wedding.

307
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:18,860
I have a better idea.

308
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,643
What if you come as my date?

309
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,340
Your date?

310
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:26,860
Do you think that's a good idea,
considering everything?

311
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:30,226
Look, I've been doing
a lot of soul searching lately,

312
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,847
and the one thing I do know
is that you're a way better friend

313
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:33,908
than boyfriend.

314
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,203
Not that the sex wasn't spectacular.

315
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:41,039
For a moment there,
you scared my big buddy.

316
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:43,406
- Actually, I like to call
- Edward the third, I know.

317
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:45,501
My point is, you'll
be doing me a favor.

318
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:48,678
If ashleigh gets too carried away
trying to find me a guyat the wedding,

319
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:51,266
I can use you as my cover.
And if she actually finds me one,

320
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:52,295
I'll dump you.

321
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:55,161
Sounds good to me.

322
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:56,415
Toast on.

323
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,933
You eat that, I'll rip off your head
and tinkle down your neck.

324
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,542
Something I learned from my bubby.

325
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:08,743
If this doesn't work,
we're gonna be stealing daffodils

326
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:10,303
from people's front yards.

327
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,137
- It's not looking good.
- No.

328
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:14,542
Excuse me.

329
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:18,203
We have a big emergency.

330
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,622
We need flowers for a wedding...

331
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,795
I'm sorry. The only flowers left are
for the rosenberg bar mitzvah.

332
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:27,003
Not that they care about flowers.

333
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:30,987
It's juste for something together.
"Sure, why not."

334
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,377
Honey, we don't have to get married.

335
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,466
We can wait.

336
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,825
No, we will wait.

337
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,291
For, "Without the sweet perfume

338
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:44,854
of nature's greatest gift."

339
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:52,051
"We wouldn't have each other?"

340
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:56,164
Because, "Flowers are just
rainbows you can take with you."

341
00:17:57,735 --> 00:18:00,495
That's... what I've always thought.

342
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:05,119
- "A Nose, by any other name..."
- "Would smell as sweet."

343
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,850
"A daisy's petal
is a true love's kiss..."

344
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:10,767
You make such a perfect couple.

345
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:13,971
"Perfect, and eternal."

346
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:22,563
Stop it.

347
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:24,247
Stop it.

348
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,772
Our car's out back.

349
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:38,423
- Are you OK?
- We got the flowers,

350
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:39,904
it's time to go home.

351
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:41,789
We'll make it just in time.

352
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,030
We did good, didn't we?

353
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,333
We're like the bonnie
and clyde of botany.

354
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:50,103
The cops are running scared

355
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:52,296
'cause no daffodil is safe

356
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,466
- when Bonnie and...
- Rusty?

357
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:57,150
- Call me clyde.
- OK. Clyde,

358
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:01,181
you're looking red and blotchy.

359
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,225
So are you Bonnie

360
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,105
And my throat's constricting.

361
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:13,234
Mine, too.

362
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:23,786
You have danced on a table.
Check.

363
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,622
You have flirted with a bartender...

364
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,125
Check.
You flashed a complete stranger.

365
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,722
Double-check.

366
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:36,090
- That's some potent lemonade.
- I pre-gamed back at the house.

367
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:42,885
- The scavenger hunt?
- Sorry. Only two items to go.

368
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:46,421
Next up, you have to confess
the craziest thing your hubby-to-be

369
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:47,727
has ever done.

370
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,771
To me or for me?

371
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,776
Let's start with "for you."

372
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:55,280
C'mon, bubby. Spill it.

373
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,947
He has my name tattooed
on his right butt cheek.

374
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,621
Frannie, your turn.
What's evan done for you?

375
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:11,936
There're so many things.

376
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,233
I wouldn't know where to start.

377
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,297
Suit yourself. Casey?

378
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:22,934
Max turned down caltech

379
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,933
just to go to graduate school at cru,
so he could be with me.

380
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:33,273
That is the most romantic thing
I've heard in my entire life.

381
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,733
- It is?
- That's so awesome!

382
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,826
- Really?
- Yeah, I guess that's awesome.

383
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:41,954
It's great. He really loves you.

384
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:45,506
Really great.

385
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,188
That's beautiful.

386
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:50,187
Really heartwarming.
OK, last one.

387
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,719
The lucky bride-to-be has to...

388
00:20:57,685 --> 00:20:58,631
Kiss a girl.

389
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:08,933
It has to be a real kiss.

390
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,020
Tongue optional.

391
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,358
What a wimp.

392
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,409
- Like you'd do it?
- Maybe I would.

393
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:21,029
Or, maybe you'd chicken out too...

394
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,574
All right bakmachin show's over. 

395
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:53,132
To the bachelorette party!

396
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Cheers.

397
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,163
OK, let's see.

398
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:04,821
Wait, here we go.

399
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,105
How about this?

400
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,827
No. Yeah, you're right. Of course.

401
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,073
She's older,
she's wiser to the ways of the world.

402
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:16,445
I need something that says
sophisticacated, yetet amoral. L.

403
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:21,047
Maybe I shohould lose some of
my jewelry. What do you think?

404
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:23,371
Hello?

405
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:25,246
Sure.

406
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,231
- Is something wrong?
- No.

407
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,055
Everything's great.

408
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:32,978
- I've just been thinking...
- When you're done think I need help.

409
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,113
What're your thoughts
on seersucucker?

410
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:39,579
I want you to kiss me.

411
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:44,595
- I thought we were gonna be friends.
- I don't mean it like that.

412
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:47,033
I just want you to kiss me.

413
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:50,216
It starts with a kiss,
and the next thing you know...

414
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,672
Well?

415
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:06,718
Interesting.

416
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:10,607
Thanks.

417
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:14,306
And I'd go with the navy blue.

418
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,906
- Not the navy whites?
- No!

419
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:24,927
I thought about what I said...

420
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:27,775
nine out of ten sorority girls
agree what you did

421
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,074
was the most
romantic thing anyone has ever done.

422
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:33,071
- What do you think?
- I'm voting with the majority.

423
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,849
- OK, then I have one more surprise...
- I'm too drunk, too tired.

424
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:39,406
Tonight, I just want you.

425
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,021
Who knew we were both
severely allergic to hydrangeas.

426
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,274
I guess the enclosed space
pushed the pollen count

427
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:01,439
to astronomically-high levels.

428
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,122
Weird.

429
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,113
If Andy ever wants to get me a gift,
tell him to with teddy bears.

430
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,455
What if he asks about chocolate?

431
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,488
Chocolate is also on my list
of taboo ingestibles.

432
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:15,286
Really? Same with me.

433
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:18,164
Funny. It's like they...

434
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,016
Cut us out of the same
immune-deficient cloth.

435
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,992
I'm not afraid of much,
but needles and iguanas freak me out.

436
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:29,115
OK. Clench your fist for me.

437
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,719
It's their claws.

438
00:24:32,302 --> 00:24:33,302
Thanks.

439
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:35,762
Anytime.

440
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,476
It's just gonna hurt a little.

441
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:40,978
There you go.

442
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:44,949
Have you seen my shoes?
I swear, I left them in the bag.

443
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:47,141
- Can we talk?
- Not right now, no.

444
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:50,078
- But, I have something for you.
- Unless they're bright green, size 8,

445
00:24:50,203 --> 00:24:52,077
with a three inch wedge,
I'm not interested.

446
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:53,616
I think you'll like this more.

447
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,528
Doubtful, since kiki is
pretty particular about footwear.

448
00:25:01,745 --> 00:25:03,876
You know when I said
weddings were about renewal,

449
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,641
about limitless possibilities?

450
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,564
- That got me thinking about us...
- Please get up...

451
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:10,133
Wait. Let me finish this.

452
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:13,344
I know we've only known each other
for a short time,

453
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,221
but I also know how
I feel about you.

454
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:19,850
And I think
I know how you feel about me, too.

455
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:23,062
- Not now, max.
- What? What's wrong?

456
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:25,489
- That.
- But you haven't seen it yet.

457
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:35,533
- That's a lavaliere.
- What did you think it was?

458
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,369
Kiki's threatening to break our knee
caps unless we get into the van now.

459
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:52,470
- Kiki's more unstable than usual, so...
- We better go.

460
00:25:53,078 --> 00:25:53,885
Look!

461
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:00,725
All right. Max, I love you,
and I'll see you at the wedding.

462
00:26:01,113 --> 00:26:02,184
We'll talk then.

463
00:26:07,718 --> 00:26:09,477
Bubby should be happy.

464
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:12,033
We got the flowers
and it only took 19 hours.

465
00:26:12,158 --> 00:26:14,133
And no one got hurt.

466
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:15,919
Matt did.

467
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,783
- Matt?
- Rosenberg?

468
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:20,410
He's not gonna have flowers
for his big day.

469
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:25,332
The way I see it, we saved his ass.
Pink hydrangeas for a bar mitzvah?

470
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,167
He'd have died of embarrassment.

471
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,545
At least we know where to pick
up a funeral wreath, cheap.

472
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:34,230
You should probably get back
to your apartment.

473
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:35,968
You should go in.

474
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,905
And I'll see you in two hours,
wearing a dress.

475
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,102
Trust me, that doesn't happen
very often.

476
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,812
Do I have permission to tease you?

477
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,880
As long as I can hit
you as hard as I can.

478
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,609
Nope. Teasing's out.

479
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:53,408
Good choice.

480
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:57,865
Thanks for everything.

481
00:26:58,269 --> 00:26:59,999
Please, what're friends for?

482
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:11,352
- I'm sorry. I don't know why I...
- No, that's OK.

483
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:14,649
That's the way the french
say good-bye... to friends.

484
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,346
- Really?
- Sure. Come on.

485
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,971
You kiss me. I kiss you back.

486
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,056
- OK.
- It's no big deal.

487
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:37,557
I'll see you later.

488
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,825
Right, later.

489
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:52,694
Dearly beloved,

490
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:56,123
we are gathered here this day
to celebrate the joining together

491
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:00,412
of kiki philbrick and charlie german
in the bond of holy matrimony.

492
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:06,192
Kiki, do you take charlie to be your
lawfully-wedded husband,

493
00:28:06,704 --> 00:28:08,527
in good times and in bad,

494
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:12,003
to love and to cherish,
in sickness and in health,

495
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:16,679
to continually bestow upon one another
your heart's deepest devotion,

496
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:21,272
to be a friend, a lover, in
times of plenty and in times of want,

497
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,813
that regardless of the obstacles
you may face on your path through life,

498
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:28,530
to always be faithful
to one another,

499
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,798
and vow to do so
from this day forward,

500
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,622
as long as you both shall live?

501
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,712
I do.

502
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:37,650
You may now kiss the bride.

503
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,481
Can I get two glasses, please?

504
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,347
So. I struck out online, but there're
plenty of guys here, so don't worry.

505
00:29:05,472 --> 00:29:07,638
Trust me, I wasn't worrying.

506
00:29:07,763 --> 00:29:09,859
OK, good,
because I think I found you a keeper.

507
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:12,290
You're gonna love this one,
He's cute, he's single,

508
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:14,765
and I'm pretty sure
he can make you see God.

509
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:20,573
Yeah, I don't think he's my type.

510
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:22,093
No, he's Protestant.

511
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:26,349
Ash, maybe today is not my day
to find a boyfriend.

512
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:30,851
You're not dating him again, right?

513
00:29:31,308 --> 00:29:32,321
Well, no.

514
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:36,100
I just agreed to bring him as my date
so he could make a play for Robin.

515
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:39,257
Well he's in for a surprise.
Because Robin's gay.

516
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,937
- Really?
- Really.

517
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:45,250
Which means you're still looking
for a boyfriend. Be right back.

518
00:29:57,538 --> 00:29:58,774
What are you doing here?

519
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:01,632
Just taking a break
from the fun, fun, fun. You?

520
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:03,509
Hiding.

521
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:05,761
Me too.

522
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,817
Max told me he gave up Caltech.

523
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:12,033
You knew, didn't you?

524
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,319
I promised I wasn't gonna tell you.

525
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,661
Now, you're mad at me, aren't you?

526
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,305
Right now, I'm...

527
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:23,284
... scared and happy and mad
and thrilled and everything in between,

528
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:26,657
and it's all wrapped up in this
overwhelming desire to puke my guts out.

529
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:29,368
Add itchy to that
and I'm right with you.

530
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:31,834
It's my allergies.

531
00:30:33,661 --> 00:30:35,708
- And Jordan.
- And Andy?

532
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,168
Yeah, and Andy.

533
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,962
Life shouldn't be this complicated.

534
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:41,755
You know, you and Jordan can't.

535
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,699
I know. I gotta deal with it.

536
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,988
It's just not that easy.

537
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,724
This afternoon,
I thought Max was going to propose.

538
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:54,396
I thought
he was going to lavaliere you.

539
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,312
- He tried.
- You didn't accept?

540
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:02,810
I always thought the hard part would be
finding the right guy.

541
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,317
But, it turns out
it's not finding the guy that's hard,

542
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:08,729
it's staying on the same page
with him.

543
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:12,870
And right now,
I feel like we're in different chapters.

544
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:14,857
It's better than me and Jordan.

545
00:31:15,892 --> 00:31:17,861
Because right now,
we're in different books.

546
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,193
And someone else is reading
her book.

547
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:24,132
Or, her book is
in someone else's library.

548
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:27,058
Yeah, maybe...

549
00:31:32,464 --> 00:31:34,776
We should just wait here
until everyone leaves.

550
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:37,528
Or at least,
until the end of the song.

551
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:44,306
- Nice wedding, right?
- Yeah.

552
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,118
So, Ash tells me you're gay.

553
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:56,789
Which makes you wonder
about that kiss.

554
00:31:57,253 --> 00:31:59,083
No. Yeah.

555
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,461
Actually,
I don't really know what to think.

556
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,859
It was just a kiss.

557
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:07,091
And the feelings you're having are what
a lot of people go through in college.

558
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:08,968
It's just a part of growing up.

559
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,553
You'll figure it out eventually.

560
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:12,429
So, I shouldn't obsess over it?

561
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:15,182
Not unless you liked it.

562
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,644
Because, I did.

563
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:24,551
Robin Wylie.

564
00:32:25,636 --> 00:32:27,736
We are at the same wedding.
Imagine that.

565
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,861
- The coincidences are mind-boggling.
- Well, conveniently, so am I.

566
00:32:33,373 --> 00:32:34,373
Dance?

567
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:37,501
Don't mind if we do.

568
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:52,117
You know, the secret to cake
and concrete is in the powder?

569
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:56,932
Yeah. It all has to do
with adhesion forces and collisions...

570
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,707
Why didn't you tell me
about Caltech?

571
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,603
Before you made
the decision not to go?

572
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:06,150
It's because I thought,
it would freak you out.

573
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:07,992
Well, it did.

574
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,722
What you did was kind of huge.

575
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,490
I don't know what is the next step.

576
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:14,913
Next?

577
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:18,912
Just lavaliere you.

578
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,374
I thought you were going to propose.

579
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:25,724
Wouldn't that be going a bit too...

580
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:26,962
fast?

581
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:31,967
And changing your whole life, based on a
month-long relationship is not too fast?

582
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:36,138
I love you.

583
00:33:38,676 --> 00:33:39,767
I love you too.

584
00:33:41,385 --> 00:33:43,085
But, I kinda can't breathe.

585
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:46,192
Sorry, I didn't mean that...

586
00:33:54,322 --> 00:33:55,282
You know, the...

587
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:59,628
egg yolk lipoproteins are
an essential part of

588
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:01,687
maintaining the cake stability.

589
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:08,810
It must be going around. I'm...

590
00:34:09,513 --> 00:34:11,415
having a tough time breathing
myself.

591
00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:24,269
<i>True to the day he dies</i>

592
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,470
<i>More than a dream-come-true</i>

593
00:34:26,595 --> 00:34:28,911
<i>With eyes of ocean-blue</i>

594
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,292
<i>While sisters will be</i>

595
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,440
<i>True love is theirs to seek</i>

596
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:37,212
<i>He won the heart of our hearts</i>

597
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:41,766
Z-B-Z

598
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:51,380
OK, ladies, everybody get close.

599
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:57,010
Move your asses. I got a plane to catch.
Bridesmaids to the front.

600
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,439
Who wants a piece of me?

601
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:11,900
You?

602
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:27,481
I forgot what a bitch KiKi could be.

603
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:30,585
You know, she purpose to put us in these
dresses to make herself look better.

604
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,247
Speak for yourself.
I look hot in lime green.

605
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:37,714
So...

606
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:38,886
What was up...

607
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:42,477
... back at the house?
With Max.

608
00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:45,232
Nothing.

609
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:47,102
So, where's Evan?

610
00:35:48,797 --> 00:35:49,876
We broke up.

611
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,101
Yeah, well, we didn't exactly...

612
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:58,270
bring out the best in each other.

613
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:00,167
So...

614
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:05,573
Far be it from me
to give relationship advice,

615
00:36:06,378 --> 00:36:09,124
But, if you think
you're with the right guy,

616
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,153
and there's a chance it might work,

617
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:13,629
don't give up.

618
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:20,219
I wonder when Kiki knew
that he was the right one.

619
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:22,432
Probably when he knocked her up.

620
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,557
Wh...

621
00:36:25,928 --> 00:36:26,928
What?

622
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,196
Dinner was good.

623
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:36,907
Yeah.

624
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:41,845
You know,

625
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,351
if you think about it,
nothing happened this morning.

626
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,290
Sure, something...

627
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,210
almost did, but it didn't.

628
00:36:50,135 --> 00:36:52,056
And you cannot feel guilty

629
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:53,752
over almost.

630
00:36:57,272 --> 00:36:58,841
We were pretty tired.

631
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:01,844
Personally, I'm chalking it up
to intravenous drugs.

632
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,597
So, we're good.

633
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:07,729
We're good.

634
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,583
Friends.

635
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:13,691
So...

636
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:17,901
- Do good friends dance together?
- Sure.

637
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,446
- You don't mind if I lead?
- You're OK if I make fun of your dress?

638
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,770
OK, you lead.

639
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,002
Hey, Robin.

640
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:31,148
Before you take off
I was wondering if you might like to...

641
00:37:31,273 --> 00:37:32,078
What?

642
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:35,328
... continue this night of romance
and love at Cappie Tau.

643
00:37:36,241 --> 00:37:38,098
Sounds like fun, but...

644
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,695
it's never going to happen.

645
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,207
Well, never as in never,
or never as in not now,

646
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:44,344
or never as in Never Neverland?

647
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:48,898
Fitting you'd end with Peter Pan.

648
00:37:49,023 --> 00:37:51,347
Let's just say... never.

649
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:57,291
Well, that sucked.

650
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,434
- Wendy, darling.
- Cappie!

651
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:02,738
Both of us at the same wedding?
Imagine the coincidence.

652
00:38:10,716 --> 00:38:11,716
Hey.

653
00:38:12,614 --> 00:38:14,839
I didn't want you to leave
without saying good-bye.

654
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,842
That's nice.

655
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:20,963
Hey, I'm staying in town
for a couple weeks with my parents.

656
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:22,088
So...

657
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,635
So maybe I could give you a call?

658
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:26,637
I'd like that.

659
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:34,401
- See ya.
- Bye.

660
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:43,658
This is John. He's new at Cyprus,
and I thought that...

661
00:38:48,438 --> 00:38:49,438
Sorry.

662
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:55,581
We should look at this
as a celebration for us, too.

663
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:57,605
I mean, we didn't die.

664
00:38:57,975 --> 00:38:59,795
And Kiki got her flowers.

665
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,035
A happy ending.

666
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:04,688
And I finally have my answer.

667
00:39:05,578 --> 00:39:06,578
For what?

668
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:12,225
Whether or not it's worth risking
eternal happiness in heaven

669
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,332
for fleeting happiness on earth.

670
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:27,204
<i>I will never let you go</i>

671
00:39:29,602 --> 00:39:32,828
<i>I will never let you go</i>

672
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:43,473
I can't. We shouldn't be doing this.
I'm dating Andy.

673
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:46,591
- No. I know you're dating Andy.
- No. I have to go.

674
00:39:56,778 --> 00:39:57,894
I brought you cake.

675
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:07,871
Actually...

676
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:11,432
I'm sorry.

677
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,007
I'm sorry about you
having to keep your secret.

678
00:40:15,494 --> 00:40:17,497
I'm sorry about you
giving up Caltech.

679
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,541
Why should you be sorry about that?

680
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:23,155
Because I don't know
if I would do the same for you.

681
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,322
In fact, I didn't.
I went to Washington.

682
00:40:27,414 --> 00:40:29,301
I didn't expect you to give that up.

683
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,844
But Max, that's not fair.

684
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,395
It's not fair
we started in different places?

685
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:38,643
What would be unfair is
if I expected you to be where I am now.

686
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:44,686
I lost a girl once in my life.

687
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:47,718
And I vowed that if I ever felt
that way about someone again,

688
00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:49,492
that I wouldn't take that lightly.

689
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,197
I wouldn't lose them.

690
00:40:54,808 --> 00:40:56,279
I didn't want to lose you.

691
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:03,209
But we're supposed to be a couple,

692
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:05,670
which means we're supposed
to be on the same page,

693
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,588
meet in the middle,
travel together down a shared path.

694
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:14,532
And you're so far ahead of me,
I don't even see you anymore.

695
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,178
So...

696
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:25,649
What now, then?

697
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:32,993
Slow down for a while.

698
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:35,659
And let me catch up?

699
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,079
I can do that.

700
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:42,278
I know you can.

701
00:41:47,326 --> 00:41:48,326
What?
