00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:02,257
<i>Previously on</i> 90210.

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,022
Come on, the Beverly Hills
will be great for our family

3
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:07,540
we get the weather,
we get the Palm Trees with the...

4
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:09,149
<i>More Palm Trees.</i>

5
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:11,416
- You had, like, a million friends.
- Back home.

6
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:13,971
And they all knew about
the whole adoption story.

7
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:16,550
Ethan, this is Annie,
the new principal's daughter.

8
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:17,997
Annie, my boyfriend, Ethan.

9
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:20,473
Yeah, actually. We know each other.
We met like, two summers ago?

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,126
Ty.

11
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:23,259
You want to grab dinner
tonight after rehearsal?

12
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:25,224
- You can Spence anybody.
- Annie!

13
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:26,288
Ty.

14
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:28,146
I wanted to bring you these.

15
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:30,317
If you guys want to grab some food,
I can watch Sammy.

16
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:32,637
- You just got here.
- Don't worry, I'll be here for a while.

17
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,338
I went to Dad's office last night, and
I saw him there kissing another woman.

18
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:38,162
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

19
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:41,409
It's okay.

20
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:43,578
In eighth grade, my dad had an affair.

21
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:45,598
I had to tell someone, so

22
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:47,869
I told my best friend,
Naomi.

23
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,107
She promised me that she wouldn't
tell anyone. So she told everyone.

24
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:03,722
Weel,
I got's a bad news.

25
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:06,748
I just got off the phone
with your drama teacher.

26
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:08,537
Got a family emergency in Atlanta

27
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:10,967
and she is taking an indefinite leave
of absence.

28
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,229
So what does that mean?

29
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:15,724
You're not canceling the musical,
are you?

30
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,032
Well, if I can't find somebody
else I don't know that I have a choice.

31
00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:20,518
Dad, no!

32
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:23,472
We've been rehearsing for weeks
and the show is amazing.

33
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:25,627
Can't you just find
someone to supervise us?

34
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:28,209
Harry, how hard could it
be to find an acting coach in L.A.?

35
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:30,797
I mean, I could throw a rock
out the window and hit an actor.

36
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:32,608
Fine.
I'll do it.

37
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,126
<i>What?</i>

38
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:35,556
I'll direct the musical.

39
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:37,526
But...
but, Grandma...

40
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:40,041
you're so busy writing your memoir.

41
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,460
Sweetheart,
when the theater is in pain,

42
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:45,190
I come to mend the wound.

43
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:47,371
Okay.

44
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:50,977
Tabitha, that is a very nice offer.
Annie, you are very lucky.

45
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:53,855
- I'm so excited.
- I'm excited, too.

46
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:59,564
I have to remember some of
those breathing exercises I used to do.

47
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,599
I had a Director who'd say,

48
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:08,510
"If you're not breathing from your ass
"and reaching to the skies,

49
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,595
the back row won't hear you. "

50
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,465
I slept with him.

51
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,759
Now I know you don't love it,
but it's great, and, hon.

52
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:23,765
Mom, okay, stop?

53
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:25,560
I think that your foundation
a little dark.

54
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,799
It's the same one
I use every single day.

55
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:30,521
Merry early Christmas, everybody.
Both my girls look beautiful.

56
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:34,251
- Why are we shooting the Christma photo without Jen?
- She sending us a picture Christmas photo without Jen?

57
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:37,308
What? That's the dumbest thing I've ever
heard. Can we just shoot this, please?

58
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,461
All right, everyone get in real close.

59
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,240
Linda and Bob are
gonna start renovating.

60
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:46,295
So I was gonna offer
them the beach house.

61
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:48,539
I've already offered for the same rea.

62
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,745
Charles would you mind turning towards Tracy?
There's big space right here between you two.

63
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,381
I wish I could live at the beach house.

64
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:55,730
What does that mean?
Tracy, you're looking a little stiff.

65
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,687
Charles, can you put your
arms around both ladies, please?

66
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:00,891
Naomi, can I get a smile?

67
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:06,075
And, Tracy and Charles,
can I get a little kiss between you two?

68
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:09,153
Could you hurry up, please?
It's really hot out here.

69
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:11,283
It's an out-of-town emergency.
Give me a second.

70
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:15,658
Why do we even bother?

71
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,810
Naomi...

72
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,161
It'll be just a second.

73
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:22,681
Okay.

74
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:27,998
Dixon, your mom is driving me to school.
You can take my car.

75
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:30,242
- Sweet.
- You call the Realtor this morning?

76
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:32,288
Only one couple looked
at the house this month.

77
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,410
Not surprising.

78
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:34,925
Tough market.

79
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:36,450
What's going on?

80
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:38,917
We're having trouble
selling the house in Kansas.

81
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:42,188
- Is that a bad thing?
- It's not a good thing.

82
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,749
We're paying a mortgage
on a house we're not living in.

83
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,636
It's not like we're paying rent here.

84
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:50,816
Yeah, but we still got expenses.
We got moving expenses, gas prices...

85
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:53,696
Hey,
don't worry about it.

86
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,219
We're fine.

87
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:05,333
- Hi, Mom.
- Where are we going for dinner tonight?

88
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,249
I made reservations at Craft.

89
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:09,197
Is Dad coming?

90
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:10,518
He has a meeting.

91
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,771
Is that code for
"sleeping with his girlfriend"?

92
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,536
- Naomi...
- Mom, how can you live like this?

93
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,597
How can you just accept that Dad's
with another woman? How is that okay?

94
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,761
Can you explain that to me?
'Cause I just don't get it.

95
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:25,330
It's just a casual fling, that's all.

96
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:27,263
She doesn't even live here.

97
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:30,942
So what, Mom?

98
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:33,197
He's still cheating on you.

99
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,356
This is between me and your dad.

100
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,321
Stay out of it.

101
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,338
I'm not discussing this with you again.

102
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:43,176
Do you understand?

103
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:45,993
Perfectly.

104
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:59,619
I wish we could've done breakfast at the Peach Pit.
I hate early morning meetings.

105
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:02,457
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm getting a kick out of being here.

106
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,378
I can almost still hear the chanting.

107
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:06,671
"Donna Martin graduates.
Donna Martin graduates. "

108
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:07,882
That's crazy.

109
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,090
Thank you very much. Now that's
gonna be stuck in my head all day.

110
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:12,871
Speaking of, have you seen Donna?

111
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:15,530
Yes. And, oh, my God,
her baby is so cute, I can't stand it.

112
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,578
I know.
How's the play?

113
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:20,323
It's good. I mean,
the Taper just went through a renovation

114
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:23,225
so it's a really nice house to perform
in. You're gonna come see me, right?

115
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,910
Of course.
I wouldn't miss it.

116
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:26,577
So...

117
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:28,642
dirt.

118
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,831
What?

119
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:31,322
Ryan.

120
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:32,794
Okay...

121
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,085
He's nice.
I like him.

122
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:39,005
We work together, so it's awkward.

123
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:42,419
And he's ten years younger than me,
which makes it bizarre.

124
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:46,298
I asked him where he was when Kurt Cobain
died and he said he was watching cartoons.

125
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,657
Does he know about Ryan?

126
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:54,019
Why would he need to know?
It's none of his business.

127
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:57,354
Well, it may be his business
if things get more serious with Ryan.

128
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:58,787
You know, because of Sammy.

129
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,780
Well, let me worry about that.

130
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:03,397
Fair enough.

131
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:07,640
Hi.

132
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,669
Hey.

133
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,124
Ethan, I'm a mess.

134
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:14,636
I'm freaking out.
My family is so fake.

135
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:18,856
I mean, my sister's being Photoshopped
into the Christmas card from Paris.

136
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:22,114
My dad is kissing my mom
while having an affair.

137
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,154
Look, I don't...
I'm sorry you're going through this.

138
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:27,509
Thank you.

139
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:31,768
- But, look, Naomi...
- I know.

140
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,160
We're not together anymore.

141
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:39,820
But it's really good to talk to you.

142
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,231
Damn.

143
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:52,474
Why were trying to fit
that tank into a compact space?

144
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:54,701
I thought I had room.

145
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,887
Do you know how much parts cost
on German cars?

146
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:57,794
A lot?

147
00:06:57,956 --> 00:06:59,588
Just give me your insurance info.

148
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,463
Listen...

149
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,343
do you think there's any way
we can handle this between us?

150
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,993
You don't have insurance.

151
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:10,849
No, no, my dad does,
but I don't want him to find out.

152
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:13,176
You know, he won't let me
drive the car anymore.

153
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,937
I can get you the cash.
I'm good for it, I swear.

154
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:19,850
It's not like you don't know
what school I go to, man.

155
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:24,002
It's not like I'm gonna disappear or anything.
Just please do me this solid, man,

156
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:24,897
please.

157
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:27,983
My dad's away on business
for a couple weeks.

158
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,139
I just need the cash
before he gets back.

159
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:33,912
Hey, Kelly.

160
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:38,365
So about Saturday.
There's a new pizza place in Silverlake.

161
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,865
And apparently it's good,
like New York good.

162
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,498
Saturday, I can't do it

163
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,070
because Silver's not going to be
around to help me with Sammy.

164
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:48,005
- How about Brenda?
- She has a show that night.

165
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,366
Sammy's dad, does he ever take him?

166
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:51,514
What?

167
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:54,180
Sammy's dad. Did I...
Did I say something wrong?

168
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:56,049
No. No, it's fine.

169
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:58,179
He just... he doesn't live here.

170
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,028
Where does he live?

171
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:01,720
All over kind of.

172
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,155
Yeah, he's,
he's a do-gooder.

173
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:09,221
He's actually halfway across the world
right now doing charity work.

174
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,037
- Impressive.
- Yeah.

175
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,790
- Well, maybe we can do Sunday, okay?
- Okay.

176
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:16,456
- I'll see what I can do.
- Great.

177
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,215
Hey, Annie, I haven't seen you around.

178
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,339
I've been around.
Busy with the play.

179
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:26,008
So how's Naomi?

180
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,715
Just a lot of really intense stuff
going on with her family.

181
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,840
Yeah. Yeah, it seemed like it.

182
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:33,830
So are you guys like...?

183
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:36,582
No, no, no.
No...

184
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,023
She was just flipping out
and I know how to deal with her.

185
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:39,847
Right.

186
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:43,138
What about you and Ty?
What's up with that whole...?

187
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,051
nothing really.

188
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:49,706
Well, I had a lot of fun hanging
out with you the other night.

189
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,506
- Me, too.
- Well, good.

190
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:54,256
Do you want to maybe do that again?
Like Thursday?

191
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,207
Thursday night I have nothing
going on.

192
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,366
Well, I'm with my brother all afternoon,

193
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,832
so you want to just meet at
the Peach Pit like around 6:00?

194
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,903
- Yeah. Cool. See you then.
- Awesome.

200
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:37,454
So, the other night,

201
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:40,639
I left without saying good-bye.
I'm sorry about that.

202
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:42,768
No, it's no big deal.

203
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,004
Well, I think it's a big deal 'cause
I didn't get to hang out with you.

204
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:50,721
Anyway... Vampire Weekend's playing
this secret show at the Avalon

205
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,693
and my cousin got me VIP tickets.

206
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,353
It's Thursday.
You want to go?

207
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,224
I can't.
I have plans.

208
00:09:57,924 --> 00:09:58,630
Okay.

209
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:02,229
Is it like a group hang?
'Cause I don't have to go to the show.

210
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:05,291
My cousin's in the music biz
and hooks me up all the time.

211
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,345
It's not really a group hang.

212
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:10,786
It's more of a one-on-one

213
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:12,024
kind of thing.

214
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:13,470
Got it.

215
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:16,369
I'll see you around.

216
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:23,881
Silver...

217
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,354
Hey, hey, Silver.

218
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:27,841
Can I talk to you?

219
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:29,463
Headphones.

220
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,224
You have a nano second.

221
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:36,516
Please don't blog about my dad's affair.

222
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:39,849
You thought my family problems were gossip.
Why shouldn't I treat yours the same way?

223
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:44,515
Look, I've said it before,
but I'll say it again. I'm so sorry.

224
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:47,274
I'm so sorry, okay?
Because I get it now.

225
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:50,474
I know what you were going through.
What I did was really messed up.

226
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,867
Yeah,
it was really messed up.

227
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:11,889
No!

228
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:12,957
No, stop.

229
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,124
My ears are bleeding.
You have no passion, girls.

230
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:21,308
You got to sing like
your privates are on fire.

231
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:23,571
For god's sake.

232
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:28,566
Just because you're a bunch of rich
brats doesn't mean you can't have angst.

233
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:29,846
Channel it.

234
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,826
This is a song about your mother.

235
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:40,286
She's been lying to you about sex,
and it pisses you off.

236
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,711
You're all teenagers, so
I know you hate your mothers.

237
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:45,208
I hated mine.

238
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:48,830
Use the anger.
I will show you how it's done.

239
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:52,359
- Grandma, maybe I...
- Annie, I'm not your grandmother here.

240
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,382
I'm the director.

241
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:56,662
Everyone...

242
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:25,057
You've got to move
from the hips and claim the stage!

243
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:28,562
- Dad?
- Hey.

244
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:31,985
You know how very much I love Grandma,

245
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,479
and it was a nice idea.
But you have to,

246
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,997
have to find a new directo
for the musical.

247
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:39,839
I cannot replace her.

248
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,664
You have to, okay?
Yes, you can. She...

249
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:47,127
she makes me do these crazy heavy
breathing exercises all the way to school.

250
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:49,328
And she's so embarrassing.

251
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:51,726
Sweetheart, just one more week.

252
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:54,799
There you are, Harry.
Excuse me, darling.

253
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,967
When you have a moment, I need
to go over the theater budget with you.

254
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:01,652
The lights need new gels
and the costumes are not up to par.

255
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:05,036
- Is that coffee on your tie?
- What?

256
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:07,789
Great.

257
00:13:08,216 --> 00:13:09,986
You're seriously arguing with me?

258
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,274
Hello.

259
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,235
- My mother...
- Saw the whole thing.

260
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:18,087
Hey, now you know how
Annie feels having you here.

261
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:23,726
You know people
in the entertainment industry, right?

262
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,726
Anybody who might be abl
to direct a musical?

263
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:30,714
I think I might know someone.

264
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,523
- Here.
- Thanks.

265
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:46,255
You caddied at a country club
in Wichita,

266
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:48,204
cut grass, shoveled snow...

267
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,772
And this would be your first real job?

268
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:51,871
Yes, sir.

269
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,846
- You go to West Beverly?
- Yes, sir.

270
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,883
I once hired a kid from West Beverly.

271
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:03,199
A long time ago.
He was a good, good egg.

272
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:06,747
Tell you what, I'll try you out.
You don't mess up,

273
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,120
- you got the job.
- Thank you, sir.

274
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,050
Stop calling me "sir. "
The name is Nat.

275
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:13,462
Thanks, Nat.

276
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:16,217
Mom?

277
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:19,517
Like to introduce you to somebody.

278
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:20,733
Hi.

279
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,240
This is Brenda Walsh,
a West Beverly alum

280
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,348
and a very big fan of yours.

281
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:26,373
Really?

282
00:14:26,374 --> 00:14:28,658
Well, it's nice to meet you.

283
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:31,451
It's an honor to meet you.
I've seen every one of your films.

284
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:34,474
Not every film. There were
some real stinkers in the'80s.

285
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:36,422
Well, you were wonderful in all of them.

286
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,707
Also I saw your Hedda Gabler
at the Ahmanson.

287
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,465
That's the greatest part
ever written for a woman.

288
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:45,562
I got to play her.
Not as well as you, of course.

289
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,283
- You're an actor.
- Yes.

290
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,639
Mom, opening night is around the corner.
There's a lot of work left.

291
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,687
So I thought you could use some help,
and Brenda offered to assist.

292
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,835
I've thought I was handling this?? Well

293
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:00,068
well,

294
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:01,801
I've seen the original

295
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:03,711
production of Spring Awakening.

296
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,331
And I always think it helps
to have an extra pair of eyes.

297
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:07,682
Wonderful.

298
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,160
Fine.

299
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,382
Great.

300
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:23,883
All right,

301
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,980
explain to me,
why didn't you say yes to Ty?

302
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,908
I mean, it's Vampire Weekend.
It's a secret show.

303
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,942
It's Ty Collins.

304
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:34,057
Ethan asked me out.

305
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:38,954
No Ethan.
What is wrong with you. He's off limits.

306
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,922
Ethan and Naomi are over.

307
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:44,067
They are never over.

308
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:45,933
Let me explain something to you.

309
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:49,460
Naomi and Ethan have this thing, right?

310
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:52,816
It's like they're in this bubble.
This impenetrable bubble.

311
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,444
- A bubble?
- And no matter how hard you try,

312
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,744
you can't get in
and you don't want to get in.

313
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:00,192
Trust me, I stand beside
the bubble and I'm scared.

314
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:02,153
Well, the bubble has popped.

315
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:04,541
No, no, you see,
you just think it has.

316
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:07,033
Silver, I am going out with Ethan

317
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:10,495
and you cannot talk me out of it.
And I'm not scared.

318
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:13,063
I'm going to buy you a box of tissues.

319
00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:15,269
So...

320
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,271
what can I get you ladies?

321
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:19,864
Wait,
you're working here?

322
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:21,304
Yeah.

323
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,237
Are you trying to make me
look bad with Mom and Dad?

324
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,404
No, I'm trying to make me look good.

325
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,816
I've been messing up since
I got here, so you know,

326
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,078
I'm trying to do something
a little more responsible.

327
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:33,318
Kiss ass.

328
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,496
Hey, you shouldn't be talking.

329
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:38,827
So can I get you anything?

330
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:48,042
The digital proof is in.
Naomi! Come take a look at this.

331
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:51,960
- I think I'm going to order 500 more.
- At least. I think you look beautiful.

332
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:53,241
Thank you.

333
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:57,098
Gross. I look terrible.

334
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:59,545
Well, you've been outvoted, kiddo,
'cause Jen likes that one, too.

335
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,116
- I think you look great, honey.
- Great? I look high.

336
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:03,685
No, you don't.
Were you high?

337
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:07,781
That's the office calling.
Give me a second. Yeah,

338
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,643
I'll be there at 8:00.

339
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:22,621
- That's funny.
- Hey. You're home late.

340
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,381
Yeah, I got a job
at the Peach Pit.

341
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:28,578
What?
When did that happen?

342
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:30,816
Just today.
They said they needed help.

343
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:34,027
And, Dad,
you know girls in Beverly Hills.

344
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,890
They like expensive stuff and

345
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,492
- expensive places.
- Yes, they do.

346
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:41,967
I want to roll in style.
Maybe one day get a nicer car.

347
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,386
No offense.

348
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,988
None taken.
It is a piece of crap.

349
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:48,697
- Yeah.
- Dixon...

350
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,963
Having a job, good thing,

351
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:53,254
but I wish you would've
discussed it with us first.

352
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:56,923
- You guys don't want me to take it?
- No, you can. You can.

353
00:17:57,983 --> 00:18:01,860
But I don't want it to interfere with
your schoolwork or lacrosse practice.

354
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,863
It won't.

355
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:06,351
Mom, I'll be right down.
I'm just saying good-bye to Dad.

356
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,151
<i>Bon Ami Beverly Hills,.
This is Gail, How can I help you?</i>

357
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:33,585
Hello?

358
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:35,102
Hello?

359
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,566
- No, I was up studying bio.
- All right, all right, focus.

360
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:49,887
Okay.

361
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:52,591
Which organ
produces bile?

362
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,300
The pancreas.

363
00:18:58,801 --> 00:18:59,561
Liver.

364
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:04,634
All right, name the three
classes of digestive enzymes.

365
00:19:04,763 --> 00:19:06,397
I know this one. I know this one...

366
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:09,120
lipase...

367
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,049
amylases
and...

368
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:15,629
And?

369
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:20,387
And I'll study again after work.

370
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:25,675
Those dimples are not going
to get you into Harvard.

371
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,259
I think Mrs. Schwartz
is going to give us a pop quiz.

372
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,478
I'm gonna study after work.
I promise.

373
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm sorry.
I promise.

374
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:38,918
Hey.

375
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,100
Hi.

376
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:43,505
- Ethan, I'm freaking out.
- Naomi, now is not a good time, okay?

377
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,166
- Why? What's going on?
- It's Steven.

378
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,421
I told my mom that I'm watching

379
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:50,978
him so she could have some time
to herself and just having a bad day.

380
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:52,621
That's all right. Let me help you.

381
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,198
We have a new cleaning service and I forgot
to tell him not to touch the furniture.

382
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,890
He's been rearranging it all afternoon.

383
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,933
I've tried everything that usually works
to get him to change his focus but nothing,

384
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:12,028
and I really need him
to stopbefore my mom gets home.

385
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:13,266
Hey, it's all right.

386
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,715
I'm here.
Okay?

387
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:15,968
I'll help.

388
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:18,546
Hey, Steven.

389
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,097
Hey, man. Naomi came to see you.
How cool is that?

390
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,607
The couch is in the wrong place.

391
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,506
I can see that.
You want me to help you out?

392
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,169
No.

393
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,097
- I got it.
- Okay.

394
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:29,164
Well, you know what?
I was actually hoping

395
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:32,401
maybe we could pop some popcorn.
What do you think about that?

396
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,700
I came all the way from
my house just for you.

397
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:36,986
It sounds good, right?
You love popcorn.

398
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:38,564
I like popcorn, with butter.

399
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:42,441
A stick of butter, two teaspoons of salt
and a pinch of pepper.

400
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:44,934
That's perfect.
That's exactly how I like mine,

401
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,273
but we need the couch to
sit on to watch the movie, okay?

402
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,899
So why don't you come with me
and we'll get some popcorn.

403
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:51,818
Hold my hand. Here we go.
Okay.

404
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:03,794
Annie, your posture is horrid!

405
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,267
Pull your shoulders back.

406
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:12,521
You're singing from the throat.

407
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,719
Annie, what is wrong with you today?

408
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,679
Okay, guys, how about we take five?

409
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:36,914
- Hey, Dixon.
- Hey, what's up, man?

410
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:39,384
So look, my dad's trip got cut short,

411
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,959
which means, I need the money
by the end of next week,

412
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:44,388
and I got the estimate.
It's $500.

413
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,400
Are you serious?

414
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,601
We can still go through insurance,
if you want.

415
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:50,880
No, no, no, no.

416
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:54,599
I'll get you the money, man. I'll just
pick up some extra shifts, you know?

417
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,821
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right, cool, man.

418
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,331
<i>Annie!
You're singing from the throat.</i>

419
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:06,085
<i>I need diaphragm.</i>

420
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:12,000
<i>Annie, what is wrong with you today?</i>

421
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:16,195
I always learn a lot
watching my rehearsals on tape.

422
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:17,588
Helps me tweak things.

423
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:20,361
Like did you notice that Jill
was off-key in the second verse?

424
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,600
And Adriana, she needs some refocusing.

425
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,443
You know, Brenda, that...

426
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,200
was very helpful.

427
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,250
Eye-opening.

428
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,785
I'm gonna go talk to her.
I know where she works.

429
00:22:34,864 --> 00:22:36,137
You really want to do that?

430
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,641
It's my family.
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

431
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:40,396
I just think there
might be a better way.

432
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,736
And what way is that?

433
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:44,005
Did you like when your
parents got divorced?

434
00:22:44,976 --> 00:22:47,314
You would have stopped it if you
could have, wouldn't you?

435
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:50,413
I mean, look what happened to Silver and
her mom- their whole lives fell apart.

436
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:52,899
What are you say her?

437
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,930
I'm gonna tell the bitch to stop sleeping
with my dad and back the hell off.

438
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,708
My dad's obviously going through a mid-life
crisis and she's probably just some slut.

439
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:02,983
If I can get her to leave him, then
everything will go back to the way it was.

440
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:05,958
But I need your help.
Will you please go with me?

441
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:09,465
Yeah.
I'll go.

442
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,308
That's your fourth Dr. Pepper.

443
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:25,000
- How late is Ethan?
- Half an hour.

444
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:26,741
Did you call him?

445
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:28,542
Not answering.

446
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:32,200
Maybe he forgot.

447
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:35,313
That really doesn't make me feel better.

448
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:38,949
Crap.

449
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,496
Dixon,
can I grab a coffee to go, please?

450
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:43,077
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks, man.

451
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:46,438
Hey.

452
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
So... these were your plans?

453
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,808
- I'm waiting for someone.
- Right.

454
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,853
Well, I hope you have a good time.

455
00:23:57,725 --> 00:23:58,575
Coffee?

456
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,054
Thanks, man.

457
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:02,224
Thank you.

458
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:11,080
I am such a ginormous idiot.

459
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,413
- Yes, you are.
- He's a pretty good tipper.

460
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:19,159
Ty is cool and sweet
and he really likes me

461
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,000
and I'm sitting here waiting
for a guy I might not get.

462
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:24,980
A guy in a bubble.
An impenetrable bubble.

463
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:26,500
Look,
Annie,

464
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:30,380
You're holding on to a crush
you had on Ethan, what,

465
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:31,925
like two years ago.

466
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,290
You need to go for the guy
who treats you good,

467
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,949
not the one who gives you grief.

468
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:42,133
Yo, Willie!
Burgers for table five, man. Come on.

469
00:24:44,855 --> 00:24:47,853
<i>Can't make it. So sorry.
Explain later.</i>

470
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:50,400
Yeah.

471
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,800
Lots of grief.

472
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:02,907
Thanks for helping.

473
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,298
The kids can play it,
but they can't arrange.

474
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:07,900
Sure, sure. I would add a
little percussion to the bridge here.

475
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:09,780
That sounds great.

476
00:25:09,946 --> 00:25:11,282
So...
do you want

477
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:14,000
to play with the band?
I was hoping for a fuller sound.

478
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:16,309
Yeah, I don't think so.

479
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:20,731
By the way, Kelly asked me if I could
babysit on Sunday and I don't think I can.

480
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:22,820
I have a lot of catch-up
work to do with this.

481
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,178
All right. No worries.

482
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:26,909
Do you know Sammy's dad?

483
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:28,195
I do.

484
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,931
He sounds like a cool guy.

485
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,485
Traveling the world and...
helping people.

486
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:37,339
You know, I don't really feel comfortable
talking about Kelly's personal life.

487
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,439
If you have questions,
you should just ask her.

488
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:41,094
Yeah. No, you're...
you're right.

489
00:25:44,231 --> 00:25:45,863
Should I have questions?

490
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:48,700
There's just a long history there.

491
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:08,084
You want me to go in there with you?

492
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,842
No.

493
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,050
Just wait here.

494
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,740
I'll be here.

495
00:26:21,937 --> 00:26:23,800
We're closing in ten minutes.

496
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:34,311
Are you Gail?

497
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:39,458
Hi, Naomi.

498
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:42,186
You know who I am.

499
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:43,970
Of course.

500
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:47,316
Why are you here? You're supposed to
be in Denver. Why aren't you in Denver?

501
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:49,002
I just moved here.

502
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,300
- Naomi, I...
- You know what, stop. Just stop.

503
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:54,152
Leave us alone.

504
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:57,173
Leave my dad alone,
leave our family alone.

505
00:26:57,293 --> 00:27:00,196
Go away. My dad doesn't love you.
You're just a fling.

506
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:02,880
I'm gonna lock the door for a minute.

507
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:05,567
Do you want some
water or something?

508
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:08,712
No, I don't want any water, and I don't
want to be locked in here with you.

509
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:12,100
I want you out of our lives. Why don't
you go after someone who's single? Try that.

510
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,180
I've asked myself that same
question so many times.

511
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:18,999
There are some things that don't make
sense just because they don't.

512
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,183
I guess
somehow it's worth it to me.

513
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:22,727
Really?

514
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,505
Why might that be?

515
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,990
- Because I love him.
- Oh, my God, I've heard enough!

516
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:35,038
That's the address to my beach house.

517
00:27:35,651 --> 00:27:37,200
Are you mouving a where?

518
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:45,725
<i>Your break's over
in five minutes, Dixon.</i>

519
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:48,565
I don't care about the same stuff
kids in Beverly Hills care about.

520
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:50,045
Hip nightclubs.

521
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:51,800
Trendy purses.

522
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:54,148
I just like doing my own thing.

523
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:57,699
So, you're trying not to fit in?

524
00:27:58,146 --> 00:27:59,558
I just like being different.

525
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,300
It's how I'm made,
you know what I mean?

526
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:04,594
Do I know what you mean?

527
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,578
I'm a black kid living
with a white family.

528
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:09,685
Doesn't get more different than that.

529
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:10,834
Right.

530
00:28:12,664 --> 00:28:13,705
Is that weird?

531
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:19,450
You know, they're my family,
and I love them.

532
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:22,409
They don't care that I'm black.
I don't care that they're white.

533
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:24,118
But, you know, sometimes, like,

534
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:26,358
when we're eating dinner or

535
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,941
if we're talking about something
or even laughing,

536
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,200
then just for a split second...

537
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:34,721
I feel like I don't fit in.

538
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:37,548
Then, just like that,

539
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,033
the feeling goes away,

540
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:40,572
but...

541
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:42,848
Somehow, it's still there.

542
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:44,400
Yeah.

543
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,579
So, when are you gonna ask me out?

544
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:53,658
Maybe I don't want to ask you out.

545
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:57,000
- Yeah, you do.
- You're so sure?

546
00:28:58,452 --> 00:29:00,130
- I bet you that you do.
- Wait...

547
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:03,479
that means if I do ask you out,
then I'll lose the bet.

548
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:05,597
There's no losers here.

549
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,612
All right, I like the way you think.

550
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,649
Hey.

551
00:29:21,318 --> 00:29:23,100
Dad said you're quitting the play.

552
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:27,137
Well, I couldn't work
under those conditions anymore.

553
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,698
The acoustics in that auditorium
are atrocious.

554
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,001
And the stage
is literally falling apart.

555
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,606
Well...

556
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,502
thank you so much for all your help.

557
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:39,059
You're welcome, darling.

558
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,200
You're in good hands with Brenda.

559
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,950
Annie?

560
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,248
You are doing a wonderful job
in the musical.

561
00:29:50,526 --> 00:29:52,274
You are very talented.

562
00:29:53,022 --> 00:29:54,900
Thank you, Grandma.

563
00:30:03,516 --> 00:30:04,211
Mom.

564
00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:08,015
I went to see Gail.

565
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:09,517
I talked to her.

566
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:15,529
Why would you do that?
Because I want her out of our lives.

567
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:17,826
You have no business getting involved.

568
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:20,992
Mom, it's not just a casual fling
with her and Dad.

569
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,236
He's moving her into the beach house.

570
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,580
Dad lied.

571
00:30:28,454 --> 00:30:29,184
What?

572
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:31,528
Mom...

573
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,800
No.

574
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:39,800
Oh, God.

576
00:30:58,499 --> 00:30:59,850
- Hey, Teach.
- Hey.

577
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,208
You look tired.

578
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:10,633
Up all night thinking about me?

579
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah, I wish.

580
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,656
No, I was...
up studying bio.

581
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,900
All right, everybody, let's focus.
We got tests coming out.

582
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,900
- Test?
- Yeah.

583
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:25,127
Bio's tomorrow.

584
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:27,400
Flannery O'Connor short stories today.

585
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:38,695
Annie.

586
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,827
Hey, Annie, listen,
I am so sorry about standing you up.

587
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:44,557
- This whole thing with my brother...
- Don't worry about it.

588
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,990
It's not like it was a date
or anything, right?

589
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:50,850
I got to go.

590
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,335
Hey.

591
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:00,582
So, do you think
you could score some tickets

592
00:32:00,617 --> 00:32:03,380
for the Sea Wolf concert this weekend?
I heard they're playing Spaceland.

593
00:32:03,426 --> 00:32:05,680
- Yeah, I have tickets for that show.
- Cool.

594
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,533
I'm already going with someone else.

595
00:32:08,732 --> 00:32:09,531
Later.

596
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:20,652
So, I can't do pizza on Sunday. I just
can't get a sitter everybody's busy.

597
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,500
Okay.

598
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,237
What's the matter?

599
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:30,000
Look, I don't know what the story is
with you and Sammy's dad.

600
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,800
It just feels like
there's unfinished business.

601
00:32:35,564 --> 00:32:37,271
And what would give you that idea?

602
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:40,062
Well, I was talking to Brenda, and...

603
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:42,671
Wait, wait.
You were talking to Brenda about me?

604
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,487
I'm just trying to get to know you.

605
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:49,351
Look, Kelly, I just want you
to feel like you can talk me,

606
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,797
you know, like you can tell me anything,
and if there is something going on with

607
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,700
you and your ex, then...

608
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,508
I'm a big boy...
I can handle it.

609
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:05,271
There's nothing going on
with me and my ex.

610
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:12,413
Brenda.

611
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,807
Hey.

612
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:16,185
What did you say to Ryan?

613
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:17,979
- About what?
- About me.

614
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,168
- Not much.
- You shouldn't have said anything.

615
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,773
Okay, Kelly,
any guy that

616
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:26,113
dates you is gonna have questions about him.
You should just get your story straight.

617
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,883
My story is straight.

618
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,178
You know, you get really emotional
when you talk about this.

619
00:33:31,347 --> 00:33:32,658
I wonder why that is.

620
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,113
What are you saying?

621
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:36,329
I'm saying that you still have feelings
for him.

622
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:39,399
Of course I still have feelings for him.
He's my son's father.

623
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:41,337
Come on,
you know there's more to it than that.

624
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,257
No, there isn't. Because it can't be
because he's not here,

625
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,326
and I deserve to be
with somebody and be happy.

626
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:47,814
Give me a break.

627
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:51,153
You are never gonna be happy with somebody else,
because you're still in love with Dylan.

628
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:52,276
And you no it.

629
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:14,313
Dad, what are you doing here?

630
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:17,700
- Hear they have great coffee.
- Well, you came to the right spot.

631
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:22,188
Mr. Matthews told me that you got an
incomplete on the test you took today.

632
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:24,904
I'll make it up.

633
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,809
Look, Dixon,
I like that you have this job,

634
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:30,718
but I told you I didn't want
it to interfere with your school work.

635
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:32,872
Dad, look, need this job right now,

636
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:35,526
you know? After next week, you know,
I'll cut downe on a few shifts but.

637
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:36,600
Why next week?

638
00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:42,177
Because I...

639
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:45,663
accidentally
knocked off someone's side mirror

640
00:34:45,695 --> 00:34:48,428
when I was parking the van
and wanted to pay for it myself.

641
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,460
- You should've come to me.
- But,

642
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:51,670
Dad...

643
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:55,028
your insurance would've went up, right?

644
00:34:55,452 --> 00:34:57,975
And I heard you and Mom
talking about money problems.

645
00:34:58,102 --> 00:35:00,439
So I wanted to take care of this myself.

646
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:05,342
I don't know many other kids
who would've gotten a job.

647
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:06,849
I mean, hell,
I never did.

648
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:08,789
You're already ahead of me.

649
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:10,562
Look...

650
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:13,387
I'll pay for it now,
and you can pay me back in time.

651
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:15,250
- How's that sound?
- Thanks, Dad.

652
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:17,947
Leave a tip.

653
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,740
I got your tip:
don't get any more bad grades.

654
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,240
<i>- Do you like it?
- I love it.</i>

655
00:35:39,593 --> 00:35:42,461
<i>- I think I'm gonna wear it to school.
- You would not. I dare you.</i>

656
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:44,928
<i>- Come on, get into the video.
- All right, all right.</i>

657
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,041
<i>You look pretty good
with a monkey on your head.</i>

658
00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:50,783
- <i>You look good with a tiger on your head.
- Thank you, thank you.</i>

659
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,780
<i>This is the best day ever.</i>

660
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:55,307
- <i>I love you, Ethan Ward.</i>
- <i>I love you.</i>

661
00:35:58,963 --> 00:36:00,650
<i>You're not cotton Candy.</i>

662
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:07,191
Yo, Dix.

663
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:09,424
Hey.

664
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:11,142
Here.

665
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,118
- Thanks for helping me out, man.
- No worries.

666
00:36:15,537 --> 00:36:18,095
So, listen,
my dad has a hookup with the Lakers.

667
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:20,937
We got courtside tickets,
but my buddy bailed on me.

668
00:36:20,984 --> 00:36:22,786
- So you interested?
- For real?

669
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:24,100
- Yeah.
- Kobe?

670
00:36:24,827 --> 00:36:26,895
Hell, yeah,
I want to see the Lakers, man!

671
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:31,924
You hit that guy's car,

672
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:34,386
almost got him in trouble,
and then he asks you to a game?

673
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,777
It's nothing.

674
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:38,648
I've seen guys fistfight, and then five
minutes later, they're hanging out.

675
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,466
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, you know guys aren't like girls.

676
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:44,750
We don't hold grudges.
Life is way too short.

677
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:53,964
Hey.

678
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:56,390
Look...

679
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:01,100
I'm not gonna post anything
on my blog about you.

680
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:03,072
Okay.

681
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:04,590
Thank you.

682
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,097
- Just thought you should know.
- Okay.

683
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:11,064
So see you around?

684
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,089
Yeah.
See you.

685
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:25,519
<i>All right, man,
so I'll just catch you later.</i>

686
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,756
What's this?

687
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,792
Snickerdoodles. They're apology cookies.

688
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:31,809
When I do something screwed up, I bake.

689
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,080
- You know, just forget about it.
- I can't forget about it.

690
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,521
I'm an idiot, Ty.

691
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:38,822
I like you.
I want to hang out with you.

692
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:40,856
- You really haven't been acting like it.
- I know.

693
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:42,804
I know I messed up.
And...

694
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:46,016
and I am so hoping
that I'm not too late to fix it.

695
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:47,200
Am I too late?

696
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,886
Look, I spent the whole night
making you these cookies.

697
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,841
So eat a snickerdoodle
they're really good.

698
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:54,653
- I really don't think cookies are gonna do it.
- You haven't tasted one yet.

699
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:56,560
Annie, I don't have to.
I just...

700
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:10,739
That's way better than cookies.

701
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,294
I'm sorry.
Really.

702
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:17,314
You know, if you weren't so
freakin' adorable,

703
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,782
I wouldn't even be having
this conversation right now.

704
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:21,676
Can we start over?

705
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay.

706
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,050
Yeah.

707
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:26,785
So you want to go out this weekend?

708
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:28,600
Yes, I would.

709
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,799
Good.

710
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,216
I remember that hat.

711
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,365
L.A.
Zoo.

712
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:44,700
Still cute.

713
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:46,551
How you doing?

714
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,744
I'm all right.

715
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,079
I realized,
can't always get what I want.

716
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,032
No matter how bad I want it.

717
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,100
Can't fix my parents' marriage.

718
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:02,927
Can't make my dad love my mom.

719
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:04,486
I'm sorry.

720
00:39:05,382 --> 00:39:08,483
You've been wonderful
through all this craziness.

721
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:10,300
Thank you.

722
00:39:11,988 --> 00:39:13,300
Think we can start over?

723
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,047
What do you mean?

724
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:18,877
All I know is I miss those two people
who went to the zoo

725
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:21,945
and ate cotton candy and were
silly and happy together.

726
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,052
So you saying...

727
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,258
you want to get back together?

728
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,900
I'm saying

729
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:33,907
take it day by day,
see what happens.

730
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:37,340
I can do that.

731
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:41,750
Come here.

732
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,415
- So cute. Yeah?
- Still cute?

733
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:47,345
Still cute.
