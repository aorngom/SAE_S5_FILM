1
00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:02,212
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,382 --> 00:00:04,309
- When are you coming back to school?
- I'm not.

3
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:07,143
I'm enrolling at St. Clare's.
Just need a fresh start.

4
00:00:07,313 --> 00:00:09,996
- You're the whore from the video!
- You filmed us having sex

5
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,598
and showed it to everyone! I was in
that movie, too. Only instead of hiding,

6
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:15,784
I dealt with all the
whispering and all the looks.

7
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:17,820
You need to figure out
how to do that, too.

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,644
<i>What I feel is humiliated.
I feel like I'm in hell.</i>

9
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:22,048
Liam asked me out.

10
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:24,270
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,883
I just left.

12
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:27,972
Thank you for telling me.
I appreciate it.

13
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:29,847
This is my sister, this is Jen.

14
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,273
Here I am to rescue her
from bourgeois hell.

15
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:34,480
Adrianna Tate Duncan,

16
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:35,920
will you please marry me?

17
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:56,202
{\pos(192,230)}So, Navid and I...

18
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:59,381
{\pos(192,230)}We have something to tell you guys.

19
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:00,903
Something I already know.

20
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:05,213
{\pos(192,230)}I'm not giving the
baby up for adoption.

21
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,923
- So, you're keeping it?
- Wait for it.

22
00:01:09,097 --> 00:01:11,193
We are, actually.

23
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:14,522
Navid and I.
We're gonna raise the baby together.

24
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:16,151
And we're getting married.

25
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:17,993
- What?!
- Married?!

26
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,691
Like, married, married?

27
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:21,552
It's crazy, right?

28
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:24,372
What? I am not gonna
sit here and pretend

29
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:26,001
that I think it's a good idea.

30
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:29,051
If you want to keep the baby, fine.
If you want to help out, fine.

31
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:31,033
{\pos(192,230)}But married?!

32
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:32,542
{\pos(192,230)}Help me here.

33
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:37,093
{\pos(192,230)}It does seem a little drastic.

34
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,863
{\pos(192,230)}- We love each other.
- Things change!

35
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:42,691
{\pos(192,230)}Look at Annie and Ethan.
A couple months ago they were all

36
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:46,151
{\pos(192,230)}love love love, moon, moon, moon.

37
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:48,523
{\pos(192,230)}Now they hardly talk to each other.

38
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:52,700
I'm sure it's fun playing
house in your bedroom and all...

39
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,880
Hold on.
That's where you guys are living?

40
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:56,863
I know you love him.

41
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:59,002
But you have your
whole life ahead of you.

42
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:02,111
Think of all the life events
you're gonna miss out on

43
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,231
if you tie yourself down.

44
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,993
- There's college.
- I'm still gonna go to college.

45
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:08,790
{\pos(192,230)}College parties.

46
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,181
{\pos(192,230)}A summer in Europe.

47
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:13,510
{\pos(192,210)}Or a love affair with a
tall, unshaven Italian man

48
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:15,932
who cooks you pasta puttanesca.

49
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:18,472
It's not just Ade.
Navid, you're gonna miss out, too.

50
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:20,893
No, I've never had a thing
for unshaven Italian men.

51
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:22,943
- Yeah, but...
- We love each other.

52
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:25,582
I think we can offer
this kid a great family.

53
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:28,993
Why not reconsidering adoption?

54
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,142
There's tons of people
out there who can't have kids

55
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,161
- and are ready.
- We're ready.

56
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:36,531
We are and we're gonna
be great parents.

57
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:39,253
- I'm done. You done?
- Yeah, I am.

58
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:41,711
I'll see you guys later.

59
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:44,450
I didn't mean it.

60
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:51,720
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

61
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:53,263
Totally.

62
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:54,710
Me too, I'm good.

63
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:56,243
I'm really good.

64
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,232
I am great.

65
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,700
Who needs friends or parents.

66
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,582
We don't need any support.

67
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:05,281
Right...

68
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:10,930
Are you okay?

69
00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:13,562
I'm not so great.

70
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:17,030
I'm just glad you wanted to see me.

71
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:20,731
And I'm sorry I pushed you,

72
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,143
you know, to

73
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,313
come clean at your school.

74
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:29,952
Thanks.

75
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:32,600
It's just a really hard situation.

76
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:34,920
I know it is.

77
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,862
And I should have been
a lot more sensitive.

78
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:40,940
You've been through a lot.

79
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,352
So, however long it takes you to

80
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:47,672
be comfortable
in public or whatever,

81
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,512
I'm cool with that.

82
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,801
So, you're fine
just hanging out here?

83
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:55,861
Totally.

84
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:00,561
It's gonna make going to prom tough,

85
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:03,541
but maybe the prom committee
can move it here. That'd be nice.

86
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:06,112
Dixon, I can't go to prom.

87
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,251
I can't deal with
West Beverly kids yet.

88
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:13,310
But you want to go.

89
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:19,710
Now you're just
making me feel guilty.

90
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:23,531
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,873
I shouldn't have even brought
it up, it was stupid.

92
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:37,432
Hi, Father. Thanks for coming.

93
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:39,643
Your email was rather insistent.

94
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:42,621
A martini, please, dry, two olives.

95
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,740
So, I assume you're here because

96
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:49,123
the Wilsons have had
enough of your shenanigans.

97
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:51,031
I forgive you.

98
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:53,753
And of course you can come home.
In fact, I need you to.

99
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,611
These are tough times for the
family and we need to circle the wagons.

100
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:59,980
It's a tough time for you. You're the
one who sexually harassed Portia's...

101
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:01,670
Allegedly.

102
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,870
I'm a family man. I value family,

103
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:08,653
- morals, clean living.
- What the hell?

104
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:10,102
Don't blaspheme.

105
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:14,303
- You're home!
- Sorry I haven't called, Daddy.

106
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:15,472
How's school?

107
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,371
I'm learning lots.
I've had some time off

108
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:22,731
so, I thought I'd
visit the old homestead.

109
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:25,820
Things are tough but,

110
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:28,681
I'm so glad you're here.
You can come stay with Gail and me

111
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,900
and Naomi of course.
How's that for a plan?

112
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,571
I'm glad I'm here, too.

113
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:36,870
But there's no way on earth
I'm going to rally around

114
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,770
some narcissistic,
freaky, old sexual degenerate

115
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:42,352
just because he happens
to be my father.

116
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:44,250
And neither is Naomi.

117
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,771
So, I have a slightly
different plan.

118
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:50,641
I think Naomi should get the
first installment of her trust fund.

119
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,081
Now.

120
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:55,291
There's no reason she should
have to wait till she's 21 like I did.

121
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,542
And there's certainly no reason
she should have to live with you.

122
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,432
And "Gail."

123
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:03,843
That's ridiculous, Naomi's 16.
She can't sign a lease.

124
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,653
But I can.

125
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,552
Naomi and I are going
to live together.

126
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:09,013
Why should I agree to that?

127
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:11,372
Two words.

128
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:13,601
Michele

129
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,362
Braverman.

130
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:17,762
Who's Michele Braverman?

131
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,322
She was my tennis pro when I was 16.

132
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,493
Quite an attractive girl.

133
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:25,211
Ruddy, robust, very...

134
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:27,663
Healthy, wasn't she, Daddy?

135
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,001
You give Naomi the money

136
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:32,733
and we'll play the dutiful
little daughters.

137
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,313
Fine.

138
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:39,932
I'll have my business manager
send papers in the morning.

139
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:48,422
Were you just saying that?

140
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,943
I Do you really want
to live together? For real?

141
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:55,062
Absolutely for real--
for real for real.

142
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:58,061
Honey, I wouldn't abandon
you in your time of need.

143
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,850
Where do you want to live?

144
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,553
Do you want to live in Bel Air?
Los Feliz, Malibu, Hollywood Hills?

145
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:09,822
The world is
our oyster, baby sister.

146
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:12,987
- To oysters.
- To oysters.

{\pos(192,210)}Did you by any chance grab my
math homework off the dining room table?

150
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:44,511
{\pos(192,230)}- You're the best!
- That's what I keep telling you.

151
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,793
{\pos(192,230)}What's that?

152

{\pos(192,230)}- I have no idea.
- Open it up.

153

Surprise, surprise.

154
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,542
They're throwing me a shower.

155
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:06,702
{\pos(192,230)}Just so we're clear, I still
think you're making a huge mistake.

{\pos(192,230)}But you did stand by me when I
got those terrible highlights.

157

{\a6}So, if you're dead-set
on doing this,

158
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,772
{\a6}you're gonna need
your friends' support.

{\pos(192,210)}Thank you for the party!

162
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,281
{\pos(192,210)}To be fair, I'm footing the bill.

163
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,483
{\pos(192,210)}Annie's just lending her house.

164

I thought we were having it at the Ivy.

166
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:35,133
{\a6}We were.
But I also want Nobu sushi

167
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,403
{\pos(192,210)}and Sweet Lady Jane pastries.
Catering means we can have it all.

168
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,223
Great!

169
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:48,273
{\pos(192,210)}- Your dad's a pervert.
- He's not my problem.

170
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:52,120
{\a6}Your mom's a soap opera actress.

171
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,681
{\a6}What's the problem, Naomi?

172
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:13,582
{\pos(192,210)}Very funny.

173
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:17,521
{\pos(192,210)}Now, if you don't mind,
I have someplace to be.

174
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:18,603
{\pos(192,210)}Really?

175
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,473
{\pos(192,210)}Because, I don't.

176
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:22,400
Do you, Plum?

177
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:25,351
I could stay here
for hours and hours.

178
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:39,922
A pick-up for Ryan.

179
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,540
Hey there, English teacher.

180
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:45,713
Oh, what the...

181
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:47,871
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

182
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:49,890
It's, no, it's fine, okay.
It's just,

183
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:51,343
It's bloodshot!

184
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,702
It looks terrible.
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:57,690
You're NaomI's sister, right?

186
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:00,461
She never mentioned
you were so violent.

187
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:03,010
I'm a many-faceted woman.

188
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,863
Just to be on the safe side, I think
you should get checked out by a doctor.

189
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,821
When I was living in Nice,
I knew this guy

190
00:10:08,946 --> 00:10:10,912
who took a champagne cork
to the eye and, well, he

191
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:12,473
ended up having to have surgery.

192
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:14,480
- He nearly lost his eye.
- Surgery?

193
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,081
His whole face collapsed.

194
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:20,141
I mean, he had done so much blow
that his face was as hollow as a piñata.

195
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:24,072
One errant champagne cork and whoop,

196
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,991
the whole thing kind of imploded.

197
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:28,223
It's a cautionary tale.

198
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:30,563
- Don't do drugs.
- Aim your champagne bottles carefully.

199
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:33,342
- Ryan, your order's up.
- Excuse me.

200
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,133
So you were living in Nice?

201
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:41,511
- I love the Chagall Museum there.
- You like Chagall?

202
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,093
And that museum...

203
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:47,380
The Musée du Message Biblique
Marc Chagall? It's my favorite.

204
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,781
I know the curator.

205
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,552
I've been studying
art history in Paris.

206
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:55,652
- I thought you were at Yale.
- I've been doing a term abroad.

207
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,192
That's impressive.

208
00:10:57,668 --> 00:11:00,271
Please. Not compared to you.
You're a teacher.

209
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:02,702
Do you absolutely love what you do?

210
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,513
I do, actually.
It's fun.

211
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:08,690
I mean for now, you know.

212
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:11,483
- Really more of a writer.
- You're a writer?

213
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:13,701
Have you been published?

214
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:15,812
Not yet. But...

215
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:18,161
I've written a novel.

216
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:21,131
I'd love to read it.

217
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,102
I'd like that.

218
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:24,790
Maybe over dinner?

219
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:26,980
I would enjoy
having dinner with you.

220
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:28,460
- Great.
- Great.

221
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:31,252
I mean, you know what my motto is?

222
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,782
"Be careful when opening champagne"?

223
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:35,990
"Why the hell not?"

224
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:38,380
How about tomorrow night?

225
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,332
Why the hell not?

226
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:41,602
Okay.

227
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:49,203
How good is this?

228
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,280
It's sick.
This place is adorable.

229
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:53,913
I could seriously go berserk here.

230
00:11:54,035 --> 00:11:56,131
Let's do it.
I mean, let's go berserk.

231
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:57,863
I'm going to buy like 40 things.

232
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:00,852
We have to celebrate, right?
We found our dream house.

233
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:02,421
Isn't that place perfect?

234
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:05,502
It's amazing!
I mean, we have to get it.

235
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:09,292
The neighborhood is adorable. The nearby
stores could make a girl go berserk.

236
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:11,240
Here.

237
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:13,112
You have to try this on.

238
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:14,542
No way.

239
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,091
Trust me, Naomi.

240
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:18,153
I'm going to have
to give you a makeover.

241
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:19,491
- Not the dress.
- What?

242
00:12:19,768 --> 00:12:21,461
Portia Ranson.
She's here.

243
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:24,680
The bitch from the Blendeds
who boxed in my car this morning.

244
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:27,452
Let me talk to her.

245
00:12:35,326 --> 00:12:37,043
Portia. Jen Clark.

246
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:38,940
Hi. I'm NaomI's sister.

247
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:40,613
Sorry to hear that.

248
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:41,833
Listen,

249
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,990
I know that this lawsuit must be very
hard for you and your family.

250
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:48,053
I get that. But I think you should know
that it's really hard on Naomi, too.

251
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,401
So, I propose that
we rise above our parents,

252
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,370
and we treat each other
with respect.

253
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,981
Your sister's a bitch and a slut.

254
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,450
That's a disgusting
thing to say, Portia.

255
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:01,071
I don't think you should be talking
about other women that way.

256
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:03,801
And I really don't think you should
talk about Naomi like that.

257
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:05,612
Why not?

258
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:09,202
Don't underestimate
what I'll do to protect my sister.

259
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,561
How'd it go?

260
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:18,170
That girl's got a filthy mouth
and a sneaky demeanor.

261
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:19,961
I don't trust her.

262
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:21,783
Excuse me, Miss.

263
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:24,961
We're going to need
to check your bag.

264
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,030
God, this is ridiculous.

265
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:34,352
I don't know how that got in there.
This is some kind of mistake.

266
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,470
- Why don't you come with me?
- This is ridiculous!

267
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,533
Get your hands off me.
I didn't...

268
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:42,792
- This is so stupid!
- I told you not to underestimate me.

269
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:44,220
You...

270
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:48,313
I knew I didn't trust that girl.
But a shoplifter?

271
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:51,662
- Gosh, that's so sad.
- You're awesome.

272
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,491
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,180
Attention everyone!

274
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:15,000
The bride and
mother-to-be has arrived.

275
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:16,521
You look so beautiful!

276
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,480
Thank you for hosting.
This is incredible.

277
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:20,950
- Congrats. You're here!
- Oh, my God!

278
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:23,061
- How's your new school?
- It's pretty good.

279
00:14:24,257 --> 00:14:26,341
Everyone's here.
My family... my cousins.

280
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:29,021
- Hi, sweetie!
- Aunt Nancy! Hi.

281
00:14:29,606 --> 00:14:32,383
Your mom couldn't get off work,
so I am here to represent.

282
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:34,112
So, listen, how are you doing?

283
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:36,293
I've been really worried about you.

284
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:39,142
- Worried?
- Yeah! Listen, honey,

285
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,223
you've taken on a really big job.

286
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,280
Probably the biggest there is.

287
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,451
I know you're up for it.

288
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,291
- I think I'm going to cry.
- Pace yourself.

289
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:50,922
Save those tears for later.

290
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,930
All right, everyone!
It's time for the veil!

291
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:58,071
Wait for it.

292
00:14:58,405 --> 00:14:59,441
Wait for it.

293
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:05,611
All right, ladies.

294
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:07,461
Let the games begin!

295
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:13,733
Tonight I'm Leo Briganti.
You're Spencer Corwin.

296
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:15,791
You're Art Cosgrove.

297
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,720
And you're Manuel Montoya.

298
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:21,030
I'm Mexican?

299
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:22,792
Tonight you are.

300
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,423
Where'd you get these fake Id's?

301
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,971
Who says they're fake?

302
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,782
- Adrianna got her bridal shower
- And for you...

303
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,240
Welcome to your bachelor party.

304
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:58,583
Close your mouth, Spencer.

305
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:07,382
You don't drink.

306
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:11,090
Tonight I... tonight I do.

307
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,711
All right!
Time for the judges to confer.

308
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,232
Adrianna is the winner!

309
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,111
That is so unfair!

310
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,162
I mean, it's just

311
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,373
all in good fun. Isn't it?

312
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:26,100
All right, and up next we have
the blind baby food taste test.

313
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:28,821
So, Ade, you'll be the first contestant.
Want to just wait on the patio

314
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:30,923
- and we'll set up?
- You got it.

315
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:16,650
I didn't know women
could be that limber.

316
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:20,180
You're not exactly the expert.
'Cause you're a virgin!

317
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:22,822
- Dude.
- Somehow I don't think Navid's a virgin,

318
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:25,402
considering he's marrying
the girl he knocked up. Right?

319
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:30,202
It isn't, uh, technically my kid.

320
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,833
Okay. Come again?

321
00:18:33,177 --> 00:18:34,501
You're getting married,

322
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,273
and you've never had sex?
With anyone?

323
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,443
Including your pregnant fiancée?

324
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:39,923
When you put it like that...

325
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:41,353
Incoming.

326
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,983
Man, college girls! I told you
this bachelor party would rock.

327
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:45,120
Sorority sisters.

328
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:47,221
This could be your chance.

329
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:50,022
- Cool. 
- I'm just saying.

330
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:52,713
Could we sit down?

331
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:54,773
I've got a girlfriend.

332
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:55,983
Okay.

333
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:00,050
- Not that she acts like one.
- Ladies, please. Have a seat.

334
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,761
We'd be delighted.

335
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,102
- Right, Spencer?
- Sure. Please.

336
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:06,773
Delighted.

337
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,060
I have to... Tell you something.

338
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:12,842
Me?

339
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,512
I'm pledging a sorority and

340
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:19,931
my big sister is watching me so

341
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:22,532
if you could act like
I'm saying something

342
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,322
really dirty to you
I'd appreciate it.

343
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:33,632
Thanks.

344
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:35,230
I'm Isabel.

345
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:37,552
I'm Spencer.

346
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:39,763
- t's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

347
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,181
So, what's your major?

348
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:49,021
Mrs. Shirazi?

349
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,063
I'm sorry. I know
you're having a party,

350
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,111
but I haven't slept
in days and I had to talk to you.

351
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:58,502
You're making a terrible mistake.

352
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,863
A terrible, terrible mistake.

353
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,300
Please. Hear me!

354
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:04,520
You're not ready to raise a baby.

355
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:06,210
You're just a kid

356
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,952
You're not ready
and Navid is not ready.

357
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,250
You're going to ruin your lives.

358
00:20:11,938 --> 00:20:15,403
- And the child's too.
- All right! Get back here, bride!

359
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:17,311
I should...

360
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:19,163
Sure. Okay, but

361
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:21,461
please don't make this mistake.

362
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:22,422
Please.

363
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:14,201
You know, it's like she got...
It's like she got this trump card,

364
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:16,690
you know,
because she's bipolar or something.

365
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:20,462
Not that I judge, you know.
Not that I judge at all,

366
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,992
but it's like... you know,
it's not fair.

367
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:27,082
It's like...
it's like, because you have

368
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:30,482
something wrong, like,
I have to ask you to prom, you know.

369
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,563
Like, screw your mental illness
or whatever.

370
00:21:32,977 --> 00:21:33,811
Not that

371
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:37,123
prom has anything
to do with mental illness or...

372
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:39,571
I can't believe
you're getting married, Spencer.

373
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,590
- Yeah, it's crazy, right?
- All right, Isabel, You're up.

374
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:45,921
Up for what?

375
00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:51,953
But... no. Do you want
to be a Pi Nu or what?

376
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:54,833
Fine.

377
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:24,752
What are you doing?

378
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,801
Something I hope I'm too drunk
to remember tomorrow.

379
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:36,003
- Impressive.
- It's all in the wrist,

380
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:37,551
I wish I could cook,

381
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:39,783
but it just...
it seems like awfully hard work.

382
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,420
And, you know...

383
00:22:42,635 --> 00:22:44,873
Why work when
you can live off your trust fund?

384
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:47,110
You're preaching to the choir, babe.

385
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,382
You're a Jonathan Safran Foer fan.

386
00:22:49,516 --> 00:22:51,981
You know what,
taste this really quick.

387
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:57,042
Have you read his stuff?
Or, let me guess.

388
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,950
- You hung out with him in Dubai.
- Okay, that was amazing.

389
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,343
And... no.

390
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:03,823
I didn't hang out
with Jonathan Safran Foer in Dubai.

391
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,931
I find Dubai revolting.

392
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,510
We hang out in Brooklyn.

393
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,662
You know what I'll do?
I'll send him your novel.

394
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:16,611
I mean, yeah, that would...
That... it's a good idea.

395
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,102
So, when do I get to read it?

396
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:19,622
My novel?

397
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,881
Soon... yeah, totally.

398
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:26,871
Do you want another glass of wine?

399
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:28,242
We kicked that bottle.

400
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,680
I'll open a new one.

401
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:31,371
I can't cook,

402
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:34,281
but I am a genius
at opening red wine bottles.

403
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:49,260
<i>Please welcome to the stage</i>

404
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:52,051
<i>Taylor and his pell Boyd</i>

405
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:53,951
- Thank you.
- No, it was my pleasure.

406
00:23:54,077 --> 00:23:56,473
It's always fun to discover
hidden talents.

407
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:57,771
Hey, Spencer?

408
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,542
I don't think you
should get married.

409
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:09,343
- You don't?
- You're too young...

410
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:10,940
And too cute.

411
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:17,363
I got to go.

412
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:19,133
I'm coming.

413
00:24:23,248 --> 00:24:24,473
Wait, don't forget this.

414
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:29,501
Where are the girls going?

415
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:32,231
- Easy does it, Manuel.
- I just need some more tequila.

416
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:33,902
- Tequila.
- Hey, I got to go.

417
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,883
I really need
to talk to Adrianna right now.

418
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:38,362
Yeah, we can go.
Let's just get the check.

419
00:24:38,908 --> 00:24:41,550
No... no way. I don't want...
I don't want to go home.

420
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:44,383
I don't... I don't want
to see my girlfriend. I...

421
00:24:45,678 --> 00:24:48,041
All right, you guys head back.
I'll party with Manuel here.

422
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,253
Thanks for everything, guys.
Appreciate it.

423
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:54,450
No worries.
This party is on Leo Briganti.

424
00:25:04,758 --> 00:25:08,150
This looks like a fun little box.
Baby girl.

425
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:10,262
And this will be useful.

426
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:13,802
Yay, the groom's here!

427
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:15,090
Can I talk to you?

428
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:19,050
I want to make a toast

429
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,750
to the bride and groom.

430
00:25:22,716 --> 00:25:24,521
Future mother and father.

431
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,023
It is no secret that I thought

432
00:25:27,156 --> 00:25:29,811
this was a terrible idea...
The whole marriage thing...

433
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,060
but recently, I have been thinking
a lot about family.

434
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:34,170
My sister, Jen...
She just flew in from Paris,

435
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:37,030
and we're going to live together
in the most amazing house and...

436
00:25:37,546 --> 00:25:39,950
Having a good family
is so important.

437
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:43,583
Adrianna, Navid... You two
aren't going to be a couple anymore.

438
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:47,702
You're going to be a family, that's huge
so, as much as I hate to say it,

439
00:25:48,237 --> 00:25:50,350
I have to admit I was wrong.
I was.

440
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,551
I believe in you two.

441
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,871
You'll make this work.
You'll make a wonderful family together

442
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:57,331
So, Ade...

443
00:25:58,155 --> 00:25:59,923
I better be your maid of honor.

444
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,621
I will not wear yellow.
I love you.

445
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:05,603
I love you both.
Cheers.

446
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:07,613
- Cheers.
- Navid!

447
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:11,020
It's time for "How Much Do You
Know About Your Bride?"

448
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:13,191
Come on.
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

449
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:14,772
Go.
All right.

450
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:20,670
- You have the stuff, Annie?
- Yeah, I've got the questions.

451
00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:26,041
- Ethan, hey.
- Hey, you.

452
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:28,540
So, we meet again
on the outskirts of a party.

453
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:31,210
True enough.
I'm just here, dropping off Navid.

454
00:26:31,705 --> 00:26:32,510
Right.

455
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:35,301
- Where's Dixon?
- Dixon is...

456
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:38,702
Well, Dixon is currently

457
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:40,341
very drunk.

458
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:41,843
Dixon is?

459
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:45,071
This is all my fault.

460
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:47,640
You okay?

461
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:50,310
We just haven't been...

462
00:26:50,897 --> 00:26:52,590
Getting along so well.

463
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:54,652
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

464
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:57,492
It's like we are so far apart.

465
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:59,383
So disconnected.

466
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:03,963
You want to hear
my relationship theory?

467
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:07,453
You know how they say
no man is an island?

468
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:11,042
Well, I think, actually,
every man is an island.

469
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,060
- Oh, yeah?
- And...

470
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:16,732
Relationships are like bridges.

471
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:20,381
One guy builds one half
of the bridge, and

472
00:27:20,977 --> 00:27:23,803
the other guy...
or, gal,

473
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:25,251
you know...

474
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:27,190
Builds the other half,

475
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:29,191
and...

476
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,160
They try to meet in the middle.

477
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:32,993
But sometimes...

478
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:36,770
The islands are too far apart.

479
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,842
And it's sad, but...

480
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:43,601
It happens.

481
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,251
That's okay,

482
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:46,833
because...

483
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,751
Sometimes, it's just...

484
00:27:50,638 --> 00:27:51,693
Time to move on.

485
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:55,703
I don't know maybe I'm

486
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:57,300
just talking nonsense.

487
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,150
No, you're not.

488
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:03,103
I'm not?

489
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:06,511
You're right.

490
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:10,390
I haven't been doing my share.

491
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:12,662
Dixon has been making

492
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:16,090
all the compromises. He's been
building the bridge all himself.

493
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:20,643
I've got to start doing my part
if this relationship is going to work.

494
00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:23,041
Thank you, Ethan.

495
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:25,930
No problem.

496
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:28,583
It's pretty here.

497
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:30,432
It's not Nice.

498
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:32,092
But it's nice.

499
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:36,793
Can I tell you something?

500
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:38,680
I've had fun tonight.

501
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:40,440
A lot of fun.

502
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:44,423
Well, I'm glad.

503
00:28:45,368 --> 00:28:46,363
Me, too.

504
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:49,412
I, uh...

505
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,611
Should tell you something.

506
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:55,580
- Okay. I'm scared.
- I didn't write

507
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:57,103
a novel.

508
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:01,402
- You lied?
- I... I do write... I do.

509
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:02,782
It's just that

510
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:04,570
calling myself a writer is like...

511
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:06,453
is like calling myself
a mountain climber

512
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,660
because I've hiked up
Runyon Canyon a couple times.

513
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:13,080
But we're all liars, Ryan.
I mean,

514
00:29:13,537 --> 00:29:15,400
that's what being a human being
is all about.

515
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:17,450
Lying... we all do it...
All the time,

516
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:20,100
- okay?
- So, you lie?

517
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:24,432
Tell me one thing you've lied about.

518
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,681
Okay.

519
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,850
I'm not living off my trust fund.

520
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:30,041
In fact,

521
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:31,661
I spent it all.

522
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:34,581
I blew through a million dollars

523
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:36,673
in two months.

524
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:45,542
All right, well, you know,
I'm an astronaut.

525
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:47,701
- Oh, really?
- No, I'm a cosmonaut, and,

526
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:50,562
I'm actually
the reincarnation of Laika.

527
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:52,913
The Russian space dog.

528
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:54,923
I'm glad we cleared that up.

529
00:29:55,198 --> 00:29:58,111
I figured I would before
you saw me near a fire hydrant.

530
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:07,811
Liam, what are you doing here?

531
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:10,012
I'm just... returning
your drunk brother.

532
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:11,093
What...

533
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:13,431
what is wrong with you?

534
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:17,313
You got him drunk? Dixon doesn't drink.
That's really nice, Liam.

535
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:21,183
Oh, Annie. Why do you
always think the worst of me?

536
00:30:21,978 --> 00:30:24,213
Just tell me how to get
Dixon to his room.

537
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:26,960
- You can go back to your party.
- Yeah, 'cause I'm dying to get back.

538
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:29,393
A celebration of the fact
that two deluded 16-year-olds

539
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,552
have decided to ruin their lives...
Yippee.

540
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:33,543
And I really don't need your help.

541
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:36,223
Come on... come here.
Okay...

542
00:30:36,725 --> 00:30:38,163
- try not to...
- I'll, just...

543
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:39,973
I'm just going to help anyway.

544
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,672
Think I might have...

545
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,431
Drunken a little...
Too much.

546
00:30:50,496 --> 00:30:51,293
So...

547
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:54,720
You told Naomi I asked you out.

548
00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:58,363
Just like you knew I would.
Come on, Liam, don't play me.

549
00:30:58,697 --> 00:31:02,441
You are so obviously just trying
to destroy your relationship with Naomi.

550
00:31:03,568 --> 00:31:04,680
Yeah, why?

551
00:31:05,248 --> 00:31:08,743
Well, either because A
you're just not that into her

552
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:11,050
and you're not man enough
to be honest about it,

553
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:15,250
Or B, you actually do like her
and you're not man enough to handle it.

554
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:17,302
So that's your theory?

555
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:20,683
Basically, my theory is...

556
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:22,503
You're not much of a man.

557
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,970
I've been looking for
you everywhere.

558
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:53,951
Ade, I...

559
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:56,113
I have to talk to you.
Okay?

560
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,933
Well, okay, you know how
everyone keeps going on and on and on

561
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:02,181
about the things that we're
going to be missing out on?

562
00:32:02,306 --> 00:32:03,572
What life has to offer?

563
00:32:04,197 --> 00:32:06,243
Well, I kind of
haven't been listening.

564
00:32:07,786 --> 00:32:09,131
Until tonight.

565
00:32:09,516 --> 00:32:11,450
We ended up going to this

566
00:32:11,736 --> 00:32:13,061
burlesque club and

567
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,102
I started talking to this sorority girl
and

568
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:17,982
even she was telling me
that I shouldn't get married,

569
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:20,452
and I have to admit
I started thinking about it...

570
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:21,380
dating

571
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:22,852
other people.

572
00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:25,191
All that searching,
all that looking.

573
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:30,713
I'm so lucky, Adrianna,

574
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:32,363
that I found you.

575
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:35,460
I promise

576
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:37,681
I'm done, I'm done looking.

577
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:39,110
I'm done.

578
00:32:43,068 --> 00:32:45,352
Navid, we can't keep this baby.

579
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:49,202
What's that?

580
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:52,831
Your mother came here tonight.

581
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:57,001
She yelled at me and she told me
we were making a huge mistake.

582
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:59,530
No, don't you listen to her.
How, how dare she ruin your party...

583
00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:01,732
No, it's not because of her.

584
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:06,193
It's because of what
I did afterwards.

585
00:33:10,565 --> 00:33:12,531
I took drugs, Navid.

586
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,001
But Ade,

587
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:16,300
- what about the baby?
- I threw up.

588
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:19,292
After I realized what I did,
I made myself throw up.

589
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:21,670
- You were under tremendous stress.
- I was stressed

590
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:23,350
and I took drugs!

591
00:33:23,597 --> 00:33:26,531
That's not okay, Navid,
that's not good!

592
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:29,040
I'm not ready

593
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,101
to raise this child, okay? I...

594
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:32,181
I am not...

595
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:35,532
I'm really not ready. I just got out of
rehab a few months ago. I'm not ready.

596
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:38,603
- I know, but Ade...
- No, I'm not ready to raise this child.

597
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:40,991
I wish... I wish I was.

598
00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:42,682
I really,

599
00:33:43,707 --> 00:33:46,150
I really, really wish I was.

600
00:33:48,797 --> 00:33:49,802
I'm not.

601
00:33:56,888 --> 00:33:57,742
Oh, geez.

602
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:11,070
Thank you for helping me.

603
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:14,091
Yeah, yeah, no problem.
He'll, he'll sleep it off.

604
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:18,773
Annie, I was thinking about
those theories of yours and

605
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:21,303
I want to offer up another theory.

606
00:34:21,748 --> 00:34:23,510
Maybe I'm just curious about you.

607
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:25,853
What do you mean you're curious?

608
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:27,212
Well, I don't know.

609
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:28,233
I mean,

610
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:31,102
you throw a shower for something
you don't feel like celebrating.

611
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,540
You act like a good girl, but...

612
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:35,941
You're not.

613
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:38,440
You are a volcano.

614
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:40,632
- What?
- Yeah, see

615
00:34:40,816 --> 00:34:43,922
You're dormant now,
but there's stuff percolating.

616
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:46,332
This whole good girl routine,

617
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:48,331
the smile that you paste
on your face...

618
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:50,170
it's just a mask

619
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:52,793
and when you finally
can't take it anymore

620
00:34:53,396 --> 00:34:54,600
and you explode,

621
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:57,891
it's going to be fantastic.

622
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:02,673
Who doesn't want
to watch a volcano explode?

623
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:07,682
Annie, where are you?
It's time for dessert.

624
00:35:08,536 --> 00:35:11,761
No offense, but the baby cake
is a little macabre.

625
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:18,310
What were you doing upstairs?

626
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:21,611
Liam just dropped Dixon off.

627
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:25,252
And, I'm sorry, Naomi,
but I do not like Liam.

628
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,562
I just don't.

629
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:29,971
Of course you don't.

630
00:35:30,766 --> 00:35:32,233
I'm just playing him really tight.

631
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:35,702
I mean, it's tedious,
but I think it'll do the trick.

632
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:38,860
He'll come around. Maybe
I'll be the next one to get married.

633
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:40,723
Cake?

634
00:36:08,598 --> 00:36:09,870
How are you feeling?

635
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:12,372
I shouldn't have eaten that worm.

636
00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:15,522
Famous last words.

637
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:24,092
Would you...?

638
00:36:27,336 --> 00:36:30,021
Would you like to go
to the prom with me?

639
00:36:30,618 --> 00:36:31,533
Really?

640
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:33,372
Really.

641
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:37,811
Wait, hold on, wait.

642
00:36:39,045 --> 00:36:41,140
Are you going to
remember this tomorrow?

643
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:43,531
I'm not the one that's drunk.

644
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:48,540
Cool.

645
00:37:03,218 --> 00:37:05,471
A lot of this should be,
easy to return,

646
00:37:06,717 --> 00:37:09,730
though I don't know if we should
return things or give the money back.

647
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,742
And some of these things, I mean...

648
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:16,602
What are we supposed to do
with hand-knit baby booties?

649
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:18,983
We don't have to deal
with everything tonight.

650
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:23,912
Come here.

651
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:36,693
Hold me.

652
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:45,151
Are you okay?

653
00:37:46,158 --> 00:37:47,180
I'm sad.

654
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,520
I'm sad, too.

655
00:37:52,827 --> 00:37:54,960
We're not getting married, are we?

656
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:56,611
Maybe someday.

657
00:37:57,097 --> 00:37:58,813
- But not now.
- Not right away.

658
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:01,510
It doesn't make sense, does it?

659
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:03,891
No, it doesn't make sense.

660
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:09,462
- Do I have to give back my ring?
- What? No.

661
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:11,270
I had to sell my iPod for that ring.

662
00:38:11,598 --> 00:38:13,122
Of course not, don't be silly.

663
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:14,790
You keep that ring on.

664
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:18,851
It can be like an engagement-to-be
engaged ring.

665
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:21,083
Okay.

666
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,710
It's okay, Ade.

667
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:36,001
- We're okay?
- Yeah, I mean, think about it.

668
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:38,332
We've been through all of this,

669
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:41,623
through everybody,
through their reactions,

670
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:43,773
the whole storm, you know.

671
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:47,081
We didn't, we didn't turn
on each other.

672
00:38:48,488 --> 00:38:49,432
No, we didn't.

673
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,572
So we're more than okay.

674
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:55,712
We're good.

675
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,051
We're really good.

676
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:14,392
I love you.

677
00:39:15,827 --> 00:39:17,022
I love you.

678
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:30,801
I have the most wretched hangover.

679
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:32,750
It's probably
post-traumatic stress disorder.

680
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:34,771
I can't believe
you went out with Mr. Matthews.

681
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,790
- We got the house.
- We got the house?

682
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,513
- When did you find out?
- Yesterday.

683
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:40,360
I wanted to tell you
right away, but...

684
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:43,292
The money was supposed to be wired
from my bank in Paris, but

685
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:45,641
they used the wrong
routing number apparently.

686
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:47,003
It's so frustrating.

687
00:39:47,266 --> 00:39:50,071
I wanted to sort it all out
before I told you about the house, but,

688
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:53,633
now the bank is saying that it might
take up to a week to sort out. I just...

689
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,312
I don't know what to do.

690
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,513
I so don't want you
to have to pay with your money...

691
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:59,733
I don't mind. Seriously.

692
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:00,952
No. No way.

693
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:04,472
Jen, you have to let me
do this, okay?

694
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:06,603
You've been amazing to me. Please.

695
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:07,613
Okay,

696
00:40:08,216 --> 00:40:10,640
fine, but I'm going to pay you back.

697
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:12,490
I'm the big sister.

698
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:14,450
You're the best
big sister in the world.

699
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:16,410
You're so sweet.
