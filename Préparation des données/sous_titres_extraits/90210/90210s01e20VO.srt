1
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:04,067
Donna?!

2
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:05,534
You've got to open
a store in L.A., Donna.

3
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:07,000
Someone with bipolar disorder

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,201
needs to maintain balance.

5
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:12,000
I reserved a hotel suite.
I'll be staying there
until Mom comes home.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,800
It's probably best
that I pass on the baton.
Adoption?

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,301
Liam's a psychopath
and an awesome kisser.

8
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:19,468
Donna, what's going on?

9
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:20,967
David and I are separated.

10
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:34,767
Okay, Silver, hurry up and
finish that geometry homework.

11
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,501
Sammy, I need you to turn off
SpongeBob and drink your juice.

12
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,267
I don't like it.
It has bugs.
What?!

13
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,934
Those aren't
bugs, that's pulp.

14
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:43,434
Okay, uh, time check?

15
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:44,800
Uh, 8:18.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,934
Oh, Sammy's lunch.

17
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:47,101
Oh, I got it.
Already made.

18
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:48,900
A turkey sandwich, granola bar,

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,401
and a sticker
that says "I love you."

20
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,667
Mommy, I drunk the bugs.

21
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,600
Oh, you're the best.
I love you.

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,967
Okay. Donna, can you...?

23
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:56,234
Yup, taking him to the car.

24
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:57,501
Come on, Sammy.
Come on, buddy.

25
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,667
All right, here you go.
Geometry homework.

26
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,468
That last problem set
was a killer.

27
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:02,934
If you get inspired,

28
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:04,534
feel free to take a hack
at the tetrahedron.

29
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:06,067
Nice try.

30
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,434
Pretty soon, you'll be handing
in your homework yourself.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,167
You think you're
going to be ready

32
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:12,468
to go back to school next week?

33
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:15,034
Sure. I guess.

34
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,301
Bye.

35
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:18,101
Bye.

36
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,401
Hey, you sure you want
to sell this stuff?

37
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,267
I mean, honestly, Deb, there are
some real treasures in here.

38
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:38,167
Big Mouth Billy Bass.

39
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,201
No, we cannot sell
Big Mouth Billy Bass.

40
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,134
Let's hope we can.
Come on.

41
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:46,733
We'll put a pin in it.

42
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,301
We will not put
a pin in it. We will put

43
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:50,000
a price tag on ill it;
it's junk, Harry.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,367
Oh, if it's junk, then why are
we trying to sell it?

45
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,501
Ah, and therein lies the paradox
of the yard sale.

46
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,301
Hand me the singing fish,
my love.

47
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:00,633
Hey, Annie.
You shouldn't have.

48
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:02,867
Yeah, well, I didn't.
It's for Naomi.

49
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,167
She's giving me
a ride to school.

50
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,267
I just wanted to say bye.

51
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,767
Wow. You guys are
really making a go

52
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,301
of this whole
friendship thing, huh?

53
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,967
Yup. I have decided that I
want to be a girls' girl.

54
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,267
I don't know if you noticed,
but I didn't have

55
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,301
many girlfriends
back in Kansas.

56
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,167
And I was finally
starting to make some here,

57
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:23,234
and then I just got lost
in having a boyfriend.

58
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:25,534
So now...
You're ready
to be a girls' girl.

59
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,234
Bring on the
Barbie dolls.

60
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:28,600
Hey!

61
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,867
Bye, Mom.

62
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,534
Have fun.

63
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,667
Oh, my God, who left all that
junk in your front yard?

64
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,034
Seriously, you should file
a police report.

65
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:44,867
No, no, it's, um...

66
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,667
We finally sold
our house in Kansas,

67
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,600
and we got all
this stuff to get rid of.

68
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,468
So, uh, we're having
a yard sale.

69
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:52,767
Gross... ly awesome!

70
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,600
Um, here.

71
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,967
Oh...
It...

72
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,000
It's fine.
Uh, go ahead.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,434
Keep putting on your lipstick.

74
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:01,034
You made me coffee?

75
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:03,401
Yeah, it's a pretty color on
you. It was really no problem.

76
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,067
Sweet pea goes good
with... my eyes.

77
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,733
Oh! Is that a foosball table?

78
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,568
Yeah, I used to be
really big into foosball.

79
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,900
Seriously? Me, too!

80
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,967
I used to play all the time
with Bella Cruise.

81
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,667
I swear, I was, like,
the foosball champ of St. Barts.

82
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,767
We'll have to play.

83
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,767
I'd love to.

84
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,134
I hope it's not cold.

85
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:27,301
It's perfect.

86
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:29,534
I don't like my coffee
too hot anyway.

87
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:42,134
Hey, what's the rush?
Oh.

88
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,334
Hey, Liam.
Where you going,
White Rabbit?

89
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:46,501
Uh, to, to class.
I've got English.

90
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,034
Oh, yeah? You want to be
an English teacher?

91
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,000
Teach?
Well, yeah.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,568
I mean,
say you go to class,

93
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:53,167
maybe you get really
into it, right?

94
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,667
Then what?

95
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,633
You head to college,
and become an English major.

96
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,600
Okay. And then?

97
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,733
You graduate with
a useless degree

98
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,700
that only qualifies you
to teach English

99
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,700
at some lame high school
to snot-nosed kids

100
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,700
who'd rather be at the beach.

101
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,034
What are you saying?

102
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:10,334
I'm saying, let's go the beach.

103
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,134
Liam! Quelle surprise.

104
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:14,534
Hi-ya, Naomi.

105
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:16,600
Did I overhear you
trying to get Ethan to cut?

106
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,334
Because he won't, so stop
trying to corrupt him.

107
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:19,967
Naomi...
Don't worry, I got this.

108
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,934
No, I got this.

109
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,900
Sure, man.
Let's go to the beach.
Cool.

110
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,867
See ya, Naomi.

111
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,934
Well, I'm not going
with you two,

112
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,934
so don't bother asking.

113
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,867
So what time do we have
to go to your lawyer's?

114
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,401
Oh-ho-ho, no fries for you.

115
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:40,367
Come on, fries
are a vegetable.

116
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,834
And I said I'd be there
at 4:00, but, um...

117
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:45,000
mmm, but you don't
have to come.

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,900
I know I don't have to
if I don't want to.

119
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,834
But hey, here, I brought you
some real vegetables: kale.

120
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:53,334
Mmm, it's really not going
to be that exciting.

121
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,234
I just have to pick up a lot of
brochures...  and kale, really?

122
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:58,267
Yeah, vitamin A helps support
the fetal immune functions.

123
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:00,201
And, no, I don't want
excitement, but, you know,

124
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:03,067
I want to, you know, lend moral
support if and when it's needed.

125
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,434
Okay, sounds good.

126
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:07,067
Um, do I really
have to eat this?

127
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,034
Loaded with vitamin C,
which helps the baby

128
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:11,167
build strong bones
and teeth.
That's it.

129
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:12,867
I am confiscating
that pregnancy book
you're reading.

130
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,201
Sorry, it's already
committed to memory.

131
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,967
Hey, did you take your
prenatal vitamins?
Yes, Navid.

132
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,667
Am I driving you crazy?
Yes, Navid.

133
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,134
Okay, you know what?
Eat your kale.

134
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:21,967
Let's go. Turn around.

135
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:29,134
And what type of property
are you looking for?

136
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:31,967
It shouldn't feel too much
like a retail space,

137
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:33,534
more like an art gallery.

138
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:37,334
Modern, lots of glass,
clean lines.

139
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,700
Um, high ceilings,
big windows...

140
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,201
Oh, and a private

141
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,468
office space upstairs.
What else?
Uh...

142
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,401
"Else"?
Oh, marble.

143
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,034
It's got to have lots of marble.
I love marble.

144
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:48,800
And southern exposure,

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,067
wooden accents...

146
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:53,334
Oh, and I want an antique wooden
door with a brass

147
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:55,468
doorknocker in the shape
of a tiger's head.

148
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:56,800
Do you know any places
like that?

149
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,834
Not on the entire planet.

150
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:01,733
But I'll check the computer.

151
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:04,633
Boy, you sure do know what
you want for your store.

152
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,700
Uh, let me ask
you a question.

153
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,534
Do you want to find
a space to rent?

154
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:13,367
Sure.

155
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,434
I don't know what I want.

156
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:23,600
I mean...
Japan was supposed to be

157
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,834
a really fun adventure,
you know?

158
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,767
And when David got offered a
job, we were like,

159
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,967
"Sure, why not live overseas
for a year?"

160
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,800
And then my designs

161
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,034
took off
and he got promoted...

162
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:38,067
and everything just
seemed... unmei.

163
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,468
"Meant to be."

164
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:41,167
Then, one year

165
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:45,367
turned into two years, that
became thr four and...

166
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,867
Now, I just miss it here.

167
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,700
I want to come home.

168
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,334
Especially now
that I have Ruby.

169
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:55,301
I want to raise her here
where I have a support system.

170
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,733
Near you.

171
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,534
And David doesn't
want to move back?

172
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:01,434
We've been fighting about it
for over a year.

173
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,867
And the last couple of months...

174
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,667
things have
just been pretty awful.

175
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,267
And that's why we separated.

176
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,134
So if I move

177
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:14,334
back here, what...
What does that mean? Divorce?

178
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,501
I don't know.

179
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,034
Me neither.

180
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,568
I don't know
what's going to happen.

181
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,134
I don't know.

182
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Thanks, Liam.

183
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,434
Ethan!

184
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:08,634
Missed you in class today.
Oh, yeah, I...

185
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:10,933
wasn't feeling good, so a friend
dropped me off at home.

186
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,734
And now, I'm feeling better
so picking up my car.

187
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:15,734
Come on, man, cutting class?
It's not you.

188
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,801
Appreciate the observation.

189
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,701
What's going on with you, Ethan?

190
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,768
What's going on is

191
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,467
I'm sick of being watched
like a hawk.

192
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,834
Big deal, I miss one class.
It's not the end of the world.

193
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,267
Yeah, nobody said it was
the end of the world,

194
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:30,300
but it's also not okay.
All right?

195
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,067
And Liam's trouble,
and you know that, so...

196
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,000
Are you going to give me
detention or not?

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,501
Yeah. I am.

198
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:39,000
Good to know.

199
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,200
Oh, my God.
What a freak.

200
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,967
Oh, hello, Silver.

201
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,367
Hey, I saw your movie
on YouTube.

202
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:10,000
Brilliant. Seriously.

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,167
You're like a female
Darren Aronofsky.

204
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,367
Planning on standing me up?

205
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,033
They...
What's wrong?

206
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,334
They were
talking about me.

207
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,967
I can't go back to school.
There's no way.

208
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,834
Everyone's going to be laughing
at me and whispering, Dixon...

209
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,501
Sit down, sit down.

210
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:40,834
All right, look,
no, they won't.

211
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:42,367
And if they do...

212
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,134
So what? Who cares?

213
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:45,200
I do.

214
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,434
Fine. Then you know what?

215
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:50,367
Don't let them know that.

216
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:51,667
Just put on a smile

217
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:52,768
and act like nothing happened.

218
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:54,900
And when they ask

219
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,768
what I've been up
to for the last month?

220
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:59,200
I don't know, um...

221
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,100
Tell them you've
taken up gardening.

222
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,567
Or, uh...

223
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,567
Tell them you've been reading
Jane Austen.

224
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,933
And then just smile.

225
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,900
And dare them
to give you any trouble.

226
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,401
All right?

227
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:14,667
Just never let them
see you sweat.

228
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,701
"You got to fake it
till you make it."

229
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,667
Any more platitudes?

230
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,134
"Keep a stiff upper lip."

231
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:24,100
And, uh, "turn the other cheek."

232
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,134
Okay, that sounds
kind of tricky.

233
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:28,900
Keeping a stiff upper lip
while turning the other cheek.

234
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:34,234
But I'll try.

235
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,067
Atta-girl.

236
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,467
A hundred and fifty dollars?!

237
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:49,033
Harry, what on earth?

238
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:51,367
Seems a fair price to me.

239
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,567
Yeech, get that horrible thing
off your head.

240
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,134
What horrible thing?

241
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:58,534
Me hair? You think me
ginger hair is horrible?

242
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,701
Stop. Harry, honestly,

243
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,868
who's going to buy
a Big Mouth Billy Bass for $150?

244
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:06,701
Someone getting
a very good bargain.

245
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:09,801
Oh, you know, I
forgot to tell you this.

246
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:13,134
I heard the weirdest thing
at the school board meeting.

247
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:15,134
Could you take off the hat?

248
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:17,200
It's really hard
to take you seriously.

249
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,401
Uh, apparently,

250
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:23,933
Charles Clark is being sued
for sexual harassment.

251
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,334
What? Naomi's dad?

252
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:27,033
Yeah. By Carole Ranson.

253
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:28,900
Her daughter goes to West Bev.

254
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,601
Portia Ranson.

255
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,300
Whoa, poor Naomi.

256
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,033
"Poor Naomi" what?

257
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,933
Uh, well...

258
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:37,801
Sweetheart, you're going
to hear it anyway.

259
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:40,134
Uh, it's probably best
you hear it from me.

260
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:43,000
Dad, what?

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,701
Naomi's dad is being sued
for sexual harassment.

262
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,701
God.

263
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:51,167
Poor Naomi.

264
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,933
She's really going
to need a friend now.

265
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,534
I'm
telling you, she is

266
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:04,334
the crème de la crme
de la crème.

267
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,834
Okay, you're honestly telling me
that you think this

268
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,234
alleged psychic...

269
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:13,401
Madame Flanagan is
going to help you decide

270
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:15,167
whether you should stay
in L.A. or not?

271
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,834
Come on, I know this seems

272
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,967
kooky, but it's
worth a shot.

273
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:20,868
Madame Flanagan is very good.

274
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:22,868
She's the one that told
Angelina to adopt.

275
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,067
Oh, my...  that means nothing!
Well...

276
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:27,200
she also predicted the return
of high-waisted jeans.

277
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,567
I'm serious, like,
way back in 2006.

278
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,401
Kel, jump on board.
It's going to be fun.

279
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:35,868
Madame Flanagan
will see you now.

280
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,234
Here or Japan?

281
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:41,033
Right. So David's point is

282
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,033
everything's going
so well for us in Japan...

283
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:45,100
his career's thriving,
my career's thriving...

284
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,933
so why rock the boat?

285
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,367
Why, indeed?

286
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,900
Because I miss it here.

287
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,534
And I want to raise
my daughter here.

288
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,900
But if I stay in L.A.,

289
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,601
I don't know how my marriage
will survive.

290
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,868
And if I move back to Japan,
I'll be unhappy

291
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:01,434
and I don't know if my marriage
will survive...  but I want

292
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:03,267
my marriage
to survive, but...

293
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,734
I don't know.

294
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,167
At what cost, do you know?

295
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:10,100
Has your right foot been
bothering you?

296
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,567
I'm getting
a vision of a foot.

297
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:15,967
My right foot? No.

298
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,234
Maybe that was for someone else.

299
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,300
Anyway,

300
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,900
it sounds like you have
an important decision to make.

301
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,401
Yes! Yes, I do!

302
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:32,367
I'm sensing skepticism
from your friend.

303
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,634
Oh, don't
worry about her.

304
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,567
Tell me what to do.

305
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,100
I'm afraid I can't do that.

306
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,067
I will tell you this.

307
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,933
Look for a sign.

308
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:45,467
What kind of sign?

309
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:47,234
A sign of what to do.

310
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,734
Sorry.

311
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,501
You...

312
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:59,234
I'm getting a
vision of a man.

313
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,401
You're going to meet a man.

314
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:06,567
thanks for that, but, um,

315
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:09,434
I'm really not looking
for a man right now.

316
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:12,300
Looking or not, he's coming.

317
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,434
A very handsome man...

318
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:16,601
with a six-pack.

319
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:19,834
Uh, well...
that's good to know.

320
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:22,401
Thanks a lot,
Madame Flanagan.

321
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:24,033
Uh, but... Donna.

322
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,768
Donna!

323
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,868
Thank you.

324
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:44,200
Enjoy that guitar.

325
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,667
Hey, Principal Wilson.
Hi.

326
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,801
Adorable fish. Is that one
of your yard sale items?

327
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,667
No, not really.
Yes.

328
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,000
Hi, Ms. Wilson.
Hi.

329
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,634
Hey. You came.
Hi.

330
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,300
Yeah, I told you I'd swing by.

331
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,267
Cool. You want to play
some foosball?

332
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,701
Sure.

333
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:08,868
So... how are you doing?

334
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:10,067
Fine.

335
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,967
This morning was a little rough.

336
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,234
My manicurist

337
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,834
wreaked havoc on my cuticles.

338
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,234
It's fine, though.
I totally keyed her car.

339
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:19,367
Yes!

340
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:23,900
My parents
are driving me crazy.

341
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,167
Oh, yeah?

342
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:30,300
Um, how's your dad,
by the way?

343
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,834
Funny you should ask.

344
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:34,033
He called me today.
He wants to come by my hotel

345
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,000
for a chat.
Oh, yeah?

346
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,200
Shot on goal!

347
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,801
You are good.

348
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:41,567
Yes, I am.

349
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,100
So, hey, if you want to,
you know, call me later...

350
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,868
You know, after your dad leaves.

351
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,634
Yeah, right. Sure.

352
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:53,401
She shoots, she scores!

353
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:54,868
Yay!

354
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,267
Dan and Kate have been

355
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,367
married for three years.

356
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,701
Hey, five years or longer.

357
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:07,534
Okay, Matt and Rachel have
"a spacious house

358
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:10,667
with a huge, grassy yard,
but no one to play in it."

359
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,000
Sad.

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,267
Psychologically manipulative,
don't you think?
Yeah.

361
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,667
I don't want my baby to grow
up with psychologically
manipulative people.

362
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,100
I hear you. You want a nice,
down-to-earth couple.

363
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,033
Yeah. Two people
who are equal partners,

364
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,267
with good communication.

365
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:25,167
Who like to laugh
and are warm and loving.

366
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,567
Mm-hmm, exactly.
Is that too much to ask?
No.

367
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,567
I just wish that
kindergarten teacher Laura

368
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,467
would break up with
motorcycle-riding Jimmy,

369
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:35,868
and hook up with
animal-lover Josh...

370
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,601
who couldn't
possibly be happy

371
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:38,967
with plastic surgery Pam.

372
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,900
"Hoo-hoo" what?

373
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,701
That was a big kick.

374
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah?

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,567
Do you want to feel?

376
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,367
Yeah.
Okay.

377
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:56,134
Feel that?
Yeah.

378
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:58,734
That's a definite "no"
for plastic surgery Pam.

379
00:16:58,734 --> 00:16:59,967
I read somewhere that

380
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,801
the more active the baby,

381
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:03,167
the more likely it's a boy.

382
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:04,701
That's an old wives' tale.

383
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,334
Well, are you carrying
high or low?
Navid.

384
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:07,834
Well, high is supposed
to be a girl

385
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,634
and I think low
is supposed to be...
Stop!

386
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:12,900
I don't want to know
the sex of the baby, okay?

387
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,601
I don't even want the baby
to even have a sex.

388
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,167
I don't want to think
of the baby being a real kid

389
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,734
or a real person.

390
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:22,334
Someone that I'm going
to have to give up, okay?

391
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,768
Okay.
Okay.

392
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:27,300
All right.
Victoria and Gabe.

393
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,434
Check it out.

394
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:38,033
Another Japanese
restaurant.

395
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:39,768
That's got to be some
sort of sign, right?

396
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,501
I don't know.
The last Japanese restaurant

397
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:43,467
we saw had a stop sign
in front of it,

398
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:45,434
which could mean
don't go back to Japan.

399
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,834
You're right.
I was being sarcastic.

400
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,401
I was pretending
not to notice.

401
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,100
But wait, it's also
raining in Beverly Hills,

402
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,000
which it never does,
so maybe that's a sign.

403
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,134
Okay, Donna, uh,
I hate to be rude,

404
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,768
but Madame Flanagan?
Come on!

405
00:17:58,768 --> 00:18:01,467
The woman saw
a vision of a foot.

406
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,834
Yeah, but she also
saw a vision of you

407
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,601
with a handsome,
six-pack man.

408
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:08,401
Well, then she is good.
If she saw me with a man,

409
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,801
then she is seeing
way into the future.

410
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,033
I mean, between
taking care of Silver,

411
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:14,300
and taking care of Sammy,

412
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,933
and keeping up
with my job...

413
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,933
You've got to take
care of yourself.

414
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,234
You know how
they always say,

415
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:21,134
"Put your oxygen
mask on first

416
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,367
before you assist others."

417
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,501
Okay, but a man
is not an oxygen mask.

418
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:27,467
I mean, he's going
to have needs.

419
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:30,801
He's going to want
attention and time...

420
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:33,367
No one's talking
about a husband here.

421
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,200
A husband is
a beer belly.

422
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,267
I'm talking about
a hot, six-pack fling.

423
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,801
You know what?

424
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:42,334
We should get a sitter
and go out tonight.
Go where?

425
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:44,501
Well, someplace fun,
someplace cool,

426
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:46,933
someplace we can both
let off some steam.

427
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,367
Okay, that
sounds like fun.

428
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,033
Let's do it.
Oh, yay.

429
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,701
Where would one go
to blow off steam?

430
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:55,134
Uh, how should I know?
I live in Japan, remember?

431
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,401
Um, oh, wait. Hi.

432
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,768
Ooh, excuse me.

433
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,300
Okay, this is
a weird question,

434
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,734
but we're looking for
someplace to go out tonight.

435
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,434
Do you have
any suggestions?

436
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,334
Oh, what do you think?
On a Saturday night?

437
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:06,734
Truck Stop's a good time.

438
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:09,234
Oh, Truck Stop,
here we come.

439
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:12,868
Thanks!
Thanks!

440
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:40,734
What do you mean,
I have to leave the hotel?

441
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:42,601
Well, for my image
I need to be seen

442
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:44,100
as a family man right now.

443
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,033
See, I'm being sued.
Sued for what?

444
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,768
Well, Carole Ranson...

445
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,601
Oh, God, Portia's mom?

446
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:52,601
Why would she be suing you?

447
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:56,267
Sh-She's claiming falsely
that I sexually harassed her.

448
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,768
What?!

449
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:00,467
Oh, my God, Dad,
what's wrong with you?

450
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,834
I didn't do it.

451
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,768
But I need us to present
a unified front

452
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:05,567
as a family.

453
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,801
Plus, it's illegal for you to be
living here on your own.

454
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:09,300
And I'm going to be
pretty scrutinized

455
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,634
over the next few weeks, so I
need you to come home with me.

456
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:13,134
Wait, so let me
get this straight.

457
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:14,634
I'm being punished
because of your screw-up?

458
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:17,534
Just pack your things, Naomi.

459
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:19,300
No.

460
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,367
You can't make me.

461
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,634
I'll tell Gail
about the real estate lady.

462
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:26,834
I already told her.

463
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,367
And she's forgiven me.

464
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:30,867
????

465
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,000
Sorry.

466
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,768
Ooh, fun cocktails.

467
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:04,900
I'll order for us. Excuse me.

468
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,300
What can I get you?

469
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,167
Can we get two
Dirty Girl Scouts, please?

470
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,434
They have California
rolls here.

471
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:14,100
Do you think maybe
that's a sign I should

472
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,300
split my time between...

473
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,401
Okay. You're right.

474
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,134
No more obsessing over signs.

475
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:21,167
We'll just obsess over the fling

476
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:23,501
that you're
going to have.
Okay, what do you want me to do?

477
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:24,967
Find some cute guy
and ask him

478
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,734
to lift up his shirt
so I can see his abs?

479
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:29,967
No. You don't ask.

480
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:32,900
Wait, actually, there's
not that many guys here.

481
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:35,567
Uh, you know what?

482
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:38,534
You're kind of right.

483
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,200
Uh, Donna?

484
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,868
Um, do you think we...

485
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:47,167
are at a... l-lesbian bar?

486
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,467
No.

487
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,300
It's just L.A.

488
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,267
Oh, my God, we're
totally at a lesbian bar!
Yeah.

489
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:56,300
How could those girls
send us to a lesbian bar?
I don't know.

490
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,167
Oh... it's 'cause we had
our arms around each other.

491
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,601
Two dirty Girl Scouts.

492
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:06,167
Cheers.

493
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,167
You want to dance?

494
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,967
Uh, only if you've
got a six-pack.

495
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:15,467
Well, to find that out,
you're gonna have to
get me a lot drunker.

496
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,000
Come on.

497
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,167
Oh, hey, Liam.

498
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh. Hey, Naomi.

499
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:34,834
What is up with him?

500
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,234
He acts like we haven't
been screwing like rabbits

501
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:37,334
for the past week and a half.

502
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:40,434
Did I tell you I ran
into him at Shang Hau?

503
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:41,667
We went in the bathroom

504
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,234
and...
Oh. Enough.

505
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:45,434
Agreed. It is
enough already.

506
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:47,033
Seriously.

507
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,334
I mean, he's, like, hot,
and then he's cold,

508
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,900
and then he's
really hot again.

509
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,967
Whatever, I'm
over it, seriously.

510
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,868
I don't want to be
some booty call.

511
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:57,933
I'm not the type of girl you
run into at a Chinese restaurant

512
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:59,434
and take into a bathroom.

513
00:22:59,434 --> 00:23:00,768
Anymore.

514
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:03,200
I have much more
self-respect than that.

515
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,367
Well, right on, sister!

516
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:07,900
Thank you.

517
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,601
So, how was your dad?

518
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,900
Uh, fine.

519
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,367
Mm, same old loser.

520
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:19,234
God, these are
really good fries.

521
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:22,067
Like, crazy delicious good.

522
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,033
Yep, they are good.

523
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,967
Your dad's a disgusting pervert.

524
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:29,467
I hope my mother takes him
for all he's worth.

525
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,300
How dare you!

526
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,067
You can't blame Naomi
for something that her dad did

527
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:36,467
o-or didn't do.
Oh, please,

528
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:38,567
the guy's a scumbag.

529
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,200
You knew?

530
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,801
You knew about my dad?

531
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:45,634
I... I-I just heard yesterday.

532
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,300
So you knew today
at the yard sale.

533
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,167
I-I am sorry. I...

534
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,300
I can't believe people are
talking about my dad, about me,

535
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,467
and you didn't
even say anything.

536
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,900
Some friend.

537
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,134
Okay, wait, we seriously
have to go now.

538
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:26,200
No. No, no, no.
No. We'll
totally be back.

539
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,401
Promise?
Yeah.
Promise?

540
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:29,501
Of course...
this is just
what we needed.

541
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,167
Come on, let's go.

542
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:34,200
Okay, have another
dirty Girl Scout for me.
Okay, be careful.

543
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,134
I'm just saying that Alyssa
was definitely into you.

544
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:39,967
Oh, are you jealous?

545
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,401
Of course...
you came with me.

546
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:45,467
If I'd known you were
gonna be such a fickle date,

547
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:47,634
I would have-ve...

548
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,033
Donna?

549
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:55,300
It's exactly how I imagined it.

550
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,567
And look.

551
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:59,801
The sign.

552
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:02,134
Looks like
someone's moving back.

553
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,484
Okay.

554
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,317
Yes, I know when checkout is.

555
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,250
Thank you for
reminding me again.

556
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,250
Okay.

557
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:28,951
Just a minute,
I'm almost done packing.

558
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:30,450
It's Annie.

559
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:34,784
What do you want?

560
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:38,018
Well, I-I just
wanted to apologize.

561
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:42,584
Um, look, I should've told you
what I heard about your dad.

562
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,717
Just chickened out.

563
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:47,717
I so badly wanted
to be a girl's girl,

564
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:49,651
to have real friends,

565
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:54,317
and I wish that I could
undo what I did or...

566
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:55,717
Oh! Stop.

567
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:57,284
Stop!

568
00:25:57,284 --> 00:25:59,417
Please, I'm going to be
kicked out of this hotel.

569
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,551
I don't know where
the hell I'm gonna go,

570
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:03,918
and you talking on
and on and on like that,

571
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:05,484
it's really giving me
a headache.

572
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:07,450
The hotel's kicking you out?

573
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,584
My dad says
I have to live at home.

574
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:11,584
Apparently it doesn't
look good for an alleged

575
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,651
sexual harasser
would-be family man

576
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:16,150
to have a 16-year-old daughter
living alone in a hotel.

577
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,050
Stay at my house,
as long as you want.

578
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,784
Or, you know, until you decide
what to do about your dad.

579
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:27,150
Live with you and your
Pollyanna family?

580
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,284
I don't know, I mean,
well, I guess it'd be better

581
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:30,851
than living with
my dad and his mistress.

582
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:32,918
I would really like it.

583
00:26:32,918 --> 00:26:35,350
Wait, why? 'Cause you pity me?

584
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,651
No.
Because I don't want
a friendship based on pity.

585
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:43,018
If we're gonna be frieto be blunt and ho

586
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,317
We can't walk on eggs
around each other.

587
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:48,350
Eggshells.

588
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,651
W-We can't walk on eggshells.
Right.

589
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,150
Thank you.

590
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,817
And you play with
your hair way too much.

591
00:26:55,817 --> 00:26:57,651
God. Sorry, you do.

592
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,484
I mean, I'm just being honest.

593
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,484
Well, then I'm sorry
that I threw the foosball game.

594
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:04,183
What?

595
00:27:04,183 --> 00:27:05,918
You let me win at...

596
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:08,050
Oh, there is going
to be a rematch.

597
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,651
And I'm going
to destroy you.

598
00:27:09,651 --> 00:27:10,918
Oh, anytime.

599
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:13,083
Show no pity...  that's my motto.

600
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:22,250
Our house is big,

601
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,450
there's a park
around the corner,

602
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,984
huge swing set,

603
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:27,617
sandboxes.

604
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:30,684
A jungle gym that looks so cool,
I'm tempted to climb on it.

605
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:34,384
Luckily, I only have to
teach two days a week.

606
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:36,284
And on those days,
I'll be working from home.

607
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:37,717
I plan to be very hands-on.

608
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:40,517
I don't want to miss a
minute of this kid's life.

609
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:42,551
And we both want
to be there for everything.

610
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:44,183
You know, the smiles,
the diapers,

611
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:45,717
the crawling, the walking.

612
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:47,617
GREG:
Building of
tree houses.

613
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:49,584
He's been talking
about this alleged
tree house for years.

614
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,317
I'll believe it
when I see it.

615
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:54,717
So, it says here
that you have a dog?

616
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:56,450
Yes, Nina.

617
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,984
She's great with kids.

618
00:27:57,984 --> 00:28:00,384
We've had her seven years.
Yeah.

619
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,150
Well, what if the baby
is allergic?

620
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,183
Oh, well, I mean, of course,
we would prioritize the child.

621
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:10,918
So you'd just give your dog away
after having it for seven years?

622
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:12,918
My parents live

623
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:15,851
45 minutes away...  I'm
sure they'd take her.

624
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,183
Great.

625
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:19,817
Seem to have an answer
for everything.

626
00:28:32,884 --> 00:28:35,350
Ha! Eat it!

627
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,951
Damn it! Oh!

628
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:38,817
71-70, match point.

629
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,817
All right.

630
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:45,284
71-71! Ha! Yes!

631
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:47,684
Ooh! Mom, can Naomi spend
the night tonight?

632
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,050
Now you're
gonna die.
Sure.

633
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,183
Now you're
gonna die.
Hey, Naomi.

634
00:28:50,183 --> 00:28:52,050
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh!

635
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,183
Oh! No! No, no, no, no!

636
00:28:59,018 --> 00:29:01,018
Donna, are you ready?

637
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:03,918
You can't be late
to your own opening.

638
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:05,751
Hey.

639
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,417
Are you okay?

640
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,751
I just got off the
phone with David.

641
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,617
What happened?

642
00:29:15,918 --> 00:29:18,617
I told him about the space.

643
00:29:18,617 --> 00:29:20,717
How perfect it was,

644
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,484
how it was exactly
how I envisioned it,

645
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:27,584
how I want to come back here,
I want to make a go of it.

646
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:28,717
And?

647
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:30,117
And he said

648
00:29:30,117 --> 00:29:32,050
we'll have to figure
out a schedule

649
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,584
to shuttle Ruby
between L.A. and Japan.

650
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:36,817
Honey.

651
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:40,484
I guess I always thought
when push came to shove

652
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:42,817
that he wouldn't
want to lose me.

653
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:45,150
But if he's willing
to lose me...

654
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,617
Oh, come here.

655
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:51,217
I just really thought he'd
want to move back here.

656
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:53,018
I really did.

657
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:57,717
I thought he'd
choose me over Japan.

658
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:01,050
I know this is hard,

659
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,150
but I also know...

660
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,317
that you are amazing.

661
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:09,018
You are...

662
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:11,817
talented and...

663
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:13,751
sweet and kind

664
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:16,050
and wonderful, and you
are gonna get through this,

665
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,584
no matter what.

666
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:19,918
I know.

667
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,951
I know.

668
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:23,984
I will.

669
00:30:23,984 --> 00:30:27,183
Part of me's really excited.

670
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:31,817
I'll get to raise Ruby here,
and that's what I really want.

671
00:30:31,817 --> 00:30:33,551
And the store is perfect.

672
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,384
I'm really excited about
signing the lease tonight.

673
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:41,717
And I'm really excited...

674
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:44,450
to go celebrate.

675
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,918
Oh, honey.

676
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:49,617
No, I'm happy.

677
00:30:49,617 --> 00:30:51,951
I'm really happy.

678
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:10,384
This cheese is delicious...

679
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:12,384
just as I foresaw.

680
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,317
Hey, we're gonna be sending
all our friends to your store.

681
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:16,750
Seriously!
I'm counting
on it!

682
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,950
Hey, guys.

683
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,917
Hey, Ms. Taylor.

684
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,950
Ms. Taylor?
I know.

685
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,017
Hello, Ms. T.

686
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:23,084
Hi, girls.

687
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:24,850
Donna, this is
Naomi and Annie.

688
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,950
Hi.
And what's with
the ice pack?

689
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,384
Vicious foosball
tournament.

690
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:29,651
I kicked her ass.

691
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:31,084
And cute stuff,
by the way.

692
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:32,684
Maybe I'll even
find a prom dress.

693
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,384
You didn't
"kick" anything.

694
00:31:34,384 --> 00:31:37,317
She won by one point...
and we're definitely
going to have a rematch.

695
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:39,484
Oh, you just name the day,
anytime, any place.

696
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:40,850
Excuse me, you guys.

697
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,750
Liam...

698
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,651
Look at this.

699
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:50,451
Well, thank you
both for coming.

700
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:53,017
I'm sure Silver
will appreciate it.

701
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:54,351
Hey.
Oh, hi.

702
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:56,284
Honey,
there you are.

703
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:58,451
Hey. Dixon, Silver.

704
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,351
How you been?

705
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,517
Fine.

706
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:04,417
Fine.

707
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:05,551
Do you want something to eat?

708
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:06,950
Uh, no, thanks.

709
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,883
Well, it feels like
it's been forever.

710
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:09,217
What have you been up to?

711
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:12,817
Well, I've been reading

712
00:32:12,817 --> 00:32:14,351
Sense and Sensibility,
actually.

713
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,684
Hey, Silver, how are you?

714
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,351
Um, can I get you something to
eat? Um, some cheese?

715
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:21,017
Um, I'm gonna get myself
some cheese.

716
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:22,117
Appreciate it, though.

717
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:23,850
Okay, I'll help myself.

718
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,984
Want some, hmm?

719
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:33,718
Hey, so is it nice
to see everybody?

720
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,050
Does it make you want
to go back to school?

721
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,750
Yep, I'm ready to go back
to school.

722
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,684
Honey, that's great.

723
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:42,084
Good.

724
00:32:44,251 --> 00:32:45,651
Ooh, nice flowers.

725
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:47,317
They're from David.

726
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:50,084
"Thinking of you."

727
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:51,584
What does that even mean?

728
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:55,150
I guess it means
he's thinking of me.

729
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,084
But it's no plane ticket.

730
00:32:57,084 --> 00:33:00,084
Anyway, we're low
on crackers.

731
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:02,883
The foosball champs decided
to inhale the whole stash

732
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:04,484
and then the backup stash.

733
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,084
So I'm gonna... just gonna run
around the corner and get some.

734
00:33:07,084 --> 00:33:09,351
No, no, I'll go.
It's your party.

735
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:10,618
Are you sure?

736
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:12,117
Yes.
Thanks.

737
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:22,284
Oh, gosh.

738
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:23,850
Hey!

739
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,150
Hey. Uh... late-night
munchies or...?

740
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,651
Oh, no, a friend of mine
is opening a store

741
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:33,017
and ran out
of crackers.

742
00:33:33,017 --> 00:33:34,217
Sure.

743
00:33:34,217 --> 00:33:35,817
What about, what about you?

744
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:38,017
Oh, just, uh, picking up
a six-pack.

745
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,417
A six-pack?

746
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:43,084
Yeah, beer is sold
in packs of six.

747
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:44,718
But don't worry.

748
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:47,251
I'm only gonna drink... three.

749
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:52,750
Uh, well, uh,
who's gonna drink
the other three?

750
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,883
Uh, no one's called 'em.

751
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:59,750
I'm... kinda thirsty.

752
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,117
What are you,
the bouncer?

753
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:32,750
Yeah, just keeping
out the riffraff.

754
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,750
Navid texted me
that everyone was hanging out.

755
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,917
Thought I'd stop by.

756
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,517
I actually came here with Liam,

757
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:39,484
but, uh, he seems to have
mysteriously disappeared.

758
00:34:39,484 --> 00:34:43,184
Oh, yeah? Well, head on in.

759
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:44,817
You're not gonna bounce me?

760
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:47,150
Uh, not this time.

761
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,217
It's fun. Everybody's here.

762
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:53,184
It's Dixon, Navid, Adrianna,
Naomi, Annie.

763
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:56,984
Ooh, two ex-girlfriends.
Sounds a little claustrophobic.

764
00:34:56,984 --> 00:34:58,651
I hear ya.

765
00:34:58,651 --> 00:35:00,817
You, uh, you mind if I sit?

766
00:35:00,817 --> 00:35:03,384
As long as you don't
expect me to be

767
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:05,150
bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

768
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,351
Thank God you're not.

769
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:07,351
Silver?

770
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:08,217
Yeah?

771
00:35:08,217 --> 00:35:09,618
Are you okay?

772
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:11,850
Yeah, just, uh, just
getting some fresh air.

773
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,150
Okay.

774
00:35:22,618 --> 00:35:23,750
Hey, Liam,

775
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,817
I got your text.

776
00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:26,517
You know what?

777
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,217
I'm not gonna be
your booty call.

778
00:35:28,217 --> 00:35:30,050
You can't just act
all cold and rude

779
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,050
and then text me,
expect me to show up

780
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,917
and jump your bones
or whatever. Got it?

781
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:35,351
Okay, got it.

782
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:50,117
You want to
talk about being
claustrophobic?

783
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:53,551
Try having people
monitoring your mood
every second,

784
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,917
offering you crackers like
you're an invalid.

785
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:58,817
At least you're being
offered crackers.

786
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:01,384
I got people
always watching me

787
00:36:01,384 --> 00:36:03,718
and there's no upside.

788
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:05,883
What do you mean?

789
00:36:05,883 --> 00:36:09,217
Ah, I don't know. It's just
you step off the path

790
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:12,484
you cut one class,
and people are down your throat.

791
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:13,917
You cut class?

792
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:14,917
I might've. Whatever.

793
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:19,217
It's not like I'm trying
to be an English teacher
or something.

794
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:22,684
So, when are you
coming back to school?

795
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,217
I'm not, actually.

796
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:31,817
I'm enrolling
at St. Clare's.

797
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:34,284
You're gonna go
to a Catholic school?

798
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:37,217
It's the only place that would
take me mid-semester.

799
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:39,651
Went on a tour yesterday.

800
00:36:39,651 --> 00:36:41,783
It's not that bad.

801
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:46,384
Huh... nah, Dixon didn't mention
anything.

802
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:49,050
Yeah, well, that's,
that's because Dixon
doesn't know yet.

803
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,251
I just decided tonight.

804
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,783
I just need
a fresh start, you know?

805
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,084
Where no one knows me...

806
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:05,150
where I can just be
who I want to be,

807
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,217
instead of who I was.

808
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,850
You think St. Clare's has room
for me?

809
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,718
It's an all-girls school.

810
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:16,284
Oh, sounding better
and better.

811
00:37:26,317 --> 00:37:27,417
I missed you.

812
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:29,618
I can't put on
your oxygen mask.

813
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:30,684
What is that?

814
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:32,750
I mean, I can't
commit right now.

815
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,584
Agreed.
No commitment.

816
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,883
I've never felt less committed
to anything...  wow...

817
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:37,883
in my entire life.

818
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:39,584
Shut up, Ryan.

819
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:54,651
You, you my friend, you.

820
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,351
Hey, how was
the party?

821
00:37:58,351 --> 00:37:59,551
It was cool.

822
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:03,017
Hey, so I got you guys
a thank-you gift

823
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:04,451
for letting me stay with you.

824
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,984
A little birdy told me
you'd miss it.

825
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,950
Oh, my...!
Big Mouth Billy Bass!

826
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,184
Naomi, thank you.

827
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:14,217
Well, Dixon sold it
to me, so...

828
00:38:15,184 --> 00:38:16,618
Good night.

829
00:38:16,618 --> 00:38:17,618
Good night.

830
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:18,750
Good night.
Good night.

831
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,750
Good night.

832
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,317
A thank-you gift?

833
00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:23,417
How long do you suppose
Naomi is staying here?

834
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:24,618
I don't know,

835
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:26,917
but judging from the quality
of the thank-you gift...

836
00:38:27,883 --> 00:38:31,117
...it could be a while.

837
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:42,718
No, no!

838
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:45,284
Did you see Leslie's shoes?

839
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:48,317
Kind of vain for an English
professor, don't you think?

840
00:38:48,317 --> 00:38:50,917
I don't know how she'll carry
a baby around with those shoes.

841
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:53,917
I'm sure she has other shoes.

842
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,551
And didn't you think
it was weird

843
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:57,651
how Greg was all fixated
on building that tree house?

844
00:38:57,651 --> 00:39:00,050
Look, if you didn't like them,
you should have just...

845
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,184
I did. I did like them.

846
00:39:02,184 --> 00:39:05,184
I just... I don't know.

847
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:10,117
Just all that talking about
schools

848
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:13,017
and dogs and tree houses.

849
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:18,817
I kept picturing the kid,
you know,

850
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:21,651
going to school

851
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,651
and walking the dog...

852
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:28,084
and climbing in that
stupid tree house.

853
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:32,750
And once I pictured that kid,
I just...

854
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,417
the idea of giving it up
just got a lot harder.

855
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,684
Hey, you don't, you don't have
to give your baby up

856
00:39:38,684 --> 00:39:39,783
if you don't want to.

857
00:39:39,783 --> 00:39:42,551
Yeah, yeah, I-I do.

858
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:44,684
I've been through this.

859
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:46,150
I have to be realistic.

860
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,551
My mother doesn't have

861
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:53,050
the financial means, and I'm 16.

862
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,050
And frankly, we don't have
such a great partnership,

863
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,451
my mother and I.

864
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:00,883
I don't exactly see us
at baby swim classes together.

865
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:02,351
What about us?

866
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,484
Could you picture us?

867
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:08,184
What do you mean?

868
00:40:08,184 --> 00:40:11,984
I mean me. I mean us.

869
00:40:11,984 --> 00:40:14,718
I could go
to baby swim classes.

870
00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:16,817
I mean, you're
looking for a couple

871
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:17,984
that communicates,
right?

872
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:21,117
Laughs and respects one another.

873
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:23,017
I mean, that's us, right?

874
00:40:23,017 --> 00:40:26,017
A baby lasts a lot longer
than baby swim classes.

875
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:27,150
Well, I'll be there
a lot longer.

876
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,883
Yeah, until you go away
to college.

877
00:40:28,883 --> 00:40:30,551
I'll go to college nearby.
Who cares?

878
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:34,917
Hey, hey, the only thing
that matters is

879
