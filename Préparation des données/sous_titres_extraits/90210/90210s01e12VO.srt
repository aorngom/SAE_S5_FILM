1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,960
90210

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,600
My name's Sean.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,060
Son of Harry Wilson and Tracy Clark.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,560
I didn't exactly have the most stable upbringing.

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,430
Certainly didn't grow up in a place like this.

6
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,200
You're the first brother at West Beverly

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,800
to play varsity lacrosse as long as anyone can remember.

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,630
Who is that?

9
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,230
just a cheerleader.

10
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,460
Everything you have done

11
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,260
was just to set me up to ruin my birthday?

12
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,260
Absolutely.

13
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,600
Being your friend, I'm over it.

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,400
I already beat you to it.

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,330
You want to be with me?

16
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,600
Well, yeah.

17
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,660
I'm a virgin.

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,660
What?

19
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,800
I was trying to push you away.

20
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,660
Why?

21
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,830
Because I slept with Ryan.

22
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,430
25 years,

23
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,960
that's a long time.I don't know that I can

24
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,560
possibly make that up to you.

25
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,530
It's all good.Everything's cool here.

26
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,060
I'm making myself right at home.

27
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,860
Ah, you should have seen me.

28
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,800
I was poppin' huge air off all the moguls

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,400
and just shredding down the black diamonds.

30
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,730
Look at you,Mr. Hotshot Boarder.

31
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,800
You gotta come next year.

32
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
I really missed you.

33
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,660
No, you missed the chance to laugh at me

34
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,260
when I face-planted off the ski lift.

35
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,200
I'm a simple man with simple pleasures.

36
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,460
Kansas, darling,how was your winter break?

37
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,760
Oh, my God, Mom and I took Sean to Cancun,

38
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,430
but you probably already heard that from him.

39
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,430
Yep, he mentioned it.

40
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,630
Oh, my God,he's so awesome.

41
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,430
It was so great to spend that quality time

42
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,330
with my half brother.I mean, our half brother.

43
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm so sorry.I didn't mean to exclude you.

44
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,100
No problem.You didn't.

45
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,800
We had a blast.

46
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,700
Oh, my God, I totally dared Sean to eat a fried grasshopper.

47
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,530
And we laughed so hard,

48
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,600
I thought grasshopper was going to come out his nose.

49
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,830
I'm so sorry you missed it.

50
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,360
It's not a competition,Naomi.

51
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,800
You can Sean it up as much as you want.

52
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,330
That is really mature of you,Annie.

53
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,660
Honestly, I don't think I could be quite so open-minded

54
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,460
if Sean didn't want to hang out with me.

55
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,460
Well, it was

56
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,600
an adjustment,what with him wanting

57
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,730
to stay at your house and all.

58
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,330
Oh, wait.

59
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,330
He's staying with us.My bad.

60
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,130
Point, Miss Wilson.

61
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,760
Okay, well,

62
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,260
can you let me know if you hear from him?

63
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,860
Hey. You okay?

64
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,660
Yeah, um...

65
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,000
it's just I have this friend Hank from rehab?

66
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,560
He hasn't returned any of my texts.

67
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,700
Nobody from group has even heard from him.

68
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,000
Could he be on vacation?

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,260
Maybe.

70
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,800
But when an addict just disappears like that...

71
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,100
Everybody, settle in, please.

72
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,160
Take your seats.Thank you very much.

73
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,900
Today we're gonna talk about perception.

74
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,360
I mean, how do we even perceive?

75
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,300
Well, the eyes take in information

76
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
and then it passes that information off to the brain.

77
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,230
Seems pretty straightforward,but you can

78
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,660
still see without using your eyes,

79
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,830
and that's called...

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,130
..."intuition."

81
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,560
Using your intuition.

82
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,500
I'm so sorry.

83
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,030
I wish I had better news.

84
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,260
And there's nothing that I can do?

85
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,300
Some surgery or drug therapy?

86
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,800
Not in this case.

87
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,100
Is there somebody I can call for you? A husband?

88
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,800
A boyfriend?

89
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,430
No, there's no guy in the picture at the moment.

90
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,430
You said you used to live here before.

91
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,930
Are there some friends you could talk to about this?

92
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,200
I've burned all of those bridges.

93
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,030
Hey, D.

94
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,300
Hey, girl. What's up?

95
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,900
Got this week's new pick.

96
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,060
It's a rough mix

97
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,230
of a new band my dad just signed,

98
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,660
Drops In The Fall.Excellent.

99
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,100
Oh, yeah, and thank you for the Sam Cooke stuff.

100
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,800
I knew about his R&B stuff, but I didn't know he did gospel.

101
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,460
Really? That's how he got started.

102
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,060
It blew me away.

103
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,330
Hey, babe.Hey, Silver.

104
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,460
How was your winter break?

105
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,960
Oh, you know,the usual:

106
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,100
eggnog, sugar crash,remorse, New Year's.

107
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,500
Well, tell me what you think.

108
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Yes.

109
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
Bye, D.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
Peace.

111
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,800
Bye, D.

112
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,060
Why you gotta act like that?

113
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,230
Have we met?

114
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,600
And besides, I think she's into you.

115
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,560
Which doesn't make me want to hug her.

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,930
Except for maybe around the neck.

117
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,200
You're crazy.

118
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,660
Yeah, well,it works for me.

119
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,360
But anyway, Bio awaits.Later, D.

120
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,030
Hi, Annie.

121
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,400
Hey.

122
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,230
Hey, I just came to see my dad.

123
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,530
Yeah, we're goin' surfing.

124
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,430
I know. He wanted to take the van.

125
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,260
So, how's school?

126
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,030
You know, reading, writing,all that fun stuff.

127
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,300
Arithmetic.

128
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,530
Yup.

129
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,830
That's pretty much how I remember it.

130
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,060
Surf's up!

131
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
You're going surfing.

132
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,030
Yeah, Sean invited me.

133
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,900
Oh, you don't surf, do you?

134
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,230
Harry's an amazing teacher.

135
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,360
You should come, Annie.

136
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
You should come.

137
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,730
I mean, you don'thave to be

138
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,230
naturally graceful to surf.

139
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,930
You know, I'm gonna pass.

140
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,500
But, uh, tell

141
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,030
my dad I had to run.

142
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,430
I'll see you guys later.

143
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,460
Boo.

144
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,560
Hey, Miss Taylor, um,do you have a minute?

145
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Sure, yeah. Come on in.

146
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Sit down.

147
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,630
How are you?

148
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,530
I'm... I'm okay, I guess.

149
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,430
I was wondering if you had a way

150
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,030
to get in touch with Miss Walsh.

151
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,460
Uh, Brenda?

152
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,060
Yeah. Um,

153
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,600
my rehab group is hosting this support day tomorrow

154
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,730
to thank all the people who have helped

155
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,200
with our recovery.

156
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
Most people would bring their families,

157
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,130
but I was gonna bring Navid,

158
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,600
but he's at his cousin Avi's wedding.

159
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
I see.

160
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,860
Your mom can't make it.

161
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,030
Well, she could.

162
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,600
I just kinda don't want her

163
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
She pretty much

164
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,330
checked out on that whole stand-by-your-kid thing.

165
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,060
Does that make me a jerk?

166
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,800
No, it makes you somebody who's looking out for herself.

167
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,330
But I'm sorry

168
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,000
your mom's not there for you.

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
It's okay.Miss Walsh was,

170
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
and, uh, I'd really like her to come.

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,430
Uh, you know what?

172
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,030
Brenda is usually pretty busy

173
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,660
with her work.

174
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,560
Sure.

175
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Okay.

176
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,200
But you know what?

177
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,430
I will talk to her.

178
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,430
Thank you

179
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,060
so much, Miss Taylor.

180
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,900
It really means a lot to me.

181
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,800
Chastity belt!Giraffe!

182
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
A promise ring.

183
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,360
Uh, Cheerios.

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,460
A tusk!An elephant!

185
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,530
What? How did you get that?

186
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,930
That looks like a sock.

187
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,960
That was the trunk.

188
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,200
Let's go. Next, next!

189
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,700
Time's running.

190
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,500
It's a weapon.Somebody's hunting!

191
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,600
Hunting.Archery.

192
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,830
Yes!

193
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,160
What?!

194
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,000
That drawing looked like a sock, too.

195
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
An argyle sock.

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,060
Go, go, go!

197
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,530
Yeah, I know, a sock.

198
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,900
That is a small...Oh! Time is up.Thank God!

199
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Good!

200
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,130
How'd we do?

201
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,400
Nine points, b-b-baby!

202
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,300
* Wilson men kicking ass and taking names. *

203
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,000
Why don't you let a real artiste

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,860
show you how it's done?

205
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,860
Ready, girls?

206
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,400
Ready.

207
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,530
Come on, Grandma. Come on.

208
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,860
Hmm...It's a sock.

209
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,800
Tabitha, could you pick up the pace?

210
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,200
Um, she's crosshatching.

211
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,060
Tabitha!

212
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Here, let me try again.

213
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,400
Tabula rasa.

214
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,360
Shoot me now.

215
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,830
Oh, excuse me.

216
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,430
Hello.

217
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,700
A skull?

218
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,830
Death?

219
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,760
Murder?

220
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,600
No, though, come to think of it,

221
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,500
It does resemble a bit of a Vanitas still life.

222
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,700
Come on,Ladies, time is running out.

223
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,630
Says who?

224
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,730
Oh, boo!

225
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,460
- Come on!  - All right, all right.

226
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,860
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

227
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,500
Mm, thank you, Mom. Excellent job.

228
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,830
You gotta back off.

229
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,660
I told you I'll get the money and I will.

230
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,230
All right, I just need a little more time.

231
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,900
And-And I promise...

232
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
Hello?

233
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,560
Damn!

234
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Sean, what's going on?

235
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,600
It's nothing, really.

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
What I heard wasn't nothing.

237
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,800
It was definitely something.

238
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,300
Sean, we're family here.

239
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,660
You can talk to us.

240
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,660
Okay.

241
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,900
My father, adopted father,he

242
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,900
He was a gambler.

243
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,200
He made some money at it.

244
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,030
But then he got in way over his head.

245
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,800
He couldn't come up with what he owed.

246
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
So, he killed himself.

247
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,030
Oh, my God.

248
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,300
He did it to protect me.

249
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,330
You know, he thought his life insurance

250
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,360
could clear his debt,

251
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,160
but sure enough

252
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,400
It turns out his policy doesn't cover suicide.

253
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,860
So now these guys,

254
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,530
the guys that were after him for the money...

255
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,800
Now they're after you.

256
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,100
Let us help.

257
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,630
How much did you father owe?

258
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,860
$200,000.

259
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,448
Look, I didn't want to worry you with this.

260
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:40,718
I'm shipping out in a week.

261
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:42,075
What are they gonna do, come to Iraq and find me?

262
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:42,997
They don't have the guts.

263
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,400
So, who's turn is it to draw, huh?

264
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,260
Annie,

265
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,784
Got a minute?

266
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,328
- Yeah.- I wanted to apologize.

267
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,272
I hope that phone call didn't upset you.

268
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:11,558
No, no, and-and I don't want you

269
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:12,927
to think I was eaves dropping on purpose.

270
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,080
- I was just there. - Of course.

271
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,618
No, I know. I'd hate to think

272
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,253
that I, uh, you know,caused you any worry.

273
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:17,890
Oh, it's okay.

274
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,219
I-I just thought my dad would want to know,

275
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,335
So I felt like I had to say something.

276
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,700
Yeah, yeah.

277
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,000
It's nice to have people around who care.

278
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,760
Here.

279
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,840
Thanks.

280
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,405
You could take that if you want.

281
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:35,743
No, no, it's late.

282
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:38,760
It'll go to voicemail. No worries.

283
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,230
So, good night.

284
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:48,700
Yeah. Uh, yeah. Good night.

285
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,753
Mother, I doubt that will help.

286
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,188
Believe me, dear,when the topic

287
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:03,499
of discussion is money, drinking always helps.

288
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:06,483
What is the economic situation here?

289
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,699
- What are the options?  - I do so wish I could help.

290
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:10,764
But I've taken such a beating in the market recently,

291
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:11,773
I simply can't.

292
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:15,779
In fact, I think it's time for me to go back to work.

293
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:16,868
Really?

294
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:18,469
Well, money's only part of it.

295
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,236
The truth is I miss acting.

296
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:23,460
Digging into the script,

297
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,630
arguing with the director,

298
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,630
canoodling with my co-stars.

299
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,130
It's a calling.

300
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,800
And then there were two.

301
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
You know, our retirement account is in pretty good shape.

302
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,960
Because we've left it alone.

303
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,500
I know, just hear me out.

304
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,600
We're not paying rent here, right?

305
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,900
The house in Wichita will sell eventually.

306
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,960
Maybe we borrow against our 401(k).

307
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,560
O-Or the kids' college funds.

308
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,360
Harry...

309
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,030
We can't do nothing.

310
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,360
I-I know you're worried.

311
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,830
I think, um...Tracy should

312
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,830
Be included in this discussion.

313
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,030
You would be okay with that?

314
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,330
Well, she's Sean's mother.

315
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,160
If I were in her place, I would want to know.

316
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,960
All right. I'm going to, I'm going 
to give her a call.

317
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,200
Thank you.

318
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,760
Dad's pretty freaked out.

319
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,630
Can you blame him?

320
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,730
Dix, do you... Um...

321
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,530
What do you think about Sean?

322
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,200
What do you mean, what do I think about him?

323
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
Don't you like him?

324
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,860
Well, I've never really felt

325
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,460
completely comfortable around him, 
you know?

326
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,330
I-I was walking by his room before and...

327
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,230
You know, it's probably nothing.

328
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,360
What?

329
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,730
He got a local call.

330
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,100
No!

331
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,360
All right, but he got a local call.

332
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,500
So?

333
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,130
So, who'd be calling him?

334
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,130
He said he didn't know anybody in town.

335
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,700
I don't know.

336
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,900
It could've been Tracy. Naomi or...

337
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
a wrong number, you know?

338
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,530
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

339
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,460
Look, when Sean first came here,

340
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,630
you know, I freaked out.

341
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,060
And it hurt Dad, a lot.

342
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,560
Don't put everybody through the 
same thing again.

343
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,700
All right?

344
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Yeah.

345
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,700
Good night.

346
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,530
Night.

347
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,860
Kelly.

348
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,460
Here on my doorstep.

349
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,330
I wouldn't be if you'd returned my calls today.

350
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,400
Sorry, I just couldn't deal with

351
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,300
any of the Ryan drama today.

352
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,800
Probably should have thought of

353
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,300
that before you slept with him.

354
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,330
That's not why I'm here. Can I come in?

355
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,660
Adrianna asked me to get in touch with you.

356
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,060
Her rehab group is having support day.

357
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,530
She wants you there.

358
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,930
Why me?

359
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,830
Because you stood up for her,

360
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,130
more than her own mom.

361
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,460
She sees you as a mother figure.

362
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,600
I didn't ask for that.

363
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,100
But whether you asked for it or not,

364
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,300
that's the way it is.

365
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,960
I can't make it.

366
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,360
Why, because it's me asking?

367
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,460
It's got nothing to do with you.

368
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,900
Then what is it?

369
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,700
This girl is in the early stages of recovery.

370
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,960
She needs you.

371
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,300
If you were reaching out for help,

372
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,700
wouldn't you want people standing by you?

373
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,030
I think you should leave.

374
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,720
You know, Brenda, I knew you were selfish.

375
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,420
But this?

376
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,730
This is unforgiveable.

377
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,100
If you're gonna ditch school,

378
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,560
go to the beach, not to work.

379
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,500
Nat needed help with the breakfast shift,

380
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,000
so, I came through.

381
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,630
Uh, you need a table?

382
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,500
Nope, just coffee and a bagel.

383
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,900
Did you give that CD a listen?

384
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,900
Actually, yeah, you know,it reminded me of Prince.

385
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,460
It kind of did.

386
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,200
Maybe with a little middle-period Curtis.

387
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,460
Curtis...?

388
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,230
You're kidding.

389
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,560
Curtis Mayfield?

390
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,130
Only, like, the greatest songwriter of the '60s.

391
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,900
What are you doing tomorrow?

392
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,500
Nothing, why?

393
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,960
My dad has this thing at our beach house once a month--

394
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,860
it's a gospel choir barbeque,

395
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,160
a lot of people from his label,

396
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,730
but the food is really good

397
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,830
and the music is dope.You should come.

398
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,500
I mean, unless Silver would have an issue with that.

399
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,830
Oh, um, no, nah, not at all.

400
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,660
Not at all, you just count me in.

401
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,500
Here you go.

402
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,630
I'll text you the details later.

403
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,500
Keep the change.

404
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,660
Thank you.

405
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,430
We did mother and son Watsu.

406
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,360
I thought we were close.

407
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
It's not you.

408
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,530
He didn't want anybody to know.

409
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,160
This whole thing just makes me sick to my stomach.

410
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,600
If I hadn't given him up...

411
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,400
if he hadn't been adopted by this terrible man!

412
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,930
Tracy, we cannot beat ourselves up about it.

413
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,430
What is past is past.

414
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,060
But he needs our help.

415
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,560
Yeah.

416
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,760
And the fact of the matter is

417
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,930
that I have means that you two don't.

418
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,600
Thank you, Tracy.

419
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,060
That's very generous.

420
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,900
I mean, it's not going to be as easy with the divorce

421
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,360
as it would've been otherwise.

422
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,400
I mean, there was the pre-nup, so...

423
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,700
Anything you could do would be great.

424
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,630
I think I'm going to call my business manager.

425
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,930
Maybe I will sell some of Charles' art.

426
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,560
There is a Damien Hirst

427
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,260
that I couldn't wait to get out of my bathroom.

428
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,930
I'll be in touch.

429
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,060
We'll get through this.

430
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,600
Thank you for not

431
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,730
stabbing her to death with a pencil.

432
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,200
If you had scissors on your desk,

433
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,430
it'd be a different story.

434
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,660
But honestly, in this case I think 
she's kind of entitled.

435
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,300
Let's see what she comes up with.

436
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,630
Hey, want to go get some lunch?

437
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,800
Yes, but first, I'm just finishing up a post

438
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,760
on that creepy custodian guy.

439
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
You know, the one with the lazy eye?

440
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,860
I'm fairly certain he was

441
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,230
checking out my ass this morning. 
Then again,

442
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,760
maybe he was just tired.

443
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,460
Ooh, want to see something good?

444
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,730
Check out my cheerleader post.

445
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,360
Hmm, "Shake, Shimmy and Shut Up."

446
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,860
Nice headline. Thank you.

447
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,660
But the only one you mention 
here by name is Christina.

448
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,930
My blog is called The Vicious Circle.

449
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,700
And you know my motto:

450
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,200
Show no mercy.

451
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,000
So, what's your deal for tomorrow afternoon?

452
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,660
There's a Tarantino festival at the Arclight.

453
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,960
I...I know, I know it's pretentious

454
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,900
and violent and derivative but 
totally awesome.

455
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,100
If you just give Death Proof

456
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,260
one chance, I swear you're going to love it.

457
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,000
I-I, um... I got a...

458
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,730
I got to do a family thing.

459
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,500
No, Annie told me how crazy things 
are with Sean.

461
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,200
It's cool. Yeah.

462
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,660
Um, food. Starved. Let's go.

463
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,130
Brenda really wanted to be here.

464
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,200
Of course, um, I understand.

465
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,530
But I'm proud of you.

466
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,030
What you've accomplished, you're 
amazing.

467
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,160
Thank you.

468
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,700
Yes, she is. Hi.

469
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,660
Oh, you made it. Awesome. Yeah.

470
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,860
I'm sorry I'm late.

471
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,160
Traffic's a bitch.

472
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,100
I'm so happy you could come.

473
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,360
There's so many people I want to 
introduce you to.

474
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,060
I'm really hoping that my

475
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,630
Hello, everyone!

476
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,360
If everybody could come inside, 
we're gonna get started.

477
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,560
Let's go.

478
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,660
I wake up in the middle of the night

479
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,000
drenched in sweat, hating myself.

480
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,130
But when I realize it's just a 
nightmare,

481
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,730
I'm so relieved.

482
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,900
Relieved that I'm okay,

483
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,100
relieved that I'm clean,

484
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,700
and grateful.

485
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,300
Grateful for all the people 
who have been there for me.

486
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,100
People who believed in me,

487
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,830
even when I didn't believe in myself.

488
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,000
So, I think I'm gonna be okay.

489
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,100
Would anybody from Adrianna's support 
team like to share?

490
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,960
I haven't really known Adrianna that long,

491
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,260
but ever since I met her,

492
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,560
I've admired her

493
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,960
She's passionate. She's smart.

494
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,160
And most importantly, she actually learns 
from her mistakes, which is

495
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,160
more than I can say for myself.

496
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,460
She's my friend.

497
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,230
And that's not a word that I use lightly.

498
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,460
And I'll always have her back.

499
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,660
Hands off the fries.

500
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,160
How'd you do that?

501
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,660
Eyes in the back of my head.

502
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,330
I should use you for this psych paper.

503
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,960
Intuition and extrasensory French fry perception.

504
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,000
Your mother let you out of the house in that outfit?

505
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,460
Oh, my God, Annie. You have to see these pictures.

506
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,560
-No, thanks. -Show me.

507
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,960
Well, they're just pictures of Sean and I.

508
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,360
I'm going to put them on Facebook later.

509
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,760
Ooh, he's hot.

510
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,660
Oh, my God. This is us at the beach

511
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,760
right before going surfing.

512
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,860
Oh, and this is us goofing off in the car.

513
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,800
You can still see without using your eyes.

514
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,200
Sean, what's going on?

515
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,360
You could take that if you want.

516
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,060
It'll go to voicemail. No worries.

517
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,960
He got a local call. So?

518
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,400
And that's called using your intuition.

519
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,560
There's something I gotta do

520
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
What?

521
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Nothing, but I gotta go.

522
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,130
Oh, my God.

523
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,300
Can I just tell you, he is so adorable.

524
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,700
Tell me I'm crazy.

525
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,900
You're crazy.

526
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,360
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I'm crazy.

527
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,230
I mean, I'm probably crazy.

528
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,500
At least I hope that I'm crazy,

529
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,400
because everybody loves him--

530
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,500
Naomi obviously.

531
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,400
Maybe she's right.

532
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,200
Maybe I'm just jealous.

533
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,260
Annie, whoa, take a breath.

534
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,460
What are you talking about?

535
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Mom, there's something off about Sean.

536
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,860
And I don't have any proof,

537
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,060
and I know that and I really don't want to hurt Dad,

538
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,960
but I have this hunch that something is not right.

539
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,760
I know.

540
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,060
I have the same feeling.

541
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
You do?

542
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,300
I thought it was just me that maybe I couldn't handle the fact

543
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,230
that your dad and Tracy have a child together,

544
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,000
But that's not it.

545
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,400
Something doesn't add up.

546
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,730
It would break Dad's heart if he knew how we felt.

547
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,130
I know, but it would be worse if we were right and we didn't act on it.

548
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,530
So, what do we do?

549
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,830
Nice speech.

550
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,200
Yeah.

551
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,400
Uh, listen, you and me, we have such crazy history.

552
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,700
Don't worry, I know you came for Adrianna, not me.

553
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,700
No, what I mean is...

554
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,800
that history connects us.

555
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,360
You know me better than anyone else.

556
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,430
I need that.

557
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,960
Really?

558
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,900
Yeah.

559
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,630
I'm going through some crazy stuff right now.

560
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,260
Hey, guys, I wanted to introduce you

561
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,400
to my sponsor, Amy.

562
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,100
Hey, I'm Brenda.

563
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,300
Kelly. Nice to meet you.

564
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Glad you guys could both make it.

565
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,960
I actually want to introduce them to Hank.

566
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,100
Have you seen him anywhere?

567
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,400
Oh, Ade, I thought you'd heard.

568
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,130
Heard what?

569
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,360
He found out he's HIV positive.

570
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,730
He started using again.

571
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,060
I'm really sorry.

572
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,700
Excuse me.

573
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,760
I can't believe he relapsed.

574
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,930
Who is Hank?

575
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:03,930
Is that your boyfriend?

576
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,000
No, he's...

577
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,330
he's not my boyfriend.

578
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,560
We slept together a couple of times.

579
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,600
Have you been tested?

580
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,660
No.

581
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,900
I'm fine.

582
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,230
You need to get tested.

583
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,330
We'll both go with you, right?

584
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,900
Right.


585
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,030
* Well, they've warned you and they told you *

586
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,400
* Just leave it to the Lord *

587
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,230
* Have courage, don't worry *

588
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,100
* Just leave it to the Lord *

589
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,460
* He never sleeps£¬sees everything... *

590
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,830
I'm glad you made it. Me, too.

591
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,460
This is amazing.

592
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,260
Um, was that Kobe inside?

593
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,700
Yeah, if he's in town, he never misses 
Daddy's barbecues.

594
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,830
I got to be honest,

595
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,700
I really didn't know that there was 
this many black people in Beverly Hills.

596
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,960
Well, you just have to know where to look.

597
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,800
I guess you're right.

598
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,660
Let me guess...you're Dixon.

599
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,930
Yes, sir.

600
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,800
I'm Franklin Whitney, Stina's father.

601
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,960
I've heard a lot about you,

602
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,030
young man. Oh.

603
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,830
Well, uh, nice to meet you, sir.

604
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,130
Stina tells me you're into music.

605
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,700
Yes. She's, uh, put me on to 
a lot of great stuff.

606
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,830
You play an instrument?

607
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,000
-No, but I-I love to sing.  -You any good?

608
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,160
I... uh, you know, I haven't had 
any complaints,

609
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,460
but then again, I mostly sing in the shower.

610
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,960
Well, don't wait to be discovered.

611
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
If singing's what you love, you make 
it happen.

612
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,330
Yeah.

613
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,460
Stina, baby, Dre's leaving, and he wanted

614
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,500
to say good-bye.

615
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,700
Dr. Dre?

616
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
PhD.

617
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,230
Listen, don't be a stranger, Dixon.

618
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,330
Hope we'll see a lot more of you, 
all right?

619
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,230
Yes, sir.

620
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,560
I'll be right back.

621
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
All right.


623
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,860
-Okay... -Deb.

624
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,930
Can we talk?

625
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,700
Yeah, I think we should.

626
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,830
Give me a minute.

627
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,430
Look, I've been doing some research,

628
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,645
and I think I found a way

629
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:04,860
we can take a second mortgage

630
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,110
out on the house.

631
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,360
Harry, I went to see the private 
investigator

632
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
that found Sean.

633
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,700
Okay.

634
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,200
I'm sorry I went behind your back,

635
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,530
but we're in a pretty unusual situation here,

636
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,260
and I wanted to get some answers.

637
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,600
Did the P.I. have any answers?

638
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,760
No...

639
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,260
but, honey, doesn't it strike you

640
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,830
as odd that Sean shows up

641
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,730
out of nowhere and asks us for money?

642
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,215
No, Tracy found him,

643
00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:26,700
and he didn't ask us for money.

644
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,000
We offered.

645
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,300
Annie doesn't trust him.

646
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,860
Look, that's...

647
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,530
that's not about Sean.

648
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,300
That is about Naomi.

649
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,060
It's about Annie being a teenager,

650
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
and it is about jealousy.

651
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,400
We went through this with Dixon.

652
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,200
-Harry... -Look, sweetheart,

653
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,965
I know that this has been

654
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:44,730
a big adjustment for everybody,

655
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,900
but Sean is my son and I owe him.

656
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,530
Look, I know how you feel-- I do--

657
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,360
but I won't let you pay down your guilt

658
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,800
at the expense of Annie and Dixon.

659
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,660
Sean's as much my child as Annie or Dixon.

660
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,600
He's not my child.

661
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,030
Okay.

662
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,400
So, what does that mean?

663
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,130
You saying that you don't care about Sean?

664
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,260
I don't feel the same way about him that you do,

665
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
and I think that you're letting your guilt

666
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,260
-cloud your judgment. -My guilt?

667
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,360
Yes, something's not right here, Harry.

668
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,100
Sean.

669
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,900
What happened? You okay?

670
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,100
The guys my dad owed...

671
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,300
they found me.

672
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,630
I'm calling the cops.

673
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,730
No, no, please.

674
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,630
Look, these aren't the kind of guys

675
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,460
who let people call the cops and get away with it.

676
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,630
This isn't y'all's problem.

677
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,100
I'm so sorry.

678
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,660
I'll be gone in the morning.

679
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,660
-No, Sean... -It's the only way.

680
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,060
We will get the money somehow.

681
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,760
Don't worry.

682
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,330
Al Elmore Investigations.

683
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,760
Hello?

684
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,760
Why do they always

685
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,160
have the ugliest art in waiting rooms?

686
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,430
Right, and they're all the same.

687
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,460
They must have a catalog.

688
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,960
I am such an idiot.

689
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,230
There was so much I wanted

690
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,130
to do with my life now that I'm clean.

691
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,460
Hey, listen to me.

692
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,730
We don't know anything yet.

693
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,660
Adrianna Tate Duncan?

694
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,460
Yes.

695
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,360
Your HIV test is negative.

696
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,860
Oh, my God!

697
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,130
Oh, my God, that is the best news ever.

698
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,560
Thank you so much.

699
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,630
Oh, my God.

700
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,530
But there's something else.

701
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,830
What?

702
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,130
When we ran your blood work,

703
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,570
It turns out you're pregnant

704
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,930
No.

705
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,630
You should see your gynecologist

706
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,760
to discuss your options.

707
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,660
I can't be pregnant.

708
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,100
I'm only 16.

709
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,260
Okay, look, I know you're freaking out right now,

710
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,660
but let's just take this

711
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
one step at a time, right, Brenda?

712
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,130
I have to go. I'm sorry.

713
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,330
Brenda.

714
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,460
I can't tell my mom.

715
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,860
My mom's gonna kill me.

716
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,900
I will help you talk to her, sweetie.

717
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,460
I don't even know where Hank is.

718
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,600
We will find him.

719
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,630
He might not even be the father.

720
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,330
I slept with a lot of guys when I was using.

721
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,100
What's Navid gonna think?

722
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,700
He's gonna hate me.

723
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,130
No.

724
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,700
He's gonna totally hate me.

725
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,130
This can't be happening.

726
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,560
This... no, this isn't happening. Shh.

727
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,930
Come here, come here.

728
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,030
It's gonna be okay.

729
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,630
I can't take it.

730
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,460
All right, Tracy, let's meet here in the morning

731
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,130
and figure out how much we can pull together.

732
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,830
-Yeah. -Dad...

733
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,360
-look, please listen to me. -Annie,

734
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,700
I don't have time for this right now.

735
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,730
Mom, look.

736
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,500
The last five calls that Sean received

737
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,830
was from Al Elmore, the P.I.

738
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,430
Why would they be in touch? Wait.

739
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,560
What are you doing,going through his things?

740
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,860
First, you go to a P.I.,

741
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,600
then you invade a man's privacy.

742
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,830
Annie, what's going on with you?

743
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,330
I'm scared, Dad.

744
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,930
I know how much Sean means to you,

745
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,260
and I'm really scared that you're

746
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,730
never gonna forgive me for this,

747
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,530
but I'm more scared that something is not right.

748
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,700
And you agree with her.

749
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,730
We don't think Sean is who he says he is.

750
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,000
Give us the same benefit

751
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,630
of the doubt that you're giving him.

752
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,060
What do you want me to do?

753
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,330
Ask him to take a paternity test.

754
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,630
Please?

755
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,900
Sean is my son.

756
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,030
I know it.

757
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,930
I can feel it in my guts,

758
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,830
in my bones, but if that's

759
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,700
what you need me to do... I'll do it.

760
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,800
You shock me.

761
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,760
* Ooh-ooh-ooh *

762
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,600
* And we'll rejoice *

763
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,100
* And we'll rejoice singing *

764
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,260
* Every day *


766
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,260
Here you go.

767
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,200
Thank you.

768
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,500
So, Daddy really liked you.

769
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,200
You should come to dinner next week.

770
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,430
look, Christina, you're amazing,

771
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,430
and I'm very grateful that you invited me here

772
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,730
and introduced me to...

773
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,700
this whole world...

774
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,260
but... but...

775
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,100
the thing is, I have a girlfriend.

776
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,200
I know.

777
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,300
So do I.

778
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,800
Wait, what?

779
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,000
Tiffany.

780
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,430
That cute soprano.

781
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,130
Did you think

782
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,760
-I was making a move on you? -No.

783
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,400
No.

784
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,660
I'm just surprised that...

785
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,900
I've had boyfriends, too,

786
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,130
but I'm not interested in you in that way.

787
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,730
I just invited you here

788
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,680
'cause I thought you'd like this.

789
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,630
No, no, no, I...

790
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,900
I do, I...

791
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,800
this is... this is amazing.

792
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,300
Well, you're welcome anytime.

793
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,460
Silver, too.

794
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,060
If it wouldn't ruin her street cred

795
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,200
to hang out with a cheerleader.

796
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,300
No, not at all.

797
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,460
* Oh, oh, happy, happy day *

798
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,700
* Oh, happy day *

799
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,130
* Happy day *

800
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,560
* Yeah, yeah Oh, happy day *

801
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,830
* Oh, happy day. *

802
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,000
What the hell is wrong with you?

803
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,015
How could you leave Adrianna

804
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,030
at the clinic like that?

805
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,060
I mean, that's pretty low,

806
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,130
Brenda, even for you.

807
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,000
Kel, I... I can't have kids.

808
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,030
What?

809
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,760
I had fibroids removed a while ago,

810
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,600
and there were complications,

811
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,730
and kids are not an option for me.

812
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,160
I'm sorry.

813
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,400
You know, when I first heard, I thought,

814
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,960
it's not...

815
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,230
the end of the world...

816
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,430
but, then, somehow,

817
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,360
when I heard that Adrianna,

818
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,760
who wasn't even trying

819
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,360
and doesn't even want it,

820
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,600
is pregnant...

821
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm pathetic.

822
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,730
I'm jealous of a 16-year-old girl.

823
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,060
You're not pathetic.

824
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:21,133
- you wanted kids.  - I didn't.

825
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:24,501
I mean, I, I figured that I would in the future, but...

826
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:26,151
man, I hate it when people tell me I can't do something.

827
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:27,801
I can't do something.

828
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:29,501
That's the Brenda I know and love.

829
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:32,400
You know, I didn't think I could have kids either,

830
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,200
but medicine is changing all the time.

831
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,534
I'm kind of ready now,

832
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:41,501
so...I'm thinking of adopting.

833
00:32:42,534 --> 00:32:47,100
Bren... wow.I think that's a great idea.

834
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,634
And I would really like you in my life for that.

835
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:53,300
I'm not going anywhere.

836
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:03,734
Hey... you made it.

837
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:04,934
Cool party, huh?

838
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:08,534
You want me to introduce you to Denzel?

839
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:11,367
Why would you lie to me about this?

840
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:12,634
Are you into Christina?

841
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:15,167
No... Look, I apologize.

842
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,701
I shouldn't have lied to you,

843
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:19,100
and I'm not into Christina

844
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,701
and she's not into me.

845
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:22,868
Trust me.

846
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:26,067
But I didn't know how to talk to you about all of this.

847
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:28,801
All what?

848
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:30,767
This.

849
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:32,334
I'm a black kid in a white family,

850
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:33,767
so there's this whole other culture

851
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:34,767
I have never experienced.

852
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,801
Then Christina came along

853
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:40,501
and she's exposed me to some really amazing things,

854
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:43,300
but... I know you hate her.

855
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,467
Okay... well, "hate" is a very strong word.

856
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:50,634
"Loathe" and "detest,"yeah, maybe.

857
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,234
Look... you're the girl I want to be with.

858
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,734
All right?

859
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:01,834
If you want me to end my friendship with Christina...

860
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:05,133
No. No.

861
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,667
I guess the fact

862
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,734
that she can do something for you that I can't,

863
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:11,200
well, it makes me kind of jealous.

864
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,467
And that's so not me and totally lame.

865
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:16,934
No, no,actually,I find it flattering.

866
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:22,000
- Okay.You just have to do one thing for me. - All right,

867
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,167
all right, I promise I won't lie to you again.

868
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:28,033
No.Introduce me to Denzel.

869
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,434
All right, yeah,he's right over there.

870
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:34,701
Sean.How's the eye?

871
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:35,834
Ah, it's okay.

872
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:37,934
I come from hardy stock.

873
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:39,968
We're going to get that money together.

874
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:43,200
Thank you, Harry, that's...that's beyond generous.

875
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,834
I'll pay you back,I swear to you.

876
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,234
Just one catch.

877
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:50,834
I need you to take a paternity test first.

878
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,667
I'm sorry.

879
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,801
Believe me, I know what the results are going to be.

880
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,567
Harry, please,that's a lot of money.

881
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,968
I'd ask the same thing if I was in your shoes.

882
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:02,167
Of course I'll do it.

883
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,968
I knew you would.

884
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:06,367
You know what?

885
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,534
I am not going to let anything happen to you.

886
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,667
Everybody

887
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:14,968
can I have your attention for a minute?

888
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:18,100
I'm so glad you're all here.

889
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,467
I'm reminded on these days

890
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,534
of the many things I have to be thankful for--

891
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:22,767
my family,

892
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:24,701
good friends,

893
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:28,400
beautiful,beautiful music.

894
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,734
So please...

895
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:32,334
join me and reflect on all the things you have to be

896
00:35:32,334 --> 00:35:34,234
thankful for in your own lives.

897
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:35,267
Hear, hear.

898
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:42,167
You know "Amazing Grace"?

899
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:44,000
Yeah. Why?

900
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,501
Consider yourself discovered.

901
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:02,167
* Amazing grace *

902
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:05,701
* How sweet the sound *

903
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,767
* That saved *

904
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:11,934
* A wretch like me... *

905
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:16,267
* I once was lost *

906
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:19,267
* But now I'm found *

907
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:21,434
* Oh, was blind *

908
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:26,367
* But now I see. *

909
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:37,033
So... I'm taking a paternity test in the morning.

910
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:41,067
I was surprised Harry needed that kind of proof,

911
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:43,901
but I guess not everyone trusts me.

912
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:47,584
I thought you, Annie, out of all people, would understand.

913
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:49,234
would understand.

914
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:51,634
Understand what?

915
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:55,200
You moved from Kansas to this perfect life in Beverly Hills.

916
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,267
You just had it handed to you.

917
00:36:58,267 --> 00:36:59,968
Not everybody gets that chance.

918
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,667
Not everyone gets to take what isn't theirs, either.

919
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,367
what isn't theirs, either.

920
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,701
Good night, Annie.

921
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:29,000
Sean.

922
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,000
Sean, you...

923
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,999
Sean.

925
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,100
* But then you're lost beyond all doubt... *

926
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,566
* I don't know how to fix this *

927
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:55,900
* I never mean to hurt you *

928
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,200
* I know the dark side is no fun *

929
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,100
* Another mark is made ... *

930
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,533
* They're just done *

931
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:13,466
* And you're the only thing I'm trying not to break... *

932
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:18,933
* And now we're hearing pieces *

933
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,699
* I think *

934
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,133
* I should take *

935
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,167
* The blame... *

936
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,466
He cleared his stuff out

937
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:45,599
He's gone

938
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,633
What do you mean he's gone?

939
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:48,966
He can't be gone.

940
00:38:48,966 --> 00:38:50,533
He's gone.

941
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:51,699
He wasn't our son.

942
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:52,966
No, I would know my own son.

943
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:54,599
I would know

944
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,966
if he was my son!

945
00:38:55,966 --> 00:39:00,066
Tracy... he wasn't our son.

946
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:02,766
I'm so sorry, Tracy.

947
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:04,200
Is this some kind of sick joke?

948
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,800
No joke.

949
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,499
He scammed all of us.

950
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:08,900
He just wanted money.

951
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,933
Okay, but if he is not our son, then who was he?

952
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,133
I don't know.

953
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,200
I called the P.I. this morning.

954
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,599
His phone had been disconnected.

955
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,299
They were probably working together.

956
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:19,366
Oh, my God.

957
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:22,800
Mom. Mom.

958
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,399
No, I'm not,I'm not doing this.

959
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:25,733
I'm not.

960
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,233
Look, you were right about Sean.

961
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:30,332
I have no idea how I'll make this up to you.

962
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:31,633
It's okay.

963
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:38,167
Hey, Dixon, you want to help me make breakfast?

964
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,033
- Yeah, sure, whatever.  - Come on.

965
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:42,633
Girls, if you need us,we'll be in the kitchen.

966
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,500
Let's make some pancakes.

967
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,900
Pancakes, my favorite.

968
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,933
you okay?

969
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,100
Are you insane?

970
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,399
I know.

971
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:02,000
I know, it's such a shock.

972
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,332
I'm still trying

973
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:04,933
to wrap my head around it

974
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:07,033
but, you know, maybe,

975
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:10,366
maybe we can take something good from this.

976
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,833
With everything that's going on right now, I mean,

977
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:17,167
maybe me and you can just finally call a truce.

978
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,283
How do you keep managing

979
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,399
to cause my family so much pain?

980
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,699
Me?

981
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:24,366
My mom had a son.

982
00:40:24,366 --> 00:40:26,332
I had a brother.

983
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:27,332
He was not

984
00:40:27,332 --> 00:40:28,800
our brother.

985
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,300
I mean, at least he leftbefore both our families

986
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,800
leftbefore both our families

987
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,033
were taken in by his scam.

988
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:35,366
Your family.

989
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:38,267
Sean came to our house last night

990
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:39,766
and Mom gave him the money.

991
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,733
Wait, what?

992
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,366
I thought she didn't have it.

993
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:47,366
She didn't have it, Annie.

994
00:40:47,366 --> 00:40:48,599
She called Dad

995
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,666
and gave up some of her demands

996
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:54,666
in the divorce so he would give her the money,

997
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:57,233
and she gave it to Sean.

998
00:40:58,267 --> 00:41:01,299
I... I am so sorry.

999
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,033
I did not know.

1000
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:07,066
Get away from me.

1001
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,866
This is your fault.

1002
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:15,533
* And the walls are caving in *

1003
00:41:16,566 --> 00:41:18,599
* Behind me *

1004
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,267
* Air is getting thin... *

1005
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:21,966
Hey, Dad.

1006
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:23,566
I am so sorry.

1007
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:27,900
No, no, I'm sorry.

1008
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,332
I guess I should have trusted you.

1009
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,533
Oh, Daddy.

1010
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,066
I never wanted you to feel like this.

1011
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:41,200
Oh... I know,sweetheart.

1012
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:47,200
* And I miss you more than I should *

1013
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
* But I thought I could *

1014
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,466
* Can't get my mind off of you. *

1015
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:54,000
I love you, Daddy.
