1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Previously on 90210

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,050
Your father called us yesterday.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:04,830
My stepdad.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,200
He requested your records.

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,520
He's looking at military schools.

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,700
I'm in a bit of a pinch financially.

7
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,150
I went through a lot of money very quickly.

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,070
I'm glad to help.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,490
I got,like,20 cases of beer

10
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,920
and topher's brother brought over

11
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,550
vodka,gin,whisky,bourbon.

12
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,340
thank you,phoebe abrams.

13
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,940
I am really stoked about the afterprom party

14
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,120
at phoebe abrams's house tonight.

15
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,540
I will be there with the beverly hills police department.

16
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,730
Who the hell told him?

17
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,460
I know who it was.

18
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,890
Why did you tell your dad about my party?

19
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,960
Is that what everyone thinks?

20
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,880
They don't think.

21
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,600
They know.

22
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,500
You're a rat.

23
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,410
The sophomore prom queen is erin silver.

24
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,730
I don't know exactly who I am.

25
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,350
But I do know who I am not.

26
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,450
Some weird zombie prom-loving loser.

27
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,210
Why did you get me this corsage?

28
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,630
You looked in my facebook page,didn't you?

29
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,540
You like me.

30
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,820
Dude,I'm so sick of looking at you.

31
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,500
Mvid!

32
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,610
Y water just broke.

33
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,280
I think I'm going into labor.

34
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,780
oh,I'm definitely getting some tonight.

35
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,820
So,anyway,his dad left when he was a kid.

36
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,620
It was just liam and his mom against the world.

37
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,800
She was a housekeeper for this billionaire

38
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,390
family out in long island.

39
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,390
Whatever.Long story short.

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,190
Last year,liam walked in on the billionaire screwing his mom.

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,210
Oh,how awful.

42
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,100
I know.Right?

43
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,670
Then she marries the guy.

44
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,400
Turns out he's a complete son of a bitch.

45
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,790
I mean,no wonder liam has trust issues.

46
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,830
Are you listening to me?

47
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,450
Absolutely.

48
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,170
Liam sounds great.

49
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,730
You had me at trust issues.

50
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,740
No,jen.

51
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,730
You don't get it.

52
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,580
Tonight,everything changed.

53
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,300
Everything.

54
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,520
Well,honey,that's great.

55
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Naomi!

56
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,980
Total emergency.

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,710
Not only has my party been ruined,

58
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,260
thanks to principal loser,

59
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,380
but now nobody's stepping up and they're.

60
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,000
uh,and that's a good thing since after proms are highly illegal

61
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,500
and will lead to suspension,

62
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,930
which will lead to missing finals,

63
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,340
which will lead to summer school.

64
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,160
Did you fall on your head?

65
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,940
What?

66
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,750
Jen's not a grown-up.

67
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,530
She's my sister.

68
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,780
Jen,phoebe.

69
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,520
Phoebe,jen.

70
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:10,880
Hey.

71
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,900
Um,jake manditsky said that he could have the party at his house,

72
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,210
but then his parents said at the last second

73
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,780
that they're not going to their beach house and now.

74
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,570
Well,there's no parents at my house.

75
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,290
I'll throw it.

76
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,360
I don't think so.

77
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,160
Sweetie,I'm sorry,but there's no way I'm going to

78
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,240
have a bunch of high school kids trashing my house,

79
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,240
spilling beer all over my furniture

80
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,610
and vomit wine coolers on my rugs.

81
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,650
It's actually my furniture and they're my rugs

82
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,370
since I'm paying for everything.

83
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,660
What's that supposed to mean?

84
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,080
In fact,since I'm the only one paying rent,

85
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,320
it's actually my house.

86
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,970
If I feel like throwing a party at my house,

87
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm going to throw a party at my house.

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,880
but you are more than welcome to come.

89
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,120
You don't want to do this,naomi.

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,030
So.let's do it!

91
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,090
Afterprom party at my house.

92
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,830
Spread the word.

93
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,350
Party at 174 west hollybrook.

94
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,350
Penelope!

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,430
Party at my house tonight.

96
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,870
Keep it on the D.L.

97
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,410
Benedict annie is right there.

98
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,590
Drop it,penelope.

99
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,520
Annie's not the one who told.

100
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,650
Don't worry about her or them.

101
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,590
I like that wrap,by the way.

102
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,170
You look really good tonight.

103
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,215
I mean,like a model-- a really,really
short model,like,a regular model

104
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,250
standing in the distance-- but you look
good.

105
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,410
Well,thank you,naomi.

106
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh,my god.

107
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,710
Everyone who's anyone is going to be at my party tonight.

108
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,420
oh,my god.

109
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,230
What?

110
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,170
Ade just went into labor.

111
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,540
Oh,my god.

112
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,210
Oh,I have to get to the hospital.

113
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,800
Yeah.

114
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,290
Please,you have to take care of my house.

115
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,480
You have to be the hostess.

116
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,860
Make sure that nobody vomits wine coolers on the rugs,okay?

117
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,140
Absolutely.Don't worry.

118
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,260
Thank you so much.

119
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,430
Okay,ggot toO.

120
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:58,640
Go.

121
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,370
Go,go,go.

122
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,970
Oh,is this it?

123
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,220
No,wait.

124
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,390
Ours had different rims than this one.

125
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,340
Man,is it just me,or do most limos look very similar?

126
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,350
We'll find it.

127
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,210
Eventually.

128
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,780
Yo,congratulations,prom king.

129
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,000
Thanks.

130
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,900
Dixon,why do you have to be like that?

131
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,520
You can be enjoying the fact that you won.

132
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,120
Whatever.

133
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,460
What does that mean?

134
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,440
Nothing.

135
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,850
It's just hard to enjoy something

136
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,240
when your girlfriend thinks it's stupid.

137
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:25,850
Guys,guys!

138
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,490
Adrianna is having her baby.

139
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,120
Now?

140
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,400
Yeah.

141
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,330
Navid is with her and naomi is going to 
meet her at the hospital.

142
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,040
We've got to get to naomi's 'cae I promised

143
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,950
that I would take care of her house,and there's,

144
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,590
like,200 people on their way there now.

145
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,380
We got to hurry,guys.

146
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,890
All right,but the only problem is someone stole our limo.

147
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,540
Navid and adrianna probablyook it.

148
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,130
yeah Yo,duncan.

149
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,480
Can we get a ride,man?

150
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,650
Yeah,no problem,man.

151
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,680
Hop aboard the white stallion.

152
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,010
You are the man,D.

153
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,260
Wait!

154
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,950
She's coming?

155
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,830
I don't want that rat in our limo.

156
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,670
Phoebe,I swear I didn't tell anyone about your party,okay?

157
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,370
I swear.

158
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,720
Come on,pheebs,be a sport.

159
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,380
They need a lift.

160
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,920
Yeah,if you could just drive me to my house,I could get my car.

161
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,030
It would be so great.

162
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,860
Fine.

163
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,500
Just don't talk to me or look at me.

164
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,420
Honestly,phoebe? - You're talking and looking.

165
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,520
Thank you.

166
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,590
Sorry I have to abandon you.

167
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,240
I mean,on prom night and everything.

168
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,370
Don't worry about it.

169
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,090
I'll see you later tonight.

170
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,560
You'll go to the party?

171
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,250
Well,it's your party.

172
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,100
Of course I'm going.

173
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,260
You know what's crazy?

174
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,200
What's that?

175
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,460
My mom has been sending me to this therapist for months now.

176
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,980
This chick costs $200 an hour,

177
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,440
and I've barely said five words to her.

178
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,230
I spend one night with you,

179
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,420
I end up telling you my whole life story.

180
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,520
Well,500 bucks,we'll call it even.

181
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,120
this probably goes without saying,

182
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,740
but that stuff that I said-- that was private.

183
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,760
Of course.

184
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,220
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

185
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,090
Cool.

186
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,590
Come on,man.

187
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,330
Move the car.

188
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,430
Oh,finally.

189
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,740
Oh,my lord!

190
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,780
That is just crazy talk.
 - Excuse me?

191
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,490
Yeah,I thought so.

192
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,700
I told karen I thought so.

193
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,590
Ma'am,this is pretty urgent.

194
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,930
What's the matter,kid?

195
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,120
You get in a fight on prom night?

196
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,570
Well,I feel your pain,but it's not urgent,okay?

197
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,110
So take a seat and I'll get to you when I get to you.

198
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,490
Anyway.

199
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,060
What? 
- She said I never said a word to her,which is ridiculous.

200
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,780
'cause I can remember the exact second I told her.

201
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,330
Oh,my god,navid,what is taking so long?

202
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,890
My girlfriend is having a baby!

203
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,450
She's having a baby?

204
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,540
Yes,she's having a baby.

205
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,250
Yeah,I am having a baby.

206
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:32,030
Beautiful dreamer,wake unto me starlight and dewdrops  whoa!

207
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,900
Are waiting for thee heard in the day lulled

208
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,000
by the moonlight have all passed away.

209
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,620
I am going sprinkles,heath bar,chocolate chips,

210
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,570
chocolate fudge,yogurt- covered raisins on top.

211
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,410
Diabetic coma.

212
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,060
You think I should lose the yogurt raisins?

213
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,110
Yeah,that's the problem.

214
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,680
Who knew you were such a sugar fiend?

215
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,500
What can I say?

216
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,580
It's the only vice I have left.

217
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,220
Left,really?

218
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,720
What vices did you have?

219
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,730
A huge barbecue chicken problem.

220
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,650
But that's a conversation for another time,

221
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,020
when there aren't so many impressionable minds around.

222
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,640
Sounds intriguing.

223
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,710
all right!

224
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,570
Let's give it up thfor e wildcat crooners.

225
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,720
Hey,hon!

226
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,730
Hey!

227
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,160
Will you save my spot in line?

228
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:17,740
Yes.

229
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,940
So,what do you think?

230
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,860
Oh,it's great.

231
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,680
Everyone looks like they're having so much fun.

232
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,650
Yes,they are.

233
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,890
Hey,how come you're not wearing your t-shirt?

234
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,200
Oh,shoot.

235
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,240
I completely forgot.

236
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,370
Hey,what are you doing?

237
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,270
You lost our place in line.

238
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,260
I just a text.

239
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,290
Adrianna is in labor.

240
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,070
oh,guys!

241
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,110
What on earth are you doing down there?

242
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,940
I'm cleaning.

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,060
Naomi asked me to keep an eye on the house.

244
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,330
Unbelievable.

245
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,820
She throws this party,and she's not even here.

246
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,520
What are you looking at?

247
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,490
If you're supposed to be cleaning,clean.

248
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,680
I'm going outside to resist taking up smoking again.

249
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,150
It's never easy.

250
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,940
Me and silver-- it.

251
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,420
I don't know.

252
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,190
Relationships are work.

253
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,880
That's what they always say,right,man?

254
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,940
Well,this one is a lot of work.

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,360
I mean,sometimes I just wish I had a regular high school girlfriend

256
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,630
who liked stuff like prom and going to see her boyfriend play lacrosse

257
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,880
and didn't think walking on the third street promenade meant

258
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,760
she was a consumerist sellout.

259
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,950
Silver isn't easy,man.

260
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,200
Of course not.

261
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,080
I mean,who wants some boring regular high school girl?

262
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,720
I mean,silver's got spirit and attitude.

263
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,110
Life-force.

264
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,250
You know?

265
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,670
All I mean is.

266
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,150
I think you and silver are great.

267
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,750
And everything worth anything just takes work and patience.

268
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,920
Yeah,yeah.

269
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,220
I hear you,man.

270
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,390
But what can i do?I mean.

271
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,400
I love her,man.

272
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,500
I mean,when she's across the room,I miss her.

273
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,350
You know,speaking of which,

274
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,830
I'm going to go see how she's doing,a right?

275
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,880
Go,man.

276
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,130
I'm going to run to adrianna's room.

277
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,120
Can you hold this?

278
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,620
Sure,okay.

279
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,430
We'll wait here.

280
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,060
I can't believe we haven't heard from annie or dixon.

281
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,490
Well,I'm sure they're on their way.

282
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,250
Hey,where'd you get those,piglet?

283
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,810
I may have snuck them out of the postprom-a-palooza.

284
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,910
Come on.

285
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,900
Share.

286
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,550
After the piglet dig?

287
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,670
Okay.

288
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,320
Oh,thank you!

289
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,170
I'm not ready.

290
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,520
It's too soon.

291
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm supposed to have three more weeks.

292
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,800
It's going to be okay.

293
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,320
Greg and leslie aren't even here yet.

294
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,200
They're getting a flight.

295
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,060
They'll be here at 5:00 A.M.

296
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,630
Get ty.

297
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,100
I need him to sign that parental waiver.

298
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,040
He hasn't signed it yet.

299
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,720
I will call him.

300
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,390
I will get him down here.

301
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,540
Have you calleom your aunt'S.

302
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,820
She'll be here soon,okay?

303
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,300
I don't even have a toothbrush.

304
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,910
Don't worry.

305
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,200
Your breath doesn't smell that gross.

306
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:04,990
Kelly!

307
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,450
Did you get a hold of brenda?

308
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,000
No.

309
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,800
I left her a message.

310
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,050
She must still be in china.

311
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,650
What is she doing in china?

312
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,450
She's supposed to be here.

313
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,760
It's too soon.

314
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,840
See?I'm not ready.

315
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,500
Nothing is ready.

316
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,360
calm down.

317
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,940
Whatening?

318
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,450
I don't know.

319
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,930
The baby's heart rate's dropping.

320
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,000
What does that mean?

321
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,320
We need to do a c-section now.

322
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,580
Just stay calm.

323
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,360
Navid.

324
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,060
You're gonna be okay.

325
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:29,810
Navid!

326
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,860
Navid?

327
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,550
Just go.

328
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,220
OK,he watch the jackets!

329
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,140
And go!

330
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,250
Go!

331
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,310
Ryan.what are you doing?

332
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,160
It's you.erupting like a volcano.

333
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,250
Is the lava not reading?

334
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,950
Maybe I need to do some more crosshatching.

335
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,900
She's beautiful.

336
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,660
Do you want to hold her?

337
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,850
Come on,ade.

338
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,840
Just take a look.

339
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,940
No,navid.

340
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,450
Ade.

341
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,300
just take her out of here.

342
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,390
Okay.

343
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,370
just get some rest,okay?

344
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,010
Hey.

345
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,160
It's a girl.

346
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,750
she's great.

347
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,510
Healthy.

348
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,280
Six pounds,two ounces.

349
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,990
18 inches.

350
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,120
How's ade?

351
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,220
She's,uh,good.

352
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,640
She'S.

353
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,730
she's fine.She's resting.

354
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,430
Can we see the baby?

355
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,680
Yeah,sure.She's down the hallway in the nursery.

356
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,630
I'll go with you guys.

357
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,170
Hey,navid,quick question.

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,340
Annie.

361
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,560
Do you know where annie and dixon are?

362
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,560
Me?No.

363
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,260
You don't think they're still at your house?

364
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,870
My house?

365
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,970
Oh,right,right,yeah.

366
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,770
Uh,my house.

367
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,690
They might be,yeah.

368
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm gonna go see the baby,okay?

369
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,040
Clearly,they lie.

370
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,060
Looks like it.

371
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,640
Do you really think they went to an afterprom party?

372
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,160
YeS.

373
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,870
They must have.

374
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,950
Well,how are we gonna find them?

375
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,660
They're not answering their phones. - I don't know.

376
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,180
Maybe we should get in the car and drive around.

377
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,570
Drive where?

378
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,530
I don't know.

379
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,610
oh,man,suddenly I am so tired.

380
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,450
Why are you laughing?

381
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,960
Oh,my god,the way you yawned!

382
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,010
Like,like,like a lion.

383
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,970
did you just.

384
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,590
I did!

385
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,980
Did you just make yourself yawn?

386
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,500
I did!

387
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,360
I did.

388
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,270
Nowe hav to try it.

389
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,890
Come on.

390
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,770
Try it.Make yawn.

391
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,110
Oh,man!

392
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,650
I feel weird.

393
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,590
Me,too.

394
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,530
almost like I am stoned or something.

395
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,340
Yeah,at's how I feel.

396
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,550
I-I keep losing my train of thought and I have the munchies!

397
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,490
The brownies!

398
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,730
you think they were.

399
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,360
Pot brownies?

400
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,510
Seriously?

401
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,420
oh,my god!

402
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,150
Uh,where's dixon?

403
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,430
In the other room deejaying.

404
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,000
Always the life of the party.

405
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,690
Can I ask you something?

406
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,470
Sure.

407
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,750
What do you think about me and dixon?

408
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I think both of you guys are great.

409
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,620
No,I meanlike,as a couple?

410
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,070
We're just so different.

411
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,730
He's,like.

412
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,070
prom royalty,you know?

413
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,490
And I'm not.

414
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,430
Allyactu,technically,you are.

415
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,610
Come on.

416
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,810
Is that who you think I am,what,a prom queen?

417
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,940
No,no,and I'm glad that you're not.

418
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,990
Dixon loves you,silver,and prom is like a once-a-year thing,

419
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,080
which means there are still 364 non-prom nights

420
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,250
where your differences won't seem so drastic.

421
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,860
So you think we work?

422
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,500
Yeah,I think you guys make a great couple.

423
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,430
good.

424
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,650
Okay,I just needed to hear that.

425
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,210
are you wearing dixon's jacket?

426
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,130
I bought him this boutonnière.

427
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,630
You must have picked up his jacket by mistake.

428
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,890
Yeah,I guess.

429
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,170
I got you,man.

430
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,800
hey,dixon,I think we,uh,mixed up our jackets.

431
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,140
Oh,uh,man,I knew this felt a little tight.

432
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,380
You know,with my broad shoulders and everything.

433
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,970
thanks,man.

434
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,200
Hey,um,you want a song?

435
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,000
Uh,no.

436
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,300
No,man,you're doing great.

437
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,100
Good job,man.

438
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,390
All right,thanks,man.

439
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,650
You see,the problem is we can't drive anywhere because we're stoned.

440
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,710
Right.

441
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,630
Maybe we should call a cab.

442
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,660
Okay.

443
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,540
Should I call one or should I put on the list to call one?

444
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,770
Why are we whispering?

445
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm not sure.

446
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,070
Hey.

447
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,480
Everything okay?

448
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,420
Just making a list.

449
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,740
Fine.Good.

450
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,620
It's good.

451
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,840
Should we tell her?

452
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,080
Yeah,okay.

453
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,130
I grabbed a few brownies from the post-prom-a-looza,

454
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,330
and we suspect that they contained cannabis.

455
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,430
Now,see,that you should have whispered.

456
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,280
What?

457
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,620
The nerds had pot brownies.

458
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,050
so,you two are high?

459
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,340
Yes,we are!

460
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,320
We are!

461
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,420
And it,it,it couldn't be worse timing

462
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,600
because we cannot drive to find the kids.

463
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,650
Where would you drive exactly?

464
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,060
I have no idea.

465
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,440
okay.

466
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,200
Everything is gonna be okay.

467
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,320
You have great kids.

468
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,760
I'm sure they're safe.

469
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,870
There's nothing you can do.

470
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,710
Can we at least get some snacks?

471
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,840
Yes,I will go to the vending maand ine get you some snack

472
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,690
I can't be sure they're gonna have barbecued chicken,

473
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,720
but maybe they'll have barbecued chips.

474
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,490
Oh,barbecued peanuts,pork rinds?

475
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,550
she has a crush on you.

476
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,330
Yeah,right!

477
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,710
I'm serious.

478
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,510
That is the pot talking.

479
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,250
It makes you paranoid,remember?

480
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,320
You see that guy over there?

481
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,260
15 minutes ago,I thought he was the narc that was onto us.

482
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,030
Is he staring at us?

483
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,980
Yes.

484
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
hey,uh,are you okay?

485
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,640
Oh,look.

486
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,860
annie the rat.

487
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,590
Look,phoebe.

488
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,800
I'm cool.

489
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,660
oh,okay.

490
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,190
I'm fine.

491
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,680
I'll just head home.

492
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,960
Phoebe.

493
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,760
how you gonna get home?

494
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,100
I guess I'll walk.

495
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,120
I don't know.

496
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,540
Can you drive me?

497
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,990
Yes,I can drive you.

498
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,100
All right.

499
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,140
Okay,come on.

500
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,430
Wrap around.

501
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,360
Let's go.

502
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,950
Okay!

503
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,060
Having fun?

504
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,030
Oh,yeah,sure.

505
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,930
Really?

506
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,490
'Cause you look bored.

507
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,530
You caught me.

508
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm,um,naomi's next-door neighbor.

509
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,410
Zelda.

510
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,160
What's your name?

511
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,330
I'm liam.

512
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,640
Liam,liam,liam.

513
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,570
why do I know your name?

514
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,530
'Cause I just told it to you.

515
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,750
I know.

516
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,030
I heard a crazy story about you.

517
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,610
Yeah,you're the one whose mom was a maid,right?

518
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,830
Until she ended up shagging her boss.

519
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,660
Where did you hear that?

520
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,500
Oh,just a bunch of girls were gossiping about you.

521
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,780
Is it true or was naomi just exaggeratg?

522
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,350
Because she does have that tendency.

523
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,410
I mean,you know.

524
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,030
she's your girlfriend,right?

525
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,000
No.

526
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,860
Naomi is not my girlfriend.

527
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,120
You know.

528
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:17,650
I think that you and i could find a way to make this night a lot more fun.

529
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Oh,yeah?

530
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,190
Yeah.

531
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,850
Adrianna?

532
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,440
brenda!Hi.

533
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,720
Hey,sweetie.

534
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,750
You're here.

535
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,010
I thought you were supposed to be in china.

536
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,240
My show got extended.

537
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,740
I leave for beijing tomorrow.

538
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,690
But when I heard that you were here,

539
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,080
I rushed right over right after curtain.

540
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,440
You're playing cleopatra?

541
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,590
That's crazy.I just played cleopatra.

542
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,460
Well,that doesn't surprise me.

543
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,360
You and me,we're two of a kind.

544
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,240
I mean,think about it.

545
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,740
We both love drama.

546
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,300
We both live pretty dramatic lives.

547
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,910
Yeah,we do.

548
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,520
How's the baby?

549
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,750
Fine.

550
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,460
Healthy,you know.

551
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,030
She'S.

552
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,530
she's fine.

553
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,220
Do you want to go for a walk?

554
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,670
Um,I'm not sure I'm allowed to do that.

555
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,290
Who's gonna stop you?

556
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,860
You are with the queen of egypt.

557
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,150
okay.

558
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Let's go to the cafeteria.

559
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,850
Maybe get some jell-O.

560
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,270
Jell-o?

561
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,510
I love jell-O.

562
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,450
Me,too.

563
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,180
See?

564
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,450
We are two of a kind.

565
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,250
"Jim walsh"?

566
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,780
That's not a relative of yours,is it?

567
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,860
Yeah,that's my father.

568
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,160
He's dying,actually.

569
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,370
Oh,my god.

570
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,380
I'm so sorry.

571
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,170
Oh,you know what I hope they have?

572
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,840
Jell-o with those little marshmallows.

573
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,780
Your dad's dying?

574
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,390
Could go any minute.

575
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,270
But shouldn't you be with him?

576
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,710
Too painful.

577
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,400
Of course,it's painful.

578
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,870
I'm just not ready.

579
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,410
But you'll never be ready,will you?

580
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,380
I-I just think if you don't say good-bye,you're always gonna regret it.

581
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,640
Have you met my dragon?

582
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,310
handsome,isn't he?

583
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,370
Yes,sure.

584
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,620
Brenda.

585
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,410
You have to say good-bye,brenda.

586
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,010
If you don't,you're gonna always regret it.

587
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,150
Always!

588
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,860
Good-bye.

589
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,210
I've got to go to china.

590
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,070
Brenda?

591
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,290
Brenda?

592
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,940
I want to hold my baby.

593
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,050
Okay,on three.

594
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,340
One.

595
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,570
two.

596
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,720
three!

597
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,260
so,how long have you had a thing for my girlfriend?

598
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,850
What?

599
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,920
The way you're looking at her,man.

600
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,510
Now?

601
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,160
No,I wasn't looking at silver.

602
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,970
I was just staring off.

603
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,920
I think,actually,something got caught in my contact lens.

604
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,010
The way you were talking about her before.

605
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,520
Well,come on,man,I think silver's great,you know,but as a friend.

606
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,510
And as my friend's girlfriend.

607
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,980
You swear?

608
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,340
Of course.

609
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,070
So why do you have a picture of her in your pocket?

610
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,640
Well,I.

611
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,280
I got it for you.

612
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,280
you're lying to me.

613
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,420
Dixon,just let this go.

614
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,560
So you're,you're just gonna lie to me?

615
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,150
I thought I was your friend.

616
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,570
I am your friend.

617
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,480
And I didn't do anything,so just back off.

618
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,400
But you wanted to.

619
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,390
You wanted to do something.

620
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,050
Says who?

621
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,130
Just admit it.

622
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,910
Admit what?

623
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,580
Okay,you guys have to come swimming.

624
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,850
The water's fine.

625
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,060
What's wrong?

626
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,880
Don't lie to me,man.

627
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,260
Drop it,dixon.

628
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,090
Admit it.

629
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,500
Drop it.

630
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,900
I mean,you're king jock,right?

631
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,090
So,man up!

632
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,560
Admit it!

633
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,030
Fine!

634
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,290
I like you,silver.

635
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,740
What?

636
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,800
Thank you so much.

637
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,510
I really appreciate it.

638
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,860
You sure it's okay if I go?

639
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,560
Come on.

640
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,750
You've been here all night.

641
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,220
And you have about 200 people waiting for you at your house.

642
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,300
Mm,okay.

643
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,900
I'll be back here first thing tomorrow.

644
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,740
And by "first thing," I mean mid-afternoon.

645
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,170
Definitely before dinner.

646
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,280
We'll be here.

647
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,870
Here's the form.

648
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,870
Thanks.

649
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,490
I also want to give this to you.

650
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,150
A cigar?

651
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,430
Yeah,it's what they give new fathers,right?

652
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:25,840
So here.

653
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,560
You're a good guy,navid.

654
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,880
You've really been there for adrianna,which I respect.

655
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,450
I also respect your left hook.

656
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,420
yeah,sorry.

657
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,110
thanks.

658
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,150
Thanks.

659
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,520
Trail mix?

660
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,980
Oh,no,I'm good.

661
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,720
You sure?

662
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,580
It's really good.

663
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,590
I'm sure it is,but I'm not high.

664
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,090
oh,yeah,right.

665
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,600
It's weird.

666
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,460
I forgot how this makes you feel.

667
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,550
Hungry,paranoid.

668
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:21,620
You know,earlier,I actually thought you had a crush on my husband.

669
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,020
what?

670
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,100
Oh,I know,it's insane.

671
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,180
Just,we women,we get a little jealous,and,well,add pot into the mix.

672
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,400
debbie,I.

673
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,460
oh,I know.

674
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,630
It's me.I'm stoned.

675
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,550
That's why I swore off this stuff in college.

676
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,270
Hey,savanna,have you seen liam?

677
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,760
Oh,my god,this party is a-ma-zing!

678
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,390
Thank you.

679
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,200
Liam?

680
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,600
I think maybe he went upstairs.

681
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,450
Thanks.

682
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,560
You're back.

683
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,400
What have you done?

684
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,820
Who is she?

685
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,740
She's nobody.

686
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,610
And she's gone.

687
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,410
I don't ever want to see you again.

688
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,550
Golly,my sister can be so high-strung.

689
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,670
And she has such hilariously bourgeois ideas about fidelity.

690
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,040
Now,where is my louboutin?

691
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,080
Here we go.

692
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,530
Your sister?

693
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,740
Are you kidding me naomi is your sister?

694
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,780
Yes.

695
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,290
She was getting a little full of herself.

696
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,480
She needed to be knocked down a peg.

697
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,100
Trust me: It's good for her.

698
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,430
You used me.

699
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,260
it's not like you didn't have fun,right?

700
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,910
If I were you,I'd consider myself lucky.

701
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,480
But she is your sister.

702
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,370
I mean,she's gonna hate you.

703
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,550
Oh,she'll never know it's me.

704
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,640
I mean,you're not gonna tell her.

705
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,510
Because she'd be devastated.

706
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,660
And you're just not that cruel.

707
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,380
Give me my shirt.

708
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,960
I forgot how cute teenage boys are when they're upset.

709
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,530
You are a bitch.

710
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,410
Don't be vulgar.

711
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,890
and yes,I am.

712
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,270
Only when it's absolutely necessary.

713
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,060
Annie!

714
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,260
How could you?

715
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,350
What?

716
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,750
You slept with liam in my bed.

717
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,470
No.

718
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,490
W-what are you talking about?

719
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,400
Don't lie to me.

720
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,870
Naomi,I didn't do anything.

721
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,490
What is this?

722
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,550
It's my wrap.

723
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,470
Which I found in my room.

724
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,190
How did it get there?

725
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,050
I don't know.

726
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,240
I haven't even been in your room.

727
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,190
Must have been somebody else.

728
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,210
I was with phoebe abrams.

729
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,380
Oh,right!

730
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,330
She hates you!

731
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,050
No.

732
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,450
Look,I know she does.

733
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,010
But she got so drunk so I had to drive.

734
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,580
Stop lying to me!

735
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,250
Stop it!

736
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,060
Naomi,I wouldn't do that to you.

737
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,190
What are you talking about?

738
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,160
You already have!

739
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,140
What?

740
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,970
Ethan ring a bell?

741
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,030
And I forgave you 'cause apparently I was an idiot!

742
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,770
Okay.Naomi,please stop,okay?

743
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,720
This is crazy.

744
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,690
she acts like she's this innocent girl from kansas.

745
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,400
That is not what she is!

746
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,360
Maybe at one time.

747
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,360
Not anymore.

748
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,550
She ratted out the party.

749
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,880
No,I didn't!

750
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,170
No one wants you here.

751
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,320
Why are you still here?

752
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,790
Get out of my house,kansas skank!

753
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,310
That's for charlie.

754
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,350

755
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,620
Get out!

756
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,380
Screw.

757
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,870
screw you,naomi!

758
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,050
Screw all of you!

759
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,000
Hi,um,I was calling.

760
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,900
I was concerned about some underage

761
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:18,400
drinking going on at a party
near my house,174 west hollybrook.

762
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,080
The house belongs to naomi clark.

763
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,630
Where's your dragon?

764
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,550
Honey,did they give you painkillers?

765
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,080
Wait.

766
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,370
Am I awake?

767
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,020
No,I am not awake because you're in china.

768
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,120
Okay.I got back a couple hours ago.

769
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,760
I'm real.

770
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,970
Sorry.

771
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,290
ade,he is beautiful.

772
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,100
It's hard to believe it was her all this time.

773
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,020
you know?

774
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,460
Inside me.

775
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,570
Pretty amazing.

776
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,010
Yeah,really amazing.

777
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,740
uh,sorry to interrupt you guys,but,um,greg and leslie are here.

778
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,730
Already?

779
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,450
Yeah,they're parking downstairs.

780
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,810
See,this.

781
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,190
this is why I didn't want to hold her.

782
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,460
This is why.

783
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,300
This.

784
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,950
Now I have to say good-bye.

785
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,380
How am I gonna say good-bye?

786
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,770
How?

787
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,840
look,I know that this is tough,anthis isyour decision.

788
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,890
All I can say is that adoption is a wonderful gift.

789
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,520
And I'spm eaking from experience.

790
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,430
That's why I was in china.

791
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,570
I adopted a little girl.

792
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,090
really?

793
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,080
Yeah.

794
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,700
She's with my mom and dad right now,

795
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,530
and I cannot wait for you to meet her.

796
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:28,170
Trust me,that couple you chose,you are making them so happy.

797
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,990
And they're gonna make her so happy.

798
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,770
Yeah.I know they are.

799
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,740
you're gonna be really happy,okay?

800
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,470
Thank you.

801
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,740
You're gonna be happy.

802
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:52,920
Ethan.

803
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,250
Ethan!

804
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,770
What was that?

805
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,090
I never wanted to say anything.

806
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,110
I don't know what to do with this,okay?

807
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,710
I mean,you're one of my best friends,but that's it,right?

808
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,210
We're just friends.

809
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,640
I don't think we're just friends.

810
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,710
Ethan.

811
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,450
no.

812
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,960
And I don't want to be just friends.

813
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,320
I don't think I could take it.

814
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,270
I want to be something more.

815
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,790
or I don't want to be anything.

816
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,900
It's up to you,silver.

817
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,980
Just think about this: Why are you out here talking

818
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:51,020
with me instead of inside talking to your boyfriend?

819
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,590
it's okay,darling.

820
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,000
It's okay.

821
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,450
I'm here and I'm gonna take good care of you,I promise.

822
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,660
I promise.

823
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,310
you ready?

824
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,370
Yeah,I'm ready.

825
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,620
Thank you.

826
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,090
What's her name?

827
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,740
Maisie.

828
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,460
That'a really pretty name.

829
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,560
Good-bye,maisie.

830
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,950
Good-bye.

831
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,610
I did the right thing,right?

832
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,640
You did a really good thing.

833
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,870
Hey,naomi,it's liam.

834
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,980
Look,I know I messed up.

835
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,170
I need to talk to you.

836
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,810
Get out of bed!Get dressed!

837
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,690
What the hell?

838
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,720
You're coming with us to stembrook.

839
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,600
It's a wilderness therapy program.

840
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:04,850
Now get dressed!

841
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,340
Mom!

842
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,620
You can't make me do this!

843
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,710
Yes,we can.

844
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,930
Your stepfather's fed up!

845
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,230
All this skipping school,stolen credit cards-- it's over.
