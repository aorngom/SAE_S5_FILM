00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,858
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,093
It's about mom.
She has cancer.

3
00:00:04,263 --> 00:00:05,897
- What?
- She's dying.

4
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:07,794
My mom died three years ago.

5
00:00:08,054 --> 00:00:09,921
I knows what you're going through.

6
00:00:13,268 --> 00:00:15,851
Continental accent.
He's for sale.

7
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:19,389
He's magnificent.
I've started my divorce proceedings.

8
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,517
We just need to send in
a deposit to retain the lawyer.

9
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:25,496
It's a little over $100,000.
I'm buying a racehorse.

10
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:27,355
I'd hate to see you lose your money.

11
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:30,320
- Who's talking about my money?
- You had sex with Naomi's sister?

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,010
She told me she was her neighbor.
I'm gonna destroy Jen

13
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:35,355
before she destroys me.
Just don't know how.

14
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,034
How we're gonna do it.

15
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:40,577
I want the same stuff
I got last time.

16
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,789
- Jasper is not a drug dealer!
- That's what Navid told me.

17
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,708
You shouldn't see him anymore.

18
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:49,232
I am not a drug dealer.
But if I was,

19
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:52,005
I wouldn't be the kind of
guy you want to mess with, would I?

20
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:00,226
Good, you're awake again.

21
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:03,892
How are you feeling?

22
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:06,611
Omar, he's awake.

23
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:08,377
How you feeling, Navid?

24
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:10,798
My head hurts.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,863
- My arm hurts, too.
- That makes sense. You broke it.

26
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:18,823
You also got a serious concussion.

27
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:21,214
The cat scan results look good.

28
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:24,079
- You're very lucky.
- I don't feel super lucky.

29
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:26,247
Can you tell me what year it is?

30
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,667
- 2009?
- Excellent.

31
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,049
I'll be back in an hour
or so to check on you again.

32
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:35,108
Only two visitors in
the room at a time, please.

33
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,472
Absolutely.

34
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:38,570
Whatever.

35
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:39,803
What's up, boy?

36
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:42,263
- Hey, champ? You good?
- What's up, bud?

37
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:44,849
Where's Ade?

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,938
You and Ade,

39
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,556
You aren't together exactly.

40
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,432
- Or at all.
- Right. Of course.

41
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,071
That's okay, sweetheart.

42
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:00,699
Can you tell us what happened?
How you hurt your head,

43
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:02,158
your arm?

44
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:03,702
I was at the blaze,

45
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,602
I was editing a report
on a student art prodigy.

46
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:09,902
I left the office.

47
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,320
I walked down the hallway.

48
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,587
I was on my way to
calculus, and then...

49
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:22,012
And then I don't remember.

50
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:26,057
Don't worry. The doctor said
there may be some memory loss.

51
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,810
I'm just actually very tired.

52
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:32,079
Of course.
Yes, you sleep.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,889
<i>Call me. Where are you?</i>

54
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,054
<i>Ade, it's Naomi.</i>

55
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:53,058
<i>Silver's mom just
got taken to the hospital.</i>

56
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:56,429
<i>I don't know where you are
or what you're doing</i>

57
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,562
<i>or why you haven't been in school, but
I really need you to come to the hosp...</i>

58
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:04,596
<i>Ade, it's me again.</i>

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,237
<i>I've been trying you for hours</i>

60
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:10,647
<i>and you're not answering and...
Silver's mom just died.</i>

61
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:14,153
<i>Funeral's gonna be tomorrow, and it
would be really nice if you could come.</i>

62
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:16,849
<i>I guess we're supposed
to be there at 10:00</i>

63
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:21,128
<i>I have no idea why I'm even
bothering to call you back;</i>

64
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:23,304
<i>it's probably pointless.
But you should know</i>

65
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,571
<i>that Navid got into an accident.</i>

66
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:27,432
<i>He's in the hospital.</i>

67
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:30,764
<i>He fell down the stairs at
school and it's really not good.</i>

68
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,040
Oh, my god.

69
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:06,371
Hold that elevator!

70
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:13,123
Thanks.

71
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:14,643
Sure.

72
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:19,284
What floor?

73
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,047
Ground.

74
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,224
I thought you left for the funeral.

75
00:04:32,394 --> 00:04:34,644
- Forgot my purse.
- Right.

76
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:38,959
Silver doing okay?

77
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:41,818
All right.

78
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:48,700
We parked on p3, right, Liam?

79
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,418
How are you feeling?

80
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:01,303
Not bad.

81
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,841
Worse than I've ever felt
in my life, but not too bad.

82
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,303
I wanted to tell you,
you were right.

83
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:11,848
I was high and stupid.

84
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,940
When I heard you were in the hospital,
it was, like,

85
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,777
this total wake up call.

86
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,771
I'm done, forever.

87
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,801
I know I said
some really terrible things.

88
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:27,001
When I said I never loved you,
I didn't mean it.

89
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,324
It was the drugs.

90
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:33,514
You are the love of my life.

91
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:36,944
When I woke up...

92
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,496
The first person...

93
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,754
The only person
that I wanted to see was you.

94
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,503
And then I remembered everything
that happened between us.

95
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,034
All of it.

96
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:53,973
How could you?

97
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,853
You should go.

98
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:16,560
I'm going to need your essays
on Kierkegaard by tomorrow morning

99
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,301
or there will be fear and
trembling in this classroom,

100
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:22,796
which was the name of the book
that you were supposed to read.

101
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,880
Aren't they angsty enough?

102
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,477
With all the hormones and acne.

103
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,994
Is existentialism really necessary?

104
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:32,679
To what do I owe this pleasure?

105
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,937
Well, Mr. Matthews, when
I attended West Beverly,

106
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,936
I always wondered
how sturdy these desks were.

107
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:44,294
Could they hold
a petulant catholic school girl

108
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,823
and, say, her very strict

109
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:50,154
yet dashingly handsome headmaster?

110
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:51,727
Catholic?

111
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:53,157
Amen.

112
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:57,287
- What are your plans this weekend?
- I don't know. What'd you have in mind?

113
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:01,874
My horse is racing at
Santa Anita opening day.

114
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:06,477
I was thinking that maybe
you would want to join me and Naomi.

115
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:09,185
Horses, champagne,

116
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:11,467
my sister and I in very cute hats.

117
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,161
- What do you say?
- I could break out

118
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:16,889
my favorite pair of chaps.

119
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:22,770
I forgot my book.

120
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:25,688
My bad.

121
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:37,577
I know where we can take down Jen.
You still want to, right?

122
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:46,169

123
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,844
Season 02 episode 11
<i>And Away They Go!</i>

124
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:07,823
Is it bad that we left the Shiva?

125
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:09,820
Kelly will be fine.

126
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,984
You needed your space.

127
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:16,157
Anyway, they covered all those
mirrors, which was just rude.

128
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,857
All those people that...

129
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:27,505
I've never even met,

130
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,036
Kissing me

131
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,635
and telling me how sorry
they are for my loss, which...

132
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:41,569
What does that mean anyway,
"my loss?"

133
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:45,340
It's a person,
it's not a baseball game.

134
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:54,920
This whole day just...

135
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,949
It's been really surreal.

136
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:06,916
One minute she's here, and then

137
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:10,264
the next minute, I'm shoveling
dirt onto her coffin.

138
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:15,341
I can't believe
my mom's in a coffin.

139
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,051
I know.

140
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:21,813
And I can't believe
that Ade didn't show.

141
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,225
She didn't, right?

142
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:27,770
I could have missed her
in the blur of people...

143
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,063
She didn't.

144
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:31,357
I guess it's the drugs.

145
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:37,832
I don't care what it is;
she should've been there.

146
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:49,876
"I'm sorry I wasn't at the funeral.
I'm thinking of you.

147
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:51,220
Love, Teddy."

148
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,130
Why didn't he go?
When I saw him, he was all dressed up.

149
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:59,778
It's totally crazy.
This girl in my pre-calc class

150
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:02,481
said that Navid fainted,
but then Abby in my gym class

151
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,724
was saying that he had
a seizure or something.

152
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:07,079
- What did Navid say?
- I don't know.

153
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:10,947
My dad was in the ambulance, but
Navid was totally out of it. My dad said

154
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:13,649
I didn't ask what your dad said,
I asked what Navid said.

155
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,855
I don't know.
I haven't heard.

156
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:22,191
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought up my dad.

157
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:25,536
I know our dinner didn't go the way that
it was supposed to, but don't worry.

158
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,789
I'm not gonna let
my parents come between us.

159
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,641
I got to go to class.

160
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:41,093
Out.

161
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,015
Way long.
Sorry, I call 'em how I see 'em.

162
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,525
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to thank you for the flowers.

163
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:52,191
And...

164
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,649
I wanted to find out
how you're doing.

165
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,652
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

166
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,691
Maybe.

167
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:01,781
But I'm asking you.

168
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:07,052
I was gonna come today.

169
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,540
Can't seem to do feelings.

170
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,501
They're not fun.

171
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:18,716
I don't know what
the hell's wrong with me.

172
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:20,550
It's okay.

173
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,527
- No, it's not.
- You barely knew my mother...

174
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:26,472
I didn't go
to my mom's funeral, either.

175
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,018
You didn't?

176
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:33,846
I couldn't.

177
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:36,783
I tried.

178
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:38,442
I put on my suit and tie,

179
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:41,904
And I rode with
my family to the church.

180
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:46,857
And then I just couldn't
get out of the car.

181
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:50,037
Like a...

182
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,201
coward, I couldn't
get out of the car.

183
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:57,920
You are not a coward.

184
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:02,593
You are so completely not a coward.

185
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:26,490
I'm sorry,
Silver, I wanted to be there for you.

186
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:28,923
You are.

187
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:32,204
You are.

188
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:52,657
- I'm sorry.
- No, I don't, either.

189
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:55,186
Sorry.

190
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,646
It was...

191
00:12:58,281 --> 00:12:59,982
I don't know what it was.

192
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:02,476
We're both going
through a lot of stuff.

193
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:03,944
- Emotional.
- Vulnerable.

194
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:05,663
Totally vulnerable...

195
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:08,616
But since...

196
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,077
We did kiss...

197
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:13,996
You're kind of my boyfriend now.

198
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:17,111
What?

199
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,448
Relax.
I'm kidding.

200
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:23,929
Right.

201
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:39,961
What do you want?

202
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,607
What kind of hello is that?

203
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:45,039
I thought you might
be wanting something,

204
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,780
that you're running low.

205
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,310
I'm clean now.

206
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,657
I don't want anything,
and I'm not going to ever.

207
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:53,237
Willpower... very impressive.

208
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:55,704
How's Navid?

209
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:57,316
Not great.

210
00:13:57,584 --> 00:13:58,958
He's in the hospital.

211
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,211
He fall down the stairs
or something?

212
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:05,650
I guess so; he doesn't
remember what happened.

213
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:08,763
I'm sorry, I got to get to class.

214
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:21,731
Hi yourself.

215
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:26,310
I want to say
sorry if I was a dick earlier.

216
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:29,845
The idea that your
parents don't like me,

217
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,117
it sends me into a dark place.

218
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:34,859
I totally get it.

219
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:38,012
And it upsets me, too,
but don't worry about them.

220
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,458
Nobody else matters,
as long as we have each other.

221
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:42,159
Which we do.

222
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,094
I love you.

223
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,763
I love you more.

224
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,449
- I got to get to class.
- All right.

225
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:59,685
When you get home from school,
we are gonna have a talk.

226
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:07,831
You kind of hold your pool
cue like you hold your chopsticks.

227
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,946
- How's that?
- Just completely and totally wrong.

228
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:16,582
- What?
- Nothing.

229
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:20,414
I'm kind of thinking
about this whole Jen thing.

230
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:28,005
You're not doing this because
you still like Naomi, right?

231
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:29,839
What?

232
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:34,011
How about the fact that Jen's
been making my life hell for months.

233
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,529
- Isn't that a good enough reason?
- Yeah, totally.

234
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:45,167
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

235
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:48,557
As long as you're sure
it's not about Naomi.

236
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,407
It's not about Naomi.

237
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,764
Well, well, well!

238
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,334
This is a surprise.

239
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:02,957
- What's going on?
- You tell me. I knew you were close,

240
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:04,983
But I didn't realize how close.

241
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:07,419
This, us, it's not a big deal.

242
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,965
We're kind of just hanging out.

243
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,551
We kind of wanna keep that
on the down-low.

244
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:16,220
We don't really want to be a...
couple couple.

245
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:20,140
So don't tweet about it, pretty boy.

246
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:25,850
I don't get it. We told you
we didn't want you seeing Jasper.

247
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:28,098
I'm gonna see him at
school. I can't help it.

248
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:30,231
What am I supposed to do,
wear a blindfold?

249
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:33,976
You were kissing him when we told
you that we didn't want you to see him!

250
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:35,948
I can't believe
you were spying on me!

251
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:37,779
I was not spying on you.

252
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:39,702
I am the principal of your school.

253
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:43,455
You can control what I do at home, but
you can't control what I do at school.

254
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:48,794
That's fine. But we can control what you
do after school, and you're grounded.

255
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:58,164
What do you think? Little
Michael Jackson meets Michael Phelps?

256
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:04,018
Your mom had some crazy clothes!

257
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,728
I know.

258
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,151
You should seriously
wear that outfit out.

259
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,110
I'm not even trying to trick you,

260
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:13,356
like that one time with
the helmet lang padded bodysuit.

261
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,138
Out.

262
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:21,516
I'm actually gonna have to
venture out into the real world soon.

263
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:22,800
Yes.

264
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,325
But I will be there
right alongside you,

265
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:27,218
and I'll even wear this.

266
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:30,127
If it'll put a smile on your face,
put a smile...

267
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:34,962
Come in.

268
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,968
I just want to apologize.

269
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:48,020
I've been a really terrible friend,

270
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,278
and I really want
to make it up to you.

271
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:52,691
Ade, stop.

272
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,448
You want to be
a good friend for Silver,

273
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:57,279
Leave her alone.

274
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:59,301
- But...
- No buts.

275
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,635
What Silver needs right now
are friends that she can rely on,

276
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,740
and clearly, that's not you.

277
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,258
- Can I get in there?
- When I'm done.

278
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:46,815
- Then can you hurry up?
- Nope.

279
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:48,857
Jerk.

280
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:52,000
Can you leave the bread out, please?

281
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:56,362
- Good morning, you two.
- Whatever.

282
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:58,780
What's on the agenda for today?

283
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,636
I have Saturday chem
study group at school,

284
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:04,096
but I probably can't go,
because I'm grounded.

285
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:06,473
Of course you can go to study group.

286
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,684
- Lucky me.
- What about you, honey?

287
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:11,693
- Any big plans for this weekend?
- Just plans.

288
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:14,671
- What are they?
- Hanging out with my friends.

289
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:19,695
If you get your books,
I'll drive you to school.

290
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:22,281
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

291
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,505
No kidding.

292
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:30,704
Have a good day.

293
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,625
I'll find my own ride home.

294
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,391
Ready for chem study group?

295
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:51,814
Yes, I am.

296
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,621
Let's go.

297
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:24,629
Oh, Continental Accent,
there you are, my darling!

298
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,181
Hi, Nate. How are you?
Aren't you a big, handsome man?

299
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:29,498
Yes, you are.

300
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:32,731
You are gonna run
so fast today, aren't you, darling?

301
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:34,580
Naomi, encourage him.

302
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,981
You are a big, handsome man,
aren't you?

303
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,157
Yes, you are.
So, muscular and...

304
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,910
Well endowed.

305
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,660
Thanks for noticing.

306
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,293
- Didn't mean...
- Darling, how are you?

307
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,147
Fan-freakin'-tastic.
Boo-yah! Who's your friend?

308
00:20:56,314 --> 00:20:58,615
Oh, this is my sister, Naomi.

309
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:00,676
It's good to meet you, Naomi.

310
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,637
This is Danny Paris,
our very talented jockey.

311
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,787
And incredibly well endowed.

312
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,809
With equestrian talents, of course.

313
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:13,772
So...
What do you think?

314
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:17,032
What do I th...
I think, yeah, right.

315
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,880
Fan-friggin'-no way in hell!

316
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:22,612
Come on, Naomi, Danny is a top athlete
with a great career, and I think

317
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:26,694
it would be good for you to have someone
take your mind off of you know who.

318
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:29,910
I know who you mean.

319
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:33,145
I just did not realize you had the
opportunity to smoke crack this morning.

320
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,253
Now, Naomi, Danny has a great
personality, and I think that...

321
00:21:37,988 --> 00:21:40,480
You two would be amazing together.

322
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:41,747
Oh, shut up!

323
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:43,266
Absolutely amazing.

324
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:46,383
Then you go date
the flirty little Napoleon guy.

325
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,080
As Kirkegaard would say,
doubt is conquered by faith...

326
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,745
How are you feeling?

327
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Okay.

328
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,709
I'm glad to be in the real world.

329
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:01,581
If you can call this the real world.

330
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,822
- Ms. Clark?
- Speaking.

331
00:22:04,187 --> 00:22:06,909
I have something for you.
From a secret admirer.

332
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:11,827
An Hermes scarf?

333
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,113
<i>Ah, j'adore it!</i>

334
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,003
Okay, who's it from?

335
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,031
Just a secret admirer.

336
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:43,908
Who names a horse
Daddylovespumpernickel?

337
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:47,116
- Oh, disgusting.
- It's not that bad, it's just odd.

338
00:22:47,388 --> 00:22:49,958
I mean, to name a beautiful,
elegant animal Daddyloves...

339
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,647
No. Disgusting.

340
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:55,457
No way. You have a box here?

341
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,960
My sister does.
We own a horse, actually.

342
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:00,548
- Cool.
- Yeah.

343
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:03,176
- Good luck.
- Thanks, honey.

344
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,489
Did you see what Ivy's wearing?

345
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:10,013
I wouldn't use that shirt as
a rag to scrub my bathtub.

346
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,346
Like you scrub your own bathtub.

347
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:14,851
You ever notice
how some girls are so girly

348
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:19,040
that they sort of... Skip femininity
and just cut straight to tranny?

349
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,817
Anyone irking you
in particular there, Ivy?

350
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,747
Oh, I'm not irked by Naomi.

351
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:26,095
I'm just worried that
she might suffer brain damage

352
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:28,573
- from swallowing all that lip gloss.
- Perrier's good.

353
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:30,907
And you can just write
your number on the check.

354
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:33,136
- What a flirt.
- Seriously.

355
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:34,992
Excuse...

356
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:38,292
You kind of forgot
about the rest of us!

357
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,134
Dude, you are such a player.

358
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:42,092
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

359
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:44,658
I think it's kind of cool
that you don't get tied down.

360
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:47,864
- Girls are nothing but trouble.
- Whatever. Guys are so much worse.

361
00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:50,719
- What?!
- You know what? You're both right.

362
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,244
Relationships are trouble.

363
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:55,747
Guess I have to accept it.

364
00:23:56,446 --> 00:23:57,676
I'm a player.

365
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,372
Ms. Clark.

366
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,559
Tiffany's!

367
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:10,889
- It's pretty.
- It's so pretty.

368
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:13,857
Okay, I know you can't
tell me who it's from.

369
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,080
But let me ask you this.

370
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:21,626
Is my secret admirer five feet tall?

371
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:22,876
No.

372
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,545
Yes!

373
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:26,590
But that's all I can tell you.

374
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,390
He'll introduce himself
when he's ready.

375
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,318
You know, I wouldn't say
you lied to your parents.

376
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:41,705
How's that?

377
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,277
Because you and I,
we have great chemistry.

378
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:47,413
Shut up.

379
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:03,210
Could I get a ginger ale
for my friend and...

380
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,670
- A whiskey straight-up for me?
- Do you have I.D.?

381
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:07,189
Really?

382
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,050
Well, I'm flattered.

383
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,845
- Make that two ginger ales, please.
- Got it.

384
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,766
What is taking Liam so long?

385
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,313
Must still be with the tech
working on his phone.

386
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,157
What kind of moron
deletes evidence like that?

387
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:25,339
Seriously?
I mean, come on.

388
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:27,574
He had a recording of Jen

389
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:29,903
confessing on his phone
and deleted it?

390
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:32,322
- So stupid.
- Don't worry about it.

391
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,230
I'm telling you, I spilled this gnarly
yogurt drink on my laptop,

392
00:25:35,397 --> 00:25:37,244
this tech guy
saved the entire thing.

393
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:41,417
- The laptop, not the yogurt drink.
- Finally, bro.

394
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,590
So? Did it work?

395
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:46,747
We're ready to go, my friends.

396
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:48,547
Nice!

397
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,219
Sweet revenge.

398
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:57,789
Number five, Pauley's Folly,

399
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,977
ridden by Enrico Perez.

400
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,743
You're the best, Danny!
Bring it home!

401
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,497
- Good luck, darling!
- Break a leg!

402
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,890
- What?
- What if we win?

403
00:26:12,057 --> 00:26:15,229
I mean, wouldn't that be amazing?
200 grand.

404
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:18,147
Wouldn't hurt, especially considering
the horse was a gift.

405
00:26:18,514 --> 00:26:20,388
Someone gave you a horse?

406
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:22,965
The race is about to start!

407
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,171
- Go, Continental Accent!
- Come on, Danny!

408
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm guessing it'd be too much to hope
your equestrian benefactor was, like,

409
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,187
anlderly aunt-type, right?

410
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:38,661
I'm sorry.

411
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,932
But I'll tell you
that I like the horse

412
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,101
a lot better than
I like the benefactor.

413
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,818
Oh, no! Continental Accent,

414
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:51,985
come on!

415
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,698
Look!

416
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,150
Wait, wait...

417
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,521
Go, go, go, go!

418
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:30,398
Look, I just wanted to tell you,
I'm sorry about your mom.

419
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:34,406
Thank you.

420
00:27:35,442 --> 00:27:39,115
And thanks for coming
to the funeral. Means a lot.

421
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:41,728
Of course. Of course.

422
00:27:42,004 --> 00:27:43,404
No, it's... hey...

423
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:45,578
It's not "of course."

424
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,970
We haven't exactly been friends.

425
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:53,205
I still feel really bad about
what happened at the end of last year.

426
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:56,173
About kissing Ethan

427
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,344
- and not telling you and everything.
- It's okay.

428
00:28:01,116 --> 00:28:02,222
I forgive you.

429
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:07,965
I miss you, you know.

430
00:28:08,143 --> 00:28:10,143
You weren't just my boyfriend,

431
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:12,315
you were my friend.

432
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,151
I miss you, too.

433
00:28:18,286 --> 00:28:19,286
Come here.

434
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,459
- Congratulations!
- This was amazing. You were so good!

435
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,835
Please tell me you're here to turn
this thing off. I can't find the remote.

436
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:47,702
Hey, is this a bad time?

437
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,396
- What are you doing here?
- I just came from a meeting.

438
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,574
And I've been thinking a lot
about what you asked me.

439
00:28:54,938 --> 00:28:57,193
And I think I know
why I did what I did.

440
00:28:57,443 --> 00:28:58,921
You figured it out?

441
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:01,804
Even though I was sober
the whole time I was with you,

442
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,492
I was still acting like an addict.

443
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:07,078
I hate how self- destructive I am.

444
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:12,066
So I screwed everything up because

445
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:16,757
there's a part of me that really
doesn't like when things are going well.

446
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,988
It's like, I don't feel
like I deserve it.

447
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:24,649
And I get that now.
And I'm going to work on it.

448
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,848
And being sober, for me,
is going to be a lot more than just

449
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:30,518
not taking drugs.

450
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,109
Okay.

451
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,870
I know it's too late for us.

452
00:29:44,037 --> 00:29:46,040
But I'm gonna be working on myself.

453
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:48,447
And when or if

454
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:51,108
you ever want to be friends...

455
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:54,042
I'll be here.

456
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:56,158
Thank you.

457
00:29:57,389 --> 00:29:59,039
I'll keep that in mind.

458
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,307
So I'll see you.

459
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,790
Bye.

460
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,603
Come on.

461
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:17,445
Come on, Mutton Bird.
Come on!

462
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:26,074
We need to talk.

463
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:27,733
Fine.

464
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:33,555
Ms. Clark.

465
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:36,501
Another present?!

466
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,549
So, you recorded me with your phone?

467
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:43,883
Gosh, you know, you are cute.
Like a little spy.

468
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,261
- That's mine.
- And what,

469
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,009
you thought that you'd play
the recording for Naomi

470
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:52,100
and she'd realize what
an evil, big, bad baddie I am?

471
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:56,646
Just tell me this,
do you have other copies or not?

472
00:30:57,103 --> 00:30:59,754
You know what?
I'm sick of being bullied by you.

473
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:02,444
And Naomi, she deserves
to know the truth.

474
00:31:03,007 --> 00:31:06,425
Please. That girl doesn't know
anything about anything,

475
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,140
and she never will.

476
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:10,827
That's one of the most charming
qualities about my sister:

477
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:13,663
her... naiveté.

478
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,791
Well, I have to say,
I love my new hat,

479
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,197
and my necklace and my scarf.

480
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:22,797
Obviously, our Mr. Secret Admirer
has great taste in accessories.

481
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,197
And in women.

482
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:28,408
Oh, my gosh.
It's so romantic.

483
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,611
He asked that you wait for him here.

484
00:31:31,662 --> 00:31:32,662
Good luck.

485
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:33,829
Of course.

486
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,292
Either you have
another copy of the recording

487
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,668
or you don't.

488
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:03,346
There's only one way to find out.

489
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,759
I'll take that as a no.

490
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:12,767
- Screw you!
- Is your temper flaring?

491
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:16,327
Should I call your mom?
Ooh, or maybe your step-dad.

492
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:18,862
- He'd know what to do.
- I'm not giving up, you know.

493
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:20,908
Not until Naomi knows the truth.

494
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:22,681
How you lied to me that night.

495
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:25,944
You turned me against her and
got me to have sex with you.

496
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,364
Look, if it makes you feel better,
it's not like I enjoyed it.

497
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,866
I've slept with
a lot of men, Liam, and

498
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,910
you were easily the most boring.

499
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,950
It was you?

500
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,135
- Naomi, I didn't...
- No, Jen, stop.

501
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:56,611
I don't ever want to see you again.

502
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:14,959
We did it, dudes!

503
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:17,954
Yeah! Nice.

504
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:19,642
That was great.

505
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:21,997
- You!
- Seriously, man, the scariest thing

506
00:33:22,164 --> 00:33:24,665
was trying to open this dang thing.
I was like, "Oh, my God."

507
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:27,229
- I didn't know.
- You wanted to use an umbrella.

508
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:30,548
An umbrella is cool.
An umbrella is Ocean's 11.

509
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:33,675
- We were all pretty damn Ocean's 11.
- We were, weren't we?

510
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:38,182
Nice.

511
00:33:48,186 --> 00:33:49,695
Can we get out of here, please?

512
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,712
Dixon just told me
something pretty messed up.

513
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:56,146
I don't want to believe it, but,
Did...

514
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,219
Did you have sex with
your sister's boyfriend?

515
00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:01,986
A high school student?

516
00:34:02,428 --> 00:34:04,918
These kids. They have it out for me.
They'll say...

517
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:07,019
Anything to...

518
00:34:12,939 --> 00:34:14,189
Yes, it's true.

519
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:16,304
I did some terrible things.

520
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:20,183
But that was before I met you, Ryan.

521
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:23,102
You have changed me, and you have...

522
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,480
Made me want to be a better person.

523
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:28,633
And if you would just
give me a chance to...

524
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
There she is.
The big winner.

525
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,237
Eduardo, hello.

526
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:37,617
I just wanted to congratulate you
on Continental Accent's big win today.

527
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,337
You made a great investment
when you bought that horse.

528
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:44,750
- I thought the horse was a gift.
- A gift she bought for herself.

529
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,686
You bought that horse
with Naomi's money, didn't you?

530
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,214
And she has no idea.

531
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,636
Well, I...
I'll be off now.

532
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,057
Ryan, please.

533
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,587
I thought that you said that
if I was honest with you,

534
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:07,054
then there was nothing I could do...

535
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:09,023
That would scare you off.

536
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:12,521
I was wrong.

537
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:26,785
What kind of sister...
What kind of person...

538
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:30,496
I don't... I don't know. I...

539
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,883
You got me, okay?
I'm here for you.

540
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:41,021
- Whatever you need, I'm here.
- Thank you.

541
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:44,739
Oh, my God. Liam.

542
00:35:46,372 --> 00:35:47,937
I have to talk to Liam.

543
00:35:49,511 --> 00:35:50,511
Okay.

544
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,980
Dude, we did it!
I told you.

545
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:20,719
Pure genius.

546
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:24,273
Why aren't you happy?

547
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:27,275
How can I be happy
when Naomi is so...

548
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:29,122
Unhappy?

549
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:33,233
The look on her face.

550
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,200
I don't think it was worth it.

551
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:37,489
Come on.
You proved your innocence.

552
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:40,291
You, like, vanquished
your archnemesis.

553
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,493
- You must be kind of relieved.
- Yeah, I am a little relieved.

554
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,041
Yeah. You know what?

555
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:52,752
I'm sorry. I never even thanked you
for your help. You were great.

556
00:36:53,124 --> 00:36:55,546
It's not like I had
anything better to do.

557
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:10,603
We're in public. What happened
to keeping things on the down-low?

558
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,953
Don't worry about it.
It's not like anybody saw us.

559
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:26,410
So, how was your study group?

560
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,912
What? Fine.

561
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:33,042
I found this in your room when
I was bringing up your laundry.

562
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:36,236
You went to your study group
without your textbook?

563
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,925
Hey, you guys found my chem book?

564
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,802
Wait, that's... yours?

565
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:45,862
Did I leave this in here?

566
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:48,266
Man, I was looking
everywhere for this.

567
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:51,018
Thanks, guys.

568
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,526
Thanks.

569
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:01,897
You didn't have to do that.

570
00:38:04,754 --> 00:38:05,793
Yes, I did.

571
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,132
Annie, I owed you.
I screwed up.

572
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:12,074
And I should have
apologized a while ago,

573
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:14,133
but we were fighting and...

574
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,217
Look, anyway, I'm sorry.

575
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,034
I should have believed you when
you told me that you and Liam didn't,

576
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:24,151
you know...

577
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:27,269
So, why do you believe me now?

578
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:29,053
'Cause Liam told us who it was.

579
00:38:30,114 --> 00:38:31,120
That night

580
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:34,656
Liam he had sex
with Naomi's sister Jen.

581
00:38:35,592 --> 00:38:36,786
What?!

582
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,234
- Her own sister?
- Right?

583
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:47,663
I mean, I don't get it.
How can siblings get so messed up?

584
00:38:57,832 --> 00:39:00,006
So, when did you get the turntables?

585
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:01,200
Those?

586
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:05,119
A couple months ago.

587
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:11,143
I guess I haven't spent
that much time in here.

588
00:39:11,972 --> 00:39:13,624
At all.

589
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:20,312
Well, whenever you want
to hang out, or...

590
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:22,868
Even just talk,

591
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:24,667
I'm here.

592
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,407
So am I.

593
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:48,105
I lost the person
I loved most in this world.

594
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,724
Now all I have is a stupid horse.

595
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:53,976
A stupid horse and me.

596
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:59,245
Okay, I'm going to go
in the house and get

597
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,658
every high-calorie,
sugary, carby food

598
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:04,487
that Kelly has in there, okay?

599
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:07,329
We need comfort food, stat.

600
00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:27,883
It's Naomi.

601
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:31,281
Please call me back.

602
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,121
I owe you a really big apology.

603
00:40:36,973 --> 00:40:38,797
I'm so sorry, Annie.

604
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,811
Oh, dude. You're really
going to town?

605
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:47,335
When you're talented,
you're talented.

606
00:40:47,502 --> 00:40:50,374
Okay, so tell me more.
Who'd you guys get to, be the waiter?

607
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:53,253
This actor kid Trevor.
He's in one of Teddy's dad's movies.

608
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,789
He did this hilarious British
accent, right, Liam?

609
00:40:57,661 --> 00:40:59,015
Yeah, it was pretty funny.

610
00:40:59,182 --> 00:41:02,419
Hey, I know...
why don't we get burgers?

611
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,381
In-N-Out or Fatburger?
Invalid's call.

612
00:41:07,287 --> 00:41:09,770
- Dude, I'm in the hospital.
- So? We'll just...

613
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:12,495
We'll slip these puppies
on and we'll sneak you out.

614
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:15,620
Genius-style.
