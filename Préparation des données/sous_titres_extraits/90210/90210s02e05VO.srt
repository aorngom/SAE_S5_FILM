1
00:00:00,629 --> 00:00:02,581
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,087
What do you do for a living?

3
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:07,849
- I'm in the music business.
- Who is that white woman,

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:11,256
and why is she hugging
your boyfriend?

5
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:15,661
You know that homeless guy
that was killed?

6
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:17,509
His nephew goes here.
That's him.

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,493
Jasper, wait.
I'll go for a ride with you.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,536
- You will?
- Naomi is your sister?

9
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:25,312
Naomi will never
believe that we slept together.

10
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:31,730
We've waited long enough.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,940
Hey, Janine!

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,205
Hey, Jordan, my man!

13
00:00:48,158 --> 00:00:50,252
Cool kicks, Alisa.

14
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,222
And, Natalie, way to work
that Bunsen burner in lab.

15
00:00:58,838 --> 00:00:59,790
Hey, man.

16
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:03,123
Mr. Wong just slammed me
with all kinds of homework.

17
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:07,120
That was not funny.

18
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:10,450
I was just thinking about something
Adrianna said to me last night,

19
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:12,490
after we did it.

20
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,361
Right. Of course.

21
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:18,902
Hey, what's the word?
You guys have a good weekend?

22
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:22,290
- I have a way to get Naomi back.
- You serious?

23
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:23,313
How?

24
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:27,120
- Come on.
- He doesn't want to talk about it,

25
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,002
Leave him alone.
My weekend was pretty awesome, too.

26
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:31,561
- How come?
- No reason.

27
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:33,292
Why, do I seem different?

28
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:37,502
Homeboy finally got laid.

29
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:40,892
What's up with that?
I was trying to keep it on the down low.

30
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:44,953
But since the cat's out of the bag,
it's true. This guy no longer a virgin.

31
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,891
Finally talked Ade into it.

32
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:51,141
I didn't have to talk her
into anything.

33
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:54,273
She came back from Beach Club,
and she couldn't keep her hands off me.

34
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,313
She showed up all,
"I want you, Navid."

35
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,363
So I gave the girl what she wants.

36
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:01,133
- Gave her what she wants!
- Put your hand down.

37
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:03,832
- You've reached your high five limit.
- Really?

38
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,621
You know what?
We should go on a double date.

39
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:11,373
You and Ade and me and this
little hottie from English class,

40
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,713
Jasmine Lotan.
You guys know her?

41
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,460
She's cute.

42
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:18,290
- You guys dating?
- We will be once I ask her out.

43
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,802
But seriously, it would be
cool to double with you and Ade.

44
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,051
Show Jasmine I'm friends
with respectable couples.

45
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:25,763
Sure, that sounds fun.

46
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,643
Great. A lot of fun.

47
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:32,890
What color is that?
I love it.

48
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,592
It's called Dulce de Leche.

49
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,850
I'll get that, too.

50
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,693
I've never been here before,

51
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:43,953
Are they any good?

52
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:47,071
Actually, this is my first time
here, too.

53
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:50,102
- We just moved nearby.
- "We"?

54
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:52,910
As in you and your boyfriend?

55
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:56,293
Yeah, right.
Me and my husband.

56
00:02:58,507 --> 00:02:59,542
You're married.

57
00:03:01,758 --> 00:03:02,922
Of course.

58
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,001
How long you been married?

59
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:08,941
19 years.

60
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:13,681
- 19 years?
- I know. It's a long time.

61
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:17,403
And I wouldn't believe it myself, except
my kids are juniors in high school.

62
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:19,773
I'm such a mom,
I actually have pictures.

63
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:22,071
I don't suppose
you want to see them.

64
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:24,111
Sure, why not?

65
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:27,472
Here we go.

66
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,803
This is my daughter, Annie.

67
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:31,960
And this...

68
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:34,523
is my son, Dixon.

69
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:39,791
College is a big decision.

70
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,920
As a junior, you've already started
thinking about where you want to go.

71
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:46,593
Right?

72
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,141
Right. Exactly.

73
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:51,913
I was gonna do you a
favor and save you some time

74
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:55,231
so you can focus on those kids
in wood shop or read fashion magazines.

75
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:58,330
I'll be going
to California University.

76
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,681
- CU is certainly a great school.
- It's more than great.

77
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,230
It's perfect, it's beautiful.

78
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,492
It's where my grandfather went.
He took me there.

79
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:08,701
It's just like being
on those east coast campuses

80
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:11,793
except the weather's great and
the people are good-looking.

81
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:14,290
It's definitely important
to know what you like,

82
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:18,161
- but you need to think about...
- I have thought about everything.

83
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,130
I know exactly how my four
years at CU will play out.

84
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:24,860
Freshman year, I'll pledge Pi Phi
no matter how much the DGs beg.

85
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:27,362
And then sophomore year,

86
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:29,772
that is when I'll find my Mr. Clark.

87
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:33,352
He'll be a Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
He'll probably play football...

88
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:37,732
CU isn't going to happen.

89
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:41,551
What do you mean?

90
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:44,153
Your test scores
aren't what they require.

91
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,530
Neither are your grades.

92
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:48,483
And you have
no extracurricular activities.

93
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,491
But I love it there.

94
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,492
And I'm a legacy.

95
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:55,412
I'm afraid that's not going
to be enough.

96
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,511
However, if you want to stay nearby,
there are plenty of other schools

97
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,052
that are within your reach.

98
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:04,782
Places like Santa Monica
Community College.

99
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:42,763
"We're all in the gutter,

100
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:45,182
but some of us are
looking at the stars."

101
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,132
It's Oscar Wilde.

102
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,480
Had a really good time
the other night.

103
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,373
- Stargazing.
- Me, too.

104
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,540
You got any plans after school?

105
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:57,603
Thought I'd hit Chinatown.
There's this dim sum place,

106
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,723
my uncle used to take me there.

107
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:02,311
I'd just really like to
get back there.

108
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:03,731
In his memory.

109
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,691
Sure, I will come with you.

110
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:16,231
This is the best meeting.

111
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:17,883
There are a lot of celebrities.

112
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,813
Can't tell you who they are because,

113
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:23,143
it's anonymous, but let's
just say say last time I was here,

114
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,442
there was someone that rhymes
with Ritney Rears.

115
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,290
They also have the best donuts.
None of that powdered sugar.

116
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:30,302
I've seen actual fritters.

117
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:33,010
But today is about you
and your accomplishments.

118
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:35,151
Six months sober, that's a big deal.

119
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:37,940
Thank you so much for coming to support.
It means so much.

120
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,133
Of course. We would not
miss it for the world.

121
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,453
- Let's go get some fritters.
- No, you stay. I'm gonna go.

122
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:47,191
Just in case you need muscle
to get to the front of the line.

123
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,861
You know how proud I am of you?

124
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:50,583
Yes, I do.

125
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:54,570
- He's so sweet, right?
- Yeah, he is.

126
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:57,410
You're lucky to have such
a great boyfriend.

127
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,201
I know. I am.

128
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:01,450
Really lucky.

129
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:03,621
I agree.

130
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,023
Here you go.
One apple, one pear.

131
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:10,181
- Thank you, sweetie.
- I'm gonna find us some seats.

132
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:14,300
Oh, my God.

133
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,990
- I have to go.
- Why?

134
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:19,162
I'm sorry.
I'll call you later.

135
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:21,182
What happened?
Who is that woman?

136
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:26,510
Silver's mom.

137
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:55,843
Go away and don't come back.

138
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,283
- Why?
- Why?

139
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:02,291
Because you're a junior
in high school, that's why!

140
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:03,260
How...?

141
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,351
How did you...?

142
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:09,153
- I can explain.
- Explain what? That you're not 17?

143
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:12,270
- I am, but...
- But what?

144
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,820
I feel like such a fool.

145
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,865
I cannot believe I
was actually falling

146
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,352
for a high school kid.

147
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:21,161
Stay away from me.

148
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,513
I'm serious. Just stay away.

149
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:36,671
Peach Pit Team

S02E05
Environmental haszrds

151
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:12,263
- You forgot your fritter.
- Come on in.

152
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:13,363
Thanks.

153
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,483
I'm sorry I left the meeting.

154
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:18,510
I just couldn't deal.

155
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,513
I totally get it.

156
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:24,883
Your mom got a chip tonight.

157
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,470
30 days sober.

158
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:27,983
Good for her.

159
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:32,232
She talked to me after.

160
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,900
Said she really wants to see you.

161
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,152
She's changed.

162
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:39,570
Like I haven't heard that before.

163
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:42,200
I know. I'm just saying,

164
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,532
she seems really different.

165
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,241
She's an addict.

166
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:50,221
And once addicts sober up,
they become different people.

167
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:54,133
When I think about
what I used to be like:

168
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:57,673
so sneaky, manipulative,

169
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:00,381
- a liar...
- And you changed?

170
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,470
Really?

171
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,221
What's that supposed to mean?

172
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:09,512
Nothing. Just forget it.

173
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:11,852
You obviously meant something.
What is it?

174
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:14,440
What?

175
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,362
I saw you kiss Teddy.

176
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,161
I made a mistake.

177
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:30,951
Please don't tell Navid.

178
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,540
I'm not going to.
But you should.

179
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:39,380
These things,
they don't just go away.

180
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,263
You think that they will,
you want them to, but they don't.

181
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:43,643
Trust me.

182
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:45,681
Look at what the kiss
with Ethan did.

183
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:47,551
That was a different situation.

184
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:49,262
- No...
- Yes, it was.

185
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:52,062
You were confused, you didn't
even know who you liked.

186
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:54,140
Me, I'm not confused.

187
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:55,143
I...

188
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,263
made a mistake,

189
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:59,443
and move on,
pretend like it didn't happen.

190
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:01,231
It's not going to work.

191
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,721
It's really none of your business.

192
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:07,070
Maybe you should
just stay out of it.

193
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:19,382
Joseph Campbell got the term
"monomyth" from Joyce.

194
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:22,210
He also called it
"The Hero's Journey."

195
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:25,590
Who are some heroes
that have famous monomyths?

196
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:28,153
There's Buddha, there's Moses,

197
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:29,143
Christ,

198
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:30,933
Luke Skywalker,

199
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:32,381
Ryan Matthews.

200
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,283
I just got this phone.
Have you downloaded the beat app yet?

201
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,603
- Give it back.
- Let me show you how to get to it.

202
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,902
Don't touch anything.
Just give it back.

203
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:43,401
I'll take the phone.

204
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,512
No, I'll just put it away.

205
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,953
Give it to me.
You'll get it back at the end of class.

206
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:50,120
Come on, that's not fair.

207
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:52,051
Write about it.

208
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,952
Your own personal monomyth.

209
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,262
Why are you wearing sweatpants?

210
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:16,460
Are you okay?

211
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:20,122
Since I'm not going to CU, I'll probably
end up working at a fast-food joint,

212
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:22,393
so might as well dress the part.

213
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,483
You're mad at me,

214
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:31,451
but we have a much bigger problem.

215
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:35,291
Oh, my God.
Naomi's wearing sweats?

216
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:36,700
What?

217
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:38,300
I don't know.

218
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:46,513
- Can I have my...?
- I wanted to talk about your paper.

219
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,062
What's the problem with it?

220
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,681
There is no problem.
It's great.

221
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:56,891
The L.A. Times is sponsoring
a essay contest and you should enter.

222
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:01,882
- I made suggestions for revision...
- Do I have to enter?

223
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:06,152
- You don't have to.
- Cool. Then I'll pass.

224
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,722
Can I just have my phone?

225
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,680
I don't get you, Liam.
You're a smart kid.

226
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,481
- Is it not cool to care?
- Find another special project,

227
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:17,201
'cause it's not going to be me.
Just give me back my phone.

228
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:19,041
"Give me back my phone"?

229
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:22,532
Sorry. Give me back my phone,
please.

230
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,010
Absolutely.
At the end of the day.

231
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:26,570
What!

232
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:29,261
Looks like I found
something you care about.

233
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,613
Sure you don't want
to even up the teams?

234
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:39,481
- You against me?
- You want to break?

235
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:41,981
I just can't believe
it's over between us.

236
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:45,481
- I'll just break.
- You know what's gonna help?

237
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:47,271
Death?

238
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:51,181
That or this super hot chick
from my history class.

239
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:54,011
She might not be a cool deejay
with an unbelievable amount

240
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,802
of sports knowledge, but she
does have some really nice,

241
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:58,291
curves.

242
00:14:02,497 --> 00:14:03,412
Nice.

243
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:07,840
Honestly, guys, I can't accept
that's the last time I'm gonna see her.

244
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,750
And I know Sasha's going through it,
too. I know she's torn up.

245
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:14,843
She told me she was starting
to fall for me.

246
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:17,852
Really? 'Cause if she said that,
you've still got a chance.

247
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:19,723
He doesn't.

248
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,521
Sorry, but you don't.

249
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:24,490
Sure he does...
it's like me and Naomi.

250
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,480
Right, like that mysterious
plan you haven't implemented yet?

251
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:31,150
Technical difficulties. The point is,
if you like someone and they like you,

252
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:32,740
there's a way around obstacles.

253
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:35,691
Like if Dixon went into
a rapid aging machine.

254
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,661
- What's your problem?
- I don't want you to get your hopes up.

255
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,162
- She's done.
- Why not give it another shot?

256
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,583
What's he got to lose?

257
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,362
I mean, what do I have to lose?

258
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:58,110
Did you guys just drag me
here for lunch to torture me?

259
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:01,501
I should be getting used to
double-beef burgers and the fryolator.

260
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:03,961
We are not torturing you.

261
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,703
We are inspiring you.

262
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,443
This is your dream.

263
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:11,061
Come on, how many times
have you done pilates

264
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,070
- to the CU fight song?
- Who cares. I'm done with it forever.

265
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:17,362
Why, because some jaded college
counselor said you won't get in here?

266
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:19,301
Come on you are not a quitter.

267
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,452
When have you ever
taken no for an answer?

268
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,352
This morning, at the coffee shop.
They were out of soy.

269
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:27,221
You should have made them get more.

270
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:28,970
Because that's who you are.

271
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:32,532
Remember at Hermès when they
were all sold out of the Birkin bag?

272
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:36,132
- What'd you do?
- I called the regional manager,

273
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:37,972
demanded they have
the salesgirl fired.

274
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:39,122
Exactly.

275
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:40,432
And then what happened?

276
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:43,183
- They tracked down the bag.
- And?

277
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:45,871
And I bought two...

278
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,400
the blue calfskin,
the brown crocodile.

279
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:50,360
Right, because you are Naomi Clark.

280
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:53,191
When somebody says you can't
have something, you get them fired.

281
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:55,432
Which, for the record,
I do have a problem with,

282
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,710
but you don't, so it doesn't matter.

283
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:00,701
You go after what you want
and you don't take no for an answer.

284
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:02,732
What the...?!

285
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:04,703
Sorry about that.

286
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,002
You have a good arm.

287
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:19,402
You're right.
You're right!

288
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:22,172
I'm not going to let
some college counselor,

289
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:25,211
who wears an ankle bracelet
under her stockings, get in my way.

290
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,821
I just have to find a way
to get into CU.

291
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:28,901
And I will.

292
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,652
That's what we wanna hear.

293
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,243
Oh, my God!

294
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:35,190
I'm wearing sweatpants!

295
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:54,920
The only thing that would
make me happier

296
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:57,970
is if you had a refrigerator
right by your bed.

297
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,203
With a pot roast inside.

298
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:03,943
I'm so famished.

299
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,182
But I'm thinking more like

300
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:08,100
fried chicken and waffles.

301
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,303
I forgot to tell you.

302
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:16,433
Say you have Roscoe's in your book bag,
and all is forgiven.

303
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,321
No, but it is about food.

304
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,460
It's about dinner actually.

305
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,492
Teddy asked us to double
date with him and some chick.

306
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:25,660
What? No.

307
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:29,041
I don't want to double date.

308
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:30,291
Why not?

309
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,372
Because...

310
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:35,552
I would rather
just be with you alone.

311
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:38,210
Me, too, but he already asked.

312
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:40,223
So just say no.

313
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:42,802
I already told him yes.
He wants to impress a girl.

314
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,562
He asked me for a favor.
It's one night. What's the big deal?

315
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:51,240
Fine.

316
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:01,401
What are you doing?

317
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:08,071
You were supposed to give me back
my phone, but you weren't here, so...

318
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:11,410
So you just started
going through my desk?

319
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:14,082
I got important stuff on it.
That can't get erased.

320
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:17,633
You just got yourself
a week's detention. Move.

321
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:21,013
That is so unfair.

322
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:23,952
I wouldn't have had to go through
your desk If you'd been here...

323
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:26,280
You didn't have to do anything.

324
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:28,351
You shouldn't have taken my phone.

325
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:31,403
- Let's make it ten days of detention.
- What is this about?

326
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,731
- Is this about your stupid contest?
- Excuse me?

327
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:37,232
- Why are you being such an a...?
- That's it.

328
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:40,981
I am sick of your attitude problem.
Your parents told the school to call

329
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,862
- if we had any problems with you.
- Wait, what?

330
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:47,533
And this qualifies. So we're
all going to have a little sit-down.

331
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:51,662
- I'll take the detention.
- I'm sorry.

332
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:53,041
It's too late.

333
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:56,352
You don't understand.
My stepdad is a jerk.

334
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,380
Everybody's a jerk.
Your stepdad, me.

335
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:01,342
I got a thought for you.
Maybe we're not the problem.

336
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,722
Maybe it's you.

337
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:14,480
Hey, you.
What's going on?

338
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:17,540
What does it look like?
I'm studying to get into CU.

339
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,061
That's awesome.

340
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:20,282
Little known fact,

341
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:22,730
huge corollary between studying
and raising your grades.

342
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:24,400
Who said anything about grades?

343
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:28,023
I did a little research
on the Dean of Admissions.

344
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:30,851
Her son goes to CU.
He's an S.A.T. tutor.

345
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:32,530
- So I hired him.
- Cool.

346
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,460
You're going to focus on the SATs?

347
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:37,692
I'm gonna date the Dean's son.
Honestly, Silver, try to keep up.

348
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:40,381
Once we start dating,

349
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:44,123
Well, he'll take me home to Mom...
naturally I'll charm her instantly.

350
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,101
Eventually, dear Richard and I
will part amicably,

351
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:50,313
but not before the Dean and I
have forged a lasting bond.

352
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:54,493
The type of bond that will guarantee me
a place at CU in the fall of 2011.

353
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:59,610
Don't you think it's just a little bit
easier to... I don't know... study?

354
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:01,851
The key to success is knowing
one's strengths.

355
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:05,122
I am terrible at tests.
But I'm an excellent dater.

356
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,911
Unfortunately, Richard
is a bit of a snooze-fest.

357
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:11,121
His Facebook says he's some
super environmentalist.

358
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,352
So I have to read
all these global warming books

359
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:15,452
to make him think
we have stuff in common.

360
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,590
Easy on the pours.
Seriously, we're in a drought here.

361
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:24,632
What do you think? Sounds like
I care about the environment, right?

362
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:38,292
Please, listen, just hear me out.

363
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,861
All right, and afterwards
if you want me to get lost,

364
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:43,440
I'll get lost. Forever.

365
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,453
I bought you a pizza.

366
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:56,473
'Cause when we met at the pizza parlor
we didn't know each other's ages.

367
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,760
All we knew
was that we liked each other.

368
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:02,372
And yes, when I found out
that you were older,

369
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:03,872
I lied.

370
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:07,622
Which was a really,
really stupid thing to do.

371
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:10,831
The only reason why I lied,

372
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,381
was because I couldn't believe

373
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:17,360
that a girl as cool,
as down-to-earth...

374
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:20,870
and as beautiful as you existed.

375
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,442
But you want to know something?

376
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,641
Although I feel terrible
about lying,

377
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm actually glad I did.

378
00:21:28,857 --> 00:21:31,210
Because if I would have
told you I was 17,

379
00:21:31,518 --> 00:21:33,160
you would have never
gone out with me.

380
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:35,911
So yes, I lied about my age,

381
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,430
but all the things
that we talked about,

382
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:39,670
everything,

383
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:42,243
all the stuff about
how I was feeling,

384
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:44,213
how you were feeling,

385
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:46,050
none of that was a lie.

386
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:47,802
So I'm here because

387
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:50,351
I'm hoping maybe we can start over.

388
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:54,132
No more lies.

389
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:57,000
Just you and me...

390
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:01,233
and half sausage, half pepperoni.

391
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:03,773
Get lost.

392
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:27,551
"Please come to the meeting tonight.
I'm speaking.

393
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:29,802
I really want to
make things right with us.

394
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:31,501
Love, Mom."

395
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:35,823
Right on the dashboard?

396
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:40,823
So, are you gonna go?

397
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:44,692
I have no idea.

398
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:48,602
You haven't seen Metropolis?

399
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,390
That's even more egregious

400
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:52,620
than your lack of experience
with Dim Sum.

401
00:22:53,116 --> 00:22:55,043
Don't I get credit
for trying chicken feet?

402
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,153
I popped back, like,
three of those suckers.

403
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,813
You're right. Credit gained.

404
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:00,622
And then it's deducted

405
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:03,550
for your staggering
cinematic naivete.

406
00:23:03,678 --> 00:23:07,673
And no, Annie, I'm sorry,
but Kansas, it's not an excuse.

407
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:09,511
You've lived in L.A.
for, like, a year.

408
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:12,270
I guess I've been hanging out
in the wrong scene.

409
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:13,760
Yeah, no kidding.

410
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:17,173
It's gonna blow your mind, Metropolis.
It's huge. It's all about

411
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:18,940
man versus society.

412
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,693
Big influence
on the movie I'm making.

413
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:23,013
You're making a movie?

414
00:23:23,388 --> 00:23:25,513
Half narrative, half documentary,

415
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:28,770
half really just sick
experimental stuff.

416
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,943
Think like, Matthew Barney
meets, Michael Moore.

417
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:33,050
Cool.

418
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:35,841
Actually there's,

419
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:39,443
there's a band playing tonight,
The Script.

420
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:41,922
Thought I might use them
for part of my score. Do you...

421
00:23:42,478 --> 00:23:43,501
want to come?

422
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:45,922
- Where are they playing?
- The Beach Club.

423
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:50,761
I will pass. Most of the people
I hate hang out there, so...

424
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:54,310
What if I guaranteed you wouldn't
have to see any of them?

425
00:23:55,105 --> 00:23:56,223
Then would you go?

426
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:28,841
- Are you Richard?
- Naomi, hi.

427
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:31,092
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

428
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:34,172
They really should repaint
the bike lanes by the Shrine.

429
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:38,843
You rode your bike here
from Beverly Hills?

430
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,640
Just doing what I can to
reduce my carbon footprint.

431
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:44,902
That's impressive.

432
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:46,403
No, stop.

433
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,690
No, seriously, I feel
like I'm surrounded by people

434
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,882
who don't care about
the Earth. They just

435
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:52,870
guzzle water
from plastic water bottles...

436
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,990
How do they sleep at night?

437
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,571
No idea.
You know what, I wish

438
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,101
we could put pictures
of choking dolphins on the bottles.

439
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:02,902
I think maybe then they'd think
twice about using them.

440
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:05,003
Choking dolphins would be awesome.

441
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,802
Before we get started with vocab,
do you know

442
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,132
where the Independent Theater
is around here?

443
00:25:13,265 --> 00:25:14,912
I heard there's a showing of <i>FLOW,</i>

444
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,523
and I just wanted to see
if I could catch it later tonight.

445
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:19,050
<i>FLOW</i> as in <i>For Love Of Water?</i>

446
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:24,412
I tried catching the re-release
last night, but they were sold out.

447
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,960
Rumor has it that you'll never
view water politics the same way again.

448
00:25:28,086 --> 00:25:29,581
Well, hey, you should come.

449
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:32,001
I mean, I have another ticket.

450
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:37,800
You know, I'm your tutor.
I'm not sure that's appropriate.

451
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:40,420
Come on, it's not a date.

452
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:43,502
It's just two like-minded
individuals going to see a film

453
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,602
about something they're
passionate about.

454
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:47,711
Plus, I hear it's
kind of one of those flicks

455
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,573
you've got to see on the big screen.
Kind of like <i>The Dark Knight.</i>

456
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:54,791
God, you're tempting me.

457
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:58,840
Yeah, you know, what the hell.
It's just one movie.

458
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:00,641
Great.

459
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:02,232
Vocab.

460
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:13,871
- Sorry we're late.
- Hey, no worries.

461
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:16,301
- How are you, buddy?
- Good, man, how you doing?

462
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:18,133
What, no hug?

463
00:26:18,847 --> 00:26:19,953
Oh, of course.

464
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:22,731
Guys, this is Jasmine.

465
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:24,172
Jasmine, this is...

466
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:25,750
Hey, I'm Adrianna.

467
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,870
And Navid.

468
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:28,283
Have a seat.

469
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,661
Jazz... just moved to L.A.
from Kauai.

470
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,571
No kidding. Sweet.

471
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:42,723
Ade, you went there once, right?
With your mom?

472
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:45,641
- Yeah, a long time ago.
- Yeah, I remember.

473
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:49,321
When she came back,
she would not take off her lei.

474
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:51,520
I'm telling you,
this thing was not only wilting,

475
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,311
but it was actually
starting to stink.

476
00:26:54,617 --> 00:26:57,242
You know, my family actually vacations
In Kauai every Christmas.

477
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:58,873
Right on. Whereabouts?

478
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:01,252
North Shore. It's like,
one of the most beautiful...

479
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:03,280
I'm starving!
Should we look at the menu?

480
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,250
Sure.

481
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:09,911
Hey, honey, do you want
to order two dishes and split?

482
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:11,711
Yeah, sounds good.

483
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:14,300
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

484
00:27:14,785 --> 00:27:17,983
I think I'll have an iced tea.
No, make that an Arnold Palmer.

485
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:20,310
I'm good with water.

486
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:22,540
I think we're all good for water.

487
00:27:23,157 --> 00:27:24,252
Okay, great.

488
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:26,993
- Oh, babe.
- Oh, my God...

489
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:29,100
I got it. Don't worry about it.

490
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,611
I am very impressed, Liam.

491
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,921
It only took a month for us
to get called into school.

492
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:43,270
You held it together a whole lot longer
than I thought you would.

493
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:45,241
Sweetheart, I know
this is tough for you

494
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,600
but we had an agreement.

495
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:48,643
- If he screwed up one more time...
- I know,

496
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:50,271
Sweetheart, we gave him a shot.

497
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:53,220
We let him move back
into the house, but obviously

498
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:54,412
it's not working.

499
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:57,182
Some kids are just
bad seeds, you know?

500
00:27:57,306 --> 00:27:58,440
Liam is one of those.

501
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:07,052
Jeffrey Sarkossian.
This is my wife, Colleen.

502
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,772
Ryan Matthews. Nice to meet you.

503
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,850
Look, I wanted to apologize

504
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:14,583
ahead of time for whatever
trouble Liam got himself into.

505
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:15,912
Trouble?

506
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:19,063
Liam hasn't gotten into any trouble.

507
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:23,241
Listen, the reason I called you both
down here was to tell you in person

508
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:26,172
how great Liam's been doing.

509
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:29,420
His first paper was terrific.

510
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,121
It was insightful, well structured,
beautifully written.

511
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:34,711
Oh, honey.

512
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:36,670
You should be very proud of him.

513
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,642
Okay, everyone, welcome.

514
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,813
My name is Tim,
and I'm an alcoholic.

515
00:28:58,158 --> 00:28:59,552
Hi, Tim.

516
00:29:02,838 --> 00:29:04,132
Sorry, I'm late.

517
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:08,270
So...

518
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,082
what you did...

519
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:12,942
that was cool.

520
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:17,003
The ten days of detention
still stand.

521
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:19,210
Yeah, okay.

522
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:23,960
Your phone.

523
00:29:27,456 --> 00:29:28,302
Thanks.

524
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:35,182
That essay contest thing.

525
00:29:37,428 --> 00:29:38,852
Did I miss the deadline?

526
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:41,220
Nope.

527
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:43,172
Three days left.

528
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:46,012
Cool.

529
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:55,372
So I hiked the waterfall.

530
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:58,270
Of course, I thought it was
three miles instead of nine.

531
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:01,002
And I ran out of water, and...
I vomited.

532
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:06,593
I gotta go to the ladies' room.
I'll be right back.

533
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:08,111
Okay, sure, babe.

534
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:12,162
Do you want to try
any French onion soup?

535
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:27,503
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you talking about?

536
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,770
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

537
00:30:29,905 --> 00:30:32,440
Why would you ask Navid and I
on a double date?

538
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:34,312
Just thought it'd be fun.

539
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:35,902
Yeah, right.

540
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:39,270
And you had to make out with Jasmine
right in front of me. Really?

541
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:42,383
I'm sorry. Did that bother you?
It's interesting because

542
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:44,303
- you know what bothered me?
- What?

543
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,860
Having to listen to Navid
brag about having sex with you

544
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:48,512
right after we kissed.

545
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,742
So this is about getting revenge?

546
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:54,601
What do you care who I make out with?
You've got a boyfriend, remember?

547
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:57,313
I know I have a boyfriend.
I don't need you to remind me.

548
00:30:57,487 --> 00:30:58,952
So why are you acting so jealous?

549
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:01,480
I'm not acting jealous!
It's just really annoying

550
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:04,303
because I know that
you're trying to make me jealous.

551
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:06,333
So what if I am?

552
00:31:07,046 --> 00:31:10,592
- It's obviously working.
- It's not working. It's pathetic.

553
00:31:11,626 --> 00:31:14,472
Okay, you know what?
I really could care less.

554
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:17,503
- Kiss whoever you want.
- Okay fine.

555
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:18,630
Fine.

556
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,902
You shouldn't have done that.

557
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:43,020
I'm sorry you're not feeling good.

558
00:31:43,355 --> 00:31:46,950
- You still want me to come over?
- No, I just need to sleep.

559
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,903
Sure everything's okay?

560
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:52,603
Everything's fine.

561
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:55,242
Am I not allowed to have a headache?

562
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:57,103
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

563
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:12,550
You look like you're lost.

564
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:18,213
I'm looking for Reed Tower.

565
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:20,680
I'm going that way. Come on.

566
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:22,842
Thank you.

567
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:24,571
I'm Jamie, by the way.

568
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,322
I take it you don't go here?

569
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:29,121
No, I'm going to apply.

570
00:32:29,258 --> 00:32:31,071
Yeah, you should, it's the best.

571
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:34,071
And you, you are a Pi Phi
waiting to happen.

572
00:32:35,765 --> 00:32:37,373
So, you're psychic?

573
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:40,291
Psychic, SAE pledge...
same thing.

574
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,570
Yeah, we... know things.

575
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:44,521
Like what?

576
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:46,031
Like...

577
00:32:46,996 --> 00:32:49,591
I know when I see someone
I have to meet.

578
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:53,173
Why do you think I threw
my football at you yesterday?

579
00:32:53,478 --> 00:32:55,332
What, you thought
that was an accident?

580
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,072
No, my arm is pretty damn accurate.

581
00:32:57,206 --> 00:33:00,850
Don't think I would've made it
on the football team otherwise.

582
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,620
So, you're on the team.

583
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:07,602
Would you want to come
to a game sometime?

584
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:10,343
There you are.
I was afraid you got lost.

585
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,901
I was actually just
asking for directions.

586
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:18,320
- Jamie, this is...
- My roommate Richard.

587
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:28,281
So, we should get going
if we want to catch the bus.

588
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:40,011
So, these guys are from Ireland?
Cool.

589
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:44,833
I'm sorry, man.
Just...

590
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:49,010
not really in the best mood. Hoping
that music gets my mind off Sasha.

591
00:33:49,588 --> 00:33:50,560
No problem.

592
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:53,482
- So, what do you want to drink?
- Whatever.

593
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:58,322
- What are you doing here?
- Look, I just came for the music.

594
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:00,121
I had no idea
you were going to be here.

595
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,182
The musicians are friends of mine.

596
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:03,833
Adult friends.

597
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:05,772
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:08,312
Let's go.

599
00:34:13,627 --> 00:34:15,023
You want to split?

600
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,580
So, thanks, everyone, for coming down.
We're The Script from Dublin,

601
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:21,753
and the song we're going to do
is called "We Cry."

602
00:34:22,297 --> 00:34:24,171
Let's just stay for the set,
you know?

603
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,392
- Then we'll bounce.
- All right.

604
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:04,533
Told you we could hear the music

605
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:07,651
- without seeing anyone you hate.
- It's perfect.

606
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:12,131
What?

607
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:16,140
Nothing. Nothing. Just...

608
00:35:17,975 --> 00:35:19,420
Thank you for this.

609
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:38,263
And I have let down...
so many people over the years

610
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:39,682
I've lost count.

611
00:35:40,797 --> 00:35:43,492
But the ones that I regret
hurting the most

612
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,750
are my children.

613
00:35:50,157 --> 00:35:52,101
I was such a terrible mother.

614
00:35:53,415 --> 00:35:55,653
Which is why I'm so grateful that...

615
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:58,462
one of my daughters is here tonight.

616
00:35:59,855 --> 00:36:01,201
Thank you, honey,

617
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:03,411
for giving me another chance.

618
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:08,490
I promise you,
I will not let you down again.

619
00:36:14,628 --> 00:36:16,381
I'd like to say
something, if I could.

620
00:36:16,518 --> 00:36:17,861
Go ahead. Please.

621
00:36:27,016 --> 00:36:30,681
I really wanted to be here tonight
so that I could tell my mother,

622
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:32,712
once and for all,

623
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,223
to stay away from me.

624
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,813
Everything that she said?

625
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:41,042
Trust me, it's going to last
until she's a bad day.

626
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:44,110
Then she's going
to go back to the bottle or,

627
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:47,043
the pills, whatever
she can get her hands on.

628
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:52,032
But you did get
one thing right, Jackie.

629
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:55,700
You were a terrible mother.

630
00:36:56,676 --> 00:37:01,171
The worst of the worst. And if you think
that you can buy me back with a car...

631
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:04,840
That's just proof
that you don't know me at all.

632
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:09,791
Stay away from me.
I mean it.

633
00:37:11,176 --> 00:37:12,472
You're dead to me.

634
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:36,492
Let's just go, man.

635
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:39,481
It's hard being
in the same room as her.

636
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:41,481
Yeah, it's cool.

637
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:46,263
Actually...

638
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,830
- give me ten minutes.
- When did she get here?

639
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:52,260
I don't know. But I got to act
while I got an opening.

640
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:54,342
Go do your thing, man.

641
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:20,582
- You already talked to her?
- There's nothing to talk about anymore.

642
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,703
I'm too late. She moved on.

643
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:25,603
Let's just get out of here.

644
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,262
Where are you going?

645
00:38:37,497 --> 00:38:40,091
That kiss wasn't appropriate
for a tutor.

646
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:43,513
I'm sorry. I know this is not
supposed to be a date.

647
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:45,822
I'm just having such a good time.

648
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:48,373
Me, too.

649
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:52,140
I got to say,
you really surprised me.

650
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:54,550
When I first heard "Beverly Hills,"
I thought, "Great.

651
00:38:54,678 --> 00:38:57,970
She's going to be about
clothes, and hair, and makeup."

652
00:38:59,446 --> 00:39:00,790
Man, was I wrong.

653
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:02,362
You're...

654
00:39:03,346 --> 00:39:05,041
pretty unique, you know?

655
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:06,852
You, too.

656
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,970
You must have pretty
inspiring parents.

657
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:12,603
What are they like, by the way?

658
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:13,770
My parents?

659
00:39:15,198 --> 00:39:17,570
Pretty normal.
My... dad's a radiologist.

660
00:39:17,707 --> 00:39:20,802
And my mom's actually
the Dean of Admissions at CU.

661
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:22,220
Really?

662
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,731
I had no idea.

663
00:39:33,448 --> 00:39:36,390
<i>Naomi will never believe
that we slept together.</i>

664
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:04,833
I really...

665
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:07,203
need to talk to you.

666
00:40:08,598 --> 00:40:10,793
And I'm sorry for the way I acted.

667
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:14,222
Call me back, okay?

668
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:25,410
Hello?

669
00:40:28,778 --> 00:40:30,661
This is the last time, okay?

670
00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:33,813
We're just saying good-bye.

671
00:40:40,426 --> 00:40:41,821
Ade, are you okay?

672
00:40:45,217 --> 00:40:46,811
Is it the Teddy thing?

673
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:48,900
It didn't go away, did it?

674
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,891
I mean yes, you were right,
it didn't.

675
00:40:52,957 --> 00:40:54,650
That's not why I'm here.

676
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,861
Silver, we're friends. Okay?
We have to stay in each other's lives.

677
00:41:00,996 --> 00:41:02,831
I know. I'm sorry that we fought.

678
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:04,451
Your mom called me.

679
00:41:05,657 --> 00:41:07,003
Ade, let it go.

680
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:09,511
She just wanted advice
on how to get through to you.

681
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:11,082
She shouldn't have bothered you.

682
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:12,960
No, you don't understand.

683
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:16,300
She told me something
you don't know.

684
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:20,510
Please. There's nothing that
that woman could tell you

685
00:41:20,636 --> 00:41:22,513
that will make me change my mind.

686
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,390
Our relationship is over.

687
00:41:26,576 --> 00:41:27,983
She has cancer, Silver.

688
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,021
Your mom is dying.
