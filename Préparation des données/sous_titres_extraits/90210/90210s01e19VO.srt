1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,450
previously on 90210:

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,460
We're in two different places.It's not
your fault.It's because we've grown apart.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,340
Let's end this.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,000
- Hey,naomi.
- See,that's not fair.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,000
You know my name,but I don't know yours.

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,180
Liam.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,580
- Liam's a psychopath  and an a
- you filmed us having sex?!

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,520
What's wrong with you?

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,570
I love you.

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,200
Silver,listen...

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,870
I don't know what's going on anymore.

12
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,400
You e the reason we are out
here looking for her right now.

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,890
She lives with you,kelly,not me,okay?

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,230
You're the one who's supposed
to be taking care of her.

15
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,270
Silver!

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,430
I know what you're going through.

17
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,400
My mom used to go through
the same type of thing.

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,470
Silver has bipolar
disorder,just like my birth mom.

19
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,380
Oh,so apparently they're going to
be re-carpeting the school library.

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,150
- Oh,yeah?
- They're going to be doing it over spring break.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,930
Spring break.Right.

22
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,400
I'm so outf it.

23
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,290
Is everybody psyched?

24
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,300
Yeah.Half of the senior class is gog to be
partying on jake olson's uncle's yacht in,

25
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,350
uh,in the greek isles.

26
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:09,550
Supposedly his uncle also invited keith
richards,uh,one of the pussycat dolls and...

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,000
cookie?

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,700
Um,sure.Thanks.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,010
You know,you can have a second if
you'd like,silver,they're low sugar.

30
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,180
No kidding.No,thanks.

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,910
So are there any underclassmen
going to this yacht shindig or...

32
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,160
you know what,can we change the subject,maybe talk
about something else a little less stimulating?

33
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,220
I'm sorry.I don't mean to be a drag.

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,150
It's just someone with bipolar
disorder needs to maintain balance.

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,530
Right.You know,I totally get it.

36
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,450
Yeah.So,um... what's new?

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,400
How was your yesterday?

38
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,580
Um,let's see... I woke up,took
my meds,had breakfast with kelly.

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,570
Did my homework,had lunch with kelly,went to
see my therapist,read an unstimulating book,

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,170
had dinner with kelly,took more meds,wrote in my
journal,listened to some unstimulating music and went to sleep.

41
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,410
It was a blast.

42
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,610
Dixon: Structure's important.I'm sure.

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,790
Donna: Yes,it is.

44
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,580
Speaking of structure,dixon,I'm sorry,but
I think that's enough visiting for now.

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,100
Sure,no problem.

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,910
Hey,kelly?Can we get some
privacy to say good-bye?

47
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,640
Oh,sure.

48
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,730
Yeah,of course.

49
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,730
I'll come over tomorrow,if you want.

50
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,850
Dixon,you should take a breather.

51
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,140
Go somewhere for spring break.

52
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,110
I was thinking about it.

53
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,480
But the thought of leaving when you
maybe needed me seemed kind of crazy.

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,740
It's okay.

55
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,760
Just go.Have some fun.I mean it.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,640
Maybe.

57
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,720
I'll call you later?

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,230
Not after 8:00.

59
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,840
t-minus six hours until
spring break freedom.

60
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,890
Whatever.

61
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,440
Who cares?

62
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,400
Call me the most perceptive brother in the world,but
I think you're not totally excited about said break.

63
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,750
It's just... you know,me and ethan were
going to spend the whole vacation together,

64
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,370
and do all of these fun L.A.Things
that we never have time to do.

65
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,500
And then I was gonna get my prom dress.

66
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,530
But now instead I'll just spend the whole
time alone,wallowing in my post-breakup funk.

67
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,720
Well,instead of wallowing,how would you
feel about a little brother-sister road trip?

68
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,250
Are you serious?

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,540
Yeah.Silver's pretty much
holed up with kelly 24/seven.

70
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,970
Come on,I miss... I miss
hanging out with you.

71
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,900
We used to do stuff
together all the time.

72
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,530
Ever since we got here... I don't know,it just
seems like we don't have any one-on-one time.

73
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,800
Well,a road trip to where?

74
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,850
I was thinking arizona.

75
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,490
What's in arizona?

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,710
Adventure.

77
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,920
Oh,and about five water parks
all within a 150-mile radius.

78
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,930
What,water parks?Are you serious?

79
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,020
Uh,that's if you don't love 'em anymore.

80
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,420
Oh,you bite your blasphemous tongue.

81
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,960
But mom and dad are never going
to let us go to arizona alone.

82
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,960
Yeah,but they will let us go to
grandma's house in palm springs.

83
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,530
J-just saying.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,420
I know how much you're all going
to miss me over spring break,

85
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,470
so for those of you
who just can't bear it,

86
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,050
I still have a few slots left open
on my habitat for humanity trip.

87
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,450
Volunteer house-building crap?

88
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,650
Yeah,otherwise known as a chance to help victims
of the california wildfires rebuild their lives.

89
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,140
Unless there's going to be drunk chicks doing
body shots,I'm gonna stick with south beach.

90
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,040
You're such a pig,jaime.

91
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,820
Thank you,naomi.

92
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,220
Any interest?

93
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:51,260
Build houses for poor people-- have poor people
wait on me hand and foot in cabo... tough choice.

94
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,540
Let me ask you this-- how many
times have you been to cabo?

95
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,930
Hmm,probably as many times as you've been
to whatever discount shoe store you frequent.

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,250
don't any of you want to do something
different every once in a while?

97
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,700
You know,experience something you haven't experienced
before,oruh,learn somethingabout yourselves?

98
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,290
I'll sign up.

99
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,720
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

100
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,420
Why not?I want to experience things
I've never experienced before.

101
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,530
Take a risk,for a change.

102
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,660
Me,too.That's why I'm going to
vegas with my dad's black card.

103
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,080
That sounds real meaningful.

104
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,910
Glad to have you,ethan.Will
you pass this back?

105
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,260
I cannot believe we ever dated.

106
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,870
I mean,the fact that you find this
trip even remotely interesting is...

107
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,290
hey,you.

108
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,860
I didn't know you signed up for the...
ugh... t habitafor humanity trip.

109
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,250
I did,too.How excited are you about
giving something back to poor people?

110
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,720
I'm in matthews' sociology
elective and I cut a few classes.

111
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,160
He's making me go.Otherwise
he's going to fail me.

112
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,610
- It sucks.
- Yeah,I know,it totally sucks.

113
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,170
I'm actually being made to
go to by,you know,family.

114
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,780
But I guess,silver lining,it looks like
we'lblebe a to spend some time together.

115
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,630
Yeah,maybe.

116
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,590
See you later.

117
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,620
Silver?

118
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,940
You okay?

119
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
I was in the shower.

120
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,770
For an hour?

121
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,200
Just looking for a little privacy.

122
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,080
Right.

123
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,820
Here.

124
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,030
Okay... it's time for your mood chart.

125
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,280
Let's see
here-- it's 9:30.

126
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,280
What is your mood?

127
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,030
Irritated.

128
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,040
Okay,irritated.

129
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,060
How irritated,on a scale of one to ten?

130
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,390
I was at a four,but you asked
me-- that bumped me up to a six.

131
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,890
Six,okahow would you like to
spend your time before bed?

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,080
Would you like to journal?

133
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,710
No,I would not like to journal.

134
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,240
Nor would I like to use the
word "journal" as a verb.

135
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,550
Okay,um... what do you want to do,then?

136
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,510
Nothing.Just sit here in silence.

137
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,670
Okay,fine.

138
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,240
I'll get it.

139
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,690
surprise!

140
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,690
Donna!

144
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,380
Oh,ruby,look at you.

145
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,370
Now,you don't have to
take your shoes off.

146
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,140
I'm so used to doing it in japan.

147
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,300
You know what,I'll take
whatever height I can get.

148
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,450
I don't want to look like a pipsqueak next to my
half-sister-in-law who's so grown up and so beautiful.

149
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,020
And,silver,come here and give me a hug.

150
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,090
How are you?

151
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,620
I've been better.But
I've been a lot worse.

152
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,040
And I'm so happy that you're here.

153
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,060
Don't worry--
not too happy.

154
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,630
I'm happy to be here.

155
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,000
When kelly told me what you went through,all
I wanted to do was come to L.A.And hug you.

156
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,530
- Thanks.
- Oh,what about your work?

157
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,900
Won't the entire japanese fashion
world collapse in your absence?

158
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,730
Well,there'll probably
be a lot of skyping

159
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,190
and e-mailing to remind my employees which end of the
zipper goes at the top of the dress,but they'll survive.

160
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,020
I'm in L.A.I hugged silver.

161
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,260
Now ruby and I can
go check into a hotel.

162
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,290
No way!

163
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,790
Sammy's visiting dylan,so
you guys can stay in his room.

164
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,300
Yeah.

165
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,180
- Okay?
- Okay.

166
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,900
All right,so what can I get
you?We have juice,water,wine.

167
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,610
Oh,uh,we have some
amazing sugar-free cookies.

168
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,590
They taste like styrofoam.

169
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,410
That sounds delicious.

170
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,900
But you know what,I'm going
to make you guys some tea.

171
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,900
We'll have our own little chanoyu,which
is the japanese tea ceremony.

172
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,780
Look at you,all worldly and stuff.

173
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,180
Oh,shut up.

174
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,000
No,you're famous.You are.

175
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,670
What can I say?The french have jerry
lewis,the japanese have donna martin.Who knew?

176
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,610
Okay,you go make some tea and then you
can tell us all about your glamorous life.

177
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,600
Yes,and do not leave out a sequin.

178
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,600
Uh,actually,silver,you
have to get to bed.

179
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,220
Sorry.

180
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,050
Fine.

181
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,070
- Good night,donna.
- Good night.

182
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,220
Night,kelly.

183
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,910
I'll explain.

184
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,840
I have a lot to tell you.

185
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:47,930
Okay,so we just have to call mom and dad in an hour and 45
minutes and let them know that we made it to palm springs.

186
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,410
Nice.

187
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,800
You are one crafty sister.

188
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,900
I know.

189
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,290
Brother-sister road trip.

190
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,440
Brother-sister road trip.

191
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,990
all right,so look,the first song of a
road trip-- super important,all right?

192
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,220
Sets the whole tone.

193
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,850
You know what we've
got to listen to,right?

194
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,580
- "Seasons of love.
- " "No sleep 'til brooklyn.

195
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,170
- The beastie boys?
- Rent?Are you serious?

196
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,240
All right,look,look,the
driver controls the music.

197
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,240
The passenger controls the snacks.

198
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,130
may I have a refreshment,please?

199
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,760
Why,certainly you may.

200
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:28,020
Yep,it is all yours... once I start hearing
the sweet sounds of the rent soundtrack.

201
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,070
Don't,don't don... oh.

202
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,090
All right,remember,we
have,we have some time.

203
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,910
We have miles to go.Watch.

204
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,360
Watch.

205
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,200
so just you and me.

206
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,670
How will we pass the time?

207
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,600
Oh,I got an idea: Sex.

208
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,950
Lots of sex... starting now.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,440
- Starting later.
- Oh,no!

210
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,550
I have an assignment
for my photography class.

211
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,960
I have to line up a nude model.

212
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,180
Hubba hubba.

213
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,330
Really?That's your response?

214
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,230
One hubba too many?

215
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,690
sorry.

216
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,990
You're right.

217
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,930
You know,sweetheart,this is a professial
undertaking and I,I should behave accordingly.

218
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,770
I'd appreciate that.

219
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,940
You know something,sweetheart?I-I
haven't watched you work in a long time.

220
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,190
I want to see the magic happen.

221
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,900
I bet you do.

222
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,710
Uh,now look,everyone.

223
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,350
Susanna here is a real stickler for
rules,and you know,with good reason.

224
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,280
There's a lot of kids,a
lot of power tools.

225
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,510
I'm just saying,I don't want
to take anyone to the hospital,

226
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,600
uh,because I don't know where it is.

227
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,380
Play your cards right,maybe we'll
get some alone time together.

228
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,460
That's an oxymoron.

229
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,760
Uh,one last thing to be aware
of,this is chumash country.

230
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:03,280
So if you find any native american artifacts or anything
that might be worth money,go ahead and return that to me.

231
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,020
Hope we find some of
that ancient chumash weed.

232
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,380
I heard that stuff
gets you so messed up!

233
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,020
Are you talking about peyote?

234
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,870
Which native americans used to expand their
minds and open themselves up to revelations?

235
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,400
Because I wouldn't recommend it.

236
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,670
You might realize what an idiot you are.

237
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,080
All right,guys,that's enough.

238
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,590
Introduce yourselves to susanna.

239
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,520
She's gonna give you your assignments.

240
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,430
Let's do some good here,you
know?Let's build a house!

241
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,830
S... e!

242
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,140
Hey,you.Liking the trip so far?

243
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,190
Yeah.I mean,I'm excited for
things to get going,you know?

244
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,590
But it definitely feels good to be doing something
different and bust out of my comfort zone...

245
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,950
yeah,I totally get it.So
listen,if I said to someone,

246
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,810
"i can't wait to spend
some alone time together,"

247
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,570
and that person said to me,"that's an
oxymoron," what do you think that person meant?

248
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,440
Uh,that it's an oxymoron
to be alone together.

249
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,380
No,not what he
meant.What he meant meant.

250
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,230
What are you talking about?

251
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,620
Okay,so I have this
little thing going with lm.

252
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,950
I don't know.He's playing
it really close to the vest.

253
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,810
I think he's into me.I
mean,why wouldn't he be?

254
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,940
But then he says these cryptic things like "maybe"
and "that's an oxymoron," and I'm just,like,"what?

255
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,310
" So,what do you think?

256
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,700
I think,ideally,you'd talk
to someone else about this.

257
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,260
Who?

258
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,410
The girls on this trip
are smelly granolas.

259
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,440
I mean,seriouy,hey're
wearing utility sandals.

260
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,650
And t a single one of them complimented
me on my adorable little shorts.

261
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,110
hey,you could talk to liam!

262
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,350
Suss out what he thinks about me.

263
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,440
Yeah,absolutely not.

264
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,600
Great,so you'll think about it.

265
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,280
No! Not doing it.

266
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,160
No,monday is not good enough.

267
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,060
I need the samples by friday.

268
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,560
Did you hear back from paris?

269
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:53,090
****

270
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,300
very impressive,donna.

271
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,770
And also illegal.

272
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,640
You're not allowed to drive and talk on the phone
at the same time anymore without a bluetooth.

273
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,330
Are you serious?

274
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,020
Well,I haven't been behind
the wheel for quite a while.

275
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,100
Oh,by the way,the public transportation
system in tokyo is so amazing.

276
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,040
what?

277
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,870
Just picturing you on the subway.

278
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,120
What?

279
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,260
I love the subway.

280
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,770
Well,people change,I guess.

281
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,750
Oh,my gosh.

282
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,670
Speaking of change,I drove by
now wear this the other day.

283
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,420
- Oh,our old store.
- Yeah!

284
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,720
Now it's a different kind of boutique.

285
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,400
Specializing in medical marijuana.

286
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,240
- No way.
- WaY.

287
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,250
Well,maybe if we had sold hemp
clothing we wouldn't have gone bankrupt.

288
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,960
Well,we tried,didn't
we?You can't win 'em all.

289
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,230
What are you talking
about?You won japan.

290
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,830
And you and david are
like a power couple.

291
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,910
Hey,speaking of david,how is he?

292
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,570
You haven't said anything about him.

293
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,070
Oh,david is,david is fabulous.Fabulous.

294
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,290
He just got a big promotion and you know that girl
rapper he discovered,the 15-year-old from osaka?

295
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,590
- Yeah.
- She's totally blowing up.

296
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,570
Oh,you know what?We have to go
to opening ceremony and to curve.

297
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,160
We have a lot of shopping to do.

298
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,180
Dixon: Look,I'm just saying,this is
the third time we've stopped already.

299
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,360
Maybe if you stop
drinking so much dr.Pepper.

300
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,550
We're on a road trip.Drinking
dr.Pepper is practically a requirement.

301
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,690
Then the next stop better have a snack
machine,'cause I need to be re-chipified.

302
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,550
Hey,dixon,um... thanks
for suggesting this trip.

303
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,500
It's exactly what I needed.

304
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,190
Yeah.Me,too.

305
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,050
Put the paper down on the toilet.

306
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,460
is dana bowen there?

307
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,070
Oh,okay.Well,um,do you know
when she'll be back from lunch?

308
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,710
Um,no,no,it's cool.

309
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,850
Um,uh,I don't need to leave a message.

310
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,310
I'll come see her myself.

311
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,410
All right,thank you.

312
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,580
Bye.

313
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,350
Pretty please?

314
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,030
To make up for you
cheating on me with annie.

315
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,260
No,we were broken up.

316
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,080
Let's not dwell on the details.It hurt.Plus,I'm
going to keep bugging you until you say yes anyway.

317
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,470
I mean,I never get tired of
bugging.I could bug you all day long.

318
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,990
Fine,fine!

319
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,830
I'll ask liam if he likes
you just so you'll shut up.

320
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,910
Yay!

321
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,460
Hey,don't tell him I sent him,or
sent you or that I like him.

322
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,280
In fact,don't mention me at all.Except
to,of course,find out if he likes me.

323
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,220
Um... Just shut up!

324
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,520
Hey,man,I'm ethan.

325
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,400
Good for you.

326
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,800
Uh,well,hey,look,I know it's
like an awkward question,but,uh...

327
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,780
do you like naomi?

328
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,370
Hey,so this must be the part where the,uh,jealous
ex-boyfriend comes overand threatens the new guy.

329
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,900
You gonna punch me now?

330
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,410
No,I'm not going to punch you.

331
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,890
Oh,come on.Isn't that
how you jocks roll?

332
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,590
I mean,don't get me
wrong,I think it's adorable.

333
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,400
Unfortunately,I'm not really in the
mood for a pissing contest right now.

334
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,420
Hey,man,what's your problem?They run
out of black eyeliner at rebels-r-us?

335
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,700
Take it easy.

336
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,930
Don't go intoo a 'roid rage.

337
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,370
- Go to hell.
- Right back at you,man.

338
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,830
The guy's an ass.

339
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,320
Yeah,I know.

340
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,710
But does he like me?

341
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,310
*****

342
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,010
I don't like when they
cut the octopus too thin.

343
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,640
Me either.

344
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,390
okay... we have 45 minutes before we
have to pick up silver from therapy.

345
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay.

346
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,940
So,how are you holding up?

347
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,180
Well,I love silver's doctors.

348
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,680
Both her psychiatrist and her therapist are great,and
she's responding really well to the medicine.

349
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,390
Kel... I didn't ask how silver's doing.

350
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,330
I asked how you're doing.

351
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,740
It's been hard.

352
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,560
I can tell that silver resents my
constant moniring,but I don't care.

353
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,390
I am willing to do whatever it takes for her to
get better,even if it means she ends up hating me.

354
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,130
Thank you.

355
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,730
The octopus looks pretty good.

356
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,610
Yeah,see to me,it still
looks like octopus.

357
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,340
hey,guys,sorry to interrupt.

358
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,100
I just have to say I love your dress.

359
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,090
Oh,thank you.

360
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,750
I just spent,like,the whole morning trooping around stores
looking for something to wear to this premiere party.

361
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,100
Your dress is the first thing
I've seen that I actually like.

362
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,700
You're diablo cody,right?

363
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,490
Yeah.

364
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,130
Diablo cody.

365
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,150
She wrote juno.

366
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,480
Sorry.

367
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,260
Uh,maybe it didn't come to japan.

368
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,260
Oh,no,it did,but they
called it teenage mommy-girl.

369
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,170
No.You wrote  teenage mommy-girl?

370
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,660
I loved that movie.

371
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,620
Thank you.

372
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,940
I love your dress.

373
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,450
She designed it.Donna is amazing.

374
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,190
She's like the stella
mccartney of japan.

375
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,960
Minus the rock star pedigree...
and the rock star baggage.

376
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,990
Well,who sells your stuff?I would love to
wear one of your dresses to this premiere.

377
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,140
no one around here,unfortunately.

378
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,050
But she sews really fast,don't ya?

379
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,820
Yes,I have been known to sew rather
fast,especially before the japanese oscars.

380
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,410
Diablo: Cool.

381
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,850
All rightie,buckaroos,you'll
be stayin' in "cowhide.

382
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,830
" You need anything at all,feel free
to pick up the phone and give a hee-haw.

383
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,880
Have fun.

384
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,400
Okay,maniac,where did
you find this place?

385
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,360
They were running a deal online.

386
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,170
Oh,no wonder.

387
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,350
So,where should we begin?

388
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,840
I was leaning towards oasis
because it has an eight-story tower

389
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,200
and was voted one of the ten-best
water parks by the travel channel,

390
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,820
but maybe we shouldn't
start with the best.

391
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,900
Dixon?

392
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,020
Where should we start,oasis or big surf?

393
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,260
Look,I gotta tell you something.

394
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,230
We're not actually here
for the water parks.

395
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,870
My birth mom lives here.

396
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,110
hey,so we met the woman who
wrote teenage mommy-girl.

397
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,510
Juno.

398
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,330
- Diablo cody?
- Yeah.

399
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,690
You met diablo cody?

400
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,690
Yeah.Donna's gonna  design her
dress for some big premiere.

401
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,130
No way!I have been
reading her blog for years.

402
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,220
She's my idol.

403
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,830
And I'm gonna style her,too.

404
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,630
Well,'cause I'm such a control freak.

405
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,580
I want to make sure she doesn't
pick out any crazy accessories.

406
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,940
Wait.Do you want to come with me?

407
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,370
Maybe you could be my assistant.

408
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,550
Oh,really?

409
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,680
Yeah.I would love it.

410
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,300
No,you guys.

411
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,940
I... it's not a good idea.

412
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,980
It's,you know,a big red carpet event with all the
people and paparazzi and celebrities and limos and... no.

413
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,040
I-I just think it's too much.

414
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,610
Kelly... I'm sorry,silver.

415
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,900
You just got out of the hospital.

416
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,350
Angry.

417
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,340
Level ten.

418
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,740
yeah,you're not supposed to break
branches off of living trees for kindling.

419
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,840
Look,who it is,the oxymoron himself.

420
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,990
And yes,I know what that means.

421
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,330
Oh,aren't you the little philologist.

422
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,800
I need to get back to camp.

423
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,940
I wish you wouldn'T.

424
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,120
Really?And why is that?

425
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,360
BeusE... we can't do this at camp.

426
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,200
There you are.

427
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,440
so,liam and i did it in the woods.

428
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,770
He totally likes me.

429
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,810
It was so obvious.And
yes,it was amazing.

430
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,260
- the things he did with his hands...
- maybe just tell him this.

431
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,030
He went off to score some peyote.

432
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,940
Lame.He knows I hate drugs.

433
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,350
he is a bad,bad boy.

434
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:49,240
Mr.Matthews,so,uh,are we gonna
get a chance to explore the area?

435
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,520
Ah,yeah.You know,unfortunately,I don't
think there's gonna be time for that.

436
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,210
So basically,this whole trip is just like
school,only with hot dogs and hammering?

437
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,920
And s'mores.

438
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,870
Come on,man,what were you expecting?

439
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,260
I don't know.To interact with different
people,to get different perspectives.

440
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,360
I just wanted something
different to happen,anything.

441
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,770
You said that we were gonna learn
something new about ourselves.

442
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,650
Well,you learned you
don't like hammering.

443
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,660
Look,be patient,man,maybe you will.

444
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,440
Thanks.

445
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,150
no,no,I-I'm just,I'm just
saying,you could have told me.

446
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,190
I did tell you.

447
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,710
No,you said,"nude model.

448
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,660
" I assumed that you meant a woman.

449
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,950
That's not my fault.

450
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,710
Can you turn a little to the left?

451
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,990
D-do you have to get that close?

452
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,670
- Harry...
- it is a legitimate question.

453
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,270
I'm just saying,you got a naked man standing
in front of you with his schlong hanging out.

454
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,850
I can hear you.

455
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,440
Sorry,buddy.

456
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,000
okay.

457
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,850
Let's go back.

458
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,690
Annie.

459
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,930
Why don't you take that outside?

460
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,870
Oh,you'd like that,wouldn't you?

461
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,600
hi,sweetheart.How's grandma's house?

462
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,800
Great,great.

463
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,880
Yes,terrific.

464
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,540
We are just,we're sitting by the pool.

465
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,170
What are you guys up to?

466
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,010
Just working on a crossword puzzle.

467
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,240
Okay.

468
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,350
Well,then I will let you get back to it.

469
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,650
- Have a good night.
- Tell dixon we love him.

470
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,900
Uh,will do.

471
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,130
ByE.

472
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,940
That is really good.That's amazing.

473
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,910
What the hell?

474
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,160
Oh,my goodness,these
are gonna be so great!

475
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,710
what's wrong?

476
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,710
I didn't like lying to dad like that.

477
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,460
We were already lying to him.

478
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,040
I mean,we're not in palm springs.

479
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,660
It's not the same
thing,and you know it,dixon.

480
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,630
Fine.

481
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,190
I know.But I couldn't tell mom and
dad about this,about my birth mother.

482
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,220
They would have made
some big deal out of it.

483
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,310
Yeah,okay,maybe.BuT...
but why'd you lie to me?

484
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,140
You told me we were
here for water parks.

485
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,200
I was gonna tell you.

486
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,590
I just thought you might be upset.

487
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,700
Yeah,well,you were right,I am.

488
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,400
Or freaked out or something.

489
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,550
Look,I just want to see her.

490
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,820
I want to make sure she's okay.

491
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,100
And if she is,then what?

492
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,230
You gonna stay here in arizona?

493
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,820
Of course not.

494
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,710
Ez,geannie.

495
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,830
I'm sorry.I know that.

496
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,350
Or at least i think I know.

497
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:23,230
It's just,you have this whole
past,this whole family,this,

498
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,600
this whole side of
you that I don't know.

499
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,730
Yeah,I-I get it.

500
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,280
I guess in a way,there's a whole
side of me I don't even know.

501
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,140
And that's really weird.

502
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,270
I need to tell her I'm sorry.

503
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,720
For what?

504
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,650
After my grandma died,this
social worker asked me

505
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,640
if I wanted to go back and live with
my mom or if I wanted to be adopted.

506
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,850
I was so mad with my mom
for being crazy,you know?

507
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,540
So I chose adoption.

508
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,340
I left her.

509
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,070
Yeah.

510
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,540
Ever since all this happened with
silver,I see things differently.

511
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,920
She had a disease.

512
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,290
It wasn't her fault.

513
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,560
So I just want to see how she's
doing and tell her I'm sorry.

514
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,530
Hey,dude.

515
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,300
What do you want?

516
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,440
I heard you might have some peyote.

517
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,860
I'll pay you for it.

518
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,430
Let me think.

519
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,750
No.

520
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,510
Why not?

521
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,770
Because I don't think you can handle it.

522
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,410
Oh,yeah?

523
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,850
Well,how about this?

524
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,410
You give me some,or I'll
tell matthews you're holding.

525
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,510
- Think you can handle that?
- Blackmail,huh?

526
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,140
Not exactly keeping with
the ancient chumash spirit.

527
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,860
Fine.

528
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,690
I'll make the tea tomorrow
night,we'll drink it together.

529
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,220
Uh,no thanks,man.I think
I'll be fine on my own.

530
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,830
Easy does it,jock.

531
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,400
This is a pretty hard-core
experience.You need a guide.

532
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,860
Someone to make sure you don't freak and
try to saw off that prized lacrosse arm.

533
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,610
That's the deal.

534
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,640
Otherwise,no dice.

535
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,560
Sorry.Did I wake you?

536
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,840
Oh,no.I had to go to the
bathroom,and I saw the light on.

537
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,930
Can I see?

538
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,790
Of course,please.

539
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,750
I love this fabric.

540
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,680
Um,so,what do you think of the dress?

541
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,790
It's gorgeous.

542
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,250
But better get back to bed before
the warden realizes that I'm up.

543
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,290
Hey,silver,hold on a sec.

544
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,590
I,uh,I just want to
tell you a little story.

545
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,690
When I had my first runway show
in japan,everything going great,

546
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,830
untithis one model,yuko,refused
to wear the heels I picked out.

547
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,170
She went on and on about how
they were impossible to walk in.

548
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,590
I was furious.

549
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,470
How dare she try to ruin my show,right?

550
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,530
Yeah,totally.

551
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,370
Well,then I put on said heels.

552
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,510
Walked two steps,fell flat on my butt.

553
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,540
yuko was totally right.

554
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,540
I thought she was trying to ruin my show,but
she was really just trying to make it good.

555
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,120
Do you see what I'm trying to say?

556
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,610
Yeah.That kelly and I should try
walking in each other's shoes.

557
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,000
That story works on two levels.

558
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,920
Yeah,well,kelly's shoes suck.

559
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,620
so,just,uh,give me a shout when
you're done,and I'll come get you.

560
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,160
I'm gonna explore.

561
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,880
Sounds good.

562
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,440
I'll...

563
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,070
that's her.

564
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,880
Go.

565
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,250
I can'T.

566
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,250
Yes,you can.

567
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,900
No.No.I-I can'T.

568
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,810
I can'T.

569
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,850
Thought I was ready to see her.

570
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,970
But I'm not.

571
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,550
It's still too painful.

572
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,840
I wish I could go apologize to her.

573
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,290
But I'm just not ready yet.

574
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,460
excuse me.

575
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,790
You are dana bowen,right?

576
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,950
Yeah.

577
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,400
N's sister.

578
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,160
My-my dixon?

579
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,130
Yeah.

580
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,230
Um,we drove here so he could see you.

581
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,940
He wanted to tell you something.

582
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,470
But then he got too nervous,so
I said I would do it.

583
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,490
Well,what?What-what
did he want to tell me?

584
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,890
He wanted to apologize.

585
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,110
What does he have to apologize for?

586
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,850
When he was eight,a social worker himked 
if he wanted to stay with you or get adopted.

587
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,910
So,he wanted to apologize
for choosing to leave.

588
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,180
He thought that was his choice?

589
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,340
Yeah.

590
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,060
He was an
eight-year-old kid.

591
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,600
I mean,that social worker might have asked
him,but believe me,I made the decision.

592
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,550
Because it was what was best for him.

593
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,970
Well,I will tell him that.

594
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,980
Thank you.

595
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,750
Wait.

596
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,360
Can you stay a minute?

597
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,000
Is he... is dixon okay?

598
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,850
Dixon's great.

599
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,500
He's really great.

600
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,120
How are you doing?

601
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,660
Pretty good,you know.

602
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,770
I got a job,an
apartment... I'm doing okay.

603
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,330
He will be so glad to hear that.

604
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,050
So,he finally got himself a sister,huh?

605
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,540
You know,growing updixo
n always wanted one.

606
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,800
He used to beg me to buy
him a sister at the hospital.

607
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,280
Really?

608
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,810
Oh,yeah.

609
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,480
His little cousin,um,she left a
little baby doll at the house once.

610
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:52,690
Well,dixon said she left it,but
I always thought he stole it.

611
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,160
he used to drag that doll
around,calling it his sister.

612
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,810
Named her mango.

613
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,870
Mango?

614
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,490
Mango.

615
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,770
How much longer till it kicks in?

616
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,050
Any minute now.

617
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,740
Here's what hunter thompson taught me.

618
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,700
Look at a fixed point in the horizon
and start taking deep breaths.

619
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,620
Faster.Oxygen helps
activate the mescaline.

620
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,950
You should be feeling it now.

621
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,430
Empty your mind.

622
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,050
Really empty it.

623
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,420
check out that coyote.

624
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,230
What coyote?

625
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,350
There was just A...
look,there was just...

626
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,080
whoa,am I tripping?

627
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,730
Right on.

628
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,780
That wasn't a coyote.

629
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,450
That was a peyote coyote.

630
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,260
Cool.

631
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,330
It's time to close your eyes.

632
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:05,490
Now... picture your own face.

633
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,490
Okay.

634
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:12,140
And go into the image of your face till
you're looking into one of your eyes.

635
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,270
Okay.

636
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:20,150
What is your expression on
the face within your face?

637
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,810
I think I'm frowning.

638
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,640
That's,uh,surprising.

639
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,350
Yeah,that'S... that's
not how people see me.

640
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,150
But it's the face within the face.

641
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,330
You know what I'm saying?

642
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,030
I think so.

643
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,160
People think I'm someone
different than I am.

644
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,580
Let me ask you
something,why do you smile?

645
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,280
I smile...

646
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,370
...'cause I don't want to
cause trouble for anyone.

647
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,490
I don't want to make
anyone's life harder.

648
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,180
Not my teachers,not my
coaches,definitely not my parents.

649
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,160
My brother's autistic,so they need
me to be easy,not make any waves.

650
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,390
I don't want to cause any conflicts,so
I just pretend like I'm fine.

651
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,870
Even when I'm not.

652
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,770
It's like a habit,I guess.

653
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,520
But I'm tired of it.

654
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,670
I'm tired of always being the good guy.

655
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,230
I'm tired of feeling like a phony.

656
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,700
okay,you are making
this dress look so good.

657
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,520
Please.This dress is
making me look good.

658
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,200
You have got to open
a store in L.A.,Donna.

659
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,520
Seriously,we need you here.

660
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,200
How'd you get that past me?

661
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,900
Diablo,it's time to hit the red carpet.

662
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:56,460
Let's go,let's go,let's go.

663
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,680
Okay.Oh,wait!

664
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,820
Hold on.Hold
on.Wait,wait,wait!Wait! Wait!

665
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,850
Reporter: The stars are
on the red carpet tonight.

666
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,440
Right now,being joined by
oscar winner diablo cody.

667
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,800

668
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,240

669
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,600

670
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,220
tell me a little bit about your dress.

671
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,550
Uh,this is a donna martin.

672
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,000
Uh,yeah,actually,I have the
designer right here with me.

673
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,660
donna,perfect,tell me a
little bit about your style.

674
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,900
What... hi,everybody.

675
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,170
Sorry.

676
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,290
oh,my god.

677
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,230
You're actually not going to
believe this,but god knows...

678
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,190
we haven't laughed like this in a while.

679
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,350
Yeah.

680
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:51,690
I know you think I'm too strict,but
we can't forget what happened.

681
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,790
And I don't!

682
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,820
Believe me,I don't forget
about it for an instant.

683
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,970
I have this to remind me ery day.

684
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,070
But I don't want my whole
life to be about that.

685
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,200
You know,donna used to workwith
this model named yuko...

686
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,260
- wait,she told you that story,too?
- Yeah.

687
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,820
All right,look,you were
right about the premiere.

688
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,400
It would have been too much for me.

689
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,860
But I still need some
spontaneity in my life.

690
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,980
Even if it's just deciding to... put on a face
masque and bake some cookies,watch a horror movie.

691
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,600
What do you say we put on a
face masque,bake some cookies?

692
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,590
And watch a horrorovie?

693
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,530
Don't push it.

694
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,400
come on.

695
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,750
Yeah.No more phoniness.No
more faking it.

696
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,400
From now on,if I'm upset about
stuff,people are going to know it.

697
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,390
I'm-I'm talking a lot.Am
I ruining your high?

698
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,440
NaH.

699
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,100
It's pretty profound going
along with someone else's trip.

700
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,580
I'm going to take a leak.

701
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,360
this stuff's delicious.

702
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,190
- damn!
- Liam?

703
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,020
Liam?

704
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,920
I'm over here.

705
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,530
I jacked my ankle.

706
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,810
Oh,man.

707
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,690
You look weird down there.

708
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,170
Will you give me a hand?

709
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,910
Sure.No,no.Wait.

710
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,650
That's what the old ethan would've done--
would've helped out,been the good guy.

711
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,000
What if this is some
kind of cosmic test?

712
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,290
This isn't a cosmic test.

713
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,610
How do you know it's not a cosmic test?

714
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,340
- Because you didn't take peyote,jackass.
- What?

715
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,010
You worked all day inhaling paint fumes,you had
a few too many beers and you drank some herb tea.

716
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,770
You were screwing with me?

717
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,940
Yeah.My bad.

718
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,480
Now,can you get me out of here?

719
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,870
Thanks.

720
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,170
if you can't bring
mohammed to the mountain...

721
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,620
Diablo cody is in my house and
my face is a crusty pukefest.

722
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,390
I once knew a stripper
named crusty pukefest.

723
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,840
Oh,my god!I love your
dress.I love your movie.

724
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,740
- I love your tv show.
-Thank you.

725
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,760
I love your blI love your blog!I
love your book!I love your hair!

726
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,250
Oh,my god,I love your hair.

727
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,750
Then,you know,we have to get a picture.

728
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,950
Would you mind doing the honors?

729
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,100
Oh,yeah,yeah.Awesome.

730
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,490
diablo cody!

731
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,980
Okay!

732
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,350
look,I tried to score
peyote and I couldn'T.

733
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,990
I messed with you because i
don't respond well to threats.

734
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,570
And because you're a douchebag.

735
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,010
Okay,that,too.

736
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,020
You wanted a self-revelation
and you got one.

737
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,010
You just weren't high.

738
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,940
Hallucinogens aren't all
they're cracked up to be.

739
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,230
Oh,thanks,dr.Drew.

740
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,550
I'm serious.

741
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,070
Last time I dropped acid,I lost
it and tried to cut my arm off.

742
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,080
I would have cut down to the
bone if my girl hadn't stopped me.

743
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,770
- Whoa,that'S...
- crazy?

744
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,480
No kidding.

745
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,810
Now you know something about me,okay?

746
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,080
So we're even.

747
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,360
I knew you were going to
punch me sooner or later.

748
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,050
Go to hell.

749
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,800
It's so nice having you here.

750
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,170
Not to be selfish,but sometimes it really sucks
having my best friend live halfway around the world.

751
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,220
Yeah.

752
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,960
You know,I've actually been toying with
the idea of opening a store in L.A...

753
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,860
who knows?

754
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,880
Maybe L.A. Is ready for
me now,hemp or no hemp.

755
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,800
Oh,that would be amazing.

756
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,640
Do you think david  fuld goor it?

757
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,700
Donna,what's going on?

758
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,200
David and are separated.

759
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,510
I'm sorry.

760
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,480
you have the worst taste in music.

761
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,450
Don't say that.

762
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,730
I am your mango.

763
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,930
I swear to you,I do not remember
anything about that doll.

764
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,060
Oh,mango thinks you do.

765
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:37,540
look,um.. thank you so
much for talking to herer.

766
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,600
You know,'cause if you hadn't,um... I still
would have been feeling bad and really guilty.

767
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:49,320
And next time,when I am
ready to talk to her...

768
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,640
will you come back with me again?

769
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,350
Of course.

770
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,340
Hey,you.

771
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,030
I thought maybe you
could give me a ride.

772
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,500
Your house on the way to ethan's?

773
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,400
Excuse me?

774
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,270
you're giving him a ride?

775
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,770
Forget it.I have my car
here,I just remembered.

776
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,920
And I just remembered how hot you
were in the woods,so don't worry.

777
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,000
You'll be getting that ride very soon.
