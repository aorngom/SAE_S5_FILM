1
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,473
Use it to open the tackle
shop, get your own place.

2
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:17,601
Tonight, we're stealing the Sats.

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,479
As of now, your life
outside of school is over.

4
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:24,599
What is going on?
All this bitterness, all this sniping...

5
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,346
We should go to counseling.

6
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:28,361
- What?
- I kissed another man.

7
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,007
- I'm Teddy's girlfriend.
- He has a girlfriend?

8
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:32,824
Are we okay?

9
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:36,119
We're definitely not okay.

10
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:38,455
You moved here? You're back?

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,037
Call me Karma, babe.
And Karma is a bitch.

12
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,390
What's wrong?

13
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,687
My life is over.

14
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,892
I'm sure you did fine on the Sats.

15
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,133
Jen's back.

16
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:07,317
She's back in LA?

17
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,448
You know what?
She's not our problem.

18
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:16,080
- Everything is going to be okay.
- But it's not.

19
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:17,661
She bought the Beach Club.

20
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:20,580
She's taken my Beach Club
away from me.

21
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:22,837
So, we'll hang out somewhere else.

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,543
A man can only eat so many
Yucatan chicken wraps.

23
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:29,499
But I love it there. They come
around and mist me while I'm tanning.

24
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,300
Jen's trying to ruin my life again.

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,188
Stay out of her way. Don't engage.
Don't go anywhere near her.

26
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:36,930
- But...
- I'll mist you.

27
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:40,392
You'll mist me?

28
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:43,242
Sure. I'll mist you.

29
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:04,541
Is that a portrait of me?

30
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:06,543
It's an abstract.

31
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,423
I'm sorry about what happened
with my dad. I really am.

32
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,591
I was completely humiliated.

33
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,216
I should have told him about you,
but the thing is, my dad, he's...

34
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:19,402
he's tricky.

35
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,362
He's got a big personality,
and he can be kind of judgmental,

36
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:24,185
And you don't think he'll like me.

37
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:26,538
No, I do.

38
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:29,361
He will. I really want him to like you.

39
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:31,735
And this is new to me.
I haven't done this.

40
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,572
I've never known a girl that mattered
enough to me to introduce to my father.

41
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:38,450
I want to do it right.

42
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,110
So...

43
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,205
Come over and have dinner
with me and my dad?

44
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,792
And break bread with your
kind-of-judgmental mega-movie-star dad?

45
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:53,089
"Okay," she says,
immediately regretting it.

46
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:54,624
"Thank you,"

47
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:57,051
he says, getting ready to kiss her.

48
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:06,311
Three dimes.

49
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,980
I was thinking more like 18.

50
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:13,151
But come on up. Have a look.
We'll settle on something fair.

51
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,820
I'm staying at
the Pacific Waves Motor Hotel.

52
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:21,392
Every bit as luxurious as it sounds.

53
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,559
Two hours.

54
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:26,020
So?

55
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:27,362
So, my boy,

56
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:30,805
we got a broker in Redondo
who thinks they may only be worth

57
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:32,796
$15,000.

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,551
This is really gonna happen?

59
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,541
The tackle shop and you
and me living together?

60
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,846
Thanks to you.

61
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,183
What do you say we celebrate.

62
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,561
- Rent a boat. Do some fishing.
- That sounds good.

63
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,105
Let me take care of my business,

64
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,213
and we'll hit the high seas.

65
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:14,254
- Is it okay if I make a call?
- Take five and then we'll get busy.

66
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,904
All right. Thanks.

67
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:19,584
Take five?

68
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,190
That's, like, actual
recording studio talk.

69
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:24,725
I am so excited.

70
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:27,251
I'm excited you're excited, sweetie.

71
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:29,991
Speaking of exciting...

72
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:33,742
What would you think about maybe
recording a duet with Javier?

73
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,359
- It was the label's idea, but I...
- Javier?

74
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:37,705
As in,

75
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:41,442
Javier-Javier?

76
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,491
Javier-Javier-Javier.

77
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,162
That's insane.
I am, like, his biggest fan ever.

78
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:50,498
I have his Christmas album,
his kids' album.

79
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:52,904
Anyway, slight snag.

80
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:55,920
Javier's about ready to go out on tour,
so this needs to happen fast.

81
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,881
I can be anywhere, anytime.

82
00:04:58,312 --> 00:04:59,632
Scheduling? Not the snag.

83
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,450
Check this out.

84
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:22,058
Right?

85
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:25,241
I'm out to four different writers,
praying for something better.

86
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,543
I could write it.

87
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,413
I'd like to try.

88
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:36,836
Why not? If you have something ready
by Wednesday, we'll listen to it.

89
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:54,505
- <i>Pacific Waves.</i>
- Hi. Finn Court, please.

90
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:56,105
Not here.

91
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,470
Excuse me?

92
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,734
Checked out about an hour ago.

93
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:17,416
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

94
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,129
Why are you waving your tape
measure in front of my house?

95
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,506
My house.

96
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,253
We need to take a look
at the gutters on the other side.

97
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
Sure.

98
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,638
I pouted a little and
Olivier bought it for me.

99
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,223
For weekends.

100
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,058
A sort of country house.

101
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,518
You can't do this.

102
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,187
- I already have.
- I live here, Jen.

103
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,914
For 29 more days,
as stipulated by California law.

104
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,420
But if the construction
is going to bother you,

105
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,648
feel free to vacate sooner.

106
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,497

00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,172
Season 02 Episode 20
<i>Meet The Parent</i>

108
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:26,070
You must have ESP. I was just about
to call you. I have to talk to you.

109
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,116
I need to talk to you, too. Some pretty
messed up stuff went down with my dad.

110
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:33,543
Did he evict you?
Did he give you 29 days to get out?

111
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,039
Jen just bought my house.
The one I live in.

112
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:38,794
- What?
- Now I'm going to kill her.

113
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,497
You can't engage with her.
She's rattlesnake.

114
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,764
You can't go poking
her with a stick.

115
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,045
- You'll find a new place to live.
- Really?

116
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:47,008
How?

117
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,408
I don't know.
We'll find you something.

118
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:51,846
Just promise me that you'll
stay away from her.

119
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,146
<i>She's toxic.</i>

120
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:58,811
- So, I gave my dad these coins...
- <i>I'm gonna go,</i>

121
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,147
eat some ice cream,
calm myself down.

122
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,066
I'll call you back, babe.

123
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:12,502
What? Javier Luna?
That's seriously amazing.

124
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:15,442
I know. Double amazing? Get this.
Laurel, my producer?

125
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:18,164
- She's letting me write the song.
- What?

126
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,378
I could be "singer-songwriter."

127
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:22,413
I am so proud of you.
Come here.

128
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,213
I've got to go to the Blaze.
We'll talk more. See you later?

129
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,380
See you.

130
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:30,948
Well, well, well.
The plot thickens.

131
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:32,931
What is that supposed to mean?

132
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,653
Why are you wiggling your eyebrows?

133
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,867
He's my friend.

134
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:39,830
He just got a girlfriend.

135
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,266
Don't kill me.
Do you wish he didn't?

136
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,549
Navid will always be
very special to me.

137
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,000
But he's with Lila now and

138
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,360
he's happy.

139
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:53,761
So I respect that.
And he totally deserves to be happy

140
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:56,295
after everything I put
him through, so...

141
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:59,112
Just had to ask.
I got a question for you.

142
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,225
Is it an eyebrow-wiggling
type question?

143
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,460
What's Teddy's dad like?
I have to go over there for dinner,

144
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,462
I just want to
know what I'm in for.

145
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,127
- You're meeting Spence?
- Why do you say it like that?

146
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:11,571
- Is he scary?
- He's just really intense.

147
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:14,093
He either loves people
or hates people.

148
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:15,847
And when he hates people...

149
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:19,775
Are you nervous?

150
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:22,608
Now I am.

151
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,736
- What's up?
- Not much.

152
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,339
Are you pissed at me?

153
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,601
I'm not pissed at you.

154
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:39,839
I'm not really into this
whole getting blown off thing.

155
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:41,644
But I'm not blowing you off.

156
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:44,250
I just really appreciate
direct communication.

157
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:46,211
So...
if you don't like me,

158
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,561
or you don't like blondes,
or you don't like the way I chew...

159
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:52,583
Ivy, stop.
You're getting the wrong idea.

160
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:56,558
All I want to do is
hang out with you,

161
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,514
- but you know I'm grounded.
- So...

162
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,680
call me when you can, I guess.

163
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:02,727
- Wait.
- What?

164
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:07,293
That doesn't mean that you
can't come to my house.

165
00:10:08,797 --> 00:10:11,319
- Am I allowed to?
- I don't know.

166
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:14,822
But, what I do know is my
parents are going out tonight.

167
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:16,574
And...

168
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:19,575
I can't wait any longer
to hang out with you.

169
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:24,165
All right.

170
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:26,417
- All right?
- Yeah, all right.

171
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,085
All right.

172
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:40,973
No more wraps or mozzarella sticks.
I want to class this place up, Tio.

173
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,059
Comprende? I want more...

174
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,435
European flair.

175
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:48,425
How does a coq au vin
chopped salad grab you?

176
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,983
Good. We have a good
selection now...

177
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,815
Hold that thought, Tio.

178
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:55,029
To be continued.

179
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:02,036
- What do you want?
- Other than world peace?

180
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,815
You can have any house
in Beverly Hills,

181
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,759
and you had to have mine.

182
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:14,501
Something doesn't smell right.

183
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:19,470
- Probably Tio's aftershave.
- You want something, Jen.

184
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:23,563
As a matter of fact,
I do want something.

185
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,252
While I was in France,
Olivier and I,

186
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:30,681
we fell back in love.
It took time, but...

187
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:33,109
I had to forgive him
for his indiscretions

188
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:35,290
and learn to trust him again.

189
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:38,823
And we are more in love than ever.

190
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,026
Waiter, barf bag.

191
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:43,982
Which is why I can't allow you to
tell him what happened last year.

192
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,373
He could never handle the thought of
me with another man. He's very jealous.

193
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,251
You don't want me to tell
him what a big tramp you are?

194
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,501
Exactly.

195
00:11:55,704 --> 00:11:57,933
You know what?
Do whatever you want?

196
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,722
I owe you a very big apology.

197
00:12:03,563 --> 00:12:05,878
I have done some terrible things
to you.

198
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,520
And I am really truly very sorry.

199
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:12,104
You can have the house.

200
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:14,025
I'll give it to you.

201
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:16,610
But what I would really like...

202
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:19,206
is another chance with you.

203
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,641
Really?

204
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,244
You're the only sister I've got.

205
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,457
Please give me another chance.

206
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:32,209
And I would love for you
to get to know Olivier.

207
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,295
Join us for dinner tomorrow night.

208
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:35,895
Please.

209
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:47,834
Guess who?

210
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:50,535
- Hillary Clinton?
- Close.

211
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,477
- Tila Tequila?
- Closer.

212
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:54,774
Lila, is that you?

213
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,406
I have a story idea. Everyone's
talking about Adrianna and Javier.

214
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,094
We should do a piece.

215
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,787
I thought you were,
sensitive about the Ade thing.

216
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:09,497
I was.

217
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:13,069
My chest basically turned to
concrete at the mention of her name.

218
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:16,454
I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause we've
been hanging out so much,

219
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,881
or maybe it's 'cause
we've gotten closer.

220
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,393
But recently, no concrete.

221
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,017
- That's cool.
- That is cool.

222
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:43,767
Sorry.
I tried knocking, but...

223
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,876
I'm not doing
this Matthews' project by myself.

224
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:53,988
I barely know who Vivaldi is.

225
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,379
Are you okay?

226
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:05,353
- Where did you get the boat?
- I built it.

227
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,152
You built a boat?

228
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:10,641
That's what I do when I want
to blow off some steam.

229
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,687
What got you all steamed up?

230
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:24,164
You can talk to me.

231
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,366
Come on,
you were there when I found out

232
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,327
my parents were all messed up,
so you can definitely trust me.

233
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,252
My dad meant a lot to
me when I was a kid.

234
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:43,149
And, we were, like, really close,

235
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,837
and we went sailing.

236
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,720
Sailing was our thing.

237
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,806
Anyway, he hasn't been
around for a while,

238
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:52,696
and just recently...

239
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:55,384
out of the blue,
he showed up, and...

240
00:14:57,206 --> 00:15:00,772
like an idiot, I got all excited
thinking he was gonna stay.

241
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,948
As soon as he got what
he wanted, he took off.

242
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,067
And...

243
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,451
Just whatever, so...

244
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,653
I haven't really told anybody
about my dad, so if you...

245
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,335
What about Naomi?

246
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:27,218
You should tell her.

247
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:30,346
She is your girlfriend.

248
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:42,099
Jack, neat,

249
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:46,164
and, let me have one of those
local beers you're always touting.

250
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,713
Just a ginger ale for me.

251
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm getting a little old for vomiting
and hangovers, don't you think?

252
00:15:53,596 --> 00:15:55,704
You're never too old
for vomiting and hangovers.

253
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:57,213
Says you.

254
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,228
It's a work thing.

255
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,019
Cross your fingers they're not
dragging me back to the studio.

256
00:16:24,906 --> 00:16:26,239
Hello, darling.

257
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:30,864
Can I say two words to you?
Signature umbrellas.

258
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:33,867
- That's what this place needs.
- That's a good idea.

259
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,511
This is Ryan Matthews,
Naomi's teacher.

260
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,748
Ryan, this is Olivier, my husband.

261
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,085
An educator.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

262
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,447
- Drinks on the house.
- That's okay.

263
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:47,715
It's no skin off my face.
We own the Beach Club.

264
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:52,301
That's a great thing to own.

265
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:55,173
It's not the Dodgers, but...

266
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,855
We should get to our table.

267
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:00,227
Ryan, it was lovely to see you.

268
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:02,313
Indeed, it was.
Great meeting you.

269
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,222
Pleasure was mine.

270
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,151
Can I get a little
whiskey in the ginger ale?

271
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:18,594
Make it a double.

272
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:27,564
Watch the carbon footprint.

273
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:29,373
I can't write.

274
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,509
I can't. I have lost my ability
to string words together.

275
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:35,721
This was my big chance,
and I'm totally blowing it.

276
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:37,937
You've written songs before.

277
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,291
But not like this.
I don't know what's happening.

278
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,377
Everything I write is terrible.

279
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,647
And the more I write,
the terribler it gets.

280
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,399
"Terribler." Listen to me.
I totally can't even talk.

281
00:17:48,574 --> 00:17:51,682
Let me see. You're probably
just being hard on yourself.

282
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,092
- I'm ruined.
- You're not.

283
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:05,875
- You got to get out of your head.
- And how do I do that,

284
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,560
by banging it against the wall?
'Cause I already tried that.

285
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:10,427
I'll figure something out.

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,890
I'm sorry. It was supposed to be just
us, but my dad invited a few friends.

287
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:23,093
My half-sister Kate might be here.
You'd like Kate. She's really nice.

288
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,677
Like, obsessed with horses,
but really nice.

289
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:30,234
Please, if you keep talking about this
contract, I'll throw you on the grill.

290
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,327
Have it your way, but if the deal
doesn't close, don't call me crying.

291
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:35,335
- I'll call you screaming.
- Whatever.

292
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:36,782
Dad, you remember...

293
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,034
Don't bill me for
this hour, either, Arthur.

294
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,478
Dad, this is Silver from the match.

295
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,111
Hi, Silver.
What an unusual name.

296
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,625
- Actually, it's...
- I hope you're hungry.

297
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,475
Take a look at this piece of meat.
Is this not gorgeous?

298
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:50,879
Come on. Peter Luger.

299
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,761
- Actually, Silver's a vegetarian.
- Does she eat chicken?

300
00:18:58,048 --> 00:18:59,346
Not so much.

301
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,558
Let's see, maybe I've got a veggie
burger with your name on it.

302
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,574
- Put it right there.
- Perfect.

303
00:19:05,741 --> 00:19:07,521
So, Teddy says
you don't play tennis.

304
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,973
Sadly I don't.

305
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:14,236
- But I...
- Silver's really into the Blaze.

306
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,681
What is that?
Is that a junior arsonist club?

307
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,008
It's like a magazine.

308
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:21,118
It's like a newspaper,

309
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:25,124
- but actually, it's more of a news...
- Silver's a journalist.

310
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:29,537
In my field, I've met hundreds of
journalists, and I never liked one.

311
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,353
Dr. Fun to the rescue!

312
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,318
I don't see how playing Skee-Ball
is gonna get this song written.

313
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:51,168
Trust me, if you aren't inspired
and out of your head in one hour,

314
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:53,241
I will release you
from my clutches. Deal?

315
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:54,408
Deal.

316
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:56,058
Dr. Fun?

317
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,957
See that homeless man
in the white shirt?

318
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:01,024
I think that's Mr. Matthews.

319
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,197
I got into a little tussle
with this chili dog,

320
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:13,782
and I have to admit defeat,
cause just... look at it.

321
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:16,715
It's a worthy adversary.

322
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,383
Are you cool?

323
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:24,264
Why, don't I look cool...
hanging on to the trash can.

324
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,264
Are you sure you're okay?

325
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,396
Guys, please.
This "Mr. Matthews,"

326
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:31,271
it's so formal.

327
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,982
When we're outside of school,
try something like

328
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:36,581
"Mr. Ryan... Matthews."

329
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:40,766
I'm gonna hit the road.
Papers to grade.

330
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:43,283
You're both getting A's.

331
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:45,128
All right.

332
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:49,206
- Wait, are you calling a taxi?
- Taxi.

333
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,852
Taxi Driver.
Great movie!

334
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,578
- You talkin' to me?
- What?

335
00:20:57,505 --> 00:20:59,355
- You talkin' to me?
- No.

336
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,858
You know, from the thing.
The movie.

337
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:03,095
Right.

338
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,406
So, are you having an okay time?

339
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,737
Sorry I'm so tongue-tied.
I feel like I'm making

340
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:27,607
- a horrible first impression.
- You're doing great.

341
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:30,828
Sorry I'm late.

342
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,833
You're, the horse lover.

343
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,233
It's Kate, right? Teddy's sister?

344
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,933
Actually, Heidi here
is my dad's girlfriend.

345
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:41,680
We met on set.

346
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,326
That's right, and in a
very good movie, too.

347
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,679
Into Arabia.

348
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,680
Did you ever see that film,

349
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,057
Yes, I did.

350
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,018
- Great film, no?
- Great film.

351
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,318
Great film.

352
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,637
You didn't like it.

353
00:21:56,276 --> 00:21:59,123
I mean, it's kind of
just a diff... erent...

354
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,343
Actually, no, I didn't like it.
It employed a bunch of

355
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,075
played-out, fear-mongering stereotypes
of Arab people.

356
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:11,025
The female characters, they were
offensively sexist and idiotic,

357
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:13,040
frankly,
it was a waste of your talent.

358
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:21,256
To tell you the truth...
I don't think you're wrong.

359
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:25,177
That woman that astrophysicist character
What was she doing in Lebanon?

360
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,804
- I don't remember.
- Rocking her gold lamé bikini.

361
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:30,182
Exactly. That's exactly right.

362
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,391
Funny girl.

363
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:45,760
Get me off this ride
before I get all Mr. Ryan Matthews

364
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:47,026
on that trash can.

365
00:22:47,193 --> 00:22:50,193
Funnel cake wasn't the wisest move.

366
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,570
No, we should go.

367
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,252
This was really nice of you,

368
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,630
but honestly, it's pointless.

369
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:02,558
I'm so stupid for thinking I could
actually write a real song.

370
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:05,334
Will you just cut it out?
I'm not gonna listen to you

371
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:08,782
beat yourself up about this. I have
3 minutes, I say we hit the bumper cars.

372
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:10,681
No, bumper cars, okay?

373
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,581
Just let it go, please?

374
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:14,142
What? Why?

375
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:15,767
Because, Ade...

376
00:23:16,741 --> 00:23:17,980
you can do this.

377
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,600
I know you can.

378
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,975
I believe in you.

379
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:27,142
I see you like this, all depressed
and down on yourself,

380
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:29,382
it hurts.

381
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:31,699
It's like

382
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:33,704
the worst feeling in the world.

383
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,956
Seeing you happy,

384
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:38,834
that means everything to me.

385
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:51,721
I gotta take this.

386
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:55,147
Lila, hey.

387
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:59,031
I had a lot of work at the Blaze,

388
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:00,882
so I'm just hanging out at the pier.

389
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:03,675
Okay, I'll meet you
at the Beach Club.

390
00:24:09,836 --> 00:24:11,409
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine.

391
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,201
So, where were we?

392
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,262
Leaving.

393
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,493
Your plan actually worked, Dr. Fun.

394
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,792
I'm inspired. I really
want to go home and write.

395
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:24,342
Let's hit the road.

396
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:34,806
Wait, should we get some dessert?

397
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:37,726
I don't know.

398
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,253
Are you trying to prolong dinner?

399
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:47,255
Sadly, I do not see your
sister coming, Jennifer.

400
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:50,413
She'll be here.
She's just late.

401
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:53,200
Trust me, I know my sister,

402
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,495
and I know she'll come.

403
00:24:56,952 --> 00:24:58,413
I could try the mango sorbet.

404
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,890
Here she is.

405
00:25:02,853 --> 00:25:05,303
You must be Naomi.
I am Olivier, your brother.

406
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,713
Please, don't kiss me.

407
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:10,351
And sit back down.
I'm not gonna be here that long.

408
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:13,929
I think there are a few things
you deserve to know about my sister.

409
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:18,293
I'm sure Jen probably told you
she spent last year

410
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,352
pining for you, but the truth's

411
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,979
she was pretty much slutting
it up with any semi-rich guy

412
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:25,482
who would look halfway
in her general direction.

413
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:26,924
What?

414
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:30,028
And you might find this interesting:
she also slept with my boyfriend.

415
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,479
He was, what, 16 at the time?

416
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:36,785
Is this true?

417
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,547
No, of course it's not true.

418
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:47,129
You disgust me.

419
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,181
<i>C'est fini.</i>

420
00:25:52,293 --> 00:25:53,293
<i>Au revoir.</i>

421
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,533
As they say in French.

422
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,515
So I'm gonna head
back home and pack.

423
00:25:58,887 --> 00:25:59,887
Bye.

424
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,189
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

425
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,166
This is unreal.

426
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:19,202
You know, I thought
I went a little overboard, but,

427
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,580
I just hope you're not wearing
anything flammable.

428
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,957
No, way. Are these
kogi short rib tacos?

429
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,334
Yeah, they are. I know
they're you're favorite.

430
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,384
I've been chasing the
truck all day on Twitter.

431
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:31,436
I made it to Abbot Kinney and back.

432
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:34,509
Of course, I had to go to a different
taco truck for the cokes.

433
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,511
And you got Mexican cokes.

434
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,761
Of course.

435
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:39,806
Dixon, you...

436
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:45,223
Dude, what was that?

437
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:49,493
My parents.

438
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:01,400
Mom? Dad?

439
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:04,301
Hey, buddy, mom forgot her wallet!

440
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,301
What would you like me to say?

441
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:10,419
That Mom forgot the slip of paper with
the marriage counselor's address on it?

442
00:27:11,188 --> 00:27:13,673
I just feel like
you think everything is my fault.

443
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,093
Like this whole thing is...
is my fault.

444
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,513
You know what?
Save it for Dr. Silla.

445
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:22,463
What's going on in here?

446
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:25,685
You know,
I just, I forgot my wallet.

447
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,064
What is going on?

448
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:30,732
- Nothing.
- Why?

449
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,734
You gotta be kidding me, right?
Nothing?

450
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:34,459
Really?

451
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,128
I'm not an idiot, you guys.

452
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,459
- Be right back.
- I have to talk to you right now.

453
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:53,505
Right now isn't the greatest time.

454
00:27:54,831 --> 00:27:57,244
- Talk to us.
- Talk to you?

455
00:27:58,031 --> 00:28:00,749
Fine! I know that you two
have been fighting.

456
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:03,680
And I know it's because
Mom kissed some guy.

457
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:05,475
- Oh, my God.
- What?!

458
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:08,061
Look...

459
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:11,091
Mom and I

460
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,901
I have been having
some problems, that's true.

461
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,994
We didn't want to say anything
to you guys until we understood

462
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:20,031
what was going on ourselves.

463
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:26,162
We've been seeing a counselor.

464
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:28,832
A marriage counselor?

465
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:31,087
Yes.

466
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:34,671
We don't have dinner plans tonight.
We have a session.

467
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:36,717
Wait. So Mom kissed who?

468
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:39,413
That's not important,
and it's not all Mom's fault.

469
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:42,929
The problems are mutual.

470
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,709
But we don't want you
two to worry about it.

471
00:28:48,705 --> 00:28:50,699
So then there's
nothing to worry about.

472
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:54,024
You know, you promise that
everything's gonna be okay.

473
00:29:05,189 --> 00:29:06,489
We love you guys

474
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,539
and we're doing the
best that we can.

475
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:17,881
We need to get to our appointment.

476
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:20,843
Guys, this is us trying.

477
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:26,473
We'll talk about it later, okay?

478
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:35,607
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

479
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:37,955
I mean, I'm confused.

480
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:40,403
What are we supposed
to feel about this now?

481
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,324
What are we gonna do?

482
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,533
Can we talk about this later?

483
00:29:52,988 --> 00:29:53,988
What?

484
00:29:58,283 --> 00:29:59,720
Fine. Whatever.

485
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:17,607
Sorry about that.

486
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,943
Family's a little crazy, I guess.

487
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:21,749
You okay?

488
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:27,534
Sorry, about that.
I don't even know what that was.

489
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,134
Stop apologizing.

490
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:31,746
- I mean, that was...
- Messed up.

491
00:30:50,904 --> 00:30:53,143
To the victor go the spoils.

492
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:57,044
- Can I pour you a glass?
- No, I'm good.

493
00:30:58,294 --> 00:30:59,399
What's going on?

494
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:01,693
The dragon is slain.

495
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,989
You said you were
gonna stay away from her.

496
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,725
I know, but Jen is a rattlesnake,
you said so yourself,

497
00:31:08,892 --> 00:31:11,703
and you don't let a rattlesnake
slither around screwing up your life.

498
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,455
You chop off its ugly head.

499
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:17,125
You should have seen her face

500
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,246
when I told Olivier about how
she's been whoring around town.

501
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:23,151
It looked like a pen
exploded onto her Kelly bag.

502
00:31:24,838 --> 00:31:25,938
That's good.

503
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:29,053
Something's been going on with me,
and I...

504
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,222
What if Olivier's so pissed at her

505
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,392
that he locks her out
and she has to stay

506
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,463
in a cabana at the Beach Club
or something? Can you imagine?

507
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:50,971
How was the pier?

508
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,245
It was okay.

509
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:56,805
Went with Ade.

510
00:31:57,328 --> 00:31:58,791
Navid, it's totally cool,

511
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:01,503
Lila, there's something
that I have to tell you.

512
00:32:02,056 --> 00:32:03,421
I think you're so amazing,

513
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:07,759
and you're brilliant
and-and so much fun.

514
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:11,429
Those sound like bad compliments.

515
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:19,854
I realized tonight that
I still feel something for Ade.

516
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,524
I don't even know what it means

517
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,859
or what I'm even gonna do about it,

518
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,370
but I know it's not fair to you, and

519
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:29,766
I think we should break up.

520
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,661
I really am sorry, Lila.

521
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:49,695
What's up?

522
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:52,355
I'm sorry.

523
00:32:52,922 --> 00:32:54,389
I don't know why I'm here,

524
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,058
but I'm here

525
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,988
and I had a really rough night,

526
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:06,150
and I needed to blow off some steam.

527
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:09,356
- Okay.
- Can I help?

528
00:33:15,055 --> 00:33:16,205
Do the stern.

529
00:33:17,484 --> 00:33:18,496
Actually...

530
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:19,998
the other end.

531
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:40,513
It's just ironic.

532
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:43,374
All these years, I...

533
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,691
I've spent trying to relax,
you know.

534
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:49,652
Just-just trying to believe

535
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,320
that life can be stable.

536
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:56,611
That just because my family was always
falling apart when I was little,

537
00:33:56,778 --> 00:33:59,459
doesn't mean it's going
to fall apart now. Right?

538
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:03,246
Then when I finally relax...

539
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:07,966
it falls apart.

540
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:18,848
Damn. I must have been rambling.

541
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:22,383
It's been, like, an hour. I feel like
I owe you 100 bucks or something.

542
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,921
Give me a break. You can't get
good therapy for 100 bucks.

543
00:34:27,716 --> 00:34:28,766
But, Dixon,

544
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:31,918
you have nothing to apologize for.

545
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:34,725
I'm actually really

546
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:38,493
honestly flattered that you feel like
you can talk to me.

547
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,298
You're just easy to talk to.

548
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:49,613
And, look, I know you
told me not to apologize, but

549
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,889
this has got to be
our worst date yet.

550
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:54,654
I don't think so.

551
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:59,180
I mean, dates are for getting
to know each other, right?

552
00:35:00,604 --> 00:35:03,744
And I am getting to know you.

553
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:06,145
And I'm

554
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:08,272
liking what I'm knowing.

555
00:35:27,922 --> 00:35:29,085
Hey, Dad.

556
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:32,170
Silver's a charming girl.

557
00:35:32,337 --> 00:35:34,350
And she rides a motorcycle.
How cool is that.

558
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:38,469
A Vespa, but... Yeah, she is cool.
I'm glad you think she's cool.

559
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,797
You know you're my favorite,
don't you?

560
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:45,351
I'm not supposed to say that,
but it's true.

561
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:47,424
Thanks, Dad.

562
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,142
I'm so proud of you.

563
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:52,882
I know you can take this tennis
all the way if you just started

564
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:54,869
taking it a little more seriously.

565
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,238
I'm at practice
like ten times a week.

566
00:35:58,128 --> 00:36:02,017
Right, and now you're at a point
where you have to make a decision.

567
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:03,766
You going to go pro,

568
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:06,456
or you going to give out
lessons at the Beach Club.

569
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,125
I want to be Federer. You know that.
That's all I want.

570
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:12,920
Then it's settled.
No more distractions.

571
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,421
No more girlfriends.

572
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,524
Break up with her, Teddy.

573
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:40,751
Hey, superstar.

574
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:44,702
What do you say to a matinee
before your match tonight?

575
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:47,121
A movie? You're kidding, right?

576
00:36:47,847 --> 00:36:48,847
Yes?

577
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,293
Yeah, and I'll just bring a
tub of popcorn to my match.

578
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:56,092
Look, I don't just show up.
I've got to warm up,

579
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:58,800
I've got to talk to my coach,
I've got to mentally prepare.

580
00:36:59,189 --> 00:37:01,928
- I have to focus.
- Okay. I'm sorry,

581
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,975
- I didn't realize how involved...
- I got to get to class.

582
00:37:12,452 --> 00:37:14,420
Rise and shine, pet.

583
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,652
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm just here

584
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,352
to thank you for making me
ten million Euro richer.

585
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,866
That's approximately
$16 million U.S.

586
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:25,613
Croissant?

587
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:27,824
What are you talking about?

588
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:31,077
Last night, your performance
was truly magnificent,

589
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:33,251
and absolutely predictable.

590
00:37:33,644 --> 00:37:35,304
Olivier was so distraught

591
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:37,621
he went running straight into the,

592
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,966
shall we say, arms of another woman.

593
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,353
Which is exactly what he's done

594
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,900
every other time he's
gotten jealous in the past.

595
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:47,117
You wanted him to cheat on you?

596
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:50,476
When we got back together, we added
a fidelity clause to our prenup.

597
00:37:51,093 --> 00:37:53,187
A few choice snaps from my PI,

598
00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:55,606
and voila, I'm 16 mill richer.

599
00:37:56,014 --> 00:37:57,364
You're disturbed.

600
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:59,905
Now, now. Let's not get nasty.

601
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:02,787
You really should
be a little nicer to me now that

602
00:38:02,954 --> 00:38:05,700
- I'll be handling your finances.
- What?

603
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,455
I felt obliged to tell Daddy how you've
been blowing through your trust fund.

604
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:13,875
The poor guy, he started panicking.

605
00:38:14,312 --> 00:38:15,793
Luckily, I offered to help.

606
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,462
This is not happening.
This is a nightmare.

607
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,923
Naomi, aren't you hungry?

608
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,940
You beat him in straight sets.
I told you,

609
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:39,995
all you got to do is focus.

610
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,827
Give me this thing.
We'll put it in the trophy room.

611
00:38:42,994 --> 00:38:44,694
Wimbledon, here we come.

612
00:38:59,392 --> 00:39:01,589
- Let me get this for you.
- Thanks.

613
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,204
I was actually just on my
way over to your place.

614
00:39:04,371 --> 00:39:06,404
I've got to apologize.
I was thoughtless...

615
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:08,768
I'm the one who should apologize.
I was stressed

616
00:39:08,935 --> 00:39:11,458
I shouldn't have taken it out
on you. I'm really sorry.

617
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:12,825
So we're even?

618
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:15,144
- Even.
- How was your match?

619
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:18,179
I won in straight sets.

620
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,916
I assume that's good.

621
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,234
As you know, I'm not
exactly a tennis buff, but

622
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,598
- winning's winning, right?
- Except no.

623
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,898
I thought winning today would
make me happy, but when I won and

624
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:31,394
I didn't have you, I realized

625
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:33,955
it doesn't mean anything
if you're not there, cause...

626
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,373
Because...

627
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:41,981
- Because...
- Because you're falling in love?

628
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:45,257
Because I am in love.

629
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:01,479
- She killed it.
- That was hot.

630
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:04,462
You killed it, sweetie.

631
00:41:04,997 --> 00:41:06,839
- Take five.
- Thank you.

632
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:09,937
Damn, you wrote this
song in two days?

633
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:11,911
This single's gonna be huge.

634
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:13,304
It's got a great hook.

635
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,222
Did you write it for your boyfriend?

636
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:18,100
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

637
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,602
- I'm here to see Adrianna.
- Oh, she's inside.

638
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:24,188
Cute flowers.

639
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:28,330
A beautiful girl like you
doesn't have a boyfriend?

640
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,405
No. I don't.

641
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:34,158
There's no one, no special guy...

642
00:41:34,443 --> 00:41:35,409
no one.

643
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:39,538
I'm glad.
