00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,080

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,450

Otherwise,we'll never get to see each otheR.

14
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,110
I'm really not up for the cast-and-crew dinneR.

15
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,300
The whole point of me doing this play was so we could hang out together.

You go ahead.

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,280

Do you mind if we just wait here until she's out of surgery?

48
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,540

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,330
There's no easy to say this.

67
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,010
I'm pregnant.

68
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,530

I can't believe I didn't see that stop sign.

82
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,650
Hey,it happens.

83
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,960
That's why they call them "accidents."

84
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,650
I-I wasn't paying attention,and I was on the phone.

85

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,980
You know?So I had to get out before one of us got h or more hurt.

123
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,400
But,anyhoW.

124
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,830
I don't want to talk about it,so that's it.

Good night.

130
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,110
- Night.- Good night.

131
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,830
It's a proven fact that male brains mature slower than female brains.

132
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,990
Trust me,ty's,like,11 in girl years.

133
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,860
I don't know what I expected him to say ooh,are you gonna finish that?

134
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,660
ade,you gotta tell your mom.

135
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,470
Listen,if perez hilton has taught us anything,it's that you can't hide a baby bump forever.

136
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,820
I'm not gonna hide it foreveR.

137
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,360
Just until I figure out what I'm gonna dO.

138
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,020
Well,maybe she could help you.

139
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,670
My mom?

140
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,290
Yeah,righT.

141
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,890
She could surprise you.

142
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,070
She'll surprise me if she doesn't kick me out.

143
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm practically her personal atm.

144
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,340
And something tells me I'm not gonna be booking a lot of parts once I start to s 

145
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,810
that's totally gonna sucK.

146
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't know what's gonna be worse,like,my mom finding out or everyone at sch

147
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,130
oh,everyone at school.

148
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,510
I mean,it'll be a constant barrage of whispers and rumors,and this is not helping.

149
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,220
I'm sorrY.

150
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
No,it's true.

151
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,240
It'S.

152
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,500
it's gonna be totally humiliating.

153
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,710
Like,I just,I just got finished being rehab girl and now I have to be pregnant girL.

154
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:05,310
I'm just so sick of reading about how screwed up i on the bathroom walls,you know?

155
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,620
Adrianna?

156
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,530
Mom,hi.

157
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,450
I've spent all day picking up after people at the restaurant.

158
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,790
I hope you don't expect me to clean up this mesS.

159
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,270
No,I'll clean iT.

160
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,850

I'm staying at the hotel,so,no.

164
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,970
So,did you hear about the toothpaste commercial?

165

Yeah,I diD.

166
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,720
I didn't get it.

167
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,870
But I got the lead at the school plaY.

168
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,700
Damn.

169
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,100
That was a national spot.

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,320
Well,I-I know.

I can see all the effort.

173
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,400
Laying around eating mac and cheese.

174
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,580
There's a recipe for success.

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,170
it's okaY.

182
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,010
I kind of blindsided you.

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,960
No,ade,it's not okay.

184
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,170
I should be more sensitive to what you're going thr and how you're feeling.

185
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,670
How are you feeling?

186
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,870
Emotio hungry all of the time.

187
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,000
Well,look,I talked to my parents last night.

188
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,740
You did?

189
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,200
Well,sure,I mean.

190
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,740
we can't get through this by ourselves,right?

191
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,660
Riwhat did they say?

192
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:08,970
Well,they were shocand mad but after two very dry martinis,

193
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,960
they calmed down a d deancided they'd help us figure it 

194
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,010
what did your mom say?

195
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,390
Um,pretty much the same thioh.

196
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,920
Well,my parents want to have you guys over for dinner.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,740
Me and my mom?

198
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,480
Yeah,I don't know if that's really a good id 

199
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,970
well,they're very insistent.

200
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,380
They want me to take responsibility and so do I.

201
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,590
We're in this together,adE.

202
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,190
All right.

203
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,460
Now,if I order some chili cheese fr would you share 'em?

204
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,740
Yeahall righT.

205
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,590
I'm starved.

206
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
I don't know where I belong.

207
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,260
you know what we got to do to get over lver and adrianna,right?

208
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
Yeah,I know exactly what to do.

209
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,460
Find a rogue scientist who's willing to experiment with the whole eternal sunshine thing?

210
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,430
No.

211
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,580
The only way to get over a girl is to get a new gi.

212
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,060
Hell to the yeS.

213
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,610
Oh,man,who am I kidding?

214
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,320
I'm never gonna get another girl.

215
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,500
Dude,dude,what is wrong with you?

216
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,220
I'm bad at the whole dating thing,man.

217
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,060
Nah,no,you're noT.

218
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,990
It took me 11 years to get up the ne to ask out adriannA.

219
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,840
Yeah,that is a little pathetiC.

220
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,300
You know,maybe the whole mind-erasing thing isn't such a bad ideA.

221
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,910
Just,dude,I'm just saying,you kn 11 years?

222
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,660
Nice.

223
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,000
Geez.

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,870
Ethan ward is here to see yoU.

226
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,620
Look,I know this sounds weird to just come out and say it,

227
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,610
but I'm the guy that hit you,d I'm so sor and I know that doesn't mean anything,

228
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,790
but I just wanted to saywe talked to the police.

229
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,870
And we're not gonna rsue any legal stuff,if that's why you're here.

230
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,880
No,no,it's not,but you could if you wante because it was totally my fault.

231
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,320
I was on the phone and I didn't see the stop sign,and.

232
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,430
you know,the important thing is that we're both all right.

233
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,410
You have a punctured lung.

234
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,590
Honestly,it sounds a lot wo than it really iS.

235
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,180
I promisE.

236
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,100
Thanks.

237
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,530
I should really be thanking yoU.

238
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,910
I mean,you got me out of this killer math test on wednesday.

239
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,910
Oh,yeah?

240
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,650
What,what school do you go to?

241
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,900
What?

242
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,880
You're in high school,right?

243
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,660
Yeah.

244
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,860
I go to west bever 

245
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,110
I'm in your french class.

246
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,410
Oh,I'I'm really sorry.

247
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,130
Sorry for what?

248
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,880
Sorry for not knowing who I am?

249
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,080
Why would you?

250
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,910
I'm not cool.

251
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,450
I'm not populaR.

252
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,350
You obviously just live in your own little bubble,

253
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,100
where people like me don't even registeR.

254
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,840
That's not true.

255
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,790
When was the last time you talked to somebody

256
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,490
who wasn't running for homecoming queen or didn't play varsity sport?

257
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,020
We exist,ethaN.

258
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,450
And some of us are really interesting people.

259
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,950
I'm not like t

260
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,410
I'm feeling really tired.

261
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,500
You should probably go.

262
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,540
Mom,dad.

263
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,130

Well,thanks for having mE.

274
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,470
Where's your mother,dear?

275
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,230
Ah,she wanted to come,but she couldn't get off work last minute.

276
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,390
We'll meet another time,I'm sure.

277
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,340
Sit.Please.

278
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,570
Yes,make yourself comfortable.

279
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,970
We're still a few minutes from dinne 

280
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,290
So.

281
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,470
What does your mother do?

282
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,540
She's,uh.

283
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,970
in the restaurant business.

284
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,900
Tough work.

285
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,150
Long hours.

286
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,820
I used to bus tables at the club in high schohardest job I ever had.

287
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,940
Y-y-you were a busboy?

288
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,550
Why is that so hard to believe?

289
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,110
Oh,because neither of us has ever seen you pick up a damn thing in this house.

290
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,980
So.

291
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,230
shall we get down to it?

292
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,830
Sure.

293
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,430
How are you feeling,dear?

294
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,250
Oh,um.

295
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,190
I'm ok good,because that's the most important thing:

296
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,200
You have to take care of yourself.

297
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,730
Do you have a good doctor?

298
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,530
Not yet.

299
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,800
But I went to a clinic,and everything looks fine.

300
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,670
First thing,we'll have to get you a doctoR.

301
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,720
And don't you worrY.

302
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,120
We'll take care of the cost.

303
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,950
Oh,don't argue with him,dear; he's very stubborn.

304
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,310
We want to help you,adrianna.

305
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,110
You're only 16; you shouldn't have to deal with this al

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,230
dinner is readY.

307
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,180

Vous allez.

323
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,270
Real insight into character isn't found onstagE.

324
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,810
It's found in rehearsaL.

325

Miss cas I-I want to ask her what I did wrong in-in the audition,

340
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,580
but I'm afraid that if I ask her,she'll think that I tho that I should get the lead,

341
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,740
which,which I did not thi and I don't want her to think that I though

342
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,850
what do you think?

343
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,560
I think that you're overthinking iT.

344
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,350
Really?

345
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,160
Should I send her balloons?

346
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,600

Balloons?

What's wrong with balloons?

352
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,920
NothinG.

353
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,700
Um,just kind of impersonaL.

354
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,340
Well,how am I supposed to get her something personal?

355
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,520
I don't know her.

356
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,270

00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,350
Uh,no.

361
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,030
My mom had to work,so she couldn't make

362
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,020
I'm a close friend.

363
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,540
Gotcha.

364
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,960
It says here,there's a history of drug abusE.

365
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,880
Um,yeah,but I'm clean noW.

366
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,810
Even so,I'd like her to have an amnio,though.

367
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,960
What's an amnio?

368
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,730
Under local anesthesia,we run a thin needle into the amniotic sac and extract a little fluid.

369
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,490
And from that fluid,we can test the fetus for abnormalitieS.

370
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,120
Normally we don't do it for a girl your age,but.

371
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,040
with your history,I really think it's a good idea.

372
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,000
I mean,god forbid anything's wrong,we'll know.

373
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,050
Okay.

374
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,350
Great.

375
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,340
First things first.

376
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,790
You need an ultrasound.

377
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,210
Lift up your shi.

378
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,110
Okay,adrianna,there's your babY.

379
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,820
Those are the legS.

380
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:56,130
And the arthat's the nosE.

381
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,910
And an ear.

382
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,160
It just.

383
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,420
it just...didn't seem real bef

384
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,120
I know.

385
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,060
********

386
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,920
*****

387
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,020
Thanks again for all the maternity classeS.

388
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,100
You're welcome,honeY.

389
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,450
Before you go,I wanted to give you this.

390
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,640
"Peaceful vista"?

391
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,870
It's in new mexico.

392
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,830
Once you to start to show,you can go there,and stay until you deliver the baby.

393
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,290
It's supposed to be gorgeous.

394
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,250
A friend of a friend's went,a friend of a friend's went,and she said it was like a spa vacatioN.

395
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,750
It looks beautiful.

396
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,890
Oh,and this is for your mother,dear.

397
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,220
It's a legal contract just laying out the terms of our financial commitment.

398
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,210
It says we'll pay for your stay,and after,we'll arrange for the adoption of the child.

399
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,830
The adoption?

400
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,860
Well,there are a lot of deserving people who can't have kids,and what other choice is there?

401
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,820
I guess I hadn't really thought about it.

402
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,140
Well,I guess it's time to start.

403
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,450
Have your mother look it over.

404
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,990
And if the terms are agreeable,which I'm sure they will,then that will be that.

405
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,560
Okay?

406
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,340
Ok 

407
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,550
what are you doing here?

408
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,810
Well,last time I was here,you were watching but there was nothing on,

409
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,400
soI'm loaning you my dvd player.

410
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,740
But then I ran into a problem when I was trying to pick up movies

411
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,720
because I didn't know if you would like action-adventure or.

412
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,120
come or romance,or horror.

413
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,540
or,uh,romantic hor which isn't a popular genre,

414
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,110
but apparently,it does exist,and apparently,the swedes have mastered iT.

415
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,140
And oh,I wanted to get you snacks,because movies without snacks suck,

416
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,050
but I didn't know if you like sweet or salty,so I got you pretzels and.

417
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,800
chocola I also got chocolate- covered pretzels in case you like sweet and salty together.

418
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,540
EthaN.

419
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,220
What is this abo 

420
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,900
I'M...I'm just trying to get to know y 

421
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:17,570
so,what's it going touh,mission impossible or the wedding planner?

422
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,360
Uh,the wedding planneR.

423
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,090
And maybe some chocolate-covered pretze 

424
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,960
want to stay and watch?

425
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,880
Oh,you have somewhere to be.

426
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
Just play rehearsaL.

427
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,930
But we're.

428
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,610
we're allowed to blow one off,so yes,I'll staY.

429
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,180
As long as you're okay with the occasional "this-is-such-a-lame- chick-flick" commentarY.

430
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,160
Yeah.

431
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,540
"When you meet a girl,you need to passively insult her,"

432
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,470
thus actively demonstrating your disintere

433
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,290
"which has the effect of elevating said girl's interest in yoU."

434
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,610
Are you kidding me with this?

435
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,690
That book worked for my cousin,avi.

436
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,650
He's swimming in chickS.

437
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,840
And he is funky-lookinG.

438
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,640
Uh,all righT.

439
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,630
Mm,I'm gonna give it a do your thing,bro.

440
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,200
Do my thing,bro.

441
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,990
Hey,what's up?

442
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,850
Not much.

443
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,150
You know,you'd be really beautiful if you didn't have that bad hai 

444
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,330
get lost,dweeb!

445
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,620
AmazamazinG.

446
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,850
I wish I had it on video,so I can put it on youtube.

447
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,730
Shut up.

448
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,260
What was that all about?

449
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,290
Um,well,navid has a bodude,don't sell me out.

450
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,420
The credo?

451
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,860
You did not read this disgusting,insulting book.

452
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,440
- No.Navid,have you met christina?- No.

453
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,420
Nice to meet you.

454
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,780
Nice to meet you.

455
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,920
So you're trying to meet a girl?

456
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,960
Well,if you want to meet a girl,don't trust th you know,

457
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,190
you should trust someone who kind of knows how a girl thinkS.

458
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,010
Me.

459
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,990
Oh,you two are really clueless.

460
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,810
You need to come to my friend's party.

461
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,260
Hot band,hot girls-- I'll hook you up.

462
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,340
No,mm-hmm.Hold on.Wait a minute.No,just him.

463
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,190
I don't need your help with no ladies.

464
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,550
Believe me,if dixon wants a girl,

465
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,440
dixon gets a g 

466
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,140
and not if "dixon" talks in the third person like a t

467
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,760
yeah,righT.

468
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,030
Touch?

469
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,730
Fair enough.

470
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,650
Hot stone massages.

471
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,160
They have hot stone massages.

472
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,160
Have you looked at this?

473
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,050
No,not yet.

474
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,230
Ooh,they have,like,a ski resort,like,half-hour away.

475
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,670
I don't think you'd be doing a lot of skiing during your third trimesteR.

476
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,890
You might be right,but I would be doing a lot of seaweed mud masks,though.

477
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,030
Sure,you'll just have to "sign away all rights to said issuE.

478
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,270
" There e a lot of deserving people who can't have kids.

479
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:41,970
Yeah,I know.

480
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,430
I saw juno,toO.

481
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,090
Look,this has a nondisclosure agreement.

482
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,260
This says you can't talk about the fact that ty's the father.

483
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,020
I guess that's okaY.

484
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,580
It also says that you can't talk about the

485
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,870
"events and circumstances leading up to and including the pregnancy and birth of said issuE."

486
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,050
Ever.

487
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,060
Basically,what we're doing now-- totally illegal.

488
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,210
I'm sure that'justverzealous lawyer talk or somethi

489
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,550
I don't know,adE.

490
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,670
This thing reads like a friggin' gag order.

491
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,950
I mean,it has seriouses amagif you don't comply.

492
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,750
What is your problem?

493
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,430
Okay,this is a plan,finallY.

494
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,110
Why do you have to be so negative?

495
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,070
I'm not being negative.

496
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,370
I don't want you to be taken advantage of.

497
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,890
Yeah,well,the collinses aren't like that.

498
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,500
What are you doing?

499
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,260
I'm gonna clear things up.

500
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:36,760
Hey,ty,it's ade call you're probably in a fierce game of dragon fury right now.

501
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,630
But if you could tear yourself away for just a minute,that would be greaT.

502
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,530
Uh,there's just some things in the contract that I find a little weird.

503
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,920
Um,not a big deal.

504
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,420
I just want to clarify them,so,um,give me a caand yeah.

505
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,980
Oh,say hi to your parents for me.

506
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,760
Okay,byE.

507
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,880
Don't-don't push yourself,okay?

508
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,790
Who are you,usain bolt?

509
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,530
You just had surgery.

510
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,560
I got to pass the old guy.

511
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,880
Ah,the competitor kicks in.

512
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,670
Okay.

513
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,750
No,his gown keeps opening and I'm sick of seeing his ass.

514
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,500
Oh,all right.

515
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,480
Yeah,no,you're right.

516
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,370
All right,let's pass him on the outside,

517
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,790
and pretend it's like the last minutes of the game,okay?

518
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,060
I should tell you that sports talk is pretty much lost on me.

519
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,130
I've never been to a game or a match or anything sports-related.

520
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,220
So,uh,maybe I'm not the only living in a bubble then?

521
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,630
You're right,but no more.

522
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,810
What,all sports all the time?

523
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,420
All new experiences all the time.

524
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,320
You know how they say your life flashes before your eyes in an accident?

525
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:43,480
Well,mine did,and all is saw was a bunch of jazz band rehearsals.

526
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,730
Ye,all I saw was one long sportscenter reel

527
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,880
there's so much more out there.

528
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,990
There's things I haven't tried,things I haven't even thought about trying.

529
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,950
Yeah,I always wanted to learn to play the guitar.

530
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,930
Then you shoulD.

531
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,910
And go skydiving?

532
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,620
Let's sign uP.

533
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,900
I've always wanted to go campinG.

534
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,940
Oh,that's easy enough.

535
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,440
I know,I just.

536
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,900
I always assumed there'd be time,you know?

537
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,190
But I'm not going to live like that anymorE.

538
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,030
I'm going to live like there's no time and that every day could be my last.

539
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,370
Carpe diem.

540
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,960
Exac 

541
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,460
miss casey.

542
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,130
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that ethan wasn't at rehearsal today.

543
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,520
He must have lost track of time.

544
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,380
Oh,it's finE.

545
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,230
Everyone can miss one.

546
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,010
Is that all?

547
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,470
Yeah.

548
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,230
No,no,um.

549
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,540
it's not that I expected to get the lead in the play,

550
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,860
because I absolutely did not,but I love acting,

551
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,860
and I really want to get betbecause this is really what I've always wanted to dO.

552
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,030
Well,your passion will certainly work in your favor,

553
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,770
and an acting clwill help as welL.

554
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,230
You have talent,annie.

555
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,910
It's just that acting is crafT.

556
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,220
You know,just like anything else,like blacksmithing.

557
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,410
You know,you're not born knowing how to be a blacksmith,right?

558
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,220
You have to study,learn your craft.

559
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,880
I'll make you a list of some good acting classes,o

560
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,560
have a good night.

561
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,800
Thank you.

562
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,580
Weezy,hi.

563
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,980
Adrianna,hellO.

564
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,360
What are you.

565
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,250
doing here?

566
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,950
Well,ty said you called with some concerns.

567
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,110
So I thought it was time to sit down with your mother.

568
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,850
I was going to leave her a note with my number,

569
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,400
but I saw her car,and i thought perhaps she was home.

570
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,390
Oh,you know,it's just.

571
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,350
it's not really a great time right n

572
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,800
you must be consta 

573
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,190
Sorry to just drop in on you out of the blue,

574
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,860
but I thought we should talk about the situation the kids are iN.

575
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,850
Especially since it is rather pressing,don'you agree?

576
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,560
Certainly seems that way.

577
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,090
it is pressinG.

578
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,170
Because,uh.

579
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,620
welL.

580
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,910
Because the baby is due in five months.

581
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,710
Naturally,I was a little surprised when adrianna said she had some concerns about the contra 

582
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,990
remind me about your specific conce um,

583
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,320
well,the collinses have been so nice.

584
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,270
They've offered to pay for the entire stay at peaceful vi and the place looks greaT.

585
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,400
And from what i hear,new mexico.

586
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,490
seems nice.

587
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:49,510
It's just not being able to talk about what happe that part of the contract seems kind of severe.

588
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,730
Adrianna,you and ty have your whole lives in front of this is not something we want to follow you around.

589
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,710
I mean,do you really want everyone to know what you've do

590
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,580
well,no.

591
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,890
But I'm not exactly sure what "done" is going to be yet.

592
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,080
I mean,I'll probably give it up for adoption

593
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,810
probably?

594
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,550
You're a 16-year-old girl.

595
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,180
What other choice is there?

596
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,330
Let's look at the facts.

597
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,770
You had a drug problem.

598
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,020
You got yourself pregnanT.

599
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,150
Then you put us all into a position where it was too late to terminate.

600
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,440
Do you really think you're responsible enough to be a mother?

601
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,500
That's not fyes,

602
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,890
I did those things,but that's because I was using,not because of who i aM.

603
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,580
I'm actually really responsiblE.

604
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,660
Adrianna,stop talking.

605
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:45,600
My daughter is someone who has been bringing home a paych since she was five years old.

606
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,300
Someone who didn't know how to ride a bicycle,

607
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,990
but when the role demanded that she ride she learned in an hour.

608
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,800
And yes,she had a drug problem,but she also kicked that drug problem,

609
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,620
and cleaned herself up,and stayed in school and got the lead in the play.

610
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,810
So let's just be clear.

611
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,970
She is very responsiblE.

612
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,620
And listen to me: This is not your choice.

613
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,210
It's herS.

614
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,400
Please,spare me the supportive mother acT.

615
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,220
You didn't even know she was pregnant five minus ago.

616
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,880
Adrianna,sweetheart,don't be foolish.

617
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,840
Don't you want your child to have a better life than you hav

618
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,440
that's it.We're done.

619
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,400
Pardon me?

620
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:30,920
Take your notes and your contracts and your superior attitude and take a hikE.

621
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,330
Wow,that waS.

622
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,040
I just need some time to thi 

623
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,820
- What can I get - um,a turkey burger.

624
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,740
Hey,is dixon working today?

625
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,900
No.

626
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,360
Is that for here or toto go.

627
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,500
Mom,I'm so sono,I'm sorry.

628
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,040
That woman was right about one thinG.

629
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,430
I've been a pretty crap no,you haven'T.

630
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,020
I mean.

631
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,360
you have sometimes,buyou've done good stuff.

632
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,890
You ught me a sled.

633
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,740
Remember?

634
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,540
And you said there wasn't going to be any snow.

635
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:13,800
So I begged and begged for it,and for christmas,you got me a sl

636
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:18,930
yeah,well.I could have taken you to where there was some sn

637
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,040
sledding in grass was

638
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:31,770
it's just sometimes it's like you don't see me as a daugmore like a cash machi

639
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,850
you got to understand it's been ha raising you alone not how I wanted to do it.

640
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,920
And when you started acting--

641
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,520
I mean,you liked it,and things just got so much easier once you booked jobs.

642
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,330
Doesn't matter.

643
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,000
Just trust me,I understand why you didn't want to tell me.

644
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,090
I wanted to tell you.

645
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,300
I just.I thought you'd kick me ouT.

646
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:59,510
Yeah,well,you are not going anywhe'cause you and mE.

647
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,460
- We're in this together- really?

648
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,610
And at first,you know,I was all insulted.

649
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,210
I mean,blacksmithing?

650
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,420
But-but then i got over myself and I looked at the classes she suggested

651
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,780
and they're actually taught by all these incredible teacherS.

652
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,860
So anyway,I filled out the application last night,an 

653
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:31,600
- annie,there's more to life than theat- yeah,I know thaT.

654
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,330
But I love it.

655
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,600
Yeah,but I mean maybe you'd love other things,toO.

656
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:42,070
I don't want to love other thin ethan,where is this coming from?

657
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,250
I've been talking just with rh about how short life is,

658
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,600
and how there are so many options out there.

659
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,210
Knyou ow,things we never even consider doing

660
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,310
because we pigeonhole ourselves at such a young age to.

661
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,490
yeah,well,I like my pigeonhole.

662
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,370
All right,that'S.

663
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,450
that's finE.

664
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,290
Then I won't talk to you about it.

665
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,530
- No,you can talk to - it's just the accident.

666
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,250
it changed thingS.

667
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,880
I mean I feel like it woke me up or somethinG.

668
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,750
Like it jolted me out of my bubble.

669
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,150
Um,bubble?

670
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,920
The bubble that I'm still in.

671
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,320
Come on,annie.

672
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,430
I'm just saying.

673
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,330
I feel differe but good different,though.

674
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,280
Okay.

675
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,520
Well,I'm glad that you feel good differeanD.

676
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,220
But anyway,um,I got to get to play practice.

677
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,620
So I'll see you at 6:30 for the eunuch scene?

678
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,110
Yeah.

Yo,how'd your friend get carolina liar to play?

680
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,040

And not pregnant.

685
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,700
Preg.

686
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,410

No,nono.

Trust me.

694
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,940
I can't do that.

695
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,660
That's why i have the booK.

00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,310
Dude,look.

00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,550
Okay.

707
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,300
What's up?

708
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,280
I'm really uncooL.

709
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,250
Excuse me?

710
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,170
I-I've been racking my brain back there to think of something cool to say,

711
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,450
but,uh,christina right here told me to be myself,so the truth is I'm just really uncool.

712
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,620
So,I'm not the kind of guy who's gonna say some sarcastic,ironic comme right?

713
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,120
And i don't even know the best restaurants,right,buddy?

714
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,950
Yeah.

715
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:27,400
And I might even drop an occasional world of warcraft reference before I remember that,

716
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:32,330
not,you know,everybody plays massively multi-player online role-playing gaso,

717
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,200
I just want you to know what you're getting yourself intO.

718
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,600
So,that way,if you do decide you want to talk to --me well,us.

721

Not over silver,h 

764
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,980

Excuse me?

769
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,080
Silver,wha.

770
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,730
She was just pretending,so you could cozy up to hiM.

771
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,960
Dixon,get your girl.

772

No,no,no.

'Cause I'm not his girL.

774
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,190
Because he dumped me.

775
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,130
Out of the blue.

776
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,040
Why would you do that?

777
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,150
I mean,what kind of "love" just stops like that?

778
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,940
And doesn't call or-or-or even care?

779
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,280
I mean,you go to parties like it never even happe

780
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,380

Silver,what was that?

00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,450
I don't know.

786
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,290
NothI don't know.

787
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,070

00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,250
Seeing you here,with a girl.

790
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,440
she's just a friend.

791
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,760
Yeah,okay,maybe she is.

792
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:21,510
But someday,someone's not going to be,and I'm gonna have to watch you and I can't handle it!

793
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,940
And then what?

794
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,580
This being in love stuff-- it's making me cra

795
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,310
so.you love me?

796
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,130

00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:59,440

00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,240
well,I ergo you,

800
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:13,630
so I'm so 

801
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,920
I just don't get why you're doing t 

802
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,090
are you tryi to ruin my life,ade?

803
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,630
Yeah,I'm trying to ruin your life.

804
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,500
Okay,look.

805
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,440
Assuming it's mine.

806
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,360
assuming?

807
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,710
Oh,come oN.

808
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,190
Obviously,we're testing for paternity.

809
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,650
That's why we insisted on an amniO.

810
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,700
My parents want to make sure they're paying for my probleM.

811
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,940
Well,it's definitely your "probleM."

812
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,230
What happened to this all,like,"we're in it together" stuff?

813
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,250
It's hard when you're fighting us.

814
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,330
My parents are trying to help make it go awaY.

815
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,240
No,this is what you're n getting.

816
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,310
It's a way for me to go away,not for "it" to go a

817
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,440
if I go to new mexico,

818
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,730
I'm still going to be pregnant with "it."

819
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,130
I'm just going to be pregnant with "it" in new mexicO.

820
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:07,040
I'm going to give birth to "it" in new mex"it'll" always be a part of

821
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,980
but the ntract doesn't allow for that,like I'm not.

822
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,660
going to even be able to talk about "iT."

823
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,110
What's there to talk about?

824
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,210
It's humiliating.

825
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,920
Yeah,it iS.

826
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,370
But it's also happeninG.

827
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:28,820
I have to deal with the situati and luckily,

828
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,500
I'm getting pretty good at dealing with humiliatjust ask your.

829
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,350
Sorry to interrupt.

830
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,330
Um,I was hoping I could get your help with somethina 

831
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:03,070
so,look,I don't really want to spend any more doing things that I'm not intO.

832
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,070
And this whole play thing,I don't know.

833
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,530
- It's just.it's just not me.- Okay.

834
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,210
Uh,but it wasn't about the play,right?

835
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,830
It was about us spending time together.

836
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,520
And we wilL.

837
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,710
Just not on a strict miss casey schulE.

838
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,550
Hey,everyonE.

because you will all know soon enoand I really can't deal with all the behind-the-back whispering.

841
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,200
So this way,you can all be shocked at once and hopefully,

842
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,130
you'll be able to deal with li d I'moi

843
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,550
so,anyway.

844
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,480
I'm pregnant.

And yes,it happened during my drug period,whicyou all clearly know about.

846
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,760
So that's about it,folks.

Oh,and as for the father there isn't onE.

848
