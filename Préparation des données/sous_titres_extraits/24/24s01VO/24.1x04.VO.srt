1
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:22,122
- You are out of your mind.
- Mason's holding something back.

2
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:25,649
- You're gonna blackmail a district director?
- Get down here.

3
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:29,806
- Bauer needs to be relieved of his command.
- Why don't you tell me about this?

4
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:32,646
- Tell you what?
- Whoever programmed this card

5
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,885
is involved with the hit on Palmer.
This came from your computer.

6
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:39,487
I don't care where it came from. I didn't do it!

7
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:42,809
Got a call from Maureen Kingsley.

8
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:47,523
She said the Gibson boy, the one who...
raped Nicole, didn't commit suicide.

9
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:48,329
So?

10
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:51,530
She's gonna publicly
accuse my son of murder.

11
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:56,162
It's Gaines. I need
an update on the Bauer girl.

12
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,813
Everything's copa. We're just waiting for you.

13
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:05,243
This is serious. We're being kidnapped.
We need to escape.

14
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:11,331
- Mom, you gotta come get us.
- Are you still at the party?

15
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:14,610
There was no party. They made us
say that. You gotta come now.

16
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:15,887
Kim! Kim!

17
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:18,282
What's going on? Teri?

18
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,250
- 911.
- My daughter's in trouble.

19
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,963
She's in North Hollywood somewhere. It
sounded like someone was chasing her.

20
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:45,685
Are you stupid? What are you doing
in the street? What are you, an idiot?!

21
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,963
No!

22
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:39,089
Keep moving.

23
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:53,405
Shut up!

24
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:55,484
Put her down. Put her down.

25
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:59,205
Keep movin'.

26
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:02,046
Shut up! Let's go. Come on, keep goin'.

27
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,124
- We have to go back.
- She's dead.

28
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:15,044
- You don't know that.
- Get in!

29
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:18,205
- Take it easy.
- You better decide whose side you're on!

30
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:20,853
We can't just leave her
in the middle of the street.

31
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,330
Nina...

32
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,762
- Nina, I know you're upset.
- Of course I'm upset. What do you expect?

33
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:41,973
Sorry. Look, the reason why I had to leave
the office is because I got a call from Walsh.

34
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:45,841
He was meeting one of our agents,
Scott Baylor. He said he had evidence...

35
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:49,482
That led you to me, I know.
But you should have thought it through.

36
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:52,963
Nina, listen to me. Richard Walsh is dead.

37
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:57,965
- What?
- He was shot. I watched him die.

38
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,603
What is going on?

39
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:06,448
He was killed cos he had proof that people
within our agency are behind the Palmer hit.

40
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,922
- Who?
- I don't know yet.

41
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:11,732
Right before Richard died
he gave me that key card.

42
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:15,522
I'm hoping that's going to tell us.
Jamey's trying to break it down now.

43
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:19,447
- You trust Jamey?
- He did. I trust you.

44
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,842
The three of us have to work together.

45
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:26,165
From this point forward we have to
assume that we can trust nobody else.

46
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:29,409
- I understand.
- Good.

47
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,809
Are you all right?

48
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:34,611
Yeah.

49
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:37,844
Work the card with Jamey.
I have to make a call.

50
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,083
Agent Pierce wanted to talk to you.

51
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,528
- Fine. Give me a minute.
- It's very important.

52
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:53,604
A minute.

53
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,525
- Yeah?
- Find anything out?

54
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:03,968
It's barely been half an hour
since you told me.

55
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:08,365
I need you to find out the source of this story.
Not first thing in the morning, now.

56
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:12,332
This can't be done over the phone.
I have to talk to some people in person.

57
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,563
I wanna hear something by four.

58
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:17,565
You've gotta let me...

59
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,724
- Where were you?
- I went for a drive.

60
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:27,044
A drive? Alone, at this time of night?

61
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:30,125
- I just needed to get away for a while.
- Away from what?

62
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,730
Everything.

63
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:40,686
They haven't told you, have they?
There's been an assassination threat.

64
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,766
- That's what all the fuss is about?
- Yes.

65
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:50,923
I thought it was something serious.

66
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:03,046
Jack. I'm screening the passenger list.
Something doesn't add up here.

67
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:06,921
- What?
- 2B. Manifest shows an empty seat.

68
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:07,650
So?

69
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:12,409
According to the ticketing file, first class
was full. Plus there was a waiting list.

70
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:15,530
Why would the plane take off
with an empty seat?

71
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:17,968
This is good.
What time does Rayburn get in?

72
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:20,726
- Six.
- Wake him up. Bring him in now.

73
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,610
Jack.

74
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,608
OK. We've got something off the key card.

75
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:33,925
The encryption is complex. I've asked
Jamey to isolate sectors. She's extracted one.

76
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:35,492
Just part of one.

77
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:38,963
That's it, just an address?
What's that got to do with Palmer?

78
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:42,204
- It doesn't say.
- Crosscheck it with his schedule.

79
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:47,048
- He's not going anywhere near it.
- Has he been near it since he came here?

80
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:47,929
No.

81
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:51,050
How about previous visits?
Connection to family members?

82
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:52,805
I can check. It'll take time.

83
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:55,885
No. Let's see what
we can peel off. Start in here.

84
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:02,129
Just the address on San Fernando Road.

85
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,649
How long will it take you to access
the next level? Minutes or hours?

86
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,691
- Hours, most likely.
- We don't have hours.

87
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:11,162
I'll check out the address myself.

88
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,127
- You want some backup?
- No. I need you here.

89
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:24,207
- What's wrong?
- I can't access our decryption software.

90
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,366
Phones are down, too.

91
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,171
It's a lockdown.

92
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:40,081
It's Mason. Hide the key card.

93
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,524
I'll handle this.

94
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:58,770
Hello, Nina. These men are with Internal
Investigations. You are in official lockdown.

95
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,321
- By what authority?
- District Office.

96
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:07,004
We're trying to stop an assassination. Can't
you find anything better to do than this?

97
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:11,644
Two agents died tonight. A lockdown's
standard procedure until we get answers.

98
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,803
- Where's Jack?
- I don't know.

99
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:23,482
Station two, coming your way.

100
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:37,323
Lockdown. Nobody leaves.

101
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:39,847
- Lockdown? Are you serious?
- No, I'm kidding.

102
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,925
- I gotta get some work from the car.
- You know the drill.

103
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,810
Fine. You take the keys.

104
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,568
All right. I assume you're all
familiar with lockdown procedures.

105
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:07,566
You remain in the building.
All communications will be monitored.

106
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:11,407
Any incoming calls without
secure access codes will be blocked.

107
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:16,772
In the meantime, continue to work on the
systems available until notified otherwise.

108
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:20,373
Who called them in, Tony? You?

109
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:22,284
Yeah, me.

110
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:26,082
- Why?
- Somebody had to. Jack's out of control.

111
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:27,526
Meaning what?

112
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:30,286
Two agents are down.
Jack was there when it happened.

113
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:32,728
You can't believe he was involved in that.

114
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:35,725
Tell you the truth,
I don't know what to believe.

115
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:39,845
I'd hate to think this has
anything to do with me.

116
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:43,926
- You think what you want.
- Could be here for quite a while.

117
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:46,964
He got past me.

118
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:53,969
All right, Nina, where'd he go?

119
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,442
I already told you, I don't know.

120
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:00,647
You let me know, we can
get things up and running.

121
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,531
I'm really sorry, George. I can't help you out.

122
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:05,604
Mm-hm. Me, too.

123
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:24,481
Senator, could I have a word with you?

124
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:35,769
I'm not sure you appreciate
the seriousness of this threat.

125
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:38,367
I get serious threats every morning.

126
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:42,844
With all due respect, this one's different.
It's a pro from overseas.

127
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:46,121
- Who's behind it?
- We don't know.

128
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:51,333
But as I'm sure you're aware, an airliner
exploded an hour and a half ago outside LA.

129
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,722
- No survivors.
- There's some connection?

130
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:56,486
Again, we don't know. We're looking into it.

131
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,211
What do we know?

132
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:02,730
That these are serious people,
and they want you dead, today.

133
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:19,011
- What about my family?
- The threat is against you only.

134
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:22,483
But of course we'll increase
security for your family as well.

135
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:25,041
The main thing is your schedule.

136
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:28,525
Today's primary day.
I'm not gonna hide in my hotel room.

137
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:32,288
Understood, but we recommend some
changes. The breakfast, for example.

138
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:37,367
The breakfast is important. The top labour
leaders in the state are gonna be there.

139
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:39,444
We're trying to keep you alive.

140
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,252
And I'm trying to win an election.

141
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:48,810
Mom said you wanted to see me.

142
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:51,612
Wanted to make sure you're all right.
Why are you up?

143
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:54,685
If I'm not sleeping by three, I'm not sleeping.

144
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:57,128
I was gonna watch some tube.
Wanna join me?

145
00:11:57,213 --> 00:12:00,250
- Anything on this time of night?
- Nothing good.

146
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:03,204
I guess I'll pass.

147
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:08,169
Heard about the threat.

148
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:11,051
Don't worry about it.
They'll take good care of me.

149
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:13,652
They better.

150
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:17,882
You better get some rest.

151
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:40,572
I'm telling you, we have
to go back and get Janet.

152
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:43,213
Are you gonna tell
your girlfriend to shut her mouth?

153
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:47,571
- She's probably dead.
- What if she's not? She might need help.

154
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,131
Why do you always do what he tells you?
Why don't you think for yourself?

155
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:58,842
- Just leave it alone, OK?
- I can't. She's my friend.

156
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,923
You know, she may be right after all.

157
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:23,801
We should go back.
If she's alive, she can ID us.

158
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:28,762
- We have to shut her up for good.
- What?! What are you saying?

159
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:33,808
You're gonna kill her?
You're gonna kill Janet, huh? Huh?

160
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:36,088
Close her mouth. Now!

161
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,892
I'm not gonna let you tie me up! No!

162
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:44,333
Sounds like she's gonna tie you up.

163
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:59,491
I just hope the girls are still there.

164
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:13,008
Oh, no.

165
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:17,245
I don't believe this.

166
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:37,925
Stay in your car, sir. Back in the car.

167
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:40,481
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

168
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:47,606
- Do you know how fast you were drivin'?
- Yes. Our daughters are missing.

169
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:50,491
We got a phone call.
We're on our way to pick them up.

170
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:53,406
- Licence and registration.
- Did you hear what I said?

171
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,451
Officer, my name is Teri Bauer.
He's telling the truth.

172
00:14:56,533 --> 00:15:00,811
We really could use your help. My daughter
just phoned from Platt's Auto Body.

173
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:04,283
Different last names.
One's married, one's not.

174
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:07,490
I just called 911 15 minutes ago.
Verify it if you want.

175
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,361
- You know what? I'm gonna do that.
- Yeah. Why don't you do that?

176
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,650
- Listen...
- I said remain in the car.

177
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:26,487
I understand that. Can we speed things up?
Write us a ticket so we can go?

178
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:31,283
The woman asked me to verify the 911.
That's what I'm trying to do.

179
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:35,161
You know, you are a real
piece of work. You know that?

180
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:41,366
- My daughter is in trouble. We're finished.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

181
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:44,729
- Relax, everyone. Whoa.
- Get your hands off me!

182
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,725
No. Stop. Don't do that.
Please, don't do this.

183
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,801
Ma'am, he just disobeyed
a direct order from a police officer.

184
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:56,286
- I'm afraid I'll have to place him under arrest.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

185
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:38,050
You know Richard Walsh was killed tonight.

186
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,806
Scott Baylor, too.

187
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,366
Did you know Jack was there
when it happened?

188
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,523
I don't know anything about it.

189
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:52,044
- And you have no idea where he is now?
- No.

190
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,727
- You're making a big mistake, Nina.
- No, you are.

191
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:59,044
When this lockdown is over,
I'll talk with the Double I team,

192
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:02,921
about some highly irregular banking
transactions traced to your account.

193
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:07,962
Trust me, the trouble Jack's in, my bank
accounts won't even raise an eyebrow.

194
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:13,484
He's going down, Nina. But that doesn't
mean you have to go down with him.

195
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,921
True love is a beautiful thing, but...

196
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,003
why go to extremes?

197
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:32,044
I know about the affair.
I mean, Jack talks about it all the time.

198
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:36,285
- Sure he does.
- How else would I know about it?

199
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:43,208
See, it is possible that Jack's not
the shining knight you think he is.

200
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:49,851
You wanna try again?

201
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:52,163
Where's Jack now?

202
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:33,246
This is Mary-138. Need a
transportation unit at the Fifth Street bridge.

203
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,325
Ma'am. OK. Please, ma'am.

204
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:39,769
1-M-38.
Repeat location with full request.

205
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,606
1-Mary-38. I need a transportation unit.

206
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:48,492
It's Teri. Leave a message,
and I'll callyou back.

207
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:52,805
Honey, it's me. I'm just checking up
on Kim. I'll call you back soon.

208
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,010
Don't move.

209
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:30,170
Dammit!

210
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:44,168
2-Adam-14. Reporting shots fired at
18166 San Fernando Road. Request backup.

211
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:50,328
2-Adam-14.
Backup on the way, 18166 San Fernando.

212
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:55,408
Stop! Police!

213
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:57,563
- Hold it right there!
- Federal agent.

214
00:20:57,653 --> 00:21:00,884
- Your badge. Nice and slow.
- Putting my gun down.

215
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:09,643
- CTU? What the hell is that?
- Counter Terrorist Unit.

216
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:14,727
This guy is not waiting for me, so you
better shoot me or help me, but decide now.

217
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:20,330
- All right, I'll help you.
- I'm picking up my gun.

218
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,085
Easy.

219
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:32,565
You be careful with that gun. I need him alive.

220
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:43,164
Throw me your flashlight.

221
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,364
Take cover.

222
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:43,442
- 2-Adam-14. Backup's on the way.
- 2-Adam-14. Copy.

223
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:45,524
Turn off your radio.

224
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:48,642
- I wish you hadn't called for backup.
- Why?

225
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:52,203
Cops have to play by the rules.
I'll have to break a few with this guy.

226
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:54,284
Who is he?

227
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:07,292
So to sum it up, Jack leaves his wife,
shacks up with you for a while,

228
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:12,163
gets bored, and then moves back home,
leaving you out in the cold.

229
00:23:13,453 --> 00:23:15,967
My personal life is not your concern.

230
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:19,648
- It is if it affects your work.
- It doesn't affect my work.

231
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:26,768
How long have you been with
the agency, Nina? Six years, seven?

232
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:28,730
Seven years.

233
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:33,603
I remember when you first joined.
You were goin' places. Everybody knew it.

234
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:38,285
It hasn't quite happened
for you yet, has it?

235
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:41,365
- You ever wonder why?
- I've done all right.

236
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:45,890
But you could have done so much better.
You had a great reputation once.

237
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:48,441
You know what your reputation is now?

238
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:52,724
Jack's flunky. His lapdog.

239
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:56,765
This is your chance
to get back on track, Nina.

240
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,086
He's a loose cannon.
Rules don't apply to Jack Bauer.

241
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,883
He does what he wants when he wants,
and he doesn't care whose life it affects.

242
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:08,612
He shot me with a trank gun,
for God's sakes.

243
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:11,730
- You withheld information.
- I was following orders.

244
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:14,452
Maybe he's following orders
you don't know about.

245
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:18,048
He violated lockdown,
and he left you holding the bag.

246
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:21,762
If he cared about you,
he wouldn't have put you in that position.

247
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:24,492
Let me ask you, would you
have done that to him?

248
00:24:26,893 --> 00:24:31,330
Fact is, I'm just asking you to do
your job and tell me where he is.

249
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,844
I don't know.

250
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:04,164
Get down! Get down!

251
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,564
Sí. Bueno.

252
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:41,728
- Maybe she's dead after all.
- We have to be sure.

253
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:51,851
- Let's just put her in the van.
- No.

254
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:06,204
- Dan...
- Shut up!

255
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:24,285
Move it!

256
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:18,883
Yeah?

257
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:22,204
- Mason's gonna wanna talk to you.
- What do you want me to say?

258
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:26,081
Jack's made it clear that
the three of us work in confidence.

259
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:30,005
- But doesn't Mason supersede Jack?
- No, no.

260
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:32,846
What we're doing came from Walsh.

261
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:37,126
George will say anything to get you to talk.

262
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:39,363
Do not be intimidated by him.

263
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:42,242
OK.

264
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:17,404
Cross me.

265
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:58,808
- The other building.
- Jeez, this place is like a maze.

266
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:04,363
All right. I've got a name.
George Ferragamo. Know him?

267
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:06,842
Yeah. I know the name.

268
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:12,923
You find anything else, leave
a message on the 802 number only.

269
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:15,447
OK. You got it.

270
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:17,524
Thanks, Carl.

271
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:47,445
You've been spending an awful lot of time
behind closed doors, making phone calls.

272
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:50,047
- Have I?
- What's going on, David?

273
00:29:56,773 --> 00:30:00,561
Phone call earlier tonight
from Maureen Kingsley.

274
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:06,765
She's digging up old history.

275
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:08,844
Bad history.

276
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:12,284
Just tell me.

277
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:23,845
She claims that Keith
murdered the boy who raped Nicole.

278
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,208
What?

279
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:30,411
Well, first, Lyle Gibson
was no boy. He was 19.

280
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:34,611
Second, he killed himself.
The coroner's report proved it.

281
00:30:34,693 --> 00:30:38,322
- Maureen has new evidence.
- What evidence?

282
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:41,364
I put Carl on it.

283
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:45,684
He came up with a name. George Ferragamo.

284
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:50,766
That's the therapist Keith went to.
What about him?

285
00:30:50,853 --> 00:30:55,051
- He claims that...
- Not that Keith confessed in therapy?

286
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:57,328
- Apparently.
- Well, then he's lying.

287
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:02,328
- You've gotta get our lawyers on this.
- Yeah, I know. I will.

288
00:31:03,853 --> 00:31:06,572
- But, you know...
- What is it, David?

289
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:13,927
I just don't understand it.
Maureen's always been very responsible,

290
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:16,971
one of the few real professionals left.

291
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:19,442
Well, I'd call this unprofessional.

292
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:23,730
David!

293
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,126
David, you can't seriously think
that our son might be a killer?

294
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,364
No, of course not.

295
00:31:41,013 --> 00:31:43,766
- Look, I apologised.
- You don't get it, do you?

296
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:46,970
- You've committed a serious crime.
- Officer, please.

297
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:49,613
Clearly he's upset. We both are.

298
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:52,332
If you could just give us a break, please.

299
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:58,164
- 1-Mary-38.
- 1-Mary-38. Go.

300
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:03,327
1-Mary-38. That emergency call was placed at
that location approximately 30 minutes ago.

301
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:05,404
Copy. Thanks.

302
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:13,367
That still doesn't justify you
disobeying a police officer.

303
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:15,444
Idiot!

304
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:34,726
- Ground units'll be on their way.
- I need him now to claim jurisdiction.

305
00:32:34,813 --> 00:32:38,123
- Where do you want me?
- Keep him pinned down at the exit.

306
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:41,046
I'll try and go round
the other side. Don't hit him.

307
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:44,409
- I won't.
- Don't hit me either.

308
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:13,245
This is the police.
Drop your weapon.

309
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:26,603
¡Dios mío! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor!

310
00:33:26,693 --> 00:33:29,491
- I told you to stay put!
- Yo no hice nada.

311
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:53,684
Over here!

312
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:58,244
- You want me, come and get me.
- Don't do it! He'll kill both of us!

313
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:03,004
Don't do it!

314
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:07,969
Come out! Drop the gun!

315
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:09,168
Don't!

316
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:12,962
Step out where I can see you
and throw down the gun.

317
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,691
Don't do it!

318
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:17,731
- I'll drop the gun, but you've gotta relax.
- Don't do it.

319
00:34:17,813 --> 00:34:19,849
Shut up. Put down the gun.

320
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,488
Speak English, asshole!

321
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:27,202
I'm putting down the gun!
The gun's going down.

322
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,442
Good work. Throw me your cuffs.

323
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,444
Oh, my God.

324
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,923
I think it might be up here,
somewhere to the right.

325
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,364
Yeah, maybe.

326
00:34:56,013 --> 00:35:01,007
There's someone up ahead. Maybe
they saw something. Roll down your window.

327
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:06,288
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what happened here, please?

328
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:10,127
- It might involve our children.
- You shouldn't let your children come here.

329
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:13,683
Yeah, I know. But could you just
please tell me what happened?

330
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:16,731
Girl was hit by a car.

331
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:19,646
Do you know where they took her?

332
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:21,724
St Mark's is closest.

333
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:25,604
Was she alive?

334
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:28,765
- She didn't look good.
- Go, go, go, go.

335
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:45,004
Hey, it's Gaines.

336
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:18,164
- Where's the other one?
- She was a problem, so we killed her.

337
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:21,808
- The body?
- No one'll find it.

338
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:25,123
- She been any trouble?
- Not at all.

339
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:40,012
You're with me now.

340
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:44,803
Be good, you'll be back at the mall
in a day or two. Be bad, you won't. Clear?

341
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,563
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

342
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:57,721
Agent Farrell, come with me, please.

343
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:08,092
Jamey.

344
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:10,846
I've already told these men,
I don't know anything.

345
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:15,051
Tryin' to protect Jack and Nina?
Don't be naive.

346
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:17,570
Sit.

347
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:23,286
Let me tell you how the game is played.

348
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:27,844
First thing they do is to tell you
that you're the only one they can trust.

349
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:32,404
That's flattering, and it makes
you trust them in return. All right?

350
00:37:32,493 --> 00:37:35,485
Then they get you to do
something you shouldn't.

351
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:39,361
Say you don't know where
Jack went, for example.

352
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:45,002
The next thing you know, Jack's gone,

353
00:37:45,093 --> 00:37:48,324
Nina's stonewalling,
and you're in the hot seat.

354
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,404
Sound familiar?

355
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:56,286
Hey, you're being used.
I've seen it a million times.

356
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:59,649
If you help me out, I'll help you out.

357
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,689
If you hold out...

358
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:12,690
Mason.

359
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:15,651
Really? Good. I'm on my way.

360
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:20,921
Seems our boy's surfaced. His name
popped up on a police frequency.

361
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:24,005
- Not that I'm surprised.
- Is he in trouble?

362
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:32,129
Off the record, just out of curiosity,

363
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:34,681
what's so special about Jack Bauer?

364
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:41,602
All right, we've found Bauer.
We're pulling out. Lockdown's over.

365
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:45,049
Hope you give some thought
to what we talked about.

366
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:51,401
Call it in as a DOA.

367
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:09,649
Everything checked out. Here you go.

368
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:11,689
What was her name?

369
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:13,331
Jessie Hampton.

370
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,728
Know anything about this guy?

371
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:21,692
- No. I gotta take him in for questioning.
- Maybe you didn't notice, he killed a cop.

372
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:26,483
- But there's something else at stake here.
- Not to me. Not to these guys.

373
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:32,124
All right.

374
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:34,647
Can I at least have a few minutes with him?

375
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:39,289
Guys.

376
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:41,364
Thank you.

377
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:44,124
Get up.

378
00:39:46,293 --> 00:39:48,648
If you tell me who you are,
I might be able to help you.

379
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:52,282
- Don't let them take me. If they do, I'm dead.
- They seem in control.

380
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:54,762
I'm not worried about them.

381
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:58,531
- Who are you worried about?
- You spring me, then I talk.

382
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,650
- That's not gonna happen.
- That's too bad...

383
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,405
Bauer.

384
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:05,768
Bauer. How do you know my name?

385
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:07,366
Time's up.

386
00:40:07,453 --> 00:40:12,083
I know more than that. If you ever wanna see
your daughter again, get me outta this.

387
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:14,807
What do you know about my daughter?!

388
00:40:16,693 --> 00:40:18,649
I'm fine! I'm fine!

389
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:20,530
I'm fine.
