3
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:14,847
Have you secured the canister?

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,683
I'm afraid not, ma'am. Our suspect
escaped beyond the perimeter.

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,686
I was told that the area
was locked down. What happened?

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,016
He had help from Tony Almeida.

7
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,232
Almeida?
He was working for us.

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,071
It only appeared that way.

9
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:30,196
Apparently, he pursued his own agenda,
trying to get his hands on the canister.

10
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,074
<i>- We're all regrouping to develop leads.</i>
- I may have one.

11
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,034
<i>As Hodges was taken into custody,</i>

12
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:39,206
he yelled at me about some larger group
that would continue on after his arrest.

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,374
If that's the case,
we need to talk to him.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,834
I need you to call
the attorney general

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,837
and draft a witness protection agreement
for Jonas Hodges.

16
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,758
There's no other way he'll talk.

17
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,925
This man murdered your son,

18
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,260
not to mention
hundreds of innocent civilians.

19
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:56,514
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

20
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:59,141
Other than kill Jonas Hodges, no.

21
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,477
I didn't mean that.

22
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:04,772
You're right. We shouldn't
be talking about this over the phone.

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,566
- How soon can you be here?
- How's 15 minutes sound?

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,868
The plan was to launch

25
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:13,197
simultaneous attacks early next year
in multiple cities,

26
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,200
so the public would finally see
that the government can't protect them.

27
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,856
They'd demand drastic measures,
and we'd step in.

28
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:21,853
We were going to supply the enemies
that want to destroy this country.

29
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:23,332
Muhammed this, Achmed that.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,252
I need the names
of the people that you are working with.

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,171
- I don't have any...
- I want the names!

32
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,842
Another attack today is all we need
to push this thing right over the edge.

33
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,664
This is no time to pull back.

34
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:36,637
We take that canister

35
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:40,057
- and finish the job off today.
- I'll contact the group.

36
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:42,351
<i>The attack will be attributed
to this man:</i>

37
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:44,228
<i>Jibraan Al-Zarian.</i>

38
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,481
<i>We're talking about launching
a new operation in the next few hours</i>

39
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,427
<i>and with only one canister.</i>

40
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,555
<i>The plan for this operation
was already in place.</i>

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,571
<i>We'd just be accelerating
the timetable.</i>

42
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,824
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,
and the group is well rid of him,

43
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,201
<i>but, in his lunacy,
he did us a favor.</i>

44
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:00,327
I say we take it.

45
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,495
Hamid!

46
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,081
Keep your mouth shut
and no one gets hurt.

47
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,599
- You understand?
- Yes!

48
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,869
How much more time do you need?

49
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,252
The material's almost
finished downloading.

50
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:46,405
Financial records are in place.

51
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,127
I'm gonna need about another 15 minutes
to alter the time stamps.

52
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:52,484
Good.

53
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:08,001
I'm gonna take this off.

54
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:11,607
You yell for help,
you and your brother die. Understand?

55
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,342
Who are you people?

56
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,951
You're putting Jihadi propaganda
on my computer.

57
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,814
These weapons...
You're...

58
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,381
You're trying to make me look
like a terrorist. Why?

59
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,736
Listen to me, Jibraan.

60
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:42,674
There's only one thing
you need to know.

61
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,220
If you don't do exactly as I say,

62
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:50,875
you're going to watch your younger
brother die right in front of your eyes.

63
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,254
And then...

64
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:55,850
I'm gonna kill you.

65
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,654
However...

66
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:01,161
if you cooperate...

67
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:05,286
there's a good chance
you will live through this.

68
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:10,104
What do you want me to do?

69
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,433
First off...

70
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:15,170
you're going to read this statement
in front of a camera,

71
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,855
and you're going to read it
like you mean it.

72
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:21,302
No, this is insane. I can't read this.
I'm not going to do this.

73
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:24,471
Okay, see, that sounds to me
like you think you have a choice.

74
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,057
Please, this is not right.
You can't do this to us.

75
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:28,635
Okay, fine.

76
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:31,103
Okay, please don't hurt him.

77
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:36,650
I'll do whatever you say.

78
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:55,946
I'll give you five minutes
to look that over.

79
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:08,046
I just finished the first sweep
with the CTU servers.

80
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,768
- There's been no chatter, no activity.
- You updated the watch list?

81
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:13,979
Yes, everyone on that list is already
under surveillance by law enforcement.

82
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,475
If one of them was gonna do something,
we would know about it.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,443
- We have to widen our parameter.
- To include what?

84
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,009
I want you to check out every Muslim
in the Washington D.C. area.

85
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:27,460
Target anyone who's working
in a sensitive government position

86
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:30,490
or in a place that might get hit.
Then start pulling the files

87
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:33,512
on every political activist
working in the Muslim community.

88
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,223
Also, I want you to contact INS.

89
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:37,876
I want a list of every recent immigrant
from an Islamic country.

90
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:40,756
- Has anybody heard of racial profiling?
- Janis, not now.

91
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:45,116
No, she's right.

92
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,072
You're right, this is racial profiling.
I don't like it any more than you do,

93
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:56,523
but Hodges told me specifically that he
was going to utilize Muslim extremists

94
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,816
in an effort to offload
the blame for this attack.

95
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,551
I need to know who he's working with,
and we're running out of time.

96
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:04,055
I don't know
a better way of doing this.

97
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:06,389
So if you do, please tell me now.

98
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,579
Okay, thank you.

99
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:19,628
I need you
to run down the list of...

100
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:28,929
- I'm sorry, I forgot what I was saying.
- INS records, Jack?

101
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,813
Yeah, run those down first
and then work backwards.

102
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:33,938
Excuse me.

103
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:39,411
This is the second time he's done this.
He keeps forgetting things,

104
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:41,859
- he looks like hell.
- He's doing pretty well, considering.

105
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,361
Considering? Considering what?

106
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:46,196
He didn't tell you?

107
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:47,724
Tell me what?

108
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,951
If there's something wrong with Jack,
tell me now.

109
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,829
He's sick, Chloe.
He was infected with the prion variant.

110
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,707
How?

111
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,780
He was trying to recover
the bioweapon canisters

112
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:00,794
and one of them ruptured.
He was exposed.

113
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:04,395
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry, he didn't want you to worry.

114
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:26,528
- Why didn't you tell me you were sick?
- It doesn't matter.

115
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:29,323
It doesn't matter?
I'm your friend.

116
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,617
We need to stay focused
on finding Tony.

117
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,202
You should be in the hospital.

118
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,151
There's no treatment for this.

119
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:42,594
There's no cure.

120
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,382
So you're telling me you're dying?

121
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,431
How long?

122
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:56,585
A day,

123
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,227
maybe two.

124
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:16,417
I've been taking this anti-seizure
medicine to keep me on my feet.

125
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,660
It's been working so far.

126
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,355
Oh, my God.

127
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,838
I'm so sorry.

128
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:29,906
Chloe, it's all right.

129
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:33,081
I've accepted it...

130
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,481
and I need you to accept it, too.

131
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:43,542
Whatever time I've got left,
I want it to matter.

132
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,069
We need to find Tony,

133
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:49,820
put an end to this.

134
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:00,494
I can't do this without you.

135
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:04,419
Please,
I need you to go back to work.

136
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,460
We strike this blow
for our brothers and sisters

137
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:30,457
who have died
at the hands of this corrupt nation.

138
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,740
Hour is here, and we are ready
for the war that is to come.

139
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:40,203
Our fighters will not rest
until America lies crippled and dying,

140
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:45,508
her streets running with blood,
and her people begging for mercy,

141
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:47,738
but there will be none...

142
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,803
only our vengeance.

143
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,265
We have a problem.

144
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:53,238
- What is it?
- Police.

145
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,768
Why don't you close down the computer
and get out of sight.

146
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:08,588
Take everything down
and watch the brother.

147
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:12,264
You need to come with me.

148
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,364
- What is happening?
- There are two police officers outside.

149
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:17,951
I want you to find out
what they want

150
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,036
and convince them
that everything is okay in here.

151
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:23,109
Jibraan,

152
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:25,499
don't try to warn them.

153
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:35,384
<i>DCPD. Open the door, please.</i>

154
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:44,062
Yes?

155
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:45,477
"Jibrain" Al-Zarian?

156
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,219
Jibraan Al-Zarian.

157
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:49,189
We got a call
from one of your neighbors.

158
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,794
They said they heard some yelling
coming from your apartment,

159
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,986
saw people they didn't recognize
enter the premises,

160
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,500
thought there might be some trouble.

161
00:10:58,464 --> 00:11:01,512
No, everything is fine.
Those were friends of mine.

162
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:03,912
And what about the yelling?

163
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,587
We got into an argument.

164
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:09,251
They were drinking a little too much.
It was nothing.

165
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:12,362
Where are your friends now, sir?

166
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:18,252
You know, they got too loud,
so I asked them to leave.

167
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,833
They won't be back.

168
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:22,848
I'm very sorry for the noise.

169
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,834
It won't happen again. I promise.

170
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,322
Just keep it down from now on.

171
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,149
- I will.
- Have a good night.

172
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:33,588
You, too.

173
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:53,253
All right, we're clear.

174
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:57,741
You did good, Jibraan.

175
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:00,509
We have to finish reading this statement
before we take off.

176
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:01,678
Where are we going?

177
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:04,723
Don't worry about that.

178
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,808
You just keep doing as we say,

179
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,270
and you and your brother are gonna
make it through this, all right?

180
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,181
Set him up.

181
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,900
... and there will be none,

182
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,475
only our vengeance.

183
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:31,128
And this is only the beginning.

184
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:33,654
We will strike again and again

185
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,283
in the name of all that is great
and righteous.

186
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,044
I think I've got something.

187
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,241
Agent Walker?
What is it?

188
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:59,377
One of the filters just flagged this.
I just finished vetting it.

189
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,947
These are multiple deposits
over a period of six months.

190
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,234
They're from an overseas
Muslim relief organization

191
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,671
called the Islamic League
for World Peace.

192
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:10,132
A total of two million dollars
to the Washington Continental Bank.

193
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,440
Every penny of it was withdrawn
within 30 minutes.

194
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,321
What name's on the account?

195
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,212
Jibraan Al-Zarian.

196
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:20,173
He's 27 years old, moved here
from Pakistan on a student visa

197
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,626
four years ago.

198
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:24,916
This is his personal web account.

199
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:27,598
These are some of the sites
he's been looking at recently.

200
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,995
- We got an address on him?
- No.

201
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,906
This address is false.
It doesn't exist.

202
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,702
Yeah, his visa expired.
He probably doesn't want to be found.

203
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:37,061
He does have a personal reference
on his INS form.

204
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:38,817
- Who?
- Muhtadi Gohar.

205
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,903
He lives at the G Street Mosque
in Georgetown. He's the imam there.

206
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,309
He might be able to help us
find Al-Zarian. We need to talk to him.

207
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:48,243
Put out an APB on Al-Zarian,
run it through the interagency database.

208
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,745
See what else you can find.
Fax everything over to the car.

209
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,014
Great work.

210
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:55,266
Jack, wait.

211
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,847
Are you sure you're up for this?

212
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,964
I have to see this through.

213
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:03,427
Please.

214
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:05,742
I can help.

215
00:14:08,492 --> 00:14:09,492
Let's go.

216
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:14,568
Come in.

217
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:18,746
- Ma'am, Mr. Collier to see you.
- Thank you, Agent Pierce.

218
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:20,136
That'll be all.

219
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:28,393
- I appreciate you coming, Martin.
- It's been a long time. You look good.

220
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:30,043
Thanks.

221
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:31,738
So, Olivia,

222
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:35,316
I know why you asked me here,
but I have to tell you,

223
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:38,536
having me dig up dirt
on Noah Daniels is one thing.

224
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,587
This is a whole different animal.

225
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,602
I'm aware of that, Martin.

226
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:45,561
I want this to happen.
I want this person taken care of.

227
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:48,887
It's Jonas Hodges.

228
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:50,910
- Starkwood?
- Yes.

229
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:53,808
What in God's name
do you have against him?

230
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:56,359
I don't know
how much of this will get out,

231
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:58,629
but Hodges was behind
everything that happened today,

232
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:01,416
from the planes going down
to the attack on the White House.

233
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,091
- What?
- It's true.

234
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:06,488
He's also responsible
for the death of my brother.

235
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:10,123
I thought
your brother killed himself.

236
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,495
He was murdered,
and Hodges was responsible.

237
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,381
But why?

238
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,269
It's complicated, Martin,
and I don't have time to go into it.

239
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:21,378
All you need to know
is Hodges worked a deal.

240
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,531
Witness Protection. My mother
approved it, and he's going free...

241
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:28,552
- unless someone intervenes.
- Okay, can I give you a little advice?

242
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,263
- What?
- This is big game. Walk away.

243
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:34,849
- I can't do that.
- Once this happens,

244
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,987
once it goes through,
you can never go back.

245
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:39,015
You will live with it
for the rest of your life.

246
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,524
I don't need a lecture on conscience
from you, of all people.

247
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,347
I have thought this through.

248
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,497
What I can't live with
is that monster getting away with this.

249
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
He has to pay for what he did.

250
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:09,729
So, where's Hodges now?

251
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,669
In FBI custody,

252
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:13,094
downtown bureau.

253
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:15,037
Deal has been signed.

254
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:17,851
He's being released into witness
protection within the hour.

255
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:20,020
Here's his itinerary.

256
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:25,562
When he walks out that door,
we lose him.

257
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,776
He disappears forever.
This has got to happen fast.

258
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:39,951
All right.

259
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,113
I'll make a call.

260
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:44,461
I'll get you contact information,
a price,

261
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:47,213
and instructions
on how to transfer the funds.

262
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:49,405
Thank you.

263
00:16:51,224 --> 00:16:52,927
You'll hear from me soon.

264
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:21,669
This is U.S. Marshal Sullivan.

265
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:24,379
I'm placing you in his custody.

266
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,670
He'll take you
to witness protection.

267
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:32,271
Thank you for your hospitality,
young lady.

268
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:39,512
This dossier outlines your new identity,
your new place of residence,

269
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:42,811
all the information you're going
to need to make this transition.

270
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:48,645
Robert Tippett?
That's my new name?

271
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,610
Yes, sir.

272
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:55,252
Sounds like a dog breed.

273
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:00,997
Our first stop
is the WITT-SEC facility in Colorado.

274
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,434
We'll put the finishing touches
on your new biography,

275
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,159
fabricate your new ID,

276
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,043
get you into counseling.

277
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:08,811
Counseling?

278
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:13,194
It helps entrants deal
with their new circumstances.

279
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,860
Son, you know who I am.
Do I impress you

280
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:18,847
as someone who needs therapy
to cope with new circumstances?

281
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,058
The service is available
if you want it, sir,

282
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:24,643
courtesy of the American taxpayer.

283
00:18:25,717 --> 00:18:28,217
You think I'm getting off easy,
don't you?

284
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:29,899
I don't think anything.

285
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:34,237
I can smell attitude, son,

286
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:37,752
and you're giving it off
pretty thick.

287
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,271
I've lost everything.

288
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,083
My company, my family,

289
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,420
and most importantly, my name.

290
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:50,754
You know how much blood and sweat went
into making that name mean something?

291
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:56,427
We leave for Andrews Air Force Base
in 30 minutes.

292
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,252
I suggest you get ready.

293
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,350
I'm fine.

294
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:41,594
We don't even know that they've done
anything yet. They could be innocent.

295
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,177
Innocent? You heard Hodges.

296
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:45,765
They're gonna use sleeper cells
to carry out these attacks.

297
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,979
Al-Zarian might not be knowingly
complicit about what happened today,

298
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,739
but innocent? No.

299
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:00,740
This is Agent Walker with FBI.
Mr. Gohar?

300
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:05,737
We're sorry to bother you at such
a late hour, but we need your help.

301
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,998
<i>- My help?</i>
- To stop a potential terrorist attack.

302
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:15,692
Mr. Gohar?

303
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:18,967
I know you.

304
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:22,220
My name is Jack Bauer.

305
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:24,602
Of course.

306
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,963
I watched your testimony
on television.

307
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:30,395
Sir, can we talk to you inside?

308
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:32,381
Please.

309
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,466
What do you want?

310
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,570
We're looking for a man
who worships here.

311
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,846
We believe he may be helping
to plan another attack

312
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,639
that may be happening soon, in D.C.

313
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:10,398
I knew the blame
would eventually fall on us.

314
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:13,062
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.
Do you know him?

315
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,446
And why do you think
he's a terrorist?

316
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:18,421
He fits a specific profile.

317
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:21,576
- You mean, he is a Muslim.
- He's a Pakistani national.

318
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:24,470
His VISA lapsed a year ago.
And he has no legal address.

319
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:27,046
He listed you as a personal reference
on his INS form.

320
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:30,176
Where someone worships is private
information, protected by law.

321
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:33,875
Finding Al-Zarian is the only way
to prevent an attack against civilians.

322
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,377
So, I ask you again, sir,
do you know him?

323
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,130
Look at the photo!

324
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,950
Yes, I know him.
But he is not a terrorist!

325
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,684
What makes you so sure?

326
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:55,497
Jibraan has come to me many times
for spiritual advice.

327
00:21:55,622 --> 00:21:56,872
I know the man.

328
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:59,930
He is not violent
and he is not an extremist.

329
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:02,320
We have evidence
that indicates otherwise.

330
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,674
- I would like to see this evidence.
- Listen to me.

331
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,774
We did not come here
to debate this with you.

332
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:08,854
- Where does he live?
- I don't know.

333
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,586
- Where does he work?
- I don't know.

334
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:13,790
- And I don't believe you!
- But you expect me to believe you?

335
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:17,393
I watched your hearing at the Senate,
I know what you have done.

336
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:20,045
So, tell me why should I believe
anything you say to me?

337
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,858
First because
you don't have a choice.

338
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:23,925
Second, because
I am telling you the truth!

339
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:26,719
The truth is that you come
into a house of worship

340
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,721
with information
you should not have,

341
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,681
an outrageous accusation,
no legal warrant, and threaten me.

342
00:22:32,806 --> 00:22:35,691
- I have not threatened you.
- Not yet.

343
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,954
- But we both know where this is going.
- If you're so sure he's innocent,

344
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,151
why are you afraid
to tell us where he is?

345
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,946
- Where is he?
- I told you, I don't know.

346
00:22:46,395 --> 00:22:48,895
But even if I did,
I would say nothing.

347
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:52,733
I would not help you
arrest an innocent man.

348
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:57,407
- This is Agent Walker.
<i>- It's Janis.</i>

349
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,711
A DCPD officer
recognized Jibraan Al-Zarian

350
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:02,906
from a domestic disturbance call
he took 15 minutes ago.

351
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:06,002
The address is 2700 Eastbrook,
Apartment 3.

352
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:08,163
Good. Coordinate with DCPD.
Set up an envelope

353
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,763
and put the building under surveillance.
We'll be there in 10 min.

354
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,785
We have an address on Al-Zarian.
Let's go.

355
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,201
- Turn around.
- Why?

356
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,337
I said turn around.
Put your hands up, now!

357
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,563
What are you doing?

358
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,031
I'm not letting him call Al-Zarian
before we get there.

359
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:22,918
- He's coming with us.
- You have no right!

360
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:25,175
- I have done nothing wrong!
- Shut up!

361
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,115
<i>... there will be none,</i>

362
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:31,004
<i>only our vengeance.</i>

363
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,056
<i>And this is only the beginning.</i>

364
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:40,355
<i>We will strike again and again
in the name of all that is great</i>

365
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:41,385
<i>and righteous.</i>

366
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,810
All right, fine.

367
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:46,692
The staging team's ready
and waiting on us.

368
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:48,384
This'll be uploaded in 2 minutes.

369
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,430
Good.

370
00:23:58,218 --> 00:23:59,854
We're getting ready to move out.

371
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,491
I'm gonna need you
to talk to your brother.

372
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,466
Tell him what we discussed.

373
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:08,146
Go ahead and wake him up.

374
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:11,032
Please, I can't do this.

375
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:14,398
Yes, you can.

376
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,287
And you will.

377
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:19,123
How do I know
you won't kill Hamid anyway?

378
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,461
Because we need him to tell the police
that his brother's a terrorist.

379
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:25,808
Believe me,

380
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:28,926
you're saving his life
by doing this.

381
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,760
Come on, let's go.

382
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,061
Calm down.

383
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:42,898
- Don't be scared.
- Jibraan, what is this?

384
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,310
Sorry we had to do it this way.
You're not gonna be hurt anymore.

385
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,739
We? Who is we?
What's happening?

386
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,448
- I'll explain everything to you.
- Who's he?

387
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:57,492
He's a friend.

388
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,123
Your friend? I know your friends.
I've never seen him before.

389
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,083
That's because
I have kept him from you.

390
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:04,168
What are you talking about?

391
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:06,758
I have to tell you something.

392
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:10,038
I'm not the person you think I am.

393
00:25:11,283 --> 00:25:12,093
What?

394
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,211
I hate what this country
has done to our people.

395
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:17,862
And I'm working with these men.

396
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:20,883
They're gonna help me
strike back against the evil

397
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:22,494
that has been done to us.

398
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:23,719
Strike back?

399
00:25:24,782 --> 00:25:26,566
I can't say any more than that.

400
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:30,175
I don't believe it.

401
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,905
This country brought us in,
gave us a home,

402
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,740
- that's what you always said.
- Yeah, that was a lie.

403
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:40,538
I have been protecting you
from this rage I've always felt inside.

404
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,507
But now it is time for you
to know the truth.

405
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:46,481
It was the Americans
who killed our parents, Hamid.

406
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:48,456
I'm going to make them pay.

407
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:51,370
What have you done to my brother?
You've poisoned his mind.

408
00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:52,943
They haven't done anything to me.

409
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,583
It is very important you accept
what I'm saying to you.

410
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,221
Why are you telling me this?

411
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:00,908
When they'll ask you
why I did what I did,

412
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:03,561
I want you to tell them.

413
00:26:05,057 --> 00:26:08,384
No one will blame you for anything.
You have done nothing wrong.

414
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:12,853
I know this is very difficult

415
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:15,448
for you to understand.

416
00:26:16,195 --> 00:26:18,095
But over time, you will see.

417
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,622
I love you, Hamid.

418
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:34,461
You said today

419
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:38,346
was a bad day to be a Muslim.

420
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:43,351
It's an even worse day
to be your brother.

421
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
Let's go.

422
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:49,987
Staging area's ready.

423
00:26:50,112 --> 00:26:52,742
- You stay here and finish up.
- Understood.

424
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:54,517
Jibraan, don't do this.

425
00:26:57,836 --> 00:26:59,636
- Everything set?
- Yeah.

426
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,273
Was the brother convinced?

427
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:02,548
I'm not sure.

428
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:04,577
But even if he wasn't,

429
00:27:04,702 --> 00:27:06,457
once the attack happens, he will be.

430
00:27:07,123 --> 00:27:08,123
Let's go.

431
00:27:29,572 --> 00:27:30,572
<i>Hello?</i>

432
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,427
Martin Collier said
you'd be expecting my call.

433
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:40,246
<i>He gave me the target's itinerary.
I'm set to go.</i>

434
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,398
Good, so the terms are acceptable.

435
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:45,523
<i>They are.</i>

436
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:47,847
<i>I just need you
to transfer the funds.</i>

437
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,167
What's the account number?

438
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:54,467
<i>International banking code is
victor-6-bravo-1-bravo-1.</i>

439
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,873
<i>Account number: 0-5-9-9-0-7</i>

440
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:00,021
<i>2-4</i>

441
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:01,343
<i>7-7.</i>

442
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,612
<i>After the funds have been transferred,
I'll proceed.</i>

443
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:06,721
<i>There'll be no need
to have any further contact.</i>

444
00:28:06,846 --> 00:28:08,846
All right, but what are you...

445
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:28,640
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

446
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:31,783
I thought you should know
your father has asked to see you.

447
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,423
My father's here?

448
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:36,412
In light of the potential
bioweapon attack,

449
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:39,647
the President ordered him moved
to the White House for his safety.

450
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:41,116
Thank you, Aaron.

451
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:44,096
I just have something to take care of.
Tell them I'll be right there.

452
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:45,563
Yes, ma'am.

453
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:27,066
<i>You've reached Martin Collier.
Please leave a message.</i>

454
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:29,670
Martin, it's Olivia Taylor.

455
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:32,603
I spoke to the contact,
but I couldn't go through with it.

456
00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:36,373
I decided to take your advice
and walk away.

457
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:38,698
Please call me as soon as you can.

458
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,249
It's Chloe, I found something weird
about these hits on Jibraan Al-Zarian.

459
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,751
- Go ahead.
- I said that the 2 million dollars

460
00:29:55,956 --> 00:29:58,522
was deposited into his account
over a period of six months?

461
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,547
That wasn't right.
They were backdated.

462
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:02,606
- What do you mean?
- One of the trace algorithms

463
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:06,173
caught a discrepancy, all that money was
really just deposited 30 minutes ago.

464
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:08,264
What about the extremist websites
he was visiting?

465
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:10,434
Same thing with the time stamps.

466
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,351
The hits were backdated
30 minutes ago.

467
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:14,316
Are you absolutely positive?

468
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:15,899
<i>It looks that way.</i>

469
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,824
<i>Jibraan could be innocent.</i>

470
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,817
Thanks.

471
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,428
What's going on?

472
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:25,895
Chloe found evidence that Jibraan
is being set up. He's been framed.

473
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,741
Why would Almeida frame
an innocent man?

474
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:30,745
They wouldn't want to risk the attack
not being carried out properly.

475
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,617
How could I be so stupid?

476
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,398
An innocent man is so much
easier to control.

477
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:40,060
All they needed was a Muslim, they could
create whatever background they wanted.

478
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,710
Give me your hands.

479
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,304
I am surprised.

480
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:50,502
Why? You were right.

481
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:52,437
Not about Jibraan.

482
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,719
My experience with the authorities,

483
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:58,647
the police is that they will go to any
lengths not to admit they were wrong.

484
00:30:59,103 --> 00:31:01,795
Even at the expense
of an innocent man's life.

485
00:31:02,685 --> 00:31:04,585
At least you didn't do that.

486
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:08,414
Please know that I forgive you.

487
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,839
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

488
00:31:12,386 --> 00:31:14,543
Then I hope you can at least
forgive yourself.

489
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:18,692
I gave up on that a long time ago.

490
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,708
It's never to late
to turn towards God, Mr. Bauer.

491
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:36,445
- That's enough?
- Thanks.

492
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,811
Thank you.

493
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,281
You don't need to stay with me.

494
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:44,043
But they know where to find me
if they need me.

495
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,921
I thought it was important for you
to hear what's going on.

496
00:31:49,697 --> 00:31:51,325
And for you to understand

497
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,032
why I did what I did.

498
00:31:53,157 --> 00:31:55,058
You're the President, sweetheart.

499
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,283
You don't owe me an explanation.

500
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,426
There's my girl.

501
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:07,749
Livy, you can squeeze a bit harder.
I won't break.

502
00:32:07,874 --> 00:32:08,884
I might!

503
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,740
- Sorry I couldn't come to the hospital.
- Don't be silly.

504
00:32:15,127 --> 00:32:17,927
You're a godsend
being here helping your mom.

505
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:21,453
Just knowing
you two were speaking again,

506
00:32:21,578 --> 00:32:23,857
let alone working together,
that's enough.

507
00:32:24,656 --> 00:32:27,454
Henry, I'm not sure that our détente

508
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,571
is holding at the moment.

509
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,829
Your mother told me about the deal
she made with Jonas Hodges.

510
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,350
And I know you,
understandably, have...

511
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:44,134
serious concerns about that.

512
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:48,709
I've had some time to think.

513
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:52,133
To put myself in Mom's position.

514
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:55,180
To be objective

515
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,648
and pragmatic...

516
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:59,351
the way a good leader should be.

517
00:32:59,476 --> 00:33:00,476
Has to be.

518
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:04,144
I know that decision
was horrible for you.

519
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:06,297
But I do understand.

520
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:10,534
I'm sorry
I made the choice even harder.

521
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:15,460
Jonas Hodges
will face judgment one day.

522
00:33:16,437 --> 00:33:18,621
If not in this life, in the next.

523
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,490
Mr. Tippet.

524
00:33:58,646 --> 00:33:59,646
Sorry.

525
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:02,605
It's gonna take me a while
to get used to that.

526
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,830
Always does.

527
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:06,330
I'll need to confiscate the wallet.

528
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:09,296
We can't let you hold on to anything
that ties you to your former life.

529
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:16,406
And the picture.

530
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:33,864
You like your job, Mr. Sullivan?

531
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:35,848
It has its challenges.

532
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,969
You strike me as someone...

533
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:41,425
who wouldn't be totally satisfied
ferrying prisoners around.

534
00:34:42,444 --> 00:34:44,373
I don't plan on doing this
my entire life.

535
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:47,189
Good to hear that.

536
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,850
Maybe you and I
can do some work together some day.

537
00:34:52,622 --> 00:34:55,122
I don't intend
to be Mr. Tippet forever.

538
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:19,992
Sign here acknowledging transfer.

539
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:59,185
FBI's identified the man they believe
is going to carry out the attack.

540
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,510
Bauer and Walker are on their way
to a possible location for him.

541
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:05,194
Have they found out anything
that would give us an idea of the target

542
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:06,955
- or a timetable?
- No.

543
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,249
Nothing actionable. Not yet.
Madam President.

544
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:14,259
This is Woods.

545
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:18,023
Are you sure?

546
00:36:21,544 --> 00:36:22,941
How did this happen?

547
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:27,261
Call me as soon as you know more.

548
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,315
What is it, Tim?

549
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:37,027
- Jonas Hodges was just killed.
- What? How?

550
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:39,613
Car bomb.
As he was leaving FBI.

551
00:36:41,003 --> 00:36:43,432
What else do they know?
Are there any suspects?

552
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:44,557
Not yet.

553
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,607
Excuse me.

554
00:36:53,956 --> 00:36:56,171
My guess is this was an inside job.

555
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,714
Inside job?

556
00:36:58,129 --> 00:36:59,299
Whoever ordered the hit

557
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,788
knew exactly when and where
Hodges was being transported.

558
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:02,913
Damn it!

559
00:37:04,654 --> 00:37:05,770
Get on top of this.

560
00:37:05,895 --> 00:37:08,392
I want to know exactly
how this happened.

561
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,993
Ms. Taylor,

562
00:37:19,956 --> 00:37:21,446
is everything all right?

563
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:22,986
It's fine.

564
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:24,561
I'll be right back.

565
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:35,294
Hodges is dead!

566
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:38,255
Calm down.
We shouldn't be talking on the phone.

567
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,234
You don't understand,
there's been a terrible mistake.

568
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,088
I spoke to the man
whose number you gave me.

569
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:46,234
But I didn't go through with it.
I couldn't.

570
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:48,640
- Didn't you get my message?
- I said calm down.

571
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,643
I can't! Hodges is dead,
I'm responsible.

572
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:54,632
We cannot have this conversation
over the phone. Do you understand?

573
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:56,440
Do you realize
what could happen to me?

574
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,354
You need to stop talking now.

575
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:00,707
Do you hear me?
Take a deep breath, listen to me.

576
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:03,235
- All right, we'll hang up, okay?
- All right.

577
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,489
I'm listening.

578
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:08,532
- Can you get to Pershing Park?
- No, not right now.

579
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:10,802
- I'm in a meeting with my mother.
<i>- Fine. I'll wait. </i>

580
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:12,497
Get there as fast as you can.

581
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:15,138
<i>We'll talk about this face-to-face.</i>

582
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:16,996
All right.

583
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:36,958
Thank you, Aaron.

584
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,367
What do you have, Agent?

585
00:39:00,492 --> 00:39:02,687
Armed hostile in the back room,
holding a hostage.

586
00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:05,467
- What about Almeida?
- He's not in there. See for yourself.

587
00:39:05,937 --> 00:39:08,178
- Reed, give us another look.
- Yes, sir.

588
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:13,809
Move in closer on the hostage.

589
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:17,952
- Is that who you're looking for?
- No.

590
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:20,177
That's Jibraan's brother, Hamid.

591
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:24,035
They're using him as leverage,
to make Jibraan do what they want.

592
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,434
- How can you be sure?
- 'Cause that's what I would've done.

593
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,544
It is imperative
that we take this hostile alive.

594
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:31,323
He's our only shot at finding out
where this attack is going taking place.

595
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:34,496
- I've already informed my men.
- I want to run point on this.

596
00:39:35,703 --> 00:39:36,703
Thanks.

597
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:40,025
You're going to stay here
with the backup teams.

598
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,157
Are you sure
that's such a good idea?

599
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:43,282
What?

600
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:46,378
Agent Bauer...
he doesn't seem to be too well.

601
00:39:46,503 --> 00:39:49,053
- Maybe you should be in charge.
- I am.

602
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,504
Jack was infected
with the bioweapon.

603
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:56,990
The same one that they are going to use
in this attack.

604
00:39:57,115 --> 00:39:59,255
- He should be in the hospital.
- There is no treatment.

605
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,098
He probably has
less than a day to live.

606
00:40:01,223 --> 00:40:04,619
So if he is strong enough, trust me,
he's the best person for this job.

607
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:06,361
I'm sorry,

608
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:09,124
- I didn't realize.
- Agent Walker,

609
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:10,349
we're ready.

610
00:40:10,557 --> 00:40:13,035
Please, Mr. Bauer,
do what you can to save Hamid.

611
00:40:14,075 --> 00:40:16,288
We've checked the windows.
We have a clear approach.

612
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:20,268
- Let's go.
- Agents, stay with Mr. Gohar.

613
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,929
On my count.

614
00:40:58,767 --> 00:40:59,608
3...

615
00:40:59,828 --> 00:41:00,666
2...

616
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,602
1.

617
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:09,925
Hamid, stop!

618
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,760
Put it down.

619
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:13,666
We're FBI. We need him alive.

620
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:16,098
- Put it down.
- He made my brother into a terrorist.

621
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,365
Your brother is not a terrorist.
He's innocent.

622
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,516
He's being set up.
He's being forced to do this.

623
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:21,561
What?

624
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:23,885
The only one who can tell us
where your brother is

625
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,610
is that man right there.
Now put it down.

626
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,071
Stand up now,
put your hands behind your head.

627
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:32,477
Do it!

628
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,749
Agent Walker, move in now.

629
00:41:35,622 --> 00:41:36,972
Move. On the bed.

630
00:41:40,605 --> 00:41:42,916
Damn it, he's bleeding out.
We need a medic, now!

631
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:45,436
We need a med team on site.

632
00:42:15,581 --> 00:42:16,881
Sit right there.

633
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,406
Are you in their system?

634
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:24,363
I've tapped
into the security trunk line,

635
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:27,609
I'm still looping in breakers to make
sure the tap doesn't get flagged.

636
00:42:27,734 --> 00:42:29,983
Well, we're on a timetable here.

637
00:42:30,108 --> 00:42:33,099
- How much longer is it going to take?
- 10, maybe 15 minutes.

638
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:34,855
Hand me that case.

639
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,306
What are you going to have me do?

640
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:41,766
You'll find out soon enough.

641
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:52,152
Is the subway on schedule?

642
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:54,381
Yeah, it's on schedule.
