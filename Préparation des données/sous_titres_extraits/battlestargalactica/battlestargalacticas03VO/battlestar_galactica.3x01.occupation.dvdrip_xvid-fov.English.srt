l'm Leoben.

The <i>Pegasus</i> is your command.

5
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,557
<i>(Skulls)</i> Hey, l am picking up
a large planetary body.

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,872
It's habitable. We may have just
found a world that can support human life.

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,873
l know in my gut that settling on
this planet means disaster for humanity

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,474

to win an election.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,438
l take the office of President
of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,590
l will sign my first executive order,

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,399
requiring to immediately
establish settlements

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,189
on the planet we have come to know
as New Caprica.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,956
If you want to move down there, go ahead.
Go down and cat around with all the men.

14

<i>It's a Cylon fleet. They found us.</i>

- <i>(Apollo) We have to get out.</i>
- We can't leave all those people.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,313
There's nothing we can do.
We're in no shape for a fight.

20

- <i>(Apollo) We have no choice.</i>

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,430

<i>We're leaving.</i>

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,908
But we'll be back.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,959
The Cylons just jumped into orbit.
The fleet's jumped away. They've left us.

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,509
On behalf of the people
of the Twelve Colonies...

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,679

<i>134th day of the Cylon occupation</i>
<i>of New Caprica.</i>

88
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,748
<i>Today is Mars Day.</i>

89
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,957
<i>Somehow it seems appropriate</i>
<i>to honour the god of war</i>

90
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,592
<i>on a day when it feels like perpetual war</i>
<i>is the only realistic prospect for us.</i>

91
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,355
<i>We've had no contact with "Galactica"</i>
<i>since it left four months ago.</i>

92
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,228
<i>But l refuse to believe</i>
<i>that Adama has abandoned us.</i>

93
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,872
<i>Our insurgency has been</i>
<i>striking back against the Cylons</i>

94
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,474
<i>whenever and wherever possible.</i>

95
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,314
<i>Although at times these attacks</i>
<i>seem like futile gestures,</i>

96
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,392
<i>l believe that they are critical to morale,</i>

97
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,392
<i>to maintaining some measure of hope.</i>

98
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,518
<i>But in order for the insurgency</i>
<i>to have a more meaningful impact,</i>

99
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,034
<i>we need to strike</i>
<i>a high-profile target.</i>

100
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,875
<i>It is simply not enough to kill Cylons,</i>
<i>because they don't die.</i>

101
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,112
<i>They resurrect themselves</i>
<i>and they continue to walk among us.</i>

102
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,873
<i>It is horrifying.</i>

103
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,269
<i>The Cylon Occupation Authority</i>

104
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,753
<i>continues to exert complete control over</i>
<i>the city and we remain at their mercy.</i>

105
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,310
<i>The Colonial government,</i>
<i>under President Gaius Baltar,</i>

106
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,868
<i>functions in name only.</i>

107
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
Let's review why we're here, shall we?

108
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,988
We're supposed to bring
the word of "God" to the people, right?

109
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,071
To save humanity from damnation

110
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,197
by bringing the love of "God"
to these poor benighted people.

111
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,671
We're here because most of the Cylon felt
the slaughter of mankind was a mistake.

112
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,275
We're here to find a new way
to live in peace, as God wants us to live.

113
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,478
And it's been a fun ride so far.
But l want to clarify our objectives.

114
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,835
If we're bringing the word of God,

115
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,674
then we should employ any means
necessary to do so. Any means.

116
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,230
Yes. Fear is a key article of faith
as l understand it.

117
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,348
So perhaps it's time to instil a little more
fear into the people's hearts and minds.

118
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,513
Let's, uh...

119
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,192
Let's execute Baltar.

120
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,279
What? What?

121
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,512
- That's not gonna happen.
- Just because he's your favourite toy

122
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,909
shouldn't interfere with
the larger issues.

123
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,197
- l think that l have cooperated...
- Gaius is with me.

124
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,989
Anyone who wants to challenge that
will have to deal with me.

125
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,550
If we'd killed him at the beginning,
it might've worked.

126
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,791
Now most humans think of him as a traitor
and would cheer his death.

127
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,077
<i>(Cavil)</i> Fine, fine. We don't kill Baltar.

128
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,675
We round up the leaders of the insurgency
and execute them - publicly.

129
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,833
We round up, at random, groups off
the street and we execute them - publicly.

130
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,514
<i>(Cavil #2)</i> Send a message
that the gloves are off.

131
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,309
The insurgency stops now or else
we start reducing the human population

132
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,834
to a more manageable size.

133
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,959
- l don't know - say, less than a thousand.
- We need to stop being butchers.

134
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,953
The entire point of coming here
was to start a new way of life,

135
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,396
to push past the conflict that separated us
from humans for so long.

136
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,519
And what has it gotten us? It's not like
they welcomed us with... with...

137
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,750
Oh, frak it, never mind.

138
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,391
You're all living in a fantasy world.
Consider the irony in that! <i>(laughs)</i>

Delusional machines. What's the universe
gonna come up with next?

140
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,392
Is it really worth it, Caprica?

141
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,189
Is the love of that man really worth
possibly losing all of this?

142
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,353
If you ever experienced love,
you wouldn't have to ask.

143
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,109
<i>In recent months, the Cylons</i>
<i>have been recruiting and training humans</i>

<i>in an attempt to establish</i>

145
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,313
<i>It is hard to think of</i>
<i>anything more despicable</i>

<i>than humans doing</i>
<i>the dirty work of the Cylons.</i>

<i>out of the hands of the Cylons,</i>

149
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,069
<i>the members of the human police</i>

<i>an extension of the Cylons'</i>
<i>corporeal authority.</i>

151
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
<i>And while their names</i>
<i>are kept confidential,</i>

152
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,394
<i>there's no question some of them</i>
<i>are people we might least expect.</i>

153
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,114

<i>rounded up by the Cylons,</i>

<i>but he communicates with the insurgents</i>
<i>by means of a secret signal.</i>

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,553
Looks like Mommy's gonna
get some sleep tonight after all.

167
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,198
You know, sometimes l hate
everything about this place.

168
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,511
But sometimes it's... it's magic.

169
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,916
l gotta go.

170
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,468
l'll be back in a couple of hours.

171
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,389
One of these days you're just
not gonna come back, are you?

172
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,552
You'll just vanish and that'll be it.

173
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,234
We'll never see you again.

174
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,039
And Nick will never know his father.

175
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,789
A couple of hours. Promise.

176
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,675
Uh... good to see you, Colonel.

177
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,637
It's good to be seen.

178
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,514
Yeah.

179
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,152
l know you're wondering,
so l'll save you the trouble.

180
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,231
The eye's gone.

181
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,438
Ripped it right out onto the floor,
picked it up and showed it to me.

182
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,114
It looked like a hard-boiled egg.

183
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,915
Big boom today.

184
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,950
- l hope that was you two.
- Oh, yeah. A heavy Raider, too.

185
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,873
Good men.
What's our next target?

186
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,589
l got these today. They're security plans
for the graduation ceremony

187
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,830
at the New Caprica Police Academy.

188
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,879
These are out of the Ministry files.
Where are you getting this stuff?

189
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,032
l have no idea. The source
won't tell me what their name is.

190
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,590
It's probably safer. We've been getting
stuff like this for weeks.

191
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,831
Humans working for the Cylons.
Makes you want to puke.

192
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,995
All the top Occupation brass is gonna be
at the graduation, even... President Baltar.

193
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,355
- Gaius Baltar?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,149
l think we can get a shot at him. But
it'll be tough avoiding human casualties.

195
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,836
Don't avoid 'em! Send a message -
you work with the Cylons, you're a target.

196
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,639
No boundaries for the Cylons,
no boundaries for us!

197
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,113
Anything we can do to nail that
son of a bitch Gaius Baltar is worth doing.

198
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,712
<i>(grunts with effort)</i>
Where are we on the wireless?

199
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,190
<i>(Chief)</i> Nowhere.
Every day we try and contact the Raptor,

200
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,477
and every day the Cylons
jam the transmission.

201
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,519
l've asked the inside source which of
the jamming frequencies are the weakest,

202
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,672
- but so far l got nothing.
- <i>(Anders)</i> You guys are dreaming.

203
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,069
There's no Raptor there, OK?

204
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,550
There hasn't been one
for the past four months, either.

205
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,074
<i>Galactica's</i> not coming back.

206
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,912
They're not. Accept it.

207
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,309
You watch your frakkin' mouth.

208
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,710
There's a Raptor there every day,
listening for our wireless call.

209
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,951
It's out there because that was the plan
if anything happened.

210
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,192
And it's out there because the old man
isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons.

211
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,919
The old man left me
to the Cylons, Colonel.

212
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,551
And if it wasn't for my wife being a royal
pain in the ass and refusing to let it go,

213
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,551
l would be dead a year now.

214
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,878
Any word on Kara?

215
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,678
Nothing... in four months.

216
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,111
<i>(rattling)</i>

217
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,191
<i>(door opens)</i>

218
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,469
<i>(Leoben)</i> Hi, honey. l'm home.

219
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,191
You kill me.

220
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,669
l download.

221
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,399
l come back. We start over.

222
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,151
Five times now.

223
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,238
l'm trying to help you, Kara.

224
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,278
l only want you to see
the truth of your life.

225
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,669
The reason you suffered
and struggled so long.

226
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,550
That's why God sent me to you.
That's why God wants us to be together.

227
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,671
You're right.

228
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,114
You're right.

229
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,078
And l hear you. l do.

230
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,991
So thank you.

231
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,154
Thank you for putting up with me.

232
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,670
- l'm so sorry.
- Put it down, Kara.

233
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,155
Just put it down.

234
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,238
- l'm a patient man.
- You're not a man.

235
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,153
And l'm willing to wait.
You just need more time.

236
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,676
l don't need more frakkin' time.
It's never gonna happen.

237
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,833
Of course it's gonna happen. You're gonna
hold me in your arms, embrace me.

238
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,434
You're gonna tell me
that you love me.

239
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,511
l've seen it.

240
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,158
You're insane.

241
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,152
To know the face of God
is to know madness.

242
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,395
l'm going to bed.

243
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,710
Be nice if you joined me.

244
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,959
Either way...

245
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,599
you'll be spending the night with me.

246
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,994
l do love you, Kara Thrace.

247
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,518
Good night.

248
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,831
Let me out!

249
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,911
Let me out of here!

250
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,316
l don't belong here! Let me out!

251
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,958
Let me out!

252
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,155
<i>(pilot) Racetrack,</i>
<i>adjust your centreline 20°.</i>

253
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,234
- <i>(pilot #2) Snowbird Three, in formation.</i>
- <i>(Racetrack) OK, let's nail this exercise.</i>

254
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,077
<i>(Helo) Regroup into deployment</i>
<i>formation and proceed to position one.</i>

255
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,630
Snowbird One to Snowbirds,
drop point in eight seconds.

256
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,157
OK, let's get this deployment bang on.
The admiral's watching every move.

257
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,236
Roger, Kat.
We go on your command.

258
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,073
Bomb bay doors open.

259
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,630
All Vipers break now, now, now!

260
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,997
Deploy drones on my mark.
Three, two, one, mark!

261
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,192
Frak me! Snowbird Four,
what the hell happened?

262
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,236
<i>(Kat) Can the chatter, Snowbirds.</i>

263
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,633
This is the CAG. Abort manoeuvre. l say
again, decoy squadron abort manoeuvre.

264
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,915
<i>(pilot #3) Roger that, leader.</i>

265
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,194
<i>"Galactica", Kat.</i>
<i>It is a mess out here.</i>

266
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,910
<i>We got decoy drones heading</i>
<i>every which way. Request instructions.</i>

267
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,596
Roger that, Kat. You're approaching bingo
fuel anyway. Bring your birds back home.

268
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,477
Belay that.

269
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,393
- Strike my last. Stand by.
- Launch the tanker bird.

270
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,472
Let them practise refuelling
before they recover the drones,

271
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,632
then run the exercise one more time.

272
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,631
Yes, sir.

273
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,711
16 times now, sir.

274
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,590
The next one will be 17, won't it?

275
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,871
Yes, sir.

276
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,916
Launch the tanker.

277
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,675
All units, recover drones
and prepare to run training mission again.

278
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,910
- <i>We're launching the tanker.</i>
- Tanker?

279
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,632
<i>Once you've tanked up, return to position</i>
<i>Alpha and prepare for training run 17.</i>

280
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,315
What the frak are they
doing over there?

281
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,995
This is the commander.
Get the admiral on the line.

282
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,720
Considering how long
our pilots have been in the air,

283
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,112
- l suggest we scrub the training exercise.
- If we can't do this in training,

284
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,796
how the hell are we supposed to do it
with Cylon Raiders on our asses? Tell me!

285
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,237
l don't know how we're supposed to do
any of this crap at half strength!

286
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,151
<i>(Kat) We've had a collision!</i>

287
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,437
- <i>(Apollo) Give me your status, Kat.</i>
- <i>(Kat) Bingo, Wally, speak to me!</i>

288
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,913
<i>(pilot) l'm losing flight control! We got red</i>
<i>lights across the board! l'm in a wild spin!</i>

289
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,514
- <i>l'm losing hydraulics.</i>
- <i>"Galactica", Kat.</i>

290
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,910
Emergency. Requesting priority landing
for two bent birds.

291
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,956
- Pull 'em in.
- Yes, sir.

292
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,838
Roger that.
Kat, bring your birds back.

293
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,950
This whole thing is frakking insane.

294
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,669
We got two ships at half strength,
crews that haven't seen action in a year,

295
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,719
and you're acting like the only problem
is they're not working hard enough?

296
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,475
Have you taken a look at yourself
in the mirror lately?

297
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,630
You're weak, soft.

298
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,553
- Mentally and physically.
- This isn't about me.

299
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,552
You've had four months
to get your act together.

300
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,875
And so far all you've been able to
frakkin' do is whine about how hard it is.

301
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,715
Well, guess what. It's gonna get
a lot harder, do you understand me?

302
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,110
Now, l want you to turn around
and get your fat ass outta here.

303
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,351
Get your men ready,
or l'll find someone who can.

304
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,635
Dismissed!

305
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,598
<i>(man)</i> Stay with him.

306
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,511
Good shot, Anders.

307
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,193
l don't like this one, Colonel. l think
we're the ones crossing the line here.

308
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,352
It's the only way it'll work.
The kid has access and clearance.

309
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,273
We gotta be square.
You can't back out once you start.

310
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,749
l'm not backing out.

311
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,229
It's wrong, Colonel.
You know that, don't you?

312
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,519
He's a soldier. It's not the first time we've
sent a soldier on a one-way mission.

313
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,636
<i>(Chief sighs)</i> This is different.

314
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,191
This is our best chance to take out
Gaius Baltar. It may be the only one.

315
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,838
We're gonna take it.

316
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,388
Ever since they killed Nora...

317
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,233
l got nothing to live for.

318
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,550
<i>(man)</i> All right, Duck!

319
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,515
You look me in the eye and you tell me
that you are committed to this.

320
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,591
l'm committed.

321
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,793
May the gods be with you.

322
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,236
Some things you just don't do, Colonel,
not even in war.

323
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,757
Well, maybe you'll feel different
when you're sitting in detention.

324
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,752
Duck volunteered. He's going.

325
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,791
It's a hard thing to say, but it seems like
l don't know who my son is any more.

326
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,712
The same goes for the crew, the ship.

327
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,356
l feel pretty much alone.

328
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,317
Except maybe for you.

329
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,196
l wish l could go back a year
and tell that Admiral Adama about this.

330
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,669
A year's a long time.

331
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,157
Can l ask you something
very personal?

332
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,751
Do you feel guilty about leaving
the people behind on New Caprica?

333
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,596
l don't do guilt.

334
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,716
You know,

335
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,791
a year ago,

336
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,189
when you put me in this cell,

337
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,475
l was at a crossroads.

338
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,036
l sat in here for weeks,
just consumed with rage

339
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,112
at all the things
that had happened to me.

340
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,228
Then at some point
l realised it was all just guilt.

341
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,630
l was angry at myself
for the choices l had made.

342
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,671
Betraying my people.

343
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,671
Losing the baby.

344
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,670
So, l had a choice.

345
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,110
l could either move forward
or stay in the past.

346
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,636
But the only way to move forward...

347
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,756
was to forgive myself.

348
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,831
l don't think we can survive...

349
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,710
l don't think the fleet or <i>Galactica</i>
or the people on New Caprica

350
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,075
can survive

351
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,958
unless the man at the top

352
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,350
finds a way to forgive himself.

353
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,633
Two pilots almost get killed because
they've been in the cockpit for 11 hours,

354
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,553
and he wants to bust <i>my</i> balls.

355
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,512
"You're soft."
Can you believe that?

356
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,073
What?

357
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,916
Oh, you agree, is that it?

358
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,230
Forget it.
l'm not looking for a fight.

359
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,198
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

360
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,477
You got something to say,
come out and say it.

361
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,118
He's right.

362
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,555
You are soft.

363
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,154
l'm not talking about the weight.

364
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,515
You've lost your edge,

365
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,591
your confidence.

366
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,995
You lost your war, Lee.

367
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,715
And the truth is,
you're a soldier who needs a war.

368
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,793
You don't want to hear it because
you think that your father's the soldier,

369
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,916
and you sure
don't want to be like him.

370
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,389
But you are like him.

371
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,750
You're more like him
than you know.

372
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,354
That's one of the reasons
l married you.

373
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,999
OK, it's working. l think.

374
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,548
Is it working or isn't it?

375
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,471
They keep jamming us.

376
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,438
So much for our source
on the inside.

377
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,590
Ten minutes left. And lots of nothing
on the wireless as usual.

378
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,629
Watch for Raiders. The last listening bird
almost got popped by a pair yesterday.

379
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,675
l've almost got it.

380
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,279
- <i>(high-pitched beeping)</i>
- Ow, frak! Turn that thing down!

381
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,351
It's working.

382
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,551
It's working.

383
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,758
Time's up. Spin up the FTL
and get ready to go.

384
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,230
Hold on.
l'm picking something up.

385
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,235
It's a Colonial transmission. It's a low
power signal, but the codes match.

386
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,596
Oh, yeah, we got
a link to the ground.

387
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,798
Send the coded response, spin up
the drive, and let's get back to <i>Galactica.</i>

388
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,439
l've got a signal.
A Raptor just made contact with us.

389
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,511
<i>(Tigh)</i> What's it say?

390
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,876
"Will make contact
this frequency every 12 hours."

391
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,112
"Prepare sitrep for command authority.
Have hope. We're coming for you."

392
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,633
<i>(Racetrack) We made contact! l say again,</i>
<i>we made contact with the ground.</i>

393
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,678
<i>Colonel Tigh has formed</i>
<i>an insurgent group</i>

394
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,470
<i>and they're waiting for instructions</i>
<i>on how to coordinate the rescue effort.</i>

395
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,991
It's gonna be OK.

396
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,075
It's really gonna be OK.

397
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,873
The surveillance pictures
taken by the insurgents.

398
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,509
l think we can match names
to about 50 of these photos,

399
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,751
but our best guess puts
the total police force at around 200.

400
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,831
200?

401
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,356
l wouldn't have believed 20 people
would turn against their own kind.

402
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,238
l want those names.
l want the rest of the names.

403
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,438
That's tough. The Cylons are afraid
the population will go after any human

404
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,911
- who joins the New Caprica Police.
- As well they should.

405
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,755
l know l haven't lived a model life.

406
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,789
l made a lot of mistakes.

407
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,236
l'm gonna need
your protection today.

408
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,748
- <i>(knock)</i> Mr President?
- <i>(Number Six)</i> Morning, Gaeta.

409
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,071
It's time for
the graduation ceremony.

410
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,597
Ah, yes.

411
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,316
The ceremony.

412
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,631
About the ceremony -
there's been a change of plan.

413
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,711
l won't be going.

414
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,877
Security concern.

415
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,749
Don't look so worried.
There'll be other graduations.

416
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,393
Right. OK.

417
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,552
l'll just... let the staff know.

418
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,192
We should call off the strike.

419
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,352
There's no reason to do it
if the <i>Galactica's</i> coming back.

420
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,115
Pass up a golden opportunity
to kill Gaius Baltar?

421
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,590
- Other than that, l fail to see the point.
- Think with your head.

422
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,353
The only chance they have
of getting us off this rock

423
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,515
is if the Cylons are too distracted battling
a full-blown uprising when they get here.

424
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,559
If your source on the inside says
Baltar's not gonna be there, abort.

425
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,870
Otherwise, stick with the plan.

426
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,109
<i>(PA)... poor diet, hormonal imbalances</i>
<i>or neurological disorders.</i>

427
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,839
<i>Many have found relief</i>
<i>at the New Caprica Medical Centre,</i>

428
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,036
<i>where a crack team of physicians...</i>

429
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,791
Hey, Duck.

430
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,911
<i>(man)</i> Fall in!

431
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,270
Good morning...
and welcome to all graduates.

432
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,749
You are the hope.

433
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,277
You are the dream of a new tomorrow
for humans and Cylon alike,

434
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,912
and l salute you for the risks that
you have taken for just showing up today.

435
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,592
<i>Today you begin a new career,</i>

436
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,956
<i>and a new life</i>
<i>as provisional police officers.</i>

437
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,431
<i>And, looking out across this room,</i>
<i>l see that the significance of this new path</i>

438
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,080
<i>is not lost on you.</i>

439
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,434
Congratulations.
It's good to have you with us.

440
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,318
Congratulations, Sergeant.

441
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,156
Congratulations, Captain.
It's great to have you with us.

442
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,276
l'll see you soon, Nora.

443
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,839
- l feel gloomy.
- OK.

444
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,070
<i>(sobs)</i> Oh, my God!
