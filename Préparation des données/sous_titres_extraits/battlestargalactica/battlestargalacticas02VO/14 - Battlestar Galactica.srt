1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,700
The Cylons Were
Created by Man

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,900
They Evolved

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,300
They Rebelled

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,300
There Are Many Copies

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,700
And They Have A Plan

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,700
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,700
Colonel Fisk is the
new Pegasus Commander

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,400
The cylon's fetus
contains no antigens.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,000
??????????????????????

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,600
Are you saying you found a
cure for the President's cancer?

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Yes.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,500
I've got ships on half rations...

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,800
when will some of these supplies
start getting out to the fleet?

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Target's FTL is history
She's all yours.

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,900
He's all right.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,300
I say again, Apollo is all right.

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,800
Let's just be glad that we both
came back alive, all right?

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,100
That's just it, Kara. 

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,100
I didn't want to
make it back alive.

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,900
You're not going to shoot.

21
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,900
You're not like me.

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Cloud 9
48 hours earlier

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,100
Hey, hey. Hey, don't go.

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,400
Sorry.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,400
I though you were still asleep.

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,400
You should have kicked me out
of bed an hour ago.

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
If I hold up Galactica's raptor,...

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Tigh'll have my ass.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Which me both know currently
belongs to me.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,500
All right, let's move on to
the the next item...

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Oh, no, gentlemen. Please, don't get up.

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,100
After the last few weeks, it just
feels good to be on my feet,...

33
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,100
thank you though.

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,300
You've made a remarkable recovery,
Madame President.

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,200
Remarkable, indeed. 

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,900
But, now I'm
playing catch-up,...

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,800
and I'm afraid during my illness I
lost focus. I let some things slide.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
That's behind us now.

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,100
Yes, it is.

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,600
To the point...

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,900
supplies are running
low and the people are worried.

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,200
Well, they wouldn't be civilians...

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,300
if they didn't have
omething to bitch about.

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,700
Well, I think that in this case,
they're entitled.

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,000
Our inventory levels are tight,
but they're not critical.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,300
But all the way across the fleet,...

47
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,400
people are reporting
shortages of essential goods...

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,700
and what they do get
comes at a high price.

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,700
They're turning to
the black market.

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Last week, one of my aides...

51
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
came down with pneumonia.
Billy had to trade liquor...

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to get the antibiotics.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's the nature of the beast.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
People want what they want.

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,400
A few trades would be one thing,
Commander Fisk, that's reality.

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
But, I'm talking about criminals...

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
making outrageous
demands on the people,...

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
so bottom line is, I'm implementing
a new fleet-wide trade policy.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,700
We need to be in control
of our supply chain,...

60
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,400
not black market thugs.

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,100
I am hoping that I can have the
military's support on this.

62
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,500
Admiral. If you want Pegasus
to run these dogs down,...

63
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
you just give us the word.

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,700
Our people will do whatever it
takes to get this under control.

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,500
And it's good to have you back,
Madame President.

66
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,200
It's good to be back,
thank you, Admiral. 

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Gentlemen, thank you.

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,000
Is madame President always so
"right in your face"?

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Her last-minute resurrection
seems to have...

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,300
invigorated her somewhat.

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, well, maybe too much.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
She doesn't really
think her made-up...

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,500
plans and regulations are going
to change anything, does she?

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
As if we don't
have enough to do.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,700
No, madame President sets a
great prestige by her office...

76
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,500
and Adama supports her,
at least for the moment.

77
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,400
Well then, so do I,
just for the moment.

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
By the way, did you
get the cigars I sent over?

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,900
I not only got them,
I enjoyed them, as well.

80
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,300
Oh, my pleasure,
Mr. Vice President.

81
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,200
Well, I've got a ship to run.

82
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,700
Look forward to
our next visit.

83
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,700
As do I.

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
I got them from a friend.

85
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,000
- Paya!
- Hey, sweetie.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,100
Wow,...

87
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,100
you seem to get an inch
taller every time I see you.

88
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,700
What, I don't
get my handshake?

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,800
Well, it's okay Paya.

90
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,600
I have a special surprise for you.

91
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,900
And it's in here. 

92
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,900
You wanna come see?

93
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,800
What's he got?

94
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,500
Come on.

95
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
What have we got?

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh, Paya!

97
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,500
I've never been great with kids.

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Maybe next time I'll
get one with, uh, two eyes.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
See if I can trade her
for something else.

100
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,700
No, it's okay. 

101
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,800
You just surprised her.

102
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
Well. 

103
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Well, um. 

104
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,100
Look, I'm not sure...

105
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,700
when i'll be able to make it back.

106
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,700
I know. 

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm gonna have to ask for an extra
hundred since you spent the night.

108
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,000
Well,...

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I wondered when you
were going to show up.

110
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,700
49.597 survivors

111
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,200
in search of a home

112
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Called Earth

113
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Raptor one-two-niner.
You are cleared into the break.

114
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Galactica, raptor one-two-niner
has the ball. 

115
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Inbound
speed two-two-zero.

116
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,500
Admiral, Colonel,...

117
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm just getting started,but...

118
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
from the looks of him,
I'd say he was garroted.

119
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Gods. This is the
last thing we needed.

120
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,200
Admiral,...

121
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
you might
want to take a look at this.

122
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Looks like our friend,
Fisk, hit the jackpot.

123
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Cubit?

124
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Find anything else,
let me know right away.

125
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,000
If I find anything else,
I may retire early.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,700
Someone's sending
us a message.

127
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,800
Or running us in circles. 

128
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,100
Maybe there's another
cylon in the fleet.

129
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,900
I almost prefer that
to the alternative.

130
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,200
We start killing our own,...

131
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,900
all they have to do
is sit back and watch.

132
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Fisk. 

133
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Do we have any idea who did it?

134
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,900
No.

135
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,900
But we will do a full investigation
and I want you to lead it.

136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't you think it would be better...

137
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,800
if someone from Pegasus
dealt with this?

138
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Even though Cain's gone, her
influence lingers.

139
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,900
I need someone I can trust.

140
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
You know, there were
times when that was in...

141
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
short supply between us.

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We've both been
through an awful lot, son.

143
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,900
And I hope that we've
grown stronger for it. 

144
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,300
I need your help.

145
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,300
I'll call up a flight
to Pegasus right away.

146
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Anyone else been inside?

147
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Just the medical team, sir.

148
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Do you know who I am? 

149
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,200
I am the vice President
of the colonies,...

150
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,200
let me in!

151
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,700
Captain Adama. 

152
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,300
Commander Fisk didn't tell
me  you were invited.

153
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,300
Let him in.

154
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,100
They were going to let me in.

155
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Oh, my gods!

156
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,400
What's going on in here? 

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,200
Where's Fisk?

158
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
On a slab in Galactica's morgue.

159
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,500
What, he's dead?

160
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,300
Isn't this your brand?

161
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,700
Careful, Gaius. 

162
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,300
You've bought yourself some
good will by saving Roslin.

163
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,000
But it's fading. 

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,300
Their old suspicions
are re-emerging.

165
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,500
What are you doing here? 

166
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,200
Captain.

167
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,700
I was about to ask
you the same thing.

168
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Wait a minute.

169
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,700
Are you interrogating me? 

170
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm not sure I appreciate
your tone.

171
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This isn't a diplomatic exercise.

172
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,500
A man was butchered.

173
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,900
His head was practically severed
from his body with piano wire.

174
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,800
You're Vice President of the fleet.

175
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,100
Why are you acting
like a child...

176
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,900
with your hand
in the cookie jar?

177
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Wonder what she would say if
she saw you like this.

178
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,500
You know I can't believe
it's even necessary...

179
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,800
for me to explain
myself to you.

180
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,600
But obviously, no, I had nothing
to do with Commander Fisk's death.

181
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
For the record, I just
came here to discuss...

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,400
President Roslin's new trade policy.

183
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
Oh, I-I thought that was settled.

184
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,100
No, uh, Commander Fisk
had some reservations.

185
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,600
I'll bet.

186
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,300
And as the vice President,
I decided to assuage his doubts.

187
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Of my own free will. 

188
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,900
Is that sufficient?

189
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,800
Or would you like me to
provide you with an alibi?

190
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I'm sure I can rustle one up.

191
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Enjoy the cigars. 

192
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,700
Escort the vice
President to his ship.

193
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,600
The wireless is going crazy.

194
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,100
Word of Fisk's murder has spread
out through the entire fleet.

195
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,900
When we lose a command
officer aboard a warship...

196
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,300
people are going to be
concerned about their security.

197
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,400
Crew can fall apart when
their Commander is killed.

198
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,900
Pegasus lost two
in a matter of weeks.

199
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,100
Maybe, this time,
they were lucky.

200
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,000
His personal log shows that he
was rerouting supply runs,...

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
on- and off-loading freighters
without command authorization.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,700
He raided the McConnell,...

203
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,900
and at least a dozen
other ships in the last week.

204
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,700
I also found
a small warehouse...

205
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,500
of high value merchandise
in his quarters.

206
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,300
He was working
the black market.

207
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Well, half the fleet's working it.
Fisk was getting greedy.

208
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,300
If he crossed one of
his suppliers on a deal,...

209
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,200
that would explain the cubits
that Cottle found.

210
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,500
Still doesn't tell us who did it.

211
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,600
Well, he's going to need
trading partners.

212
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,600
And they wouldn't be hard
to find, even on Galactica.

213
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
Lee. 

214
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,800
I'm scared. 

215
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Paya's cough
keeps getting worse.

216
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,700
I'll bring her something
on my next trip.

217
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,700
Which could be weeks if there's
another cylon attack.

218
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,300
I keep hearing about
shortages on the other ships.

219
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,300
People trading anything they can
for food and for medicine.

220
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,300
Really?

221
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,700
Have you seen all the
new working girls outside?

222
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,800
Lee, when your baby's crying
because it's hungry,...

223
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,500
you'll do anything
to make it stop.

224
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,400
Hey. 

225
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,900
Come here.

226
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Mommy.

227
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,400
Captain.

228
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,600
What do you want?

229
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,300
Is your wife around, Colonel?

230
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,400
No. 

231
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Why?

232
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Is this hers?

233
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,800
Oh, yeah. 

234
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,100
She lost it a
couple weeks ago.

235
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,800
Where the hell
did you find it?

236
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,800
On Pegasus.

237
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
In Commander Fisk's quarters.

238
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
She's burning up.

239
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,700
What did they say
at the infirmary?

240
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,500
Antibiotics have
all been rationed out.

241
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,500
They said they might have
something by the end of the week.

242
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,500
We got shortages across the fleet.

243
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,000
People begging for scraps.

244
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,400
Somehow, you and Mrs. Tigh
have fresh fruit, real liquor...

245
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,200
All right,...

246
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,800
what the hell is this about?

247
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,800
You must have known she was
trading with Fisk.

248
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,100
Or maybe I'll talk to her.

249
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,500
She didn't give it to Fisk, I did.

250
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,400
I traded it for a few necessities,...

251
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,400
a couple of things to help
her get by, big frakkin' deal.

252
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
There's nothing
illegal about that.

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,300
Not yet.

254
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Don't you play "holier
than thou" with me.

255
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
I haven't done anything that most
people on this ship haven't done.

256
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Including you.

257
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Doesn't make us right, Colonel,
just a whole lot of people wrong.

258
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,500
You didn't make
it to class today.

259
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,200
Yeah, I been pretty jammed up.

260
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,100
Anyway, I'm not sure you need me
holding your hand anymore.

261
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,800
Is that what you were doing?

262
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,200
Holding my hand?

263
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,700
I meant it as a compliment.

264
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,900
Permission to speak frankly, sir?

265
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,900
You don't need my permission and
you don't need the "sir."

266
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
Maybe that's the problem. 

267
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,400
I don't really know
what to think anymore.

268
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,800
So, I'll just ask.

269
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,400
Is this going somewhere?

270
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,200
Dee...

271
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,100
Please don't pretend like you
don't know what I'm talking about.

272
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,600
You know our time
together, our workouts. 

273
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Something's
changed between us.

274
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm just not sure
what you want me to say.

275
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Then don't say anything.

276
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,600
Communications paging
captain Adama.

277
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
You have a priority
ship-to-ship call, Cloud Nine.

278
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,000
Captain Adama here.

279
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,100
Shevon. 

280
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,300
Shevon, it's me.

281
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Shevon!

282
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, my gods! 

283
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,100
What did they do?

284
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,500
They said they knew
about you and me.

285
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,800
They wanted to know what we'd
been talking about.

286
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,400
I don't understand
why they'd care.

287
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,100
All right, get what you need. 

288
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm taking you and Paya
back to Galactica.

289
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,100
Lee, wait.

290
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,100
It's the only place
I can keep you safe.

291
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,200
What are you going to tell
them about us?

292
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,500
I'm not fooling myself.

293
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,300
I know what this is.

294
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Lee!

295
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Get away from us!

296
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,400
You listening?

297
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
I hear any more talk about Fisk,...

298
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,600
I'm going send your whore
back to you piece...by piece.

299
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,700
And then I'm going start
with the little girl.

300
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,000
I know who you are.

301
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,900
I know whose son you are.

302
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,500
And I don't care. 

303
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,500
You tell Adama to let it go.

304
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,300
Is that when you knew
that you loved her?

305
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,300
I thought so.

306
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,900
But you hurt her.

307
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes.
This is captain Adama.

308
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I need a medic and a security
team on L deck, ASAP.

309
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,000
You wanted to see me,
Madame President?

310
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,400
Yes. 

311
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,300
Thank you for coming, doctor.

312
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Have a seat. 

313
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,600
Would you like some tea?

314
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
I'd love one.

315
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,200
You know,...

316
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm never quite sure where we
stand with each other, doctor.

317
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,700
Why do you think that is?

318
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,000
I can't imagine why.

319
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,300
I've never had anything but the
utmost respect for you,...

320
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,900
and your office.

321
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,800
I understand that
you and Commander Fisk...

322
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,800
planned to meet just
prior to his death.

323
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,700
As I have already
explained to Captain Adama,...

324
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,300
Commander Fisk had
several lingering concerns...

325
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,800
about your new trade policy.

326
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,900
What can I say?

327
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,600
And that's it?

328
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,300
Gaius, she's afraid of you.

329
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Why... 

330
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,400
are you asking me this?

331
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,100
You saved my life.

332
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,700
And I'm grateful.

333
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,500
But I sense that there is some...

334
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,300
unease in you about
assuming the presidency, and...

335
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,300
I'd like to offer you an out.

336
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,300
You what?

337
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,200
Resign. 

338
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,600
Return to your scientific
work on Galactica.

339
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,900
No one will
question your motives.

340
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,900
You can consider it a second
chance, like the one you gave me.

341
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,200
Charming.

342
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Doctor. 

343
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,600
This is a one-time offer.

344
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,400
I suggest you reconsider.

345
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,600
You know, Madame President,...

346
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,500
I've never been particularly
interested in politics. 

347
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
I never wanted any
lofty position of power.

348
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,200
I never wanted to
be the Vice President.

349
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,500
That is, until this very moment.

350
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,700
Because right now,...

351
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,700
I can't think of
anything I want more.

352
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,500
One to the head. 

353
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,500
You didn't do this?

354
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,700
I was attacked.

355
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,400
Found him there when I woke up.

356
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,600
Security bulletin said...

357
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,700
Commander Fisk was garroted
with a wire.

358
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,600
Whatever happened,
looks like you found your guy.

359
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,000
What about Shevon...

360
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,300
and her daughter.

361
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,500
Cloud Nine's an open port. 

362
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,100
Chances are,
they're already off ship.

363
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,600
I'll get a team down here.

364
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,400
Councilman Zarek.

365
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,800
Lee. 

366
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,000
I just heard, are you all right?

367
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,500
What are you doing here?

368
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Attending a Quorum meeting. 

369
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,600
Nothing as exciting as all
this. I assure you.

370
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,000
I know these places are legal.

371
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But still, the son
of the almighty Adama...

372
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,800
Talk to me about the black market.

373
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,900
Not much to say. 

374
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,600
It's widespread,
inevitable,...

375
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,700
and according to
President Roslin...

376
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,000
illegal.

377
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,900
So, it's no surprise that you and
Fisk were in it up to your necks.

378
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,400
Fisk, maybe, but not me.

379
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
I represent Astral Queen.

380
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,400
I have to be careful
about the company I keep.

381
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,600
This is Fisk's log.

382
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,400
He says,...

383
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,600
he made three runs to
Astral Queen in the last ten days,...

384
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,300
and I doubt it was to discuss
prison reform.

385
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,600
What do you want from me, Captain?

386
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,200
Names of ships. Contacts.

387
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,200
I can't help you. 

388
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,500
Why do you think
Fisk approached me?

389
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,900
To get a piece of your
black market scam. 

390
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,900
To offer you protection.

391
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,900
You and your father are so
blinded by the past.

392
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,300
Fisk's black market...

393
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,400
was up and running when
he approached me.

394
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,500
He knew Adama would pick up on
his unauthorized shuttles,...

395
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,600
so he tried to force me into
taking over the deliveries,...

396
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,600
creating a firewall between Pegasus
and the illegal shipments.

397
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,600
So, you're trying to tell me
that you turned him down.

398
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
At great cost. 

399
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,800
Check the fleet logs.

400
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,000
See how many supply ships
made stops at the Astral Queen...

401
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
after last Fisk's trip.

402
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,500
The answer is none.

403
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,000
So, if Fisk was trying
to starve you out,...

404
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
why didn't you bring it to the quorum?

405
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Roslin's acting like the black
market's some sort of aberration,...

406
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,100
but I thought you were
smarter than that.

407
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,900
Did you really expect some...

408
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,900
utopian fantasy to
rise from the ashes?

409
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,500
I heard the security officer. 

410
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,500
They gave you Fisk's
killer for a reason.

411
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,800
They're offering you a way out.

412
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,000
You know something, don't you?

413
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Just rumors. 

414
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,700
There's a freighter,...

415
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,800
Prometheus.

416
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,400
Some people say it's
gone off the grid.

417
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,700
But if you want
something bad enough,...

418
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,700
that's where you go.

419
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,200
The deals are brokered by
an ex-military mercenary named...

420
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Phelan.

421
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,700
Lee. 

422
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,700
I hope she's worth it.

423
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Oh, Paya.

424
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,900
Paya! 

425
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,900
Paya, hey.
Paya.

426
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,600
It's okay, it's Lee. 

427
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,300
You remember,
it's Lee.

428
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,600
All right, you're going to be fine.

429
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
I promise you.

430
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,100
Okay, you just hang Tight. 

431
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,600
I'll be right back. 

432
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,600
I'll be right back.

433
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,200
You may find this hard to believe,
but my father was in the service too.

434
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,000
Strict as hell.

435
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,500
Probably the same as your old man.

436
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,600
But, when the cylons attacked,
all his duty and honor...

437
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,700
didn't add up to squat.

438
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,400
Is she dead?

439
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,000
I can see why you want her back,
she's one of my best.

440
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
One of yours.

441
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,100
A good escort...

442
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,700
understands it's
about a lot more than sex.

443
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,300
She knows when to listen...

444
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,900
and when to call for help.

445
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,100
Lee, I had to.

446
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,500
Don't blame her.

447
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
The only reason you're alive...

448
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,500
is because I was able to see
you through Shevon's eyes. 

449
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,600
And what I saw
seemed reasonable. 

450
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,700
Like Fisk.

451
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,000
Fisk was a pig.

452
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,100
He tried to
force us to renegotiate.

453
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,300
So you killed him.

454
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
No. 

455
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,900
I gave you the killer. 

456
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,600
The murder weapon,...

457
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,100
the prints.

458
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Everything you needed to
close the case legitimately.

459
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,100
Despite the President's objections,
the fleet needs us.

460
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,900
Rationing's too tight,...

461
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,600
ship comes in too late, we're the
pressure valve, we provide.

462
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,600
When Shevon needed
antibiotics, she knew where to go.

463
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,600
Without us,...

464
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,900
people would
have nowhere to turn.

465
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,900
The fleet would tear itself apart.

466
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And what about those
children outside?

467
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,400
How are they...

468
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,400
helping the fleet?

469
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Everyone has needs. 

470
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,900
Some settle
for cigars or liquor.

471
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,200
You wanted shevon.

472
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Others are more demanding.

473
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,300
It's hard to find...

474
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,300
the moral high ground when
we're all standing in the mud.

475
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,400
I'm not not like
my old man, Captain,...

476
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,900
and you are not like yours.

477
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,400
I came alone. 

478
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,600
But, Galactica
tracked me on DRADIS

479
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,600
All they'll need to vent this ship
into space is an excuse.

480
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,900
So, let's make a deal.

481
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,400
I want Shevon, the girl.

482
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,400
I walk out of here,
and you shut down this operation.

483
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,700
And all of you will live.

484
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Sorry, the little girl's been
paid for. No refunds.

485
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,200
Oh, gods! 

486
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,200
No!

487
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,600
- Wait.
- Lee, don't.

488
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,400
Come on, do it.

489
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,600
Do it.

490
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,600
I made you a fair offer.

491
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,500
So did I. 

492
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,900
Yeah, you're probably
right about everything.

493
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,800
You, me, Fisk.

494
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,100
Nobody can stop it,...

495
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,200
and maybe nobody should. 

496
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,300
But it needs limits.

497
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,900
There's lines you can't cross.

498
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,800
And you crossed them.

499
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,700
You're not gonna shoot.

500
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,700
You're not like me.

501
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,200
You're not gonna...

502
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,500
All right, it's done.

503
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,000
Fleet relies on the black market.

504
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Much as we'd like,
we can't wish that away. 

505
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,500
So, you're still in business.

506
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,300
For now.

507
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,500
But if they are any more killings,...

508
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,100
if you hold back
essential medicines,...

509
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,400
if you...

510
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,400
ever touch a child...

511
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,100
Shevon.

512
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,400
No, I don't want to see...

513
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,600
Hey, hey. It's over, it's okay,
everything's gonna be okay.

514
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,900
- Lee, Lee, let go.
- Shevon, it's over.

515
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,400
Stop!

516
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,000
I can't be what
you want me to be.

517
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't want
you to be anything.

518
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,200
You want me to be her.

519
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,500
That's what this is about.

520
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,500
That's what this has
always been about.

521
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,400
No...

522
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,200
that's not what
this has ever been about.

523
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Come on, Lee.
I know my job.

524
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,600
I'm a replacement.

525
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,300
For a lot of things. 

526
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,000
Things that men can't
get anywhere else.

527
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Things they've lost.

528
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,300
She wanted to give you a child.

529
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,600
But you were afraid,...

530
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,600
so you pushed
her away and then you ran.

531
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,800
And you didn't stop running
until it was too late.

532
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,000
Well, I'm not her! 

533
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And Paya is not,
and will never be, your child.

534
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,100
Commander Fisk's
murder has been resolved,...

535
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,100
and Pegasus' crew appears to have
accepted Galactica's conclusions.

536
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,400
That's all, Madame President.

537
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,600
Not quite. 

538
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,900
What about the ship,
Prometheus?

539
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,700
I understand it's the hub of
the fleet's black market.

540
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,900
We will keep an eye on them.

541
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,700
Keep an eye on 'em? 

542
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,600
It's not exactly
the solution I had in mind.

543
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,900
Whether or not we allow
a criminal enterprise...

544
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,900
to thrive in this fleet is not
a matter of choice, Captain.

545
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,300
Admiral?

546
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,300
I've given Lee full authority on
this issue. The decision is his.

547
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,200
I support your trade policies
whole heartedly madame President.

548
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,700
But, we are never going to
have a perfect system.

549
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,900
There will always be some
kind of black market.

550
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,800
At least this way, I know
names, I know faces,...

551
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,800
I know where they are, and
we will monitor the situation.

552
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,900
Thank you, gentlemen, I'm busy.

553
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,200
18, I'm starting to sweat here. 19

554
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,400
- You should be sweating.
- 20

555
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,600
Why aren't you doing any of these?

556
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,600
No talking, no talking. No cheating,
all the way up, a little higher.

557
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,900
- Sneaky.
- 8, 9,...

558
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,300
start again.

559
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,300
- You lost track.
- Zero...

560
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,200
No?

561
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,100
President wasn't very happy today.

562
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,100
No. 

563
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Ever since you ejected from
the blackbird, you've been different.

564
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,900
Harder to reach. 

565
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,900
I'm just
trying to understand.

566
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,600
Well, like you said, dad.

567
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,400
We've all been through a lot.

568
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,100
Fair enough. 

569
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,100
But you should have
told me about the woman.
