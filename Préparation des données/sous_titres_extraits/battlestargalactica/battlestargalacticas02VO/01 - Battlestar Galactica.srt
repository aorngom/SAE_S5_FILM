1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,100
The Cylons were created by man

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,200
They evolved

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
They Rebelled

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,400
There are many copies

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,100
And they have a plan

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,100
Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,900
This Planet is Kobol

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,600
The birthplace of mankind.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,700
Organise a ground survey team.
Three Raptors.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,600
Put it down!

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Get down!

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,500
She just jumped away

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,000
go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will show us the way to Earth

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,200
Starbuck?

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,600
I'm terminating your presidency
as of this moment.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,700
I'm placing you under arrest.

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,700
This is mutiny. You know that.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,900
Come. 

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,700
See the face
of the shape of things to come.

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,700
Isn't she beautiful, Gaius?

22
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,900
I'm not a Cylon.

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,700
This isn't happening.

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,200
You can't fight destiny, Sharon.

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,200
It catches up with you.
No matter what you do.

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,800
Where are the medics? Where's Doc Cottle?

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Off ship, on rounds in the fleet, sir. Stand clear!

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,900
Sgt. Fisher reporting, sir.

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,900
It's gonna be okay. Okay.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,200
I'm your new shipmate. Bill Adama.

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,600
Saul Tigh.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
H-he's gonna be okay.

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,500
Okay, we've got tension pneumo.

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,500
- I'm gonna stick him and release the pressure.
- He's gonna be okay.

35
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,800
What's going o要? What happened?

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,300
Sergeant of the guard, secure that thing in the brig.

37
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Aye, sir. Hollis, Wenzler, let's go. Let's go!

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Ah! No! Wait!

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,100
Okay, he's breathing!
Let's get him down to sickbay, RFN.

40
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,000
What the hell?

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,300
Valerii's shot the old man.

42
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,000
What?

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,300
Three, one, two

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,100
She must be a Cylon,

45
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,700
Colonel's in command. You are second.

46
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,400
Make a hole!

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,300
As you were, Captain.

48
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,100
Like hell!

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,300
Put him in the brig.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Colonel! Colonel Tigh!
He's my father! Colonel!

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,500
Colonel. Could this be
a prelude to a Cylon attack?

52
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,700
How would they know where we are?

53
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,800
Valerii could've told them, sir.

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
What? How?

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
When we aboard the base star,

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
she left the raptor for
a few minutes

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,100
and came back without her helmet.

58
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,300
She might've told the Cylons
everything. Our position, defenses

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,600
Colonel, the toasters
have knocked out our CO.

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,200
This has gotta be part of a bigger plan.

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,600
I recommend we execute jump
to urgency standby coordinates.

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,000
Colonel, I've located Doc Cottle.
He's aboard the rising star.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Dradis!

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Signal of contact, Cylon base
star bearing 4-8-7 carom 0-1-5.

65
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Sir, we can't stay here.

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Sir.

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,000
So what's your plan here?

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,500
Personally, I tend  to go with what you know.

69
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,600
'Til something better turns up.

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,500
Sir!

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,300
Dee, alert the fleet.

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,800
We are making an immediate
jump to the emergency coordinates.

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,500
Sir, Doc Cottle is still 15 minutes away.

74
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,400
He'll have to rejoin us
on the other side of the jump.

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Sir! What about our people
on the surface of Kobol?

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,700
If they're still alive, they'll have to wait.

77
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,800
FTL?

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,100
Go!

79
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,900
Nav-con?

80
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,500
Go!

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,900
Galactica to all vessels.

82
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,800
Prepare to make immediate FTL
jump to escape coordinates alpha.

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,900
I say again, escape coordinates alpha.

84
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,100
Clock will start on my mark.

85
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,100
Mark.

86
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,700
Captain, what have they done to you?
What's going on?

87
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,700
My father's been shot.

88
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,700
What?

89
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,400
Someone get this frakkin'
thing off me, please?

90
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,700
I'm not authorized to do that.

91
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,700
I'm behind the frakkin' bars!

92
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,100
Captain.

93
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,700
How bad is your father?

94
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,800
Bad.

95
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Two bullets in the chest.

96
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,700
Is Dr. Cottle with him?

97
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,700
No, Doc Cottle's not on board.

98
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,400
Attention, Galactica. Fleet is away.

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,100
Stand by to jump in five,

100
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,100
four, three, two, one

101
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Jump.

102
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
Jump completed.

103
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,800
Report.

104
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Report!

105
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Dradis is empty, no contacts.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,100
No contacts?

107
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Where is the fleet?

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
Dee!

109
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,800
Checking all channels.

110
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,100
No colonial signals.

111
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,100
They're gone, sir.

112
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Isn't she beautiful, Gaius?

113
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,400
I don't think I have ever been
touched so deeply in my entire life.

114
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,400
You're going to make a wonderful father.

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Speaking metaphorically, of course.

116
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
And literally.

117
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,100
She's our child, gaius.
Our little girl.

118
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,100
What?

119
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,800
Do you want to hold her?

120
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Yes. Yes, of course I do.

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,300
But she's not real.

122
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Any more than, uh

123
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,800
any of this is. Real.

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,400
She's real.

125
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,500
She is?

126
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,500
She may not be with
you yet, but she will be. Soon.

127
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm having a little difficulty...

128
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm trying to understand,
I want to understand. I...

129
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,400
You are the mother.

130
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,400
And you're the father.

131
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,100
Am I the father?

132
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Excuse me?

133
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,200
Dream,

134
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,400
I'm been clearly having a dream

135
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,400
We're moving out, sir. Get up.

136
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,200
And if you wouldn't mind carrying
something this time, that'd be great.

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is serisone, it should help
you breathe a little easier.

138
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,900
Here, just take it easy.

139
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,900
You'll be feeling
better in a few minutes.

140
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,100
Excuse me, sir.

141
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,500
We've got to get you up.

142
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,100
- It hurt.
- I know.

143
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,900
If you don't mind my asking,
where are we going, Crashdown?

144
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,200
Tree line. We can hide,

145
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,500
still see the crash site in case
Galactica sends a rescue party.

146
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,700
Galactica will be
sending a rescue party.

147
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,800
Everybody down!

148
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,600
what was that?

149
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,300
That Cylons?

150
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,000
Maybe. Seelix, grab the ammo.

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,300
Staggered formation, I'll take point.

152
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,700
Chief, you're bringing up the rear.
Be ready to tell the private, people.

153
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,400
Lt? I think we should double-check
the supplies before we bug out.

154
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,700
Sorry, Chief, we don't
have the time.

155
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,100
If that's an aircraft turbine, they're
gonna be o要 us any moment.

156
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,600
Lt, we gotta make
sure we have everything!

157
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,700
We don't have the time, Chief!

158
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,300
Damn it.

159
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,800
Gods Damn it!

160
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
What's going on, saul?
here's the fleet?

161
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,600
We don't know, they
jumped to another location.

162
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,900
You've got blood on your pants.
Why would they do that?

163
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,200
Every watch we update our emergency
jump calculations with new star

164
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
fixes to compensate for inertial
drift, and then we transmit

165
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,900
them to the rest of the fleet.

166
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,600
This time ours were updated,
but theirs weren't.

167
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,500
Gaeta was supposed to transmit
them to the rest of the fleet.

168
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,900
So it's Gaeta's fault.

169
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,700
Oh, the kid was overwhelmed.
He had his hands full.

170
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,900
If you say so. It sounds like a
pretty big screw-up to me

171
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,900
I should have checked before
I gave the order to jump!

172
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,900
This doesn't sound like you, Saul.

173
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,200
You don't let people slide.

174
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
You bust their ass.

175
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Now, if Bill doesn't make it...

176
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,900
- He'll make it.
- If he doesn't,

177
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,600
this will be your ship,
your command.

178
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,900
All I'm saying is you need...

179
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,600
This is Bill Adama's ship.

180
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,300
This is his command.

181
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,700
His orders are still the word
of the gods on this ship.

182
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,800
Just so we're clear.

183
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,500
This will be Adama's command
until the day he dies.

184
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,400
And we are not going to
let him die.

185
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,000
So say we all.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,900
As you were.

187
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,200
So how do we find the fleet?

188
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,300
If we jump back to our
original coordinates,

189
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,400
our nav computers can use those star
fixes to generate a best fit solution,

190
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,700
given the fleet's current position.

191
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,200
The Cylons are waiting for us back there.

192
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,500
How long will that take to
calculate once we get back there?

193
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,500
If we shut down all
our functions, 12 hours.

194
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,200
There's no way we can hold off
a Cylon base star for 12 hours.

195
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,900
We have got to jump back.
We can't stay here.

196
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,400
Lt Thrace won't be able to find us once
she retrieves the arrow from caprica.

197
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,600
If she retrieves the arrow.

198
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,800
She'll retrieve the arrow.

199
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,500
Captain, you've got to get reinstated.

200
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,100
You've got to get back to CIC.
Gotta denounce me, disavow me,

201
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,700
do whatever you need to do.

202
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,300
Colonel Tigh cannot relocate this
fleet on his own without your father.

203
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,900
Tigh's not letting me out of here.
I put a gun to his head.

204
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,100
He won't forget that anytime soon.

205
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,500
I am so sorry that
I got you into this, Captain.

206
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,400
No, don't apologize.
I knew what I was doing.

207
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,600
But I didn't do it for you.

208
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
I did it for

209
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,900
well, actually, I did it
for nothing, turns out.

210
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,700
That's not true.
You took a stand.

211
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,700
And now look at us.

212
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Watch your foot.

213
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Everyone take five.

214
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
Give me the med kit.

215
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Where's the med kit?

216
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,000
How you doing?
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

217
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
Good.

218
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Just listening to the birds.

219
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll be damned. I don't remember
the last time I heard birds.

220
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,300
Take it easy, okay?

221
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,900
Damn it.

222
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,800
We're out of serisone.

223
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,900
It's all right,
I'll get the other med kit.

224
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,900
What other med kit?

225
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,800
Oh, don't frakkin' tell me.
We pulled two med kits from the ship.

226
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
I told you to keep an
eye on both of them.

227
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
I only saw the o要e, sir.

228
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,600
There were two.

229
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,400
I'm sorry, sir, but
I don't remember you telling me

230
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,500
Well, I did!

231
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Sir, his lungs are
filling up with fluid.

232
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,500
If he doesn't get more serisone soon,
he's not gonna make it.

233
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Okay, Tarn.

234
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,100
You forgot the med kit, so you're
gonna have to go back and get it.

235
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,300
Take a rifle, three clips
of ammo, and a canteen.

236
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,600
What?

237
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Move.

238
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Cally, come here.
Watch the rear.

239
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,700
Lt. You can't send him alone.

240
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,300
You questioning my orders, Chief?

241
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,500
No, I'm just pointing out
flaw in your plan.

242
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,400
Doesn't need to be
ny bigger than that.

243
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,000
Cally and I can go with him.

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,800
All right, fine, but
would you look out for Cally?

245
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Cally, give me the rifle.

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,800
We three go. Leave that,
leave your backpack.

247
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,200
Sidearms out.

248
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,500
Tarn, you're bringing
up the rear in the middle,

249
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,500
shh. Eyes and ears.

250
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,500
Her consciousness is being downloaded
into another body right now.

251
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,100
And when she wakes up, she'll
tell them exactly where we are.

252
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,100
She's right, we can't stay here.

253
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,300
She's right, huh?

254
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,000
Sharon the Cylon is right.

255
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,400
It's all just,

256
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,200
"listen to Sharon the Cylon."

257
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
"Do whatever she says."

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
Cause that's a good idea.

259
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,300
Hey, Kara, she
helped me get this far.

260
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,400
Okay, I get it. I get it, Helo.

261
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,500
You and I go way back, so I get it.

262
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,200
All right, I remember how you felt about
her, but that is not the real Sharon.

263
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,800
That is some cheap knock-off copy.

264
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm not a copy.
I'm Sharon.

265
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,900
I remember the first day
I met you, Starbuck.

266
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,500
You were puking your guts out in the
head because you'd eaten bad oysters on

267
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,900
Don't do that.

268
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,700
Hey!

269
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,500
I don't like it and I don't like you.

270
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,800
So the best thing you can do is
just keep your damn mouth shut.

271
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,700
Starbuck.

272
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,800
Put it down, for gods' sakes.

273
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,400
What do you want from me, Helo?
She's a Cylon.

274
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,400
You've been had.
We've been had.

275
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,300
So what, I'm just supposed
to be nice to her?

276
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Because she says
she's pregnant?

277
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Get out of the way.

278
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
No.

279
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Carl, do not think that I will not...

280
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
I'm not gonna let you kill her!

281
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,500
Okay? She's carrying my child.

282
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,200
My gods, men are so
painfully stupid sometimes!

283
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,300
How do you know that?

284
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,100
I know, all right?
She is not lying.

285
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,700
They lie about everything, Helo.

286
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Their entire existence is a lie.

287
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,600
They're not human, Helo.
They're machines.

288
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,000
You can't have a baby with a machine.

289
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,300
I don't know what to tell you. Okay?

290
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,100
But I believe her.

291
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,800
I-it's hard to describe.

292
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,700
We've been together a long time.

293
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,900
I mean, I know what she is,
but she is not like the others.

294
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,900
She is not.

295
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,800
No, no, no, no, no!

296
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Bitch took my ride.

297
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,100
How's he doing?

298
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,900
Well, the bullet's tore up his spleen.
His blood pressure is way down.

299
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,900
Somebody needs to get in there and
stop the bleeding, or we'll lose him.

300
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,300
So what's your plan?

301
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,800
Don't really have one.

302
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm getting back into the cockpit.

303
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,200
I'm getting back into my fleet.

304
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,900
And I want you to come with me, Saul.

305
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,000
You really believe that we
can get back in the fleet?

306
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do.

307
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,500
How long 'til Doc Cotter's aboard?

308
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,100
I don't know.

309
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,200
It's gonna be a while.

310
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,200
He doesn't have  much time, sir.

311
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,600
You're gonna have to go in yourself.

312
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,700
Me? I'm just a medic.

313
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Today you're a doctor.

314
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Colonel.

315
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Open cell.

316
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,900
How's the Commander?

317
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,800
You've bungled the job.
If that's what you're asking.

318
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Then he's alive.
Thank the gods.

319
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,700
How many of our pilots were Cylons?

320
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,900
I don't know.

321
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Who gave the order
to shoot the old man?

322
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,700
No one.

323
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Just get it over with,
you frakkin' coward.

324
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Give me your firearm.
Give me your gun!

325
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yes, sir.

326
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,900
Just shoot me.
Get it over with.

327
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay, Tarn. Go up, take a look.

328
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,100
If it's not there, it's at the raptor.

329
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,100
And we'll have to move up more.

330
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,900
I got it, Chief.

331
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,500
All right, let's get
the hell out of here.

332
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,800
Tarn on point.

333
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go.

334
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,200
This makes no sense.

335
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,700
Why am I carrying the med
kit when you forgot it?

336
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,500
First of all that's Lt's kit.
Secondly, I'm o要 point.

337
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,300
Whatever.

338
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,000
All right, children, that's enough.

339
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,200
I'll tell you what, Cally.

340
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,400
If it makes you feel any better,

341
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,500
I'll put him on hangar deck
mop-up duty with you for next week.

342
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,900
Now you're talkin'.

343
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,100
For what?

344
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,700
If anybody should have
mop duty, it's Lt.

345
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,700
Go! Go! Get down!

346
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Top of the ridge!

347
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,800
Cally, take the rifle and cover me!

348
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,100
Suppressive fire.

349
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay, okay, wait for me.
Wait for me, all right?

350
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Go, go, go, go, go.

351
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Don't move! I'm coming
for you, don't move.

352
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,200
Jeez! 'm coming. Give me fire! Cally, go, go!

353
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,300
They're dug in, Chief. I can't see them.

354
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Cover me! Come on. Come on.

355
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Come on Chief

356
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,300
You'll be okay, you're okay.

357
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,600
You're okay, you're okay. It's okay.

358
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,100
Get on my back. Get on my back.

359
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Get on me, get on me.

360
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,600
Chief, they're not
following us anymore.

361
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,300
Cally, there. There.

362
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,200
I know you're hit, buddy.

363
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,500
It's okay, I'm gonna check you right
now. I'm gonna put him here, Cal

364
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,200
Here, stay down.
Be with me right here.

365
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Okay, I'm gonna check you right now.
It's not that bad, it's not that bad.

366
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,900
It's not that bad. Cally, check the ridge.

367
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,500
I wanna go home, Chief.

368
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,500
I know, I know. We're going home.
We're going home, okay? Okay.

369
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,600
Sh, sh, sh, sh. It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay. Stay with me.

370
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,300
Hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me, stay with me.

371
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,300
Be with me, be with me.Come on,
come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

372
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,000
Chief.

373
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Chief, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

374
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,500
We gotta go.

375
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Chief.

376
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,900
That's it. That's it,
you stupid, frakked-up crap!

377
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Chief, Socinus needs
us now. Come on.

378
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Come on. Let's go.

379
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,900
Not your fault, Lieutenant.
Not from where I was standing.

380
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,300
I was the O.O.D.

381
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,500
It was crazy in there, sir.

382
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Can't blame yourself.

383
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,300
So we jump back to
the last coordinates.

384
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,000
But we network the FTL computer with
a nav, dc, and fire control computers.

385
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,600
Once they're linked, we'll only need
ten minutes to complete the calculations.

386
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,300
You can't be serious.

387
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,400
The old man would never
do this, Colonel.

388
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,800
- No computer networks on his ship.
- I acknowledge that, sir.

389
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,800
But I can devise a software
firewall that will buy us more time.

390
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,200
Really, you're gonna out-think
the Cylons at computer software?

391
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,500
Sir, if we don't do this,
we're never gonna find the fleet.

392
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,000
Certainly not
before the commander dies.

393
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,200
This is still
the old man's command.

394
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,700
We can't do
something he'd oppose,

395
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,700
especially when it puts
the entire ship at risk.

396
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,700
This is the XO.

397
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,600
Begin jump prep.

398
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Those are  my orders.

399
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,700
The kid is back in the fleet.
So, let's have the truth.

400
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,900
How did you do it? How'd you
get off this frakkin' freighter?

401
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,300
Connections.

402
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,600
Anne's father has a friend
on the defense subcommittee.

403
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,100
So the new wife comes through.
Wish I had in-laws with pull.

404
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,200
Gimme a couple of years.
I'll have some pull.

405
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,700
You watch me.

406
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,000
I'll have my own battlestar one day.

407
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Open up, please.

408
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,400
All right.
You have my parole.

409
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,400
When I'm on duty, I'll make no attempt to
free her or sow insurrection among the crew.

410
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,300
And when I'm not o要 duty,
I'll report directly back to this cell.

411
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,100
Pre-flight brief is
underway in the ready room.

412
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,600
Right.

413
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,000
Good hunting, Captain.

414
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Thank you, Madam President!

415
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,300
Colonel, once you find the fleet,
I'd like to have a word with you.

416
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:06,300
There's nothing to talk about. You went
up against the old man and you lost.

417
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,700
We jump in, we hold off the Cylons.
We crunch the numbers.

418
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,500
Then we jump out.
That's it. Simple plan.

419
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,200
Not so simple to do.

420
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,800
Computers have been networked.

421
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,900
My board is green, sir.

422
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,900
All stations report ready to jump.

423
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,400
That software firewall ready?

424
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,800
Best I can make it, sir.
Wish Dr. Baltar was here.

425
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,800
To hell with that. Take your work over
that shifty son of a bitch any day.

426
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,400
Stand by. In five, four,

427
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,400
three, two, jump.

428
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Jump completed.

429
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,400
Report?

430
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,200
Multiple dradis contacts.

431
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Cylon base star and multiple
Cylon raiders bearing  4-8-7 carom 2-2-1.

432
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,600
Lieutenant.

433
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,300
Computations underway.

434
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:40,300
We'll be able to plot the
fleet's position in seven minutes.

435
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,100
Whoohoo! Ha ha ha! Let's get these psychos!

436
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,500
Hey flyboy, you know we got
a pool going, right?

437
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,000
See who gets the most
kills now that Starbuck's awol.

438
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,100
Well, we know i'm gonna clean up.

439
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,600
Flyboys, shut up and focus.
This is not a simulation.

440
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Roger that.

441
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,900
His heart stopped!

442
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,400
Defib, now!

443
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Power's unstable,the battery
units are at the aid stations.

444
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Well, then, get me a knife.

445
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,100
Weapons free.

446
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,200
And open racks.

447
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,200
And engage!

448
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Here they come.

449
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,200
Cylons are hacking our network.

450
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,900
Attempting to access our gateway.

451
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,000
Now it's a race.

452
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
First firewall penetrated.

453
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,000
Sierra Alpha, we got a new bogey.

454
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What is that thing?

455
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,500
I don't know, but whatever it is,
it's bearing on Galactica.

456
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,600
We gotta take it out.

457
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,000
Apollo, Hotdog offensive.
Three right, five at two.

458
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,300
Tally, Hotdog.  Count on me.

459
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,300
Roger that. I'm with you, leader.

460
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Will you pray with me?

461
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,800
Help us, Lords of Kobol.

462
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,700
Help your prophet Laura guide
us to the path of righteousness.

463
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,100
That we might...

464
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,200
that we might destroy our enemies.

465
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,400
Let us walk the path of righteousness

466
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,300
and lift our faces unto your goodness.

467
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,000
Help us turn away from
the calls of the wicked

468
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,700
and show us the knowledge
of your certain salvation.

469
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,700
We offer this prayer.

470
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Calculations at 56%.

471
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,700
Second firewall's been breached.

472
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,900
Frak they're fast!

473
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:12,200
Third firewall down!

474
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,300
Approaching Galactica's  flak barrier.

475
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Cylon target within gun range.

476
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,800
Winged it!

477
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,400
Apollo! We're straying into
Galactica's engagement zone!

478
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,200
I'm almost there, I'm almost there.
I'm almost there, come on!

479
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,000
Back! Back, back!

480
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,700
Damn it!

481
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,700
I had it!

482
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,400
Apollo reports impact
on the starboard flight pod.

483
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,300
You got a decompression
in the flight pod.

484
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,700
No explosion. No fire.

485
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,500
Repeat, no fire.

486
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,800
No fire.

487
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,300
Calculations at 80%. Almost there.

488
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,800
They're through the fourth firewall.

489
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,800
One left until they've
accessed our mainframe.

490
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,500
Frakker.

491
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,200
Whoo! That was mine, that was mine!

492
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,400
Come on, come on.

493
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
We have a solution
for the fleet's position.

494
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Break the network.

495
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,900
Network is broken!
Computers restored to local control.

496
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,500
Tell the vipers to get back aboard.

497
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,500
We're getting awful lucky today.
Prepare to jump.

498
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,000
Vipers aboard, sir.

499
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,300
Stand by.

500
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,300
In five, four, three, two, jump.

501
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,800
Jump completed.

502
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Report?

503
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Multiple contacts 'round the board.

504
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Colonial transponder, sir. We found 'em!

505
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Captain Kelly.

506
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,100
- Lieutenant Gaeta.
- Sir.

507
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,000
Dee.

508
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,500
Contact the Rising Star.

509
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Tell Cottle to get his
ass over here A.S.A.P.

510
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,000
Hell of a job.

511
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,400
From now on, no more
heart massages for me.

512
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,400
I'm sticking to
pills and enemas.

513
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,400
Sir.

514
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,200
Let's hear it.

515
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,000
Well, I managed to stop the bleeding.

516
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Um, but  he's still critical.

517
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Doc's on his way.

518
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Can you hear me, Bill?

519
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,600
Go away.

520
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,900
Captain Tigh, It's the shore patrol.
Sergeant Watkins, sir.

521
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Open up, please.

522
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,300
Major Adama's compliments.

523
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,000
He wishes me to inform you you've
been reinstated in the colonial fleet.

524
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,500
With the rank of Captain.

525
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,200
Major Adama.

526
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Welcome back to the fleet, sir.

527
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,400
I'll be right with you, Sergeant.

528
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Yes, sir.

529
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,200
You never should have
brought me back in the service.

530
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,700
If you'd just let me be, I'd have
died back there in Caprica along with

531
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,700
everyone else, and
been happier for it.

532
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,600
I don't want to command.

533
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,600
I never did

534
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Don't you dare die on me now

535
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,500
