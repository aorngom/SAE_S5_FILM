1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
The Cylons were created by man

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,400
They evolved

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,900
They rebelled

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,900
There are many copies

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,700
and they have a plan

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,200
Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,200
go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
I will show us the way to Earth

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,500
What do you want from me, Helo?
She's a Cylon.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm not gonna let you kill her!

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Okay? She's carrying my child.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Bitch took my ride.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,300
I'm placing you under arrest.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,500
This is mutiny. You know that.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,700
I'm terminating your presidency
as of this moment.

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,400
I recommend we execute jump
to urgency standby coordinates.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,200
What about our people
on the surface of Kobol?

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,200
If they're still alive,
they'll have to wait.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,500
He's not gonna make it.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
You're gonna have to
go back and get it.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,300
- Lt. You can't send him alone.
- You questioning my orders, Chief?

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,700
I don't want to command.

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,100
I never did.

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,600
Don't you dare die on me now

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,300
Cylons are hacking our network.

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Attempting to access our mainframe

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,900
What is that thing?

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,600
I don't know, but whatever it is,
it's bearing on Galactica.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,600
We gotta take it out.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,300
Hey.

31
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,800
Uh, hey.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,900
Quite a day, huh?

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,400
Yeah.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,300
Wow, I...
I haven't seen you in person since...

35
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,100
Two weeks ago.

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,900
I've really been thinking about you.

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,900
That's nice. I gotta go.

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Uh, hey, Dee. Dee, hey. Hey.

39
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
Listen...

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,100
I know that I haven't
really made an effort,

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,100
or it must seem like I really
haven't made an effort to make this,

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,700
whatever this is,  a priority, but...

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,200
But? But you were too busy helping the
President spark a mutiny on my ship?

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,500
Or, but you wanted to
wait until you were

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,500
desperate and needed a shoulder to
cry on before making your move.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,800
I think that was
a little uncalled for.

47
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Yeah...I'm sorry.
You're right.

48
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,300
I gotta go.

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,000
What the hell?

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,900
Grab the emergency flashlights.

51
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Copy that. Check the ventilator.

52
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,200
Report status.

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Let's check subsystems.
Let's get emergency power back on.

54
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,100
Flyboy!

55
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,100
Hotdog!

56
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,200
Over here, Kat. Come here.

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,700
XO cydra.

58
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,500
Uh, it's the virus, sir.

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,400
I think it must have

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,300
spawned copies of itself in
some other computer systems.

61
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,300
It's knocked out main
power and auxiliary units.

62
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,700
Emergency power
just kicked back in.

63
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,000
Hey, captain, nice work out there.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,400
I'm not sure what you guys are
kissing and hugging about.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,500
We screwed up.
We let one through.

66
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,700
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,500
- What's going on with the lights?
- I'm not sure.

68
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
We still have no idea if we
can reach most of the ship.

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
What the hell was that?

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,900
Not sure, sir. Checking.

71
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,300
Power's out, sir.
I think it's shipwide.

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,200
Sound-powered phone's the only
thing working.

73
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,700
Tried to get through to damage
control, but the lines are jammed.

74
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,700
Okay, get the birds tied down,
make the ordinance safe.

75
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,400
I'll head up to combat,
see what the hell's going on.

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,700
Say again.

77
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,900
Sullen's reporting the
starboard flight pod.

78
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,900
We've been boarded.

79
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, look,

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,200
when I came up on his six,
all right, he rotated,

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,600
so I had to bug out. It was plain,
clean, and simple.

82
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,000
Did you see when I turned on
that pair chasing me on the port beam?

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah, saw that. That was sweet.

84
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,800
I rotate, pulled back,
hit the brakes and there...bang!

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,300
Left one's lined up dead center ring.

86
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,900
I chatter him,
turn back to get his wingman...

87
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,700
It's a Cylon, come on.Let's get outta of here.

88
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
Frack! Get outta of here! No, come on!

89
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,400
Go, go, go!

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Go!

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,700
47.874 survivors

92
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,000
in search of a home

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Called Earth

94
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Come on, come on! Hurry!

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,500
Get through the hatch! Go!
Get up the ladder, go!

96
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Get up, get up the ladder!

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,400
You all right, Captain?

98
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,500
Still breathing.

99
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,300
I guess that's all right.

100
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,700
Kat, Hotdog!

101
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,800
You all right?

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,700
Think so.

103
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,300
Can I get back to you on that?

104
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,400
Sitrep?

105
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,500
We've been boarded, sir.

106
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't know how many, where they are,
where they're headed.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,200
Our standard ammo doesn't
even make a dent.

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,700
Explosive rounds are the only
way to take 'em down.

109
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,000
How many rounds you got?

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,200
That was our last one.

111
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Hotdog.

112
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,000
Take this to C.I.C.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,400
Give it to Colonel Tigh
or the officer in charge.

114
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,200
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,400
Marines.

116
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,700
Let's get toaster shopping.

117
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,200
All clear sir!

118
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,800
- Kat, on me.
- Yes, sir.

119
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Galactica to all ships.

120
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,600
We have been boarded by a
cylon raiding party.

121
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,900
Do not approach or attempt to
dock with galactica.

122
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,700
Keep a safe distance until we
have secured the ship.

123
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,100
I say again, we have been
boarded by a cylon raiding...ah!

124
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,300
What the hell was that?

125
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,900
The cylons jammed the signal.

126
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,600
Great.

127
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,900
Are those gunshots?

128
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,400
Yeah.

129
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
We can't stay in here.

130
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,000
Open the door.

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,700
You know I can't do that,
Madame President.

132
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,800
Corporal Venner, I have
no intention of being

133
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,700
locked in this cell and
shot like a rat in a cage.

134
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Open the door!

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Thank you.

136
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

137
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,800
Corporal Venner, don't shoot!
It's Captain Adama.

138
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,500
I have a fire team with me.

139
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Come on in, Captain.

140
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,000
Watch the companionway.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We're clear, sir.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We've been boarded.
This deck is crawling with cylons.

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
They're trying to get to the magazines.

144
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,700
How can we help?

145
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,400
Stay alive and don't get shot.
Leave the cylons to us.

146
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,600
Okay, sickbay is the safest spot.

147
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,500
It's farthest away
from any potential targets,

148
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,000
and it's designed to
function as a disaster shelter

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
in case the ship were lost.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
Bonnington, sidearm.

151
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Sir

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,800
Okay, Billy, you ever
handled a weapon before?

153
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,500
Pelt gun from my uncle
when I was, like, ten.

154
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,400
Principle's the same.
Real ones just make a bigger noise.

155
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,000
Madame president.

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
No, thank you. I can't.

157
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
- Corporal.
- Yes?

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,700
You're in charge of
getting her down to sickbay.

159
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,100
Take Bonnington as escort.

160
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,700
Remember, just head away
from the sound of gunfire.

161
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,800
Right.

162
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,200
What about you?

163
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
We're heading towards the gunfire.

164
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,800
Okay, listen up.

165
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,200
There's a small arms locker on
causeway bravo, two decks down.

166
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,100
We're gonna go get some
explosive rounds,

167
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,500
and then we're heading
for the magazines.

168
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,300
- Twinam
- Sir.

169
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,500
- You take point.
- Yes sir

170
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Good luck, Captain.

171
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,600
May the lords protect you.

172
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Yeah, you too.

173
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,600
- Clear
- Okay, let's go.

174
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,600
We should probably
head out of the city,

175
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,300
try to scout one of
the outlying airbases.

176
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,600
See if we can find a rapter.

177
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,800
That's not
exactly what I expected.

178
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,500
Thought I'd be stepping over
decaying corpses in the streets.

179
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,400
Yeah, we saw a few bodies
here and there.

180
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Not much though.

181
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,000
Sharon said that...

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
cylon sharon said they had
troops picking up the bodies.

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,300
Transporting them to
mass incinerators.

184
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,900
Your girlfriend's from
a lovely family.

185
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,300
Good people, great values.

186
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,100
Enough, all right.

187
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,500
Okay, I was fooled by her,
she fooled me.

188
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,100
You happy now?

189
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,700
It's not about making me happy.

190
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,800
Then what's it about?
What do you want here?

191
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,700
You want me to say I'm a
fracking idiot, okay.

192
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm a fracking idiot.

193
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,000
That make you feel better?

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,900
I don't care anymore.

195
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,400
I've been here for months.
By myself, on the run.

196
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,400
on step ahead of the cylons.

197
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,400
With the cylons, I guess, actually.

198
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,800
She seemed so real.

199
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,300
Like Sharon,
you know?

200
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,600
Same grin, same laugh.

201
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,600
All the little things.

202
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,600
I feel in love with a machine.

203
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,300
That's stupid. So just call me an
idiot, and let's be done with it.

204
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,800
You're an idiot.

205
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,500
All right?
You're an idiot.

206
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,500
But the cylons have a way of
making all of us look like idiots.

207
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
Kara, what are you doing?

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,900
Making a pit stop.
I got something I gotta pick up.

209
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,000
Hey, we gotta keep going.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,200
I got a place here, Helo.

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,800
The cylon virus spawned itself in our
subsystems before we broke the network.

212
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,300
I have teams cleaning each subsystem,

213
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,400
but it'll be at least an hour
before we can restore main power.

214
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,200
Captain?

215
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,500
What few marines we have are assembling
at their checkpoints, but comm's spotty.

216
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,100
Where are the cylons?

217
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,000
Looks like they split into two
forces. One moving forward...

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,300
and one moving aft.

219
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes, sir.

220
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,800
I've seen this before.
These are their objectives.

221
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,500
Secondary damage control
and auxiliary fire control, sir.

222
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,000
If they're successful,

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,400
they will override their decompression
safeties and vent us all into space.

224
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,500
And once we're all dead,

225
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,500
they'll turn the ship's guns on the
fleet and wipe it out once and for all.

226
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Dr. Baltar.

227
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,200
God.

228
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,800
How in god's name did you find us?

229
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,300
What do you have there?

230
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Well, it's a child, obviously.

231
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,400
A child.

232
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,100
Can I hold it?

233
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,100
Please.

234
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,000
Is this the shape of things to come?

235
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's my understanding.

236
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Only one thing for it then.

237
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,400
Commander? Please.

238
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,900
Commander,
where are you going?

239
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,200
Come back!

240
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Commander!

241
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,600
Commander.

242
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Commander, please.

243
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
No!

244
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Shh. Shh...

245
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,100
He killed our baby.

246
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,000
Our baby?

247
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,200
Adama...

248
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,700
I saw him drown the baby.

249
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,100
Why would anyone want
to drown a baby?

250
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Gaius, the answer's all around us.

251
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,700
What happened here?

252
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,900
Human sacrifice.

253
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,400
Not the fairy tales your
"scriptures" would have you believe.

254
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,200
I thought kobol was supposed
to be a paradise or something.

255
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Some place where gods live
with the humans in harmony, or...

256
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,600
For a time, perhaps.
Then your true nature asserted itself.

257
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,200
Your brutality, your depravity,
your barbarism.

258
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,800
So the "scriptures" are all a lie.

259
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,800
It's all just a lie, just a
cover-up for all this...savagery.

260
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,700
Exactly. All of this has
happened before, Gaius.

261
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,800
And all of it will happen again.

262
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,900
Adama.

263
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,900
Mankind's true nature will
always assert itself.

264
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,400
So he will try and kill our baby.

265
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,500
Only if you let him, Gaius.

266
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Only if you let him.

267
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,700
Keep your eyes up ahead.
Come on.

268
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,300
Come on!

269
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,300
Okay, go. Go, go, go, go, go.

270
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,600
- Is it clear?
- Yeah.

271
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Okay. Keypads dead.

272
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,900
Don't shoot,
don't shoot, I'm human!

273
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,100
Jammer?

274
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,500
Yes sir, it's me. It's me. Jammer,

275
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
don't shoot, please.

276
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,800
Collishaw! Watch the hatch.

277
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,200
Kat!

278
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,600
- Find those explosive rounds.
- Sir

279
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,700
What the hell happened here?

280
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,500
I don't know, sir.
I was here in this fort.

281
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I just came in here to hide.
Cylons everywhere.

282
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,300
All right, settle down, settle down.
You're gonna be just fine.

283
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Apollo?

284
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,500
You're kidding me. That's it?

285
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,300
Didn't have much to begin with, sir.

286
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,000
The other fire teams must have
cleaned the locker out right before us.

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Six rounds. There are five of us.
Okay, well...

288
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
each of you guys take one.
I'll take the reload.

289
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,800
Wait, you're not counting me,
are you, sir?

290
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,300
I mean, I'm just... I mean,
I'm just a knuckledragger here.

291
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,200
I don't know how to fight centurions.

292
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,100
I don't know the first thing
about fighting centurions!

293
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Come on. Let's go.

294
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Let's do it.

295
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,300
You never have your house
keys when you need 'em.

296
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,300
These yours?
You paint these, Kara?

297
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Yeah.

298
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,800
How the hell did you get power.

299
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,700
Batteries.

300
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Kept turning off the power.
Something about not paying a bill.

301
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,400
That is definitely not you.

302
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,100
It's my dad.

303
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,400
Well, we got one
package of noodles.

304
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,400
You don't believe
in groceries?

305
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,400
You know, I never really
liked this place anyway.

306
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,200
Air conditioning doesn't
work in the summer.

307
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,400
Heater doesn't work in the winter.

308
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,400
The rent's a crime.

309
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
After they attacked, I never...
I never pined over any of my old crap.

310
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,100
Never missed it.

311
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Stupid view of the parking lot.
Broken toilet in the bathroom.

312
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,200
You know, everyone I know...

313
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,200
is fighting to get
back what they had.

314
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And I'm fighting 'cause I don't
know how to do anything else.

315
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,700
How far to sickbay?

316
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,700
60 meters.

317
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,200
She stopped breathing a while ago.

318
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,400
Dee?

319
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Ohh my gods Dee.

320
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,200
Hey. Are you all right?

321
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,600
Yeah, I was going to the head.

322
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,700
Oh, my god, you're bleeding.

323
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,400
Went back to my rack.

324
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,300
Are you shot?

325
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,700
I forgot something.

326
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,200
Hey.

327
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,800
Dee, look at me.
Dee, look at me. Dee.

328
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,100
Try using her rank.

329
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,000
Petty officer Dualla,
look at me.

330
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,800
Hey.

331
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,600
Hey.

332
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm glad to see you.

333
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,900
I've been here in
the dark a long time.

334
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,200
It's probably a concussion.

335
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,300
Corporal Venner.

336
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,900
We need an alternate route to sickbay.

337
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,600
Give me your eyes.
Look at me.

338
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,900
We don't want to
walk into gunfire.

339
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,400
We want to go away from the cylons.
Now clear your head.

340
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,200
Come on.

341
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,000
We could, we can go in the,
all the way on the starboard side.

342
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
It's a lot farther.

343
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,400
Good. Starboard.

344
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,500
Lt Wallace reports his unit destroyed
two centurions at this junction.

345
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,400
They trapped a third in
the ship's laundry.

346
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,700
It can't walk, but it's still shooting.

347
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,300
At least we've contained the
threat to auxiliary fire control.

348
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,700
Trust me. They're still
heading for the aft damage control.

349
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Lt. Gaeta

350
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,500
Sergeant Hadrian reports her units
had to halt their advance on

351
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,300
deck 10 at frame 69.

352
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,600
Sounds cut through the hull ahead of her
and the compartments are open to space.

353
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,100
Smart move.
Keeps us from chasin' 'em.

354
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,500
There is nothing between
the last two cylons

355
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,500
and the decompression safeties.

356
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,700
If you know any prayers,
now's the time.

357
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,700
What do you say we take five?

358
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,700
How much further, do you think?

359
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Tarn getting shot,
it wasn't your fault.

360
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,300
You know that, right?

361
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,200
Chief?

362
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Talk to me,
you mother-frakker!

363
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,300
"Mother-frakker"?

364
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,200
Socinus better appreciate this.

365
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,200
He's probably lyin' in the sun
like some gods-damn emperor.

366
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,600
He's an idiot.

367
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,700
I hope he's okay.

368
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,400
He'll be fine.

369
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,400
He's a tough kid. We just...

370
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,500
gotta get him the medkit.
Yeah, we gotta go, Cally.

371
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,000
- Crashdown! - Shhh!

372
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,800
Where the hell have you been?
Where have you been?

373
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,600
Doc, where have you been?
Answer me.

374
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,500
I got lost...

375
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,300
Doc, you never run off like that.
You are under my command.

376
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,100
This is a military operation,
do you understand me?

377
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,600
What I want to hear from
you is, "yes, sir!"

378
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Yes, sir!

379
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,700
Look, Crashdown, I,

380
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm getting a really bad
feeling about this place.

381
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,700
Oh, yeah, you and me, both, doc.

382
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,900
Flash! Flash!

383
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Thunder.

384
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,700
Go, go, go.

385
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Here. Here. Here.

386
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,300
Where's Tarn?

387
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,600
What happened?

388
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,300
Cylons.

389
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,700
Were you followed?

390
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,000
No.

391
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,800
How's he doing?

392
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,700
He's not gonna make it.

393
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,200
What?

394
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,400
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

395
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,100
We've got the medkit; give him a shot.
Give him another shot!

396
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,700
Too late.

397
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,600
What do you mean it's too late?

398
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,800
I got you the medkit.

399
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,900
What else do you want?

400
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,900
So we go get the
medicine you asked for.

401
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Tarn...for what? For this!

402
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,000
Come on, you
gotta do something.

403
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,900
You have to do something.

404
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,700
I can't change that
he's gonna die,Chief.

405
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,800
It's gonna be slow and painful.

406
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,200
And we can spare him that.

407
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
We can spare him that if we
give him the morpha

408
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,500
from my kit and the one
that you brought back.

409
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,300
What?

410
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,100
No.

411
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,700
Lt?

412
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,800
Lt, come on.

413
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,800
He's your man, Chief.

414
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:49,000
Give it to me.

415
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,000
Hey, buddy.

416
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,800
It's Chief. How ya doin'?

417
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,600
What's goin' on, Chief?

418
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Well, you know.
Just listenin'to the birds.

419
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,800
I, uh... I got a little
somethin' for the pain.

420
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,000
Good news, buddy.

421
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,900
We got a rescue party here.
The raptor just landed.

422
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,900
We're gonna put you on it,
take you back to Galactica. Okay?

423
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,900
I'm goin' home?

424
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Yeah. You're goin' home.

425
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
How are you coming, Jammer?

426
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,000
That should do it, captain.

427
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,600
Hey, nice job.

428
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,900
You guys, check the
deck, check the lockers.

429
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,200
There's gotta be
more rounds in here.

430
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Combat, 12-8-6-4-2.
Arms locker. Apollo here.

431
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,800
Colonel, it's Apollo. He's on
deck 12, abaft frame 8-6.

432
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,200
That's between the cylons and
aft damage control.

433
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
Apollo, XO. Sitrep.

434
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,200
Five armed defectors. We haven't
seen anything but bodies between

435
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,200
here and the hangar deck.

436
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,600
Clear.

437
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,200
Okay, from what I can remember,

438
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,200
the sickbay's about 20 meters
through that hatch.

439
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,800
How are you feeling?

440
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Like I'm walking underwater.

441
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,400
Any marines with you?

442
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
Privates Collishaw, Twinam.

443
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Take your men and proceed
without delay to aft damage control.

444
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,400
Is that yours?

445
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,300
Oh, uh, yeah. I guess it is now.

446
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,100
Okay, if you're gonna
keep it in your trousers like that...

447
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,900
you might want to
turn the safety on.

448
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,500
All righty.

449
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,400
Is it stuck?

450
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh, frak!

451
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,200
The hatch won't open.
The other side's been de-pressurized.

452
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,000
All right, Corporal venner,
this is your ship.

453
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,800
I'm just a tourist.
Find us another way to sickbay.

454
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,900
Okay, um...

455
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,600
Okay, we have to head
toward aft damage control.

456
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,800
Aft damage control.

457
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,300
Aft damage control

458
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,200
That's what they're after.
Let's not waste any more time.

459
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,800
You get to aft damage control and
get there right frakking now, mister.

460
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,700
Get there before the cylons,
or we lose the ship. Is that clear?

461
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Aft damage control rfn.
on our way. Apollo out.

462
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Okay, hold on.

463
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,800
Okay, we made it.

464
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,700
Twinam and jammer,
you take this side.

465
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,000
Kat, Collishaw, you take that side.

466
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,700
We're gonna need some cover!

467
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,700
Let's get this stuff out.

468
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Wait.

469
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,400
Okay, everybody,
get down, stay down.

470
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Hold your fire until
I give the signal.

471
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,300
Remember, you only
have one round,

472
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,500
so it's gotta be a
head shot to make a kill.

473
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,100
Do you understand? Understood?

474
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,000
Yes, sir.

475
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,400
Kat,

476
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,400
kill the flashlight.

477
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,100
Take cover! Take cover!

478
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

479
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,800
Steady up there, Jammer.

480
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,400
Yes, sir. I'm not really cut
out for this, sir.

481
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,800
Me neither.

482
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,100
Sometimes you got
to roll a hard six.

483
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,200
Wh-what does that mean, sir?

484
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,100
Uh...

485
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,700
I don't know.
It's something my dad says.

486
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,700
Just...don't shoot until I
tell ya to. All right.

487
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Okay, we're in good shape.

488
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,600
They're coming.

489
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,600
But we're in good shape.

490
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Head shot. Reload. Head shot.

491
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,900
Head shot. Reload. Head shot.
Reload. Head shot.

492
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay, they're coming.
Everybody down!

493
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You want to shoot that,
you got to take the safety off.

494
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,100
Damn it!

495
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,900
Fire!

496
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,700
Frak!

497
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,000
Hey, hey...

498
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,100
Are you all right?

499
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:11,100
Yes. I'm fine.

500
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,500
We did it! We got 'em all!

501
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,500
They don't look
so big now, do they?

502
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,200
They look big enough.

503
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,800
I'll, uh, I'll take that.

504
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Yeah.

505
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,600
Have you been shot?

506
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,800
No, I don't think so.

507
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,800
- Yeah
- I'm fine.

508
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,100
The gods must
be watching over you.

509
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,300
Tired of walking?

510
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,900
Okay.

511
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Thanks.

512
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,200
Hey.

513
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,900
How do you feel?

514
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,900
Better.

515
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,200
I thought you said...

516
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,900
Forget what I said.
And listen to what I'm saying.

517
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,900
You listening?

518
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,800
I'm sorry. I,

519
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,500
I didn't hear that.

520
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,700
Could you, uh... could you
do that one more time?

521
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Let me be clear.

522
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,700
Get the curtain.

523
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Doc cottle's on his way.
He'll be here any minute.

524
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,300
He's going to be all right.
You know that.

525
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Yeah. Yeah, I-I know that.

526
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,300
Colonel, I assume there's still
a cell out there waiting for me.

527
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,600
That's right.

528
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Corporal Venner, I'm ready.

529
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,900
I can't believe you sided with
that woman against the old man.

530
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,900
I wouldn't do that if you put
a gun to my head. And you did.

531
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,900
As far as I'm concerned,
you're not fit to wear a uniform.

532
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,600
You're right about that part.

533
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,500
I am not fit to wear the uniform.

534
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Maybe I never was.

535
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Then again, neither are you.

536
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,600
This isn't my ship.

537
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,500
And it sure as hell isn't yours.
It's his.

538
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,600
And when he wakes up...

539
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,600
he'll decide what to do
with the both of us.

540
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,600
Thank the gods I didn't have kids.
