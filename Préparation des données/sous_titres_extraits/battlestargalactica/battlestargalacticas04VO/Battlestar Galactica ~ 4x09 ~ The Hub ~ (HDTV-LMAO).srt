00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:22,685
<i>Previously on
</i>Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:25,273
The Threes, the D'Annas,

3
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:27,867
they were boxed
after the battle on the algae planet.

4
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:28,691
Why?

5
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:31,150
D'Anna saw the faces of the Final Five.

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,870
But if we unbox her,
she can reveal their identies to us.

7
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:35,872
The Final Five have been to Earth.

8
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:38,333
If we help find them,
they can help us get there.

9
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:40,765
So what could possibly
motivate us to trust you now?

10
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:44,646
The boxing facility resides
within the Cylon resurrection hub.

11
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:48,051
This hub controls the functions
of every resurrection ship.

12
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:49,724
We destroy the hub,

13
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:52,476
Cylons lose their ability to download.

14
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,632
The Hybrid on the baseship spoke

15
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:59,062
of an opera house and a dying leader.

16
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:00,981
We're going to talk to the Hybrid.

17
00:01:01,347 --> 00:01:03,500
And why would you require my presence?

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,615
Because you're in my visions.

19
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:08,738
President Roslin was apparently
aboard the Cylon baseship,

20
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:10,406
along with Gaius Baltar

21
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:13,263
and many of Galactica's pilots
when it jumped away.

22
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:14,452
Hub's gone.

23
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:17,327
We're getting radiation signatures
from multiple nukes.

24
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:18,787
Baseship fragments.

25
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,042
The President's baseship was destroyed.

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,039
It's a different baseship.

27
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:26,339
Waiting alone in a Raptor
as the rest of the fleet jump away,

28
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:28,363
that sounds a lot like suicide, Dad.

29
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:32,143
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I can't live without her.

30
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,783
Plug it in. I need to talk to it.

31
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,822
- Let God's will be done.
- Shut up.

32
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:06,993
It's time to get some answers.

33
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:20,482
Jump!

34
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:39,310
Elosha.

35
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,057
Oh, my Gods.

36
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,055
Filters...
Filters the sublime elevation...

37
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:59,067
Why did it jump? Where are we?

38
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:01,101
I'm more concerned about why we're here.

39
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,089
Why don't I talk to the Hybrid?

40
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:06,690
Find out why.

41
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,485
- She can just do that. She can just...
- Jump!

42
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,625
Will you walk with me?

43
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:24,491
Galactica.

44
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:26,513
It...

45
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:28,760
What's going on? It's empty.

46
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,714
It is.

47
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:31,886
Feels bigger this way, doesn't it?

48
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:38,025
It's so quiet. It's strange.

49
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:40,646
A lot of things are strange.

54
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:46,658
Wing beats of a dove drown out
the heartbeats of those who follow.

55
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:49,075
- The Six is back in the stream.
- That's unusual.

56
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:50,841
To jump again so quickly.

57
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:54,847
- What do you think it means?
- Look, it knows me.

58
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:56,285
It trusts me.

59
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:57,722
I think...

60
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:00,285
I think it even likes me.

61
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:04,015
You're getting information
from this liquid?

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,229
The Hybrid is disorganized.
It's panicking. I don't know why.

63
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,774
Tell me. Why are you jumping the ship?

64
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:14,661
The Six...

65
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:17,694
The Six who went among the makers
is no longer.

66
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:19,603
End of line.

67
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:22,996
Back in the stream that feeds the ocean
that feeds the stream.

68
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:23,969
The Six.

69
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,288
She means Natalie,
the Six who was our leader.

70
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,924
She's either been hurt or killed
back on Galactica.

71
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:33,670
That's why the Hybrid's panicking.

72
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:35,072
So she's upset.

73
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:39,092
Okay, fine. Can you... calm her down?

74
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:42,214
- Can you tell her to jump back?
- It doesn't work like that.

75
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,180
She makes her own decisions.

76
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:48,564
And we can't unplug her because now
she's wired herself into life support.

77
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:51,456
All right,
then why don't we give this a go?

78
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:59,167
Hey, stop jumping the ship, all right?

79
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,376
Calm your mind.

80
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:04,240
Cease countdown, cease countdown.

81
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,358
Circulation, ventilation, control.

82
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:10,078
Filters.

83
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:13,246
- Filters... The sublime elevation...
- Did you see that?

84
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:16,386
I just opened myself up to it,
on a spiritual level...

85
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,218
Jump!

86
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,108
Don't you just hate these people?

87
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:38,588
No.

88
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:42,183
But you don't love them either.

89
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,399
The people in this room are
the closest thing you've got to family,

90
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,432
and you...

91
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:50,240
You've been their President.

92
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,170
Watch them try to comfort each other.

93
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:01,155
At least you haven't taken that
away from them...

94
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:01,983
yet.

95
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,177
You didn't rob them of their empathy...

96
00:07:05,532 --> 00:07:06,244
yet.

97
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:10,309
You just don't make room
for people anymore.

98
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:13,978
You don't love people.

99
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:19,401
Is that clear enough?
Practical enough for you,

100
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:20,854
Madam President?

101
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:35,410
I think we're going
towards the resurrection hub.

102
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:39,546
I think the mission is still on.

103
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:45,683
You sure there's no ETA at the hub?

104
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:48,517
No, the hub is jumping
and our Hybrid's jumping after it.

105
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:51,250
Sometimes we're showing up
six hours after it's moved on.

106
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,239
Sometimes, like, six minutes.

107
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,930
And one time it'll be within
one jump-length and we'll catch it.

108
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,722
But we don't know when.
So we'll have to assume that any jump

109
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:01,043
could be the one
that drops us in next to it.

110
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:08,238
They're gonna read our heat signatures
the second we fire up the first Viper.

111
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,910
Hell, they'll read our electronics.

112
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:14,210
Yeah, if we could only mask that.

113
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:17,926
Go in cold.

114
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,192
No electronics at all.

115
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,739
We'll send the Vipers out dead,

116
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,881
towed by Cylon birds.
They'll never see it coming.

117
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:31,213
Take out the hub's jump drive,
then settle in for the long fight.

118
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:33,794
Yeah, good, okay, okay.

119
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,449
But you and me, we've got to get
onto the hub in the middle of that mess

120
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:39,101
and try to find D'Anna.

121
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:44,778
We can do this.

122
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:47,029
No, I don't know.

123
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:50,923
It's crazy, isn't it? We're putting
ourselves right where the action is.

124
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,537
It's not a great plan.
There's no time.

125
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:01,714
Let me help you.

126
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:21,756
Athena, my wife, she learned to do that.

127
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,153
She never did that when I met her.

128
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:31,324
What?

129
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,959
I got curious about Athena.

130
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:36,986
About her and Hera and you.

131
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:40,574
So I accessed her...

132
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:43,168
Her memories from her last download.

133
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:46,618
You have her memories.

134
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:48,925
Yeah,

135
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,281
and they're mine now too.

136
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,275
They're as real as my own.

137
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:58,602
I know this must feel like
a violation of trust or something, but

138
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,283
I don't...
I don't want it to be strange,

139
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:02,864
okay?

140
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,703
Right.

141
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:07,984
Right, sure.

142
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,921
Madam President?

143
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:25,613
Sir?

144
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,212
Hope I didn't wake you.

145
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,478
Come in.

146
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:41,720
Thank you for the use of your Raptor.

147
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,887
I needed some familiar surroundings.

148
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:47,567
Don't worry. I'll give it back to
Lieutenant Pike the second you need it.

149
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:49,753
About that.

150
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:52,822
This mission, it's very risky.

151
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:58,376
If there's even a chance
that we can go in and blow up that hub

152
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:02,496
and end Cylon resurrection
for all Cylons forever,

153
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:04,716
we must take it.

154
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:07,837
I cannot back away from that.

155
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,330
Yes, sir.

156
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:11,911
If

157
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,253
and when D'Anna

158
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,153
comes back from the dead,
bring her to me.

159
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:21,100
I think the Cylons think

160
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,087
that she'll be interrogated
by both groups together.

161
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:26,860
I'm sure they do.
Bring her to me.

162
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:31,987
She knows the identies
of the Five Cylons

163
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:33,660
in our fleet.

164
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,703
It is a matter now of human security,
and I will not

165
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:41,123
let the Cylons have audience
to that discussion.

166
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,979
I want to talk to her alone.

167
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:47,087
Yes, sir.

168
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:48,604
Good.

169
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:08,440
Welcome home, D'Anna.

170
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:13,210
You told me I'd never
have to go through this again.

171
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,384
I lied.

172
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,619
You thought
you were putting me away forever.

173
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,530
So what changed?

174
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:25,046
War.

175
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,459
A genuine Cylon civil war.

176
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:32,172
Ones and Fours and Fives
against Twos and Sixes and Eights

177
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,073
that objected to your retirement.

178
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:39,633
Now your supporters are working
with humans against all the rest of us.

179
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:41,363
All in your name.

180
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:49,760
Boomer's an Eight.

181
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:53,230
Shouldn't she be on the other side?

182
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,476
Boomer's my pet Eight.

183
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,125
She's seen the light of reason.

184
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:03,283
And an Eight can make a passionate ally.

185
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,665
Till she sees something shiny.

186
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:12,515
Why'd you bring me back anyway?

187
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:14,951
I brought you back to heal us, sister,

188
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,113
and end this shameful war.

189
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:27,560
Since Cylon pilots don't use call signs,

190
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,230
we're gonna be painting
unique identifiers on all their birds.

191
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:31,923
It's a relief.

192
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,179
You address them, use that number, okay?

193
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:36,190
Should've scrubbed
this frakkin' mission.

194
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,049
Everyone, listen up.

195
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:40,267
These heavy Raiders
aren't like the other Raiders.

196
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:44,286
They aren't gonna make any hinky moves.
They're under control of their pilots.

197
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,344
The Cylon pilots
are in charge of their birds.

198
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:49,417
- There are tiny pilots inside of them?
- We do our jobs.

199
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:52,529
- Training is just as good as yours.
- Oh, yeah?

200
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,339
Twenty-some of you
I've taken out weren't that good.

201
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:58,341
Redwing.

202
00:13:58,848 --> 00:13:59,785
Redwing!

203
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:03,595
Now let's talk about
the surprise element.

204
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:05,557
First wave of Vipers are gonna ride in,

205
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:08,768
engines cold, dradis and comm off, okay?

206
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,950
You're gonna come in towed
by cables from the heavy Raiders.

207
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,908
- We're rigging 'em up now.
- Captain, I don't know,

208
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,778
if they're all tied together here,
kissing their gasholes so to speak,

209
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:22,078
and they tap on the brakes,
we're gonna smash right in the back.

210
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:24,088
They won't. It'll work, you guys.

211
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,445
Really. When you're close enough,
the cable's gonna disconnect.

212
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:29,370
We're mounting
explosive charges to cut it.

213
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,642
Hold it, hold it.

214
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:34,419
- We cut the cable, right?
- Cylon pilots cut the cable.

215
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,047
Then you sling out of their birds
and you turn your power on.

216
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,008
You're gonna be gunning
directly at the hub's FTL.

217
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:42,459
Then it's an all-out fight until
we get there with the nukes.

218
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:45,050
So if the Cylons don't lift up,
we're toast?

219
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:48,714
No, look, I'm serious.

220
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:51,153
Pilots!

221
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:54,397
You've flown with Cylons.
You've flown with Athena.

222
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:57,668
You put your life in her hands
and she hasn't betrayed you.

223
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,574
Well, I am the same as her.

224
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:04,587
Now all of these Cylons here,

225
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:06,117
all of these people,

226
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:08,885
they're pilots like you.
And they're gonna be out in the soup

227
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:11,324
with you taking out other Cylons,

228
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,708
just like Athena does
every time she's asked to.

229
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,047
And when that hub is taken out,

230
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:23,759
all of their lives will be at risk.
Just like yours.

231
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:27,847
So you might want to think
about how you're gonna work together.

232
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:30,830
Because we're all dead if you don't.

233
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:36,738
Moving on.

234
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:39,067
Just go and ask it already.

235
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:43,777
I've been told that you said
something about an Opera house, and I...

236
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:46,493
- Because it seems pointless.
- Look, there was an Opera house.

237
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,695
An Opera house.
Are you listening to me?

238
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,590
Apparently I was in the Opera house.

239
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:53,999
I had a vision.
I was chasing after a little girl.

240
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,186
I came to a door. I saw

241
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:59,274
Dr. Baltar and the Six take the child.

242
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,756
And... She's not listening.

243
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,532
Protect the child.
She said, "Protect the child."

244
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:07,484
- That's what Caprica said.
- I was the one holding the child,

245
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:10,010
so obviously I was the one
protecting the child, wasn't I?

246
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,845
- In the opera house...
- No.

247
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:13,893
It wasn't at all clear
what you were doing.

248
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,271
- Let me listen.
- Booting up.

249
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:19,610
Obviously you've done this
a thousand times before.

250
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,285
- I'm doing the same thing you're doing.
- No, you're not actually.

251
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:27,324
Because if you'll watch what I'm doing,
I'm actually focusing on her, all right?

252
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,653
Tell us what happened
in the opera house, all right?!

253
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:32,829
The only thing you're doing is yelling.

254
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:36,749
- Such a format will close the doors.
- "Close the door". No, open the door.

255
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:39,294
I want to open the door! Do it again!

256
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:42,320
I'm going for a walk.
Love to see you do any better.

257
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,189
- All right, I'll do it. Open the door!
- Three!

258
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:49,530
The Three is online.

259
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,858
- Accessing data. Loading data.
- The Three is D'Anna. D'Anna is online.

260
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,936
- D'Anna... D'Anna's back in a body.
- Booting up.

261
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:56,853
Jump!

262
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,576
Why are we doing this again?

263
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,796
<I don't want to see this again.

264
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:15,789
The ancients used to say:

265
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,772
"a people is only as strong
as the body of its leader."

266
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,574
If I follow that thought,

267
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:26,335
are you saying that humanity died
because I died?

268
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,214
If you're my subconscious,

269
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:31,596
I've gotta say
you're a little full of myself.

270
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:34,308
Humanity didn't die because you did.

271
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,747
The ancients got a lot of things wrong.

272
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:39,811
The body of a people is not the same
as the body of its leader.

273
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:41,997
But the soul and the spirit might be.

274
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:45,694
Oh, I see, so you're only laying
morality at my feet. Well, that's okay.

275
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:47,153
I can take that.

276
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:50,325
There are a lot of people who have sins
far greater than mine.

277
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,534
You're thinking of Gaius Baltar.

278
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:55,370
"Then I dug into the stump

279
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,498
"and pulled rocks from the ground
until my fingers bled.

280
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,043
"I collected seeds
from the few fruits the island offered,

281
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,547
"and planted them in long,
straight furrows,

282
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,200
"like the ranks of soldiers.

283
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,371
"When I finished,
I looked at what I had done.

284
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:12,220
"I did not see a garden.
I saw a scar.

285
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:14,514
"This island had saved my life,

286
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,933
"and I had done it no service."

287
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:37,691
I can see a real hierarchy around here.

288
00:18:38,072 --> 00:18:41,458
And I have to tell you, you're on
the lower end of the scale, my friend.

289
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:43,518
Yes, you are.

290
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:48,445
Which is odd
when you think about the Cylon god.

291
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:54,719
They told you about God, didn't they?

292
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:59,476
I'm not even really sure if the Hybrid

293
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:01,354
was referring to D'Anna,

294
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,970
but if it's true...

295
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,029
- It certainly would make it easier.
- How so?

296
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:08,581
Well, we...

297
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:10,863
wouldn't have to find a...

298
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:12,807
Find a body.

299
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:15,978
Yes, good. Okay.

300
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,213
Go get her and bring her here.

301
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:24,932
Something else?

302
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,943
It's just once you have what she knows,

303
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,994
I can't help feeling like you could try
to keep Earth for humans only.

304
00:19:34,114 --> 00:19:35,221
And I just...

305
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,701
Madam President, that doesn't seem...

306
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:38,812
What?

307
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:40,846
... honest.

308
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,704
You're supposed
to be conducting a fair deal here,

309
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,897
and instead you're taking D'Anna off
by yourself.

310
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:48,585
- Taking what she knows.
- Slow down, Captain.

311
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:49,797
At best,

312
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,669
D'Anna knows the identies
of the Cylons in our fleet.

313
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:54,977
And at best,

314
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:57,317
they know a way to Earth.

315
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,706
So you're not denying you'd keep the way
to Earth to yourself if you could.

316
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,843
I'm not saying that's true.

317
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:07,447
I will say
that if the Cylons had the option,

318
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:10,830
that's exactly,
exactly what they would do.

319
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:15,793
No, I don't think so.

320
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:19,101
Not the Sharons, the Eights.

321
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:21,506
Captain,

322
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:26,021
you are not married
to the entire production line.

323
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:30,551
I cannot afford
to be sentimental right now,

324
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:33,528
and I cannot afford you
to be sentimental either.

325
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:35,587
If you can't do this job,

326
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:37,607
find me someone who can.

327
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:41,646
What is that?

328
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:46,944
I think we're there.

329
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:52,604
Something's going on.

330
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:54,881
Another baseship, unscheduled.

331
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:57,802
You've gotta speak
to the Twos and Sixes and Eights

332
00:20:57,962 --> 00:20:59,779
and tell them they've gone too far.

333
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,170
No.

334
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,683
Why don't you ask about the final five?

335
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:06,300
You never ask about them.

336
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,578
Because I don't believe
we're meant to know them.

337
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,416
Well, I'll tell you.

338
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:14,117
I will tell you.
I'll start shouting out their names.

339
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,383
Why do you risk it?

340
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:19,482
Are you going to help end this war
or are you useless?

341
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:22,202
25 heavy Raiders just launched
from the new arrival,

342
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,070
heading our way.

343
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:31,331
Come on, let's get this carpool started.

344
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:46,767
Now!

345
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:49,896
Cut the frakkin' cable now,
you frakkin' bastard!

346
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:08,164
The inhibition's been lifted.

347
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,459
- I sense it.
- It's the rebel baseship.

348
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,396
I think they're gonna attack.

349
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,326
- They're gonna blow the hub.
- That would be mass murder.

350
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:22,762
Death would be permanent for all of us.
They've gone insane.

351
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:24,534
Permanent death?

352
00:22:25,974 --> 00:22:28,184
Well, that makes this all
the more meaningful.

353
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:57,959
<i>Helo, we've blown their FTL.
That hub's not going anywhere.</i>

354
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,697
Okay, take us down.

355
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:13,521
Well, he's your god as well.

356
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:16,622
And God doesn't want
any of his creations to be...

357
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:18,276
slaves.

358
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:23,714
Not that you're a slave...

359
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:25,408
Exactly.

360
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:46,645
Go.

361
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,511
This place is gonna go. Grab her.

362
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:12,378
Run!

363
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,190
<i>Hardball, Pike. I'm hit.</i>

364
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,066
My attitude control is down,

365
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:27,132
and I can't even program
any frakkin' ordnance.

366
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:29,443
Pike, hardball.
Man, don't jump.

367
00:24:29,632 --> 00:24:33,072
You'll never make it to Galactica.
You know how many jumps that is?

368
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:35,770
I'm out of here.
Okay, I'm jumping back home.

369
00:25:00,387 --> 00:25:01,193
Karl...

370
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:03,854
Come on, let's go.

371
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:10,853
Go!

372
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:24,967
There was this dog, see,
and the master had placed a bit of food

373
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:26,685
on the edge of its snout.

374
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:30,784
And the dog had to wait
until he was told he could eat it.

375
00:25:33,356 --> 00:25:34,289
I know.

376
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:35,498
Pathetic.

377
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:37,123
Pathetic, isn't it?

378
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:44,194
Put him over there.

379
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:45,321
Wait.

380
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:48,972
Easy, Smith.
Easy, easy.

381
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:51,785
Okay.

382
00:26:53,618 --> 00:26:55,452
- Find out what's going on!
- Yes, sir.

383
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:56,721
Thank you.

384
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,384
- Easy, easy.
- Thank you.

385
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:03,957
Good.

386
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:10,800
Okay, wait.

387
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:17,371
Sorry.

388
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,398
You have this...

389
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:26,224
you have this big hole in your hide,
as Cottle would say.

390
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:27,135
Okay.

391
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:28,435
All right.

392
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:31,279
I'm gonna do this again.

393
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:33,907
- Thank you.
- It's the least I can do.

394
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,638
I think you're gonna live... as usual.

395
00:27:36,758 --> 00:27:38,130
You know something?

396
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:41,322
- What?
- You're very pretty.

397
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:46,697
Man, that morpha worked fast.

398
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,798
Still.

399
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,301
Do you know why I'm so serene right now?

400
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,403
You're doped out of your mind?

401
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,598
Because I know God.

402
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,315
You need God, Laura.

403
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:02,852
Really, you'd be a different woman.

404
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:04,907
I know God.

405
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:07,754
Therefore, I know myself.

406
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:10,838
Truth is...

407
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,892
I was harboring the most awful,
desperate guilt.

408
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:20,161
A heavy, dark...

409
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,092
unimaginable...

410
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:25,709
soul-breaking guilt.

411
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:33,930
Now it's gone.

412
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:36,094
Now it's gone, it's...

413
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:38,295
been transformed into...

414
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:41,786
I have been transformed.

415
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:45,225
What was your guilt about?

416
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:47,838
I have no guilt.

417
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,860
What was your guilt about?

418
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,643
I gave the access codes to the Cylons.

419
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,076
They wiped out most of humanity.

420
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:13,500
Of course, I didn't know that's what
I was doing at the time exactly,

421
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,125
but that's what I did.

422
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:17,288
And when I realized what I had done,

423
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:19,429
the magnitude...

424
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:23,489
In that moment, I was saved.

425
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:26,880
I was loved...

426
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:28,942
by God.

427
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:31,481
Looking back...

428
00:29:33,257 --> 00:29:35,028
I think I was rewarded.

429
00:29:38,181 --> 00:29:39,200
Rewarded.

430
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:42,703
Pythia talks about the flood

431
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,842
that wiped out most of humanity.

432
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,596
Nobody blames the flood.

433
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,753
A flood is a force of nature.

434
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:56,758
Through the flood,
mankind is rejuvenated, born again.

435
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:01,797
I was another flood,

436
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,280
you see.

437
00:30:04,713 --> 00:30:05,976
I blamed myself.

438
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:07,928
I blamed myself.

439
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:11,763
But God made the man
that made that choice.

440
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:16,900
God made us all perfect.

441
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:20,611
And in that thought,

442
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:24,119
all my guilt flies away...

443
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:27,547
Flies away like a bird.

444
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:33,314
I can give you that peace,
Laura, that freedom.

445
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,491
Pray with me.

446
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:39,587
Pray with me.

447
00:30:40,962 --> 00:30:41,738
Okay.

448
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:43,988
Thank you.

449
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:46,299
Okay.

450
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:18,635
What are you doing?

451
00:31:19,114 --> 00:31:21,370
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

452
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:22,761
You're fine.

453
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:26,181
You're fine.

454
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,414
Don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me, please.

455
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,287
<i>We have D'Anna on board.
We are clear of the hub.</i>

456
00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:54,209
<i>Commence nuclear strike.</i>

457
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:59,266
<i>Repeat, nuclear strike is a go.</i>

458
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:31,088
And with a whimper, every Cylon
in the universe begins to die.

459
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:34,533
Yes, that's right.

460
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:36,932
And it's a good thing, D'Anna.

461
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:39,616
Because now there's no difference.

462
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:44,170
We can all start trusting each other.

463
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:55,962
Don't do this to me.

464
00:32:57,193 --> 00:32:58,014
Don't...

465
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:00,358
Don't do this to me.

466
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,630
Don't do this to me, please.

467
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:14,343
- Please.
- No.

468
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:24,049
I'm not saying Baltar's done more good
than harm in the universe. He hasn't.

469
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:25,739
The thing is,

470
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:29,044
the harder it is to recognize
someone's right to draw breath,

471
00:33:29,164 --> 00:33:31,097
the more crucial it is.

472
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:34,796
If humanity is going to prove itself
worthy of surviving,

473
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:38,054
it can't do it on a case-by-case basis.

474
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:43,219
A bad man feels his death
just as keenly as a good man.

475
00:33:45,352 --> 00:33:47,113
What do you want from me here?

476
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:49,125
Laura.

477
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:51,602
Just love someone.

478
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:55,247
Love...

479
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:18,746
You go.

480
00:34:21,408 --> 00:34:22,232
You go.

481
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:26,746
You go to your rest now.

482
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,703
I'm not gonna be selfish anymore.

483
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:36,619
You go.

484
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:39,192
Rest.

485
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,074
No.

486
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,526
No...

487
00:35:28,288 --> 00:35:30,257
No, please, no.

488
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:39,128
Stop bleeding.

489
00:35:39,928 --> 00:35:41,353
Stop the bleeding.

490
00:35:44,964 --> 00:35:47,261
Okay, good. Don't go.

491
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:51,402
All right, we've gotta get D'Anna
to the control room.

492
00:35:51,731 --> 00:35:52,989
No, that's not the plan.

493
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:56,660
What? What plan?

494
00:35:57,461 --> 00:35:58,578
Interesting.

495
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,709
Please don't go, Gaius.

496
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:08,255
Please.

497
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,556
I don't know how...

498
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:12,650
All right, put it in.

499
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,711
I have to take her directly
to the President. No one else.

500
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:16,972
That wasn't the deal.

501
00:36:17,337 --> 00:36:20,273
I'm just doing
what she told me to do, okay?

502
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:22,828
Double dealing.

503
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:25,814
It's very human.
You never got that, Eight.

504
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:29,647
No more.

505
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,152
No more, don't go.

506
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,031
Please don't die.

507
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:40,809
Live.

508
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:50,499
I'm not saying I agree.

509
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:52,173
I'm saying it's my orders.

510
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:59,707
So I pretty much just made
a prize fool of myself, didn't I?

511
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:05,690
Trust.

512
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:07,814
Can we go find the President now?

513
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:29,878
Gaius?

514
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,179
Gaius, it's me.

515
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:45,143
The hub's been destroyed.

516
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:47,476
Good.

517
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:53,488
Don't let anyone in here
whatever it takes.

518
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:57,609
Thank you.

519
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:02,448
He's injured,
but I think he's going to survive.

520
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:08,065
I think it's gonna be
a long time jumping back.

521
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,764
I've got time.

522
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,084
Is that right?

523
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,468
You went to a lot of trouble
to bring me here.

524
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,892
Deceiving your so-called allies.

525
00:38:25,976 --> 00:38:28,249
I suppose you've got
some questions for me.

526
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,521
Yes, I do.

527
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:33,400
I'd like to talk
about the five Cylons in my fleet.

528
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:37,277
So you know about the Final Five.

529
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:40,171
I know they're supposed to know
the way to Earth.

530
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:45,152
But you don't know
that you're one of them?

531
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:57,068
Your face!

532
00:38:58,143 --> 00:39:01,131
It's ridiculous! No, look,
I'm not giving you any names.

533
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:03,288
Not until I feel like I'm safe.

534
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,323
Cause information is all I got, sweetie.

535
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,587
I'm mortal now.

536
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:15,134
In fact, I'm the only Three
in the whole darn universe.

537
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:17,747
So I gotta worry
about protecting myself.

538
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:21,464
I'll tell you who the Final Five are

539
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:25,206
when you take me back to your fleet.

540
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:27,488
And by the way, Laura,

541
00:39:28,343 --> 00:39:30,343
I would've said the same thing
if you'd have met me

542
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:32,351
with a whole lot of Cylons,

543
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:34,647
cause I don't trust anyone right now.

544
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:37,505
So all this deception,

545
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:40,401
complete waste of time.

546
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:49,115
To remove the pump
with the attached hose and wiring,

547
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:51,942
simultaneously release the three tangs
while pulling the pump

548
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:55,230
out of the retainer
along with the line and wiring.

549
00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:04,037
You lied to me.

550
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:06,697
Did I?

551
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:10,904
I thought I was earning
humanity's right to survive.

552
00:40:12,631 --> 00:40:14,292
It's not a vending machine, Laura.

553
00:40:14,675 --> 00:40:16,169
You don't save a life, and then...

554
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,889
cue the celestial trumpets...
Here's the way to Earth.

555
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:20,924
I know.

556
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:22,050
Jump!

557
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:26,331
Disorienting, isn't it?

558
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:29,390
All these little limping steps back.

559
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:31,464
I like it.

560
00:40:32,753 --> 00:40:33,837
I'm used to it.

561
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:38,727
Every jump brings us
a little bit closer to home.

562
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:40,543
Galactica.

563
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,719
My home.

564
00:40:50,388 --> 00:40:52,802
Maybe there's something there for me.

565
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:57,534
Maybe even closer.

566
00:42:17,103 --> 00:42:18,345
Missed you.

567
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:21,908
Me too.

568
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:36,240
I love you.

569
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:51,435
About time.

570
00:43:03,037 --> 00:43:03,852
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
