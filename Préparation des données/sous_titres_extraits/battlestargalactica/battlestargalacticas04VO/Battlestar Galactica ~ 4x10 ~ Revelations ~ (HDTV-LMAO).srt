1
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:22,996
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:23,798 --> 00:00:26,016
I just finished the post-flight
on Starbuck's Viper.

3
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:29,022
This thing looks like
it's been rolled off the showroom floor.

4
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:31,116
It's time to get some answers.

5
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:32,374
Plug it in.

6
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:33,699
Jump!

7
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:39,250
President Roslin was apparently
aboard the Cylon baseship,

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,926
along with Gaius Baltar and many of
Galactica's pilots when it jumped away.

9
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:46,090
Waiting alone in a Raptor
as the rest of the fleet jump away.

10
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:48,329
That sounds a lot like suicide, dad.

11
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:51,283
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I can't live without her.

12
00:00:51,796 --> 00:00:53,055
<i>We have D'Anna onboard.</i>

13
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:56,058
<i>We are clear of the hub.
Commence nuclear strike.</i>

14
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:02,098
So you know about the Final Five.

15
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,452
I know they're supposed to know
the way to Earth.

16
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:07,736
I've gotta worry
about protecting myself.

17
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:10,948
I will tell you
when you take me back to your fleet.

18
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:21,000
I love you.

19
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:25,436
About time.

20
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:42,836
Hey there, Mr. Prez.

21
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:44,728
Heard you're here.

22
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:50,737
Temple of Aurora.

23
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:53,647
On Earth.

24
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:59,298
At least the way Pythia described it.

25
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:00,885
We'll get there.

26
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,823
Walk those halls together.

27
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:06,508
Yeah, pretty to think so.

28
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,023
This Roslin's stuff?

29
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,259
- It's weird for them to not be here.
- No one sits in his chair.

30
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,798
Tigh can't even look at it.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,128
You know, the scariest thing my mom
used to tell me when I was a kid,

32
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:28,520
it's "your father is waiting for you
in the study."

33
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,655
I'd knock on the door.

34
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:34,696
Make the long walk across the room.

35
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:39,597
To that desk.

36
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,691
You know,
Leoben said something to me when

37
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,970
he was holding me
in that doll house on New Caprica.

38
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:52,672
That children
are born to replace their parents.

39
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:58,312
For children to reach their full
potential, parents have to die.

40
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:11,137
We rejoin your fleet
in less than an hour.

41
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,862
Then we will return
your Final Five to you.

42
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:14,774
Four.

43
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:17,574
There are four in your fleet.

44
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:18,698
Four?

45
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:22,066
- Where's the Fifth?
- I want the four in your fleet.

46
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:24,415
It'd be easier
if you just tell us who they are.

47
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:27,335
- Easier because you could kill them.
- Why would we do that?

48
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,162
They know the way to Earth.
We need them.

49
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:33,827
She's right. We all want the same thing.
If we cooperate...

50
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,297
We cooperated on New Caprica, brother.

51
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:38,595
It didn't work out well.

52
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,535
I'm going to hold your people hostage

53
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,039
until the Final Four
are safely aboard this ship.

54
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,844
You need to stand down, Bill.

55
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:00,026
Come on.

56
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:01,576
Trust me.

57
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,249
Stand down.

58
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:15,671
Pass the word.

59
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:17,436
Stack arms.

60
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:20,352
I've already had an Eight
prepare a Raptor,

61
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:23,101
so we'll launch
as soon as we come out of the jump.

62
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:24,499
Admiral,

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,019
you'll be coming along with me
to Galactica.

64
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:30,270
- I'm not going.
- Bill, go.

65
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:37,238
If the Cylons get the Four,
they get Earth.

66
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:41,075
You can't let this happen.
Even if you do blow this ship to hell.

67
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,806
Godsdamn it.

68
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:09,665
I got it, Felix.

69
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:13,991
Yeah.

70
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:15,990
Thanks.

71
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:25,744
Mr. Gaeta, do you wish to be relieved?

72
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:27,435
Good to go.

73
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,754
Dradis contact.

74
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:39,384
Incoming, bearing 1-8-5,
carom 2-niner-niner at 1700.

75
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:41,044
- What do we got?
- Cylon baseship.

76
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,597
Another contact, same bearing.

77
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:44,973
It's a Raptor.

78
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,321
Our people are back, sir.

79
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:14,293
Maybe she won't be able to identify us.

80
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,757
Gods, it's good to have you back.

81
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,183
It's good to be home.

82
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:48,618
The goods news is that your president,
Laura Roslin, is alive and well,

83
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,036
as are your crewmates.

84
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:52,581
She wants the Four Cylons
that are in this fleet.

85
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:56,522
She's gonna hold our people hostage
until she gets them.

86
00:06:56,642 --> 00:06:59,046
You don't have to do anything
except stay out of the way.

87
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:01,133
I'm already in contact with them.

88
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,091
Now that they realize
there's nothing to fear

89
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:05,437
and that we only want to love
and protect them,

90
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,889
they should find a way of joining us.

91
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:11,434
I ask that you don't interfere with
any of the shuttle traffic in the fleet.

92
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,726
So your plan
is you take these four Cylons

93
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:16,273
and then you head off to Earth,
leaving us behind.

94
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,063
Now that's up to them.

95
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,397
All right.

96
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,294
If these four Cylons
want to come to you,

97
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:27,075
they're free to do so.
I will not stop them.

98
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:30,078
Do you agree, Admiral?

99
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:31,488
Agreed.

100
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,707
Well, then I will await them
on the baseship.

101
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:40,754
Laura Roslin needs her medication.

102
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:45,719
And I need to make sure
that she's all right.

103
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:48,121
- I'm gonna go with them.
- No.

104
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:51,265
We can't give them any more hostages.

105
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:52,788
The Colonel's right.

106
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,520
I served under Roslin for two years.

107
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,107
My place is by her side.

108
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,163
Another hostage
isn't gonna change the equation.

109
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,676
All right, go.

110
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,195
Thank you.

111
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:19,043
I backed your play, and now what?

112
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:22,689
Starbuck goes to work on a plan
to get our people back by force.

113
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:26,341
If we can't stop the Cylons
from reaching the baseship,

114
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:28,568
Laura Roslin wants it destroyed.

115
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,687
Half our guys are over there.

116
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:34,975
It's your call, Mr. President.

117
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:42,900
Roslin's right.

118
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,578
We lose those four, we lose Earth.

119
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,602
If everything goes South,

120
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:53,160
we destroy the baseship
and everyone on it.

121
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,786

124
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,247
The prisoners were here,

125
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,241
but D'Anna must know
you brought me in on this.

126
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,677
If she's moved the prisoners, it'll mean
a compartment by compartment fight.

127
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:55,056
And if they open fire on
the civilian fleet while we're boarding?

128
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:57,516
They could wipe out
the human race right there and then.

129
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:02,082
We need our Raptors are out there
with their nukes cocked and locked.

130
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,591
There's gotta be other options.

131
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:06,109
Yeah, those frakkin' Four
could give themselves up.

132
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:20,830
Brothers and sisters,

133
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,084
this is a great day for us.
One of our lost siblings has arrived.

134
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:30,831
She's one of the Final Five?

135
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,251
I saw her in my vision.

136
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:35,314
Now she's come home.

137
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:44,514
Laura...

138
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:48,607
There's been something
I've been meaning to say to you.

139
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:52,864
I wanted to thank you.

140
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,589
For what?

141
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:57,652
Essentially for not murdering me.

142
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:05,991
That can't have been
an easy decision to make.

143
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,840
But I love living.

144
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:15,247
I love living, and I wanted to thank you

145
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:17,690
for saving my life.

146
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:34,806
I wouldn't...

147
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,169
be so grateful if I were you.

148
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,494
You should know that I told the Admiral
that if D'Anna doesn't back down,

149
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,803
he should blow the ship to pieces.

150
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:44,707
- You what?
- She's in here.

151
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,426
Madam President.

152
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:52,478
Gaius.

153
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:54,964
Tory.

154
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:56,036
Sit down.

155
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,809
I brought you your medication.

156
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:04,503
Oh, my Gods.

157
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:08,974
- How did you do that?
- I came back with D'Anna.

158
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:12,738
To be with my people.

159
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:16,783
Because you're one of the Five.

160
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:19,366
You're one of the Final Five.

161
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:21,927
D'Anna saw her.

162
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:24,553
In a vision.

163
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:28,672
I knew it.

164
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:32,464
Maybe not on a conscious level,
but subconsciously,

165
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,618
I always knew there was something.

166
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:36,801
You had no idea.

167
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:38,077
Did you?

168
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:39,422
No.

169
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:46,486
Might be worth pondering
what else you've been wrong about.

170
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:50,698
Tory, wait.

171
00:12:56,436 --> 00:12:57,642
You're right.

172
00:12:58,219 --> 00:12:59,170
I'm wrong.

173
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:01,362
Okay.

174
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:06,790
You are one of the revered Final Five,
and as such,

175
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:09,541
the Cylons will listen to you.
Is that not right?

176
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,213
So, Tory,

177
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:14,226
please

178
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,369
go to D'Anna and

179
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:18,467
try to convince her to back down

180
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:20,401
and release all the hostages.

181
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:22,488
I'm done taking orders from you.

182
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:43,975
<i>Mr. President,
there has been a change of plans.</i>

183
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:46,954
<i>I've just executed the first
of the colonial hostages.</i>

184
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:51,417
<i>Another will follow every quarter hour
until our people come home.</i>

185
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,102
All right, listen to me.

186
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:58,471
You're not giving us a chance.
We are cooperating.

187
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:01,845
She terminated the transmission.

188
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:13,458
All right then, Admiral,
you're a go for the rescue mission.

189
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,290
If it fails...

190
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,707
destroy the baseship.

191
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,157
Yes, Mr. President.

192
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:37,061
All right,
put these pilots in their cockpits.

193
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:40,264
Check all systems,
and let's put these birds in the tubes.

194
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:41,500
Got it, Chief.

195
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,740
There you go.

196
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,000
APU won't spin up.

197
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,271
There's gotta be a short,
and damned if I can find it.

198
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:49,010
But I set some guys tracking on it...

199
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:57,495
Galen, you with me?

200
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:02,404
You all know that we have a baseship
out there with our people on it.

201
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:04,827
It is our job to get them back alive.

202
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,114
So speed is the only thing
we have on our side.

203
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:09,272
They're no doubt expecting us
to try for a breakout,

204
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:12,210
so we have to get in under
their reaction time, which is damn fast.

205
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:14,042
Raptor flights two and six

206
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:16,427
under Athena
will be our breaching force...

207
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:34,753
What's the matter?

208
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:37,614
I'm hearing it again.

209
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,081
All right.

210
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,933
Anyone know what the frak
we're doing here?

211
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:56,093
I don't know. I just felt compelled.

212
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:01,146
- Something about this Viper.
- Like what?

213
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:07,182
You checked every rivet and washer
on that bird, and you didn't find squat.

214
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:09,702
Yeah, well, something brought us here.

215
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:11,892
Something's changed.

216
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:15,248
I just don't know what it is.

217
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:24,742
Maybe Kara can help.
She flew this thing to Earth and back.

218
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:27,312
Go find her. See what she can tell you.

219
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,629
But hurry up.

220
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:31,804
A lot of good people are gonna die.

221
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,659
So where are you going?

222
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:57,426
Bill, you gotta scrub this mission.

223
00:16:57,956 --> 00:17:00,106
What the hell are you doing here?

224
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,400
You're supposed to be in the CIC.

225
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,232
The Cylons will kill
every godsdamn hostage

226
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:08,402
before we put one pair of boots
aboard their ship.

227
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:12,182
Laura Roslin
will be the next to die, Bill.

228
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,159
I'm looking for options. You got one?

229
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:26,204
Yeah.

230
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:29,870
I should've told you
when I first found out,

231
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,840
but I didn't have the guts.

232
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,621
What's wrong with you, Saul?

233
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:43,657
Remember back at the nebula

234
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:46,427
when I told you
about that frakkin' music?

235
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:49,079
I thought it was in the ship.

236
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,299
I was wrong.

237
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:52,325
It was a signal.

238
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:56,261
Some kind of crazy,
frakked-up Cylon signal

239
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,042
switched me on.

240
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:04,767
I can't turn it off.

241
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,258
Switched you on.

242
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,180
Like Boomer.

243
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:18,468
I'm one of the Five.

244
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,929
- The Five.
- One of the Cylons D'Anna's after.

245
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:29,659
Quit frakkin' with me.

246
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:33,116
Colonel, I've known you for 30 years.

247
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:34,496
I told you.

248
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:36,992
I didn't find out until the nebula.

249
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:42,184
Think about this.

250
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,063
When I met you, you had hair.

251
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:50,788
I never heard of a Cylon aging.

252
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:52,302
Doesn't mean they don't.

253
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,322
Before the attack on the colonies,
we didn't know skinjobs existed.

254
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:59,754
Turns out there's another kind of Cylon
we didn't know about,

255
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,102
and I'm one of them.

256
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,759
On New Caprica, you were in captivity.

257
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:15,890
They did something to you.
They... An implant,

258
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:19,696
a post-hypnotic suggestion
that makes you feel this way.

259
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:23,375
- Let's go talk to doc Cottle.
- Listen to me!

260
00:19:24,658 --> 00:19:26,425
It is not a delusion.

261
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:29,954
It is not a chip in my head.
I am a Cylon.

262
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:34,552
I've fooled you for months now.
I didn't want to, but I did.

263
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:36,460
Get your hands off of me.

264
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,432
If I had the guts to airlock myself
when I first found out,

265
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,142
we wouldn't be in this mess.

266
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:42,952
But that's the way out.

267
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:45,292
Not this suicidal attack.

268
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:50,101
I am one of the Final Five.

269
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,033
D'Anna will back down if you threaten
to flush me out an airlock.

270
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:49,726
Okay.

271
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:06,353
Dad.

272
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:07,613
Dad, listen.

273
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:09,776
No one suspected.

274
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:11,056
No one.

275
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:14,432
Not with his record,
what he did on New Caprica.

276
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,919
His eye, what happened to his wife...

277
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:21,949
Come on, let's get up.

278
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:27,887
What have I done? All the people

279
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,550
I've sent to die.

280
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,718
For what?

281
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:36,622
For what?

282
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:38,711
For Earth.

283
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,262
There is no Earth.

284
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:44,865
It's a frakkin' joke. There is no Earth.

285
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,414
Okay, dad,

286
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:49,938
listen to me. Listen to me!

287
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:51,757
Pull it together.

288
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:54,682
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

289
00:21:54,802 --> 00:21:56,519
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

290
00:21:56,841 --> 00:21:58,191
I can't kill him.

291
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,570
I can't kill the bastard. I can't.

292
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,196
Okay, okay, dad.

293
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,549
It's... it's gonna be okay.

294
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:07,693
It's gonna be okay.
I'll take care of it.

295
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:08,713
I can't.

296
00:22:09,148 --> 00:22:10,690
I'll take care of it.

297
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:30,554
You mother-frakker.

298
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:32,993
Who are the others?

299
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,302
Where's the old man?

300
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:41,666
Right where you put him.

301
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:44,334
<i>Mr. President,</i>

302
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,910
<i>it's the CIC.</i>

303
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:48,287
<i>D'Anna's on the line.</i>

304
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,221
- This is the president.
- <i>Mr. President...</i>

305
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:07,747
- You're running out of time.
- <i>No, you are.</i>

306
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:09,474
<i>It's your turn to listen.</i>

307
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:13,510
If you harm another one of my people,
you so much as blacken one of their eyes

308
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,692
and I flush Saul Tigh
out of the launch tube.

309
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,203
We have no wish for further bloodshed.

310
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,240
May I speak with the Admiral?

311
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:26,076
No, you deal with me.

312
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:28,285
You have 10 minutes to release my people

313
00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:31,519
or you can kiss one
of your precious Final Five good-bye.

314
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:40,006
You want to save the fleet,
I need the others, and I need them now.

315
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:45,621
It's sitting here the same way
it has been for months.

316
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:47,941
What made you think
something was happening?

317
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:51,559
Hard to explain.
You know, it's just a feeling.

318
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:55,624
Yeah, I've got a feeling too.
You're both out of your frakkin' minds.

319
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:57,607
You had a feeling you could find Earth.

320
00:23:57,808 --> 00:23:59,888
I trusted you.
I backed you every step of the way.

321
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:01,776
Now I need you to trust ours.

322
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:08,823
Ensign Anders.

323
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:10,186
Specialist Tyrol.

324
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:13,227
Slowly put your hands on your heads
and face the Viper.

325
00:24:14,643 --> 00:24:15,686
Do it now!

326
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,714
What the hell is going on?

327
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:22,878
They're Cylons, just like the XO.

328
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:35,571
Sam.

329
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,990
Go ahead.

330
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:49,579
It's true, Kara.

331
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:03,822
There's something different
about this Viper.

332
00:25:03,942 --> 00:25:06,072
Something's changed. You gotta find it.

333
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:07,124
Shut up.

334
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:18,823
Fall back!

335
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:19,906
Fall back!

336
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:22,202
- Where the hell are you taking us?
- Keep moving.

337
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:24,110
- Otherwise, we shoot you here.
- No!

338
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,452
This is a wild guess.

339
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:40,609
You told them.

340
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:42,683
We should've done it day one.

341
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:45,282
Get the baseship on the horn.

342
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:47,980
Mr. Hoshi, we need the baseship.

343
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:11,439
- What's going on?
- D'Anna's gonna execute more hostages.

344
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,536
- Okay, take me to D'Anna.
- No, she won't listen to you.

345
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:17,664
I was with her in the temple when she
had the vision of the Five... Take me.

346
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:19,785
He's right. Take him, it's good.

347
00:26:28,306 --> 00:26:30,343
Are you ready to come to your senses,
Mr. President?

348
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:34,696
<i>Galen Tyrol and Samuel Anders have just
joined Saul Tigh in the airlock.</i>

349
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,429
They found them.

350
00:26:36,926 --> 00:26:39,659
They're in line
for an express ride into a vacuum.

351
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,534
You want them alive,

352
00:26:42,654 --> 00:26:43,647
stand down.

353
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:56,781
I know Lee.

354
00:26:57,843 --> 00:26:59,330
Press him and he'll back down.

355
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:03,301
Target our nuclear weapons
on the civilian fleet.

356
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:05,862
We'll see if he wants to play hardball.

357
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:07,350
D'Anna.

358
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:10,600
Gaius.

359
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,825
Coercion won't work with Lee Adama.

360
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:43,156
- He's too similar to his father.
- Lee's bluffing.

361
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:46,026
He's doesn't give a tinker's damn
about those three,

362
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:47,030
not now.

363
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:49,307
You push him, he'll kill them.

364
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:52,946
Then the entire human race
will die with them.

365
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,857
Mr. President,
the baseship nukes just went hot.

366
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,734
If any of our fleet
starts spooling up...

367
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:13,317
They won't have time to jump
before the Cylons fire.

368
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:17,841
<i>Sergeant Harder,
clear the tube of everyone but Tigh.</i>

369
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:20,723
Corporal.

370
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:38,305
Do you really think God brought you back
from the darkness for this, D'Anna?

371
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,516
Maybe he brought you back
for a different purpose.

372
00:28:42,592 --> 00:28:43,936
To end this peacefully.

373
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,893
They will never forgive us for what
we did to the Twelve Colonies, never.

374
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,482
Proceed.

375
00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:12,603
Brute force did not work for you
on New Caprica.

376
00:29:12,723 --> 00:29:14,568
It didn't work for you
on the algae planet.

377
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:16,662
So why is it gonna work for you now?

378
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:24,892
Give me the key.

379
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:46,441
We have weapons lock on their ships.

380
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:01,447
What are you waiting for, Apollo?

381
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:02,987
Do it.

382
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:06,417
Lee, stop! Stop!

383
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:07,656
Stop!

384
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,190
Those three frakkin' Cylons
just gave us Earth.

385
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:25,312
Well, it's a colonial
emergency locator signal.

386
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:29,302
And no other wireless
in the fleet is picking this up?

387
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:31,105
Gaeta's confirmed it.

388
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:33,594
The channel's empty
except for this Viper.

389
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:37,284
It's gotta be a signal from Earth.

390
00:30:39,668 --> 00:30:41,136
You're reaching, Kara.

391
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:43,055
Come on, Lee, add it up.

392
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,530
I vanish into a storm.
Ride this Viper to Earth.

393
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,839
Coming back, I get a vision
that leads me to the baseship.

394
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:51,456
Its hybrid tells me that the Final Five
Cylons have been to Earth,

395
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:54,812
but we need the missing three,
D'Anna, to bring them out into the open.

396
00:30:54,932 --> 00:30:57,447
And now we're starting to get messages
from the beyond.

397
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,051
You heard the signal.

398
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,591
The final Cylons led me to it.

399
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:04,629
If it's Earth, they've given us
the home of the Thirteenth Tribe

400
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:06,620
just the way the hybrid said
it would happen.

401
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,603
Like it or not, Lee,

402
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,541
something's orchestrating this
for a purpose.

403
00:31:13,812 --> 00:31:15,287
A higher power.

404
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:17,995
Call it whatever you want,

405
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:21,534
but it seems to want us
to find Earth with the Cylons.

406
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:51,578
One tiny needle in the whole fleet.

407
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,030
Well, you're right. It's wafer thin.

408
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:56,864
It's the best I could do
at short notice.

409
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,882
So you're all in agreement
this is the way to Earth?

410
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:04,427
It's a stretch,
but it's the best explanation we've got.

411
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,417
Which is why we chose
to share this information with you.

412
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:09,899
We could've jumped away with it,
left you behind.

413
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:12,560
But that would've led to another
confrontation, another stand-off.

414
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:17,475
- All this has happened before...
- But it doesn't have to happen again.

415
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:21,340
Not if we make up our minds to change.

416
00:32:22,182 --> 00:32:24,818
Take a different path.
Right here, right now.

417
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:28,702
You were afraid we'd kill these four,
and yet, here they are,

418
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:30,120
standing right behind you.

419
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:31,698
Free to go.

420
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:33,347
Or stay.

421
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:36,107
I've granted them an amnesty.

422
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,673
So the question is,

423
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:42,312
where do we go from here?

424
00:32:51,776 --> 00:32:52,887
All right.

425
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,219
I'll release your crew.

426
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,670
We go to Earth together.

427
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:17,099
We've projected a course
toward the signal.

428
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:19,949
It'll probably take
some revising as we go, but...

429
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:22,691
this is our destination right here.

430
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,051
Earth.

431
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:26,635
So...

432
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,534
What are your orders, Admiral?

433
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:32,032
Orders?

434
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:38,038
Are you ready
to take us to our new home?

435
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,335
I don't know.

436
00:33:48,272 --> 00:33:49,667
You don't know what?

437
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,008
What don't you know about?

438
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,756
It's good to see you.

439
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,751
Bill...

440
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:13,194
This is it.

441
00:34:15,306 --> 00:34:16,494
This is it.

442
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,067
This is everything
that we have been working for.

443
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:34,202
I want to see you
pick up that first fistful of Earth.

444
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,024
Come on.

445
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:47,774
I'll be back.

446
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,304
I see.

447
00:34:58,001 --> 00:34:58,983
Yeah.

448
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:01,679
Thank you.

449
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,958
Thank you.

450
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:07,282
Anyway, I'm glad to see you again,
Madam President.

451
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:09,563
And so is the Quorum.

452
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:13,289
And I guess I just finished the shortest
presidency in colonial history.

453
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,512
Yes, well,
don't look so relieved, Mr. Adama.

454
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:22,196
Because you were dealt a crisis
and you knew exactly what to do.

455
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:24,247
You faced it boldly.

456
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:26,824
This fleet is going to need

457
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:29,545
that kind of leadership
in the days to come,

458
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:32,085
so you are not off the hook yet.

459
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,262
Thank you.

460
00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:41,312
You guys just gonna sit here flapping
your lips or are we gonna go find Earth?

461
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:44,470
Kara and I have been working
on a recon plan...

462
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,440
Frak it.

463
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:47,323
This is the end of the line.

464
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:49,829
We've got nowhere else to go.

465
00:35:51,204 --> 00:35:54,064
And if we give the alliance
too much time, it'll fall apart again.

466
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:56,660
Gotta roll the hard six.

467
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:59,079
We all go together.

468
00:36:00,037 --> 00:36:01,498
As fast as we can.

469
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:04,127
Yes, sir.

470
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:34,222
Fleet in jump formation. Standing by.

471
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,227
Board is green.

472
00:36:36,649 --> 00:36:38,618
Ship reports ready to jump, Admiral.

473
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:41,697
Very well.

474
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:45,989
Madam President,

475
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:47,168
without you,

476
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:48,907
we wouldn't have made it.

477
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:52,257
Give the order.

478
00:36:59,036 --> 00:37:01,040
It's been a long time coming.

479
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:04,769
Okay.

480
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,578
Take us to Earth.

481
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:16,274
In five,

482
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:17,739
four,

483
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:19,226
three,

484
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:20,680
two,

485
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,121
one,

486
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:23,867
jump.

487
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:38,403
Jump complete.

488
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:40,458
Dradis is clear.

489
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:42,286
Fleet is checking in.

490
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:43,308
Nav.

491
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:45,518
- Confirming position.
- Take your time.

492
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:47,796
Get it right.

493
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:50,807
Fleet all present and accounted for.

494
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,449
Visible constellations are a match.

495
00:38:18,168 --> 00:38:19,984
Crew of Galactica...

496
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:23,309
People of the fleet...

497
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:25,600
<i>This is Admiral Adama.</i>

498
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:29,637
<i>Three years ago,
I promised to lead you to a new home.</i>

499
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:32,440
<i>We've endured a difficult journey.</i>

500
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:35,777
<i>We've all lost, we've all suffered,</i>

501
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,280
<i>and the truth is</i>

502
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,386
<i>I questioned
whether this day would ever come.</i>

503
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:43,693
<i>But today, our journey is at an end.</i>

504
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:46,037
<i>We have arrived...</i>

505
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:48,148
at Earth.

506
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,816
We made it, kid.

507
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,899
We did it.

508
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,122
You did it.

509
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:37,155
Earth.

510
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:05,050
