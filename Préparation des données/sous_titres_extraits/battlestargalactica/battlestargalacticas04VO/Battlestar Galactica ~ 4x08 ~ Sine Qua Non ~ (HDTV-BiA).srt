1
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:24,572
Thus shall it come to pass.

2
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,200
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

3
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:29,520
Where did you hear that?
Who told you that?

4
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,200
The Hybrid from the baseship,
before they unplugged it.

5
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:34,983
I've got to find out
about these visions.

6
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,818
Plug it in.
It's time to get some answers.

7
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:40,920
Can I see what you drew?

8
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:45,880
Hera!

9
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:53,276
Get away from my child!

10
00:00:53,478 --> 00:00:54,960
You are never gonna take Hera.

11
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,303
Jump!

12
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:07,080
Heavenly father...

13
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:09,160
Give me the strength,

14
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:11,480
the wisdom, and above all...

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,218
Quickly.

16
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:24,000
All right,

17
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,080
on three. One, two,

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,339
three, lift!

19
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:32,082
Keep some pressure on that wound
until I can get to the artery.

20
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:33,160
Mask on.

21
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:39,400
- The President's been kidnapped?
- Baltar was with her.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,133
- Are you saying he's responsible?
- I heard it was the Cylons.

23
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:45,231
- No, my people say she was shot.
- What are you talking about, Roslin?

24
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:48,720
No, one of Adama's marine shot a Cylon,
that is how this entire thing has begun.

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,364
- Where's Zarek?
- I don't know.

26
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:52,320
- Where is Zarek?
- Who's in charge here?

27
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:55,961
Vice-President Zarek is still waiting
to talk to you. What should I tell him?

28
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:56,889
Sir?

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,997
Deck crew says they just shipped over
the last of the Vipers.

30
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:05,800
That means we're down forty birds,
almost as many jocks.

31
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,280
We're gonna have to reconfigure the CAP.

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,959
Rethink our defense posture.

33
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:12,136
- Where is she?
- Clamp.

34
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,723
- Marines are holding her.
- My quarters.

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,041
Nobody has told us anything.

36
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,161
- No, no, no.
- All right, everybody.

37
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:23,089
Mister Vice-President,
we have some questions for you.

38
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,800
Thank you. Just calm down please.

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,160
Everybody, everybody,
just calm down, please.

40
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:30,982
Mister Vice-President,
it's really important that we know,

41
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:32,480
is the President dead?

42
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:35,298
- We have no information...
- She was assassinated by the Cylons?

43
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:37,848
There's no truth to that,
at least as far as we know.

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,080
- Then what the hell do we know?
- Clearly, our first priority

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,516
is to get out as much
verifiable information

46
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:45,560
as we can to avoid a general panic.

47
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:47,000
To that end,

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,080
I asked Admiral Adama to come
and answer our questions directly.

49
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:52,955
Unfortunately, he wouldn't take my call.

50
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:54,600
At this time, when...

51
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:55,840
However...

52
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,160
However...

53
00:02:57,575 --> 00:02:59,040
Please, just a moment.

54
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,360
President Roslin
was apparently aboard the Cylon baseship

55
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:11,908
along with Gaius Baltar

56
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:14,400
and many of Galactica's pilots
when it jumped away,

57
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:18,160
after one of their own leaders was shot
aboard Galactica.

58
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:21,187
We have no idea
when or if they will return,

59
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:25,063
if the President or the other captives
will be subject to reprisals.

60
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:40,797
For now,

61
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:43,163
under the powers granted me by law,

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,919
I have taken over as President.

63
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:47,326
Hear, hear.

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,522
By refusing even to meet with Zarek,

65
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:14,960
you're simply helping him
fan the Quorum suspicions.

66
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:17,183
Their suspicions don't concern me.

67
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:19,360
<i>Look, maybe
he's not the man we hoped for,</i>

68
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:21,383
but he's next in line.

69
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,360
The fleet needs reassurance
and stability,

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,015
<i>frankly the kind that only
its military commander can offer.</i>

71
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,960
If this fleet needs reassurance,
then you reassure them.

72
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,832
<i>That's your job, now.</i>

73
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:33,204
You can tell Zarek
he can go to hell.

74
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,070
Why?

75
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:42,160
- Sir.
- Do you hate your people so much,

76
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:44,840
did you look for any excuse to kill one,

77
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,480
or did you deliberately try
to sabotage this truce?

78
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:50,692
No, sir, of course not.

79
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:52,840
Then you tell me why.

80
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:56,119
You make me understand why you did this.

81
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,680
They were gonna take her... the Six.

82
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,080
She was gonna take my child.

83
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,440
There were too many witnesses.

84
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,476
They all said the same thing.

85
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:13,040
Your daughter was lost.

86
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:15,286
The Cylon merely kneeled down

87
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:16,661
and was talking to her.

88
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,544
Maybe that's what it looked like, sir.

89
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:20,200
- But I know...
- You knew better.

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
I had a vision.

91
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:24,640
A vision where the Six and Baltar
were taking Hera away from me.

92
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,021
A vision!

93
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:31,535
It was more than just a vision, sir.
When I saw them together,

94
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:35,000
I knew that they would take her,
that they would take away my child.

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,080
You murdered

96
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:39,120
an unarmed woman.
And by doing so,

97
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,438
you put the lives of every single person
in this fleet at risk.

98
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,720
And quite possibly,

99
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,440
cost the lives of the President
and your husband.

100
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:51,360
You disobeyed the direct orders
of superior officer.

101
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:53,351
But more importantly,

102
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,720
you betrayed a promise to me.

103
00:05:58,714 --> 00:05:59,920
I trusted you.

104
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:06,560
I will accept any form of punishment
that you think I deserve.

105
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:10,800
I just ask
that you please don't take away Hera.

106
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:12,649
I'm afraid the brig

107
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:15,160
is no place for a little girl.

108
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:17,993
Guards!

109
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,949
- Get her out my sight.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:29,040
At one time, Admiral Adama
supported Gaius Baltar's administration.

111
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,808
Is there a chance he'd support yours?

112
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,440
I'm afraid
only Admiral Adama can answer that.

113
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:36,400
Then I will address this question
to Delegate Adama.

114
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:40,064
Do you think that your father will
hand over power to this administration?

115
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:45,939
No.

116
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:55,763

120
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:40,529
Fine.

121
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:45,751
Recon Raptor just reported back.
The resurrection hub's gone.

122
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,471
No sign of the baseship
carrying the President,

123
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,468
assuming that's where they were headed.

124
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:53,895
They were determined
to resurrect the Three.

125
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,560
The one we used to call D'Anna.

126
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,609
To do that, they gotta go to the hub.

127
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:01,501
You find it and we'll find them.

128
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:03,840
- Easier said than done.
- Maybe.

129
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,240
We've got other problems.

130
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,880
Starbuck's having trouble fielding
enough planes to fly a standard CAP.

131
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,685
She wants us to consider
having the fleet bunch up tighter

132
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:14,418
so it's easier to defend.

133
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:19,072
Means counting on a bunch of civies
flying close formation.

134
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:19,967
Yeah.

135
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:22,797
Organize it.

136
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,167
I got you appointed

137
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,613
to this job.

138
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,660
Pulled strings,

139
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,120
called in favours.

140
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:39,448
All because I thought
you might do some good.

141
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:42,688
Now, you're advising me

142
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:45,143
to step aside from a position

143
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:46,718
that by law

144
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:48,521
is mine.

145
00:08:49,358 --> 00:08:53,080
- A position I was elected to.
- But you were never elected President.

146
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,320
But I was elected to office!

147
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,447
Which is more than Roslin can claim.

148
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,028
Why do you think
she kept me on in the first place?

149
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,160
To thank me for rolling over?

150
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:08,672
No.

151
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:12,440
No, to help legitimize her coup.

152
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:13,974
In the military,

153
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,707
we used to talk
about facts on the ground.

154
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,098
Well, the facts on the ground are these:

155
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:24,461
Right or wrong, Adama will never
recognize you as President,

156
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:26,040
and we need someone he will.

157
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,370
Now, the Quorum has the legal authority

158
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,920
to appoint interim President
in a time of crisis.

159
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,080
And I suppose you have someone in mind.

160
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:35,834
No.

161
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:38,000
No, not yet.

162
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,562
Which is why we need
to form a search committee

163
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:43,251
and start looking for a candidate
as soon as possible.

164
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:45,583
Well,

165
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:47,659
good luck with that.

166
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,184
<i>So Zarek, do you really believe
that this government's in danger?</i>

167
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:57,489
<i>Let's face facts. What we had these past
five years isn't a true government,</i>

168
00:09:57,609 --> 00:10:00,184
<i>but a tacit agreement
between a military strongman</i>

169
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:03,058
<i>and a political strongwoman
to rule together by fiat.</i>

170
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:04,906
<i>I heard you asked the Quorum
to authorize</i>

171
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:07,237
<i>the creation of a civil defense force.</i>

172
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,586
<i>After what happened
during the last military coup,</i>

173
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:13,056
<i>we don't want to depend on Galactica's
marines to guarantee our safety...</i>

174
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:17,676
You see the problem?

175
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:24,160
Lampkin's first rule of legal dynamics.

176
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,613
When an irresistible force

177
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:29,648
meets immovable object,

178
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,334
stand aside

179
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:36,639
and wait for the class action suit.

180
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:39,327
Except I'm not sure
if it's to anyone's benefit

181
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:42,472
if we just sit around,
waiting to pick up the pieces.

182
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,428
This thing's heading for a showdown,
there's gonna be bloodshed, unless...

183
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:48,562
Unless you can find someone else.

184
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:52,250
Someone your father won't reject,
someone the Quorum will approve of,

185
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:56,441
someone to take Tom Zarek's place
as interim President

186
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:58,575
until the next round of elections.

187
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:04,687
Don't take the case, Counselor.

188
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:06,714
It's a loser.

189
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:09,503
I have to.

190
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:11,777
<i>We</i> have to.

191
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,211
No one on the Quorum
is going to lift a finger.

192
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:23,517
Zarek's got them inhaling fear
and exhaling anger.

193
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,935
But you have taken
the pulse of the fleet

194
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:27,640
and you know character.

195
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,125
And frankly, you need a reason
to get out of this room.

196
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:34,747
Unless you want to start discussing
what's been keeping you here.

197
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,400
So you won't be dissuaded, will you?

198
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:48,281
Not even when you hear my fee?

199
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,196
- Fee?
- Appearances to the contrary,

200
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,390
I'm actually in this for the money.

201
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,400
I have a reputation to maintain
after all.

202
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:59,746
Okay, so what did Roslin offer you
to defend Baltar?

203
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,563
Room with a view.

204
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:06,268
Well, I'm not sure
I can improve on that.

205
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:08,973
Then pro bono it is, Counselor.

206
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:11,416
A word to the wise.

207
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:15,206
Sometimes it's better to settle
for what you've already got.

208
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,016
Colonel Tigh.

209
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:24,882
I understand you've

210
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:27,880
developed a relationship
with the Cylon prisoner.

211
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:32,000
That's not the word I'd use,
but she has been more cooperative.

212
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,331
See if she'll tell you
anything about the hub.

213
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:41,080
Bill.

214
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:43,859
We'll find her.

215
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,180
We'll find all of them.

216
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:56,624
The resurrection hub. How do we find it?

217
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:59,946
- I'm sure the others have told you.
- You tell me.

218
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,920
Only our hybrids can locate it.

219
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:08,320
And then,
only after it completes a jump.

220
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,447
Even they can't anticipate
where it's going.

221
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,000
You're holding back something.
I know it.

222
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:16,560
- You're lying.
- I have never lied to you, Saul.

223
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:18,179
Why don't you trust me now?

224
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:20,454
Because there are
too many lives at stake, lady.

225
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,614
Your buddies took off
with half an air wing,

226
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,920
not to mention the President
of the frakking colonies herself!

227
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:30,640
She's the real reason you're so angry.
So worried. I can hear it in your voice.

228
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:31,971
Why?

229
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,600
Why is a dying woman
so important to you?

230
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:37,040
Not to me, godsdamn it, to the old man!

231
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,200
Admiral Adama?

232
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:55,534
Saul?

233
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,280
- Do you love me?
- What?

234
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,800
Be honest with me.
I've been honest with you.

235
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,629
I don't believe this.

236
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:04,720
You're asking me if...

237
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:09,040
<i>Attention.
Set condition 1 throughout the ship.</i>

238
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,557
This has gone too frakking far!

239
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:14,566
I don't know what kind of mind games
you are playing with me, lady,

240
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:15,895
but it ends here!

241
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,289
What do we got?

242
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,152
One of our missing Raptors
jumped into dradis range.

243
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:31,599
- You sure it's ours?
- Transponder checks out.

244
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,966
It's one of the Raptors
that boarded the rebel baseship.

245
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,535
No radiological signature.

246
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:37,960
Racetrack and Skulls
are on their way to intercept.

247
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,960
<i>Actual, Racetrack.
I'm eyeballing our bird now.</i>

248
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:46,507
Looks shot to hell. Venting fuel and O2.

249
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:49,360
Still no response to hails.

250
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:52,192
Someone had to jump that bird.

251
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:57,391
I can't see a frakking thing from here.

252
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:00,680
Skulls, take the wheel.
I'm going for a walk.

253
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,188
<i>Decompression check okay. Opening hatch.</i>

254
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,613
<i>Safety line secure.
Moving toward the Raptor.</i>

255
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:44,225
<i>I'm seeing major damage to the canopy.</i>

256
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,827
<i>Looks empty inside.</i>

257
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:04,905
<i>I've got the hatch open, but it's stuck.</i>

258
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,225
Grav field's off.

259
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,365
It's Pike.

260
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:16,780
<i>He's dead.</i>

261
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,971
This is the shuttle
she took over to the baseship.

262
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:53,869
Laird was able to salvage
the flight data recorder.

263
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:57,201
Puts the originating jump point deep
in sector Delta 9.

264
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:01,673
President Zarek called again,
he heard about the Raptor

265
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:04,388
- and he's waiting to be briefed.
- Recall the CAP.

266
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:06,391
Spin up the FTLs.

267
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,375
- What about the fleet?
- Let's go.

268
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:12,344
We are essentially looking
for an understudy. The quandary is...

269
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,187
One doesn't generally
get the chance to...

270
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,943
wield political power

271
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:19,354
without the ambition
to actively seek it.

272
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:20,440
Easy, Lance.

273
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:22,584
That same ambition

274
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:26,973
often compromises the unselfish motives
that begat the quest.

275
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,817
In other words,
a battle of Id versus Ego

276
00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:31,342
that Ego rarely wins.

277
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:34,525
Roslin never sought power.

278
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:36,734
Exception that proves the rule.

279
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:41,061
One could argue that Laura Roslin
is a study in repressed ambition.

280
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,495
Just like you, Mr. Adama.

281
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:47,120
Never seeking out a job
until it's handed to you.

282
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:50,821
Flight leader, Battlestar commander,
Quorum delegate.

283
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,742
A man doesn't carve out
a path like that through life without...

284
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:57,360
All right, enough of the psychoanalysis.
Let's get back to the job in hand.

285
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:03,339
Does your father have some other place
he wants to go?

286
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:05,123
What?

287
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,656
Where the hell did they go?

288
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:12,840
And why didn't they tell us?

289
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:36,750
Galactica, Racetrack. We've located
the source of the transponder.

290
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,750
It's Sandman's Viper all right.

291
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,036
<i>- But no Sandman.</i>
- Affirmative.

292
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:43,500
Keep searching.

293
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,814
We're getting radiation signatures
from multiple nukes.

294
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:51,538
Baseship fragments,

295
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,758
other debris
indicative of resurrection technology.

296
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:58,190
I'm afraid
it paints a pretty clear picture.

297
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:03,496
They found the hub
and they destroyed it.

298
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:08,725
Looks like our pilots helped.
Question is, where'd they go from here?

299
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:11,972
You are way too close to this.

300
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:14,190
The President's baseship was destroyed.

301
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,110
It's a different baseship.

302
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,184
We'll search every square inch
of this debris field,

303
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:22,386
- until we come up with a clue.
- What, and leave the rest of the fleet

304
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:25,008
back there with their asses
hanging in the wind?

305
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:27,393
Detail four Raptors to stay behind.

306
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:30,990
They keep searching
until they find something concrete.

307
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:32,814
Give my order.

308
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,502
People, listen up.
What are we gonna do here?

309
00:19:44,806 --> 00:19:47,110
All right, everybody.
Gather around, please.

310
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:50,590
- Mister President.
- Please, please...

311
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:53,590
Sorry, Admiral Adam will not be coming
to answer your questions.

312
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,084
I did learn, however,
that he contacted the fleet's Captains

313
00:19:57,254 --> 00:20:00,044
to inform them that several
of their ships will be requisitioned

314
00:20:00,214 --> 00:20:02,870
to expand the search for Laura Roslin
and the missing baseship,

315
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:06,870
while our tylium shipments will be
diverted to support that mission.

316
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,163
But he's bypassing us completely!

317
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:11,822
I understand... We're doing the best...

318
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:15,190
I understand.
We're trying to get some communication.

319
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,571
Captain Franks.

320
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,233
I was impressed by her gravitas

321
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:25,160
during her turn as judge
in the Baltar trial.

322
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,084
That and her vote, naturally.

323
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:31,021
No. She's already been approached to run
for office. No interest in politics.

324
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:33,270
Sadly, now she really impresses me.

325
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:36,030
Gods.

326
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:38,299
You ever feed that animal?

327
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:41,164
Where is he, anyway?

328
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:45,989
<i>Come on, Romo.
Let's put our heads together.</i>

329
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,739
<i>Who would Adama respect as President?</i>

330
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:51,543
What does this...

331
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,553
search for paragons net us anyway

332
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,403
except greater guilt
at our own failings?

333
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:58,553
Or worse.

334
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:01,830
The idiot's illusion of a clean slate,
a fresh start.

335
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:04,756
We haven't ruled out
all these names yet.

336
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,510
This one's a looser.
An exercise in futility.

337
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:15,386
Lawyers...

338
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:21,048
How this is gonna affect the President?
The break in her treatment?

339
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,616
Assuming no other changes
in her circumstances?

340
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:24,596
Yes.

341
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,241
Doloxan really kicks your ass,

342
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,567
so she actually
might feel better at first.

343
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:31,005
But any break gives the cancer
a chance to regroup.

344
00:21:31,175 --> 00:21:33,097
Makes it that much harder
to beat it back.

345
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:35,056
Plus she's taken a hit
to her immune system

346
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,388
so she'll be vulnerable to infections.

347
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:39,690
How long?

348
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:43,990
The sooner you get her back here,
the better her chances are.

349
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:48,239
And while you are digesting that,

350
00:21:49,165 --> 00:21:52,992
I have some other news...
I ran some tests on your Cylon prisoner.

351
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,431
Guess what I found?

352
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,792
Raptors are due back in a few hours.

353
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:07,174
Granted, if they'd found anything
we would have heard from them by now.

354
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,509
Still,
once we correlate their reports...

355
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,493
I'm not interested...

356
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,884
in the search.

357
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:14,301
You're not?

358
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:17,830
I know that you've been spending
a lot of time interrogating the Six.

359
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:24,765
But now, the brig guards tell me
that every time, you order them out,

360
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:26,974
and you turn off the cameras.

361
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:29,559
I'm not torturing her
if that's what you're worried about.

362
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:30,808
I'm not.

363
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:34,510
That I could almost understand.
This I can't.

364
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:39,202
Cottle tells me she's pregnant.

365
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:44,163
What the frak
have you been thinking, Colonel?

366
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,150
Do you deny it?

367
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:50,453
You don't.

368
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:52,865
You can't!

369
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,310
What the hell have you been thinking?

370
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,230
Who is interrogating who?

371
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,429
How many  secrets
have you told this thing?

372
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:03,310
How can you even ask me that?
Question my loyalty?

373
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:04,640
Your loyalty?

374
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:07,030
I need more than your loyalty.

375
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:10,110
You're my first officer.
I need judgment.

376
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:12,432
I need your competence.

377
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:17,085
I'm through jeopardizing this ship,
because of your weaknesses.

378
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,833
- Yes, your weaknesses!
- You're risking all our lives for what?

379
00:23:20,953 --> 00:23:23,005
Our missing pilots? No, for a woman.

380
00:23:23,175 --> 00:23:26,486
- For a frakkin' woman!
- You watch what you say about her!

381
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:29,950
She's the President. Not some skinjobs
that I've been banging.

382
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,028
What do you think Ellen
would say about this?

383
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:35,190
- Leave Ellen out of this.
- What would she say about her husband

384
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,150
impregnating a frakking Cylon prisoner.

385
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,390
You mother frakker!

386
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:09,670
You know how many times
I've had to repair this thing?

387
00:24:26,427 --> 00:24:28,350
What are you gonna do with that woman?

388
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,630
What are you gonna do about Laura

389
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:35,616
if you ever find her?

390
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:39,789
I don't know.

391
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:03,708
Have the Raptors and the civilian ships

392
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:07,227
begin the search
from Phantom's last known position.

393
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,666
Is that a problem?

394
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,731
Sir, respectfully,

395
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:16,510
I've already got two missing pilots,

396
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,853
and hardly enough birds
left to protect this fleet.

397
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:21,501
Now you're asking me to send
the Raptors out on a blind search

398
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:24,301
looking for a ship
that very well may be destroyed.

399
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:27,368
My people are gonna feel like they're
being asked to go on suicide missions.

400
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:28,550
I'm not asking.

401
00:25:31,744 --> 00:25:33,512
You're dismissed, Captain.

402
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:52,776
Admiral Adama?

403
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,709
Mr. Lampkin, what are you doing here?

404
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:07,505
Writs of forfeiture

405
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,022
for the ships you're borrowing.

406
00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:11,995
The captains want
to be absolved of any blame,

407
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:13,605
should anything untoward happen.

408
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:18,281
One of the less ennobling consequences
of a legal culture.

409
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,312
No one wants responsibility.

410
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:27,760
Lee said you once gave him something,
before a mission.

411
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:29,704
A lighter, was it?

412
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:34,175
Belonged to my father.

413
00:26:34,913 --> 00:26:38,320
Foolish to think a hunk of metal
could keep him safe.

414
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,149
And yet, that's what we do, isn't it?

415
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:42,798
Hang on to hope

416
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,567
in every hopelessly irrational way
that we can.

417
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:51,400
But not like those poor bastards
giving away their luck

418
00:26:51,854 --> 00:26:53,754
just when they need it most.

419
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,370
It's like they've given up.

420
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,160
If you've never been in combat,
you have no idea what they're thinking.

421
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:05,323
I always imagined you
a realist, Admiral.

422
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,521
Not one to indulge a vain hope
at the cost of lives.

423
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:12,704
But then...

424
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,020
everyone has his limits.

425
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,692
"Sine qua non", as they say.

426
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:20,674
Without which not.

427
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:21,601
Yes.

428
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:25,363
Those things we deem essential
without which you cannot bear living.

429
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:28,074
Without which life in general

430
00:27:28,194 --> 00:27:30,234
loses its specific value,

431
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:33,248
becomes abstract.

432
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:36,600
You may have a point, Counselor.

433
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:38,917
Then while I'm on a roll...

434
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:43,114
Tom Zarek may not be an ideal President,

435
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:46,534
but we could do worse.

436
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,530
You're right.

437
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:52,880
There are limits to my realism.

438
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:57,599
Goodbye, Counselor.

439
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:08,299
I can't give up on her.

440
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,055
I can't let her go.

441
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,192
I've lost my objectivity.

442
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,930
And now that I see that,

443
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:20,680
I have no choice.

444
00:28:22,314 --> 00:28:25,960
Tell the Quorum that I'm relinquishing
command effective immediately.

445
00:28:31,413 --> 00:28:32,813
No man is perfect.

446
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,324
No man is less perfect
than a candidate for high office.

447
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,280
And thus...

448
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:45,058
the ranks of likely suspects
is winnowed to none.

449
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:51,360
What if we're going about this
backwards, hey, Lance?

450
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:55,668
What if instead of picking names
and finding fault,

451
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:57,640
that we ask ourselves

452
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,360
the qualities that we want...

453
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:00,516
No.

454
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:02,400
No, what we need

455
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,215
is a new chief executive
and see who fits that bill.

456
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:08,895
Honesty, of course.

457
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:12,412
The wisdom to recognize the correct

458
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:14,240
from popular choice.

459
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:17,200
As well as the courage
to see it through.

460
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:19,120
Experience.

461
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,600
When the wrong choices cost lives
and the right ones save.

462
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:26,178
Tall order.

463
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,892
We might as well spell out one name.

464
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:39,330
Just one.

465
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,520
One we knew from the start.

466
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:52,679
Sometimes you take on a losing case

467
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,889
and you make yourself a believer.

468
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:57,400
Other times,

469
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:59,560
no matter what you tell yourself...

470
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,836
in your heart...

471
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,036
you know the outcome is fixed.

472
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:11,913
The verdict inevitable.

473
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:16,600
Lance, defense rests.

474
00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:21,539
Come on.

475
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,194
Apologies.

476
00:30:33,022 --> 00:30:34,559
I couldn't wait to tell you.

477
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,040
- Tell me what?
- We found our candidate.

478
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,360
Someone the Quorum won't hesitate
to approve

479
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,703
even over Zarek's objections.

480
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:44,969
Someone the Admiral can't help
but accept.

481
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:47,541
Yeah? Who?

482
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,680
Congratulations, M. President.

483
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,564
My name was never on that list.

484
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:58,240
Of course not!
That would be too blatant.

485
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:02,560
But it is everything
you always wanted, isn't it?

486
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:06,080
Why you had me cross
47 names off that list.

487
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:08,194
Come on.

488
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,760
Admit it.

489
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,225
Savor your victory, M. Adama.

490
00:31:14,393 --> 00:31:16,560
'Cause you'll never get
the chance to serve.

491
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,018
- What are you doing?
- Why?

492
00:31:25,138 --> 00:31:27,600
'Cause you're perfect for the job,
of course.

493
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,560
'Cause after the vicious aberration
that was Baltar's presidency,

494
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,560
and the bitter disappointment
that was Roslin's,

495
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,204
you are

496
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,680
a shining beacon of hope.

497
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:40,658
Only hope is the last thing we need.

498
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:42,160
We're a doomed race.

499
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,680
And it's time that we made our peace
with that essential truth.

500
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:47,680
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Why?

501
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:49,385
You wanna know why?

502
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:51,602
Open it!

503
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,112
Frak!

504
00:32:02,343 --> 00:32:03,493
That's right.

505
00:32:03,806 --> 00:32:05,280
They killed my cat!

506
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,568
- They?
- They!

507
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:09,120
Those debased dregs of humanity
out there.

508
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:11,888
Our lost tribe in search of a new home

509
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:14,310
so they can roost and rot again.

510
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,996
Romo, how long has the cat been dead?

511
00:32:16,116 --> 00:32:18,730
How long?
It's irrelevant, it's immaterial.

512
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,346
- Since it wasn't even my cat!
- Romo.

513
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:24,840
- It's been dead for weeks.
- It belonged to my wife.

514
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:27,278
I just retrieved it
from a vet on Geminon

515
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:29,898
when the bombs started to fall, and fate

516
00:32:30,874 --> 00:32:32,724
presented me with a choice.

517
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,297
I could get back on that shuttle or

518
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:38,761
I could run home and...

519
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:40,200
try to save my family.

520
00:32:43,702 --> 00:32:45,740
- How do you think I chose?
- Romo,

521
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,415
we've all had to make difficult choices.
You don't think I know?

522
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:50,574
Your wife's name was Faye.

523
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:53,219
You had two daughters,
Jennifer and Katie.

524
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,011
There were over 200 passengers
on that shuttle.

525
00:32:56,131 --> 00:32:58,431
Only a handful chose to stay behind.

526
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:01,114
Right, it was in your file

527
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:03,760
when you handed the job
as Baltar's council.

528
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,820
But no one blamed you, Romo,

529
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:08,781
because at a certain point
we all made decisions

530
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:11,601
that saved our lives
at the cost of others.

531
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:14,845
You think you're unique, Romo?

532
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:18,822
- Think your sins are so special?
- Is that it, Counselor?

533
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:21,066
You're gonna rest your entire case

534
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:23,906
on that pathetic little bit of insight?

535
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:25,195
No...

536
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:26,582
on this.

537
00:33:27,928 --> 00:33:31,193
The clean slate, the fresh start,
maybe they are illusions,

538
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:32,513
like you said.

539
00:33:32,864 --> 00:33:34,080
But at a certain point,

540
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:36,560
faith in ourselves,

541
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:40,506
in our right to survive,
as a species, as a people,

542
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,710
that's not a given...

543
00:33:43,492 --> 00:33:44,792
That's a choice.

544
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:47,808
Well, I've made mine.

545
00:33:47,928 --> 00:33:49,313
And if you can't stomach that,

546
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:51,741
then you had damn well
better squeeze that trigger right now.

547
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,083
Go on.

548
00:33:54,753 --> 00:33:56,334
What are you waiting for?

549
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,620
Or you can make a choice.

550
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,880
Put your past behind you.

551
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:06,007
Put the gun down.

552
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:08,138
And help me.

553
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:11,125
Because I'm telling you,

554
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:13,280
I'm gonna make a difference
in this fleet.

555
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:14,960
Is that your final word?

556
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:17,378
That's up to you.

557
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:20,566
Then swear it.

558
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:22,892
I,

559
00:34:23,535 --> 00:34:25,119
Leland Joseph Adama,

560
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,440
do now avow and affirm...

561
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,976
That I take the office

562
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,985
of President
of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol

563
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,200
without any moral reservation
or mental evasion.

564
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,822
<i>That I take the office</i>

565
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,598
<i>of President
of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol</i>

566
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:42,559
<i>without any moral reservation</i>

567
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:44,344
<i>or mental evasion.</i>

568
00:34:46,832 --> 00:34:48,757
This is a frakking joke.

569
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,090
You're the only man I can trust

570
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:54,081
to command this ship.

571
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:56,554
Maybe you're crazy enough
to pull a stunt like this

572
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:59,320
but you can't be crazy enough
to leave me in charge.

573
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:03,560
In case you forgot, my last term
at the helm was a complete disaster.

574
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:05,713
That was a long time ago.

575
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,563
You're not the same man you were.

576
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,367
You're not even the same man
who came back from

577
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,057
New Caprica.

578
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:17,123
You found out a lot about yourself.

579
00:35:17,243 --> 00:35:19,940
Been tested in ways
that I can't barely begin to imagine.

580
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,883
You're ready.

581
00:35:23,197 --> 00:35:24,211
Besides,

582
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,216
don't count on this being permanent.

583
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,200
What if it is?

584
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,607
Put these on...

585
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:36,892
and you lead the people

586
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,160
to Earth, the best way you can.

587
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:42,663
The fleet has stayed here too long
already.

588
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,000
Any other last orders?

589
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:47,719
Just one.

590
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:53,440
Give Athena back her daughter.
She needs her family.

591
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,831
We all need our family.

592
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,240
Take care of this one.

593
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,298
All right, let me see the changes
before you get this out to the press.

594
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:39,938
- All right.
- Thank you.

595
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:41,994
Mr. Lampkin.

596
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:45,845
Romo.

597
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:49,000
One day in office and
you've already got a first pet.

598
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,190
Jake here is a genuine
hero of the resistance.

599
00:36:53,457 --> 00:36:55,564
Aren't you, Jake? Unfortunately,

600
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,120
his previous owners had to let him go.

601
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:00,720
Jake, meet Romo.

602
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:02,648
Romo, meet Jake.

603
00:37:05,368 --> 00:37:06,918
Your new best friend.

604
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:10,101
If there's one thing I hate
more than cats, it's dogs.

605
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:12,300
See, a new pet for you to loathe.

606
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,126
I knew it would be the perfect gift.

607
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:17,874
Good luck, Jake.

608
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:24,400
I hear you're keeping Zarek
as Vice-President.

609
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:26,367
I can use the advice.

610
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,470
And as long as he knows he's heard,

611
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,303
I think I can trust him.

612
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,849
I don't know if I agree
with your thinking.

613
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:37,202
Well, I could say
the same thing about yours.

614
00:37:39,096 --> 00:37:40,260
The only difference is

615
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,800
you're gonna be President,
I'm just getting in a plane.

616
00:37:44,454 --> 00:37:45,894
Waiting alone in a Raptor,

617
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,520
while the rest of the fleet jumps away,
that's not just getting in a plane.

618
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:51,981
That sounds a lot like...

619
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,320
It sounds a lot like suicide, Dad.

620
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:57,323
At least this time
I'm only risking my own neck.

621
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,361
So I guess it won't matter
if as President

622
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:01,520
I order you not to do this.

623
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:06,544
I don't know
if I ever told you this, but

624
00:38:07,472 --> 00:38:09,840
one of my first missions
was a solo recon.

625
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:12,543
Me alone in a Raptor

626
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:13,960
in enemy space.

627
00:38:14,278 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm not gonna lie to you, I was scared.

628
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:18,659
Told myself that I was doing my duty,

629
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:20,720
and ultimately I faced my fear.

630
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,080
That's a good memory.

631
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:26,800
Why are you doing this?

632
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:29,643
Because I can't live without her.

633
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:34,437
And Laura's gonna get
to the rendez-vous point.

634
00:38:34,557 --> 00:38:35,800
I have to believe that.

635
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:54,056
- Admiral.
- Admiral.

636
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:57,760
What do you hear, Starbuck?

637
00:38:58,197 --> 00:38:59,560
Nothing but the rain, sir.

638
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:02,280
Grab your gun and bring the cat in.

639
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,320
Yes, sir.

640
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,265
Keep a light on, I'll be back.

641
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,857
You can count on it.

642
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:09,080
Galactica, this is Husker,
I'm in position.

643
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:11,046
Affirmative, Husker.

644
00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:16,054
All fleet ships,

645
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:18,219
this is Galactica actual.

646
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:20,031
Commence jump.
