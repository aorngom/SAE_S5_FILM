00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,446
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,298
Helo handpicked a crew for you.

3
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:26,738
I'm giving you a ship.

4
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,406
We liberated the Demetrius.

5
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,158
A sewage recycling ship.

6
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,403
Now go.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,246
Find a way to Earth.

8
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,914
I'm telling you, guys,
this thing is a setup anyway.

9
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,208
You think  the old man
just gave her the ship

10
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:39,668
and then cut her loose?

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,802
That's enough of that crap.

12
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:44,131
The resurrection ship
didn't make the jump.

13
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:46,370
And now Cavil's baseships
are breaking formation,

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,219
- taking positions around our periphery.
- They're going to attack.

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,012
They've taken out our FTL!

16
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,057
No resurrection ship.
They're really trying to kill us.

17
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:55,725
Stay the frak away from me!

18
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:57,936
I heard you. You're Cylons!

19
00:00:58,097 --> 00:00:59,688
A bunch of frakkin' skinjobs.

20
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,727
You think Cally killed herself
because of you, don't you?

21
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:14,736
- She thought we were having an affair.
- But we weren't.

22
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:17,585
No, that's right.
I'm not a cheater, I'm a Cylon.

23
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,385
I'm not a priest.

24
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:21,626
But that doesn't matter, you see.

25
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,770
Something in the universe...

26
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:25,604
loves me.

27
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:29,426
God only loves that which is perfect,
and he loves you.

28
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:32,088
He loves you because you are perfect

29
00:01:32,714 --> 00:01:33,961
just as you are.

30
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:04,469
Captain.

31
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:11,745
Captain!

32
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:18,558
I'm glad you're here.
I might have found something.

33
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,355
Before that, we need to talk

34
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:22,448
about making our <i>rendezvous</i>
with the fleet.

35
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:25,998
Later.

36
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:32,614
Come on.

37
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:33,965
Here.

38
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:35,707
What do you think?

39
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:41,508
Well...

40
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:43,308
It's hard to say.

41
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:46,088
Spectroscopics are promising.

42
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:49,241
But according to this, we already did

43
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:51,294
two long-range recons of that grid.

44
00:02:51,414 --> 00:02:52,482
Both no joy.

45
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,510
Third time's the charm maybe.

46
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,649
All right,

47
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,698
I'll have Sharon prep to go

48
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:17,909
as soon as Anders
gets back from his scout.

49
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,601
What about you?

50
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,273
You been getting any sleep?

51
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,135
I don't know. Not much.

52
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,761
It was so clear when I first got back.
If I could...

53
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:38,970
if I could just focus,

54
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,141
I know that I can find that sound again.

55
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:50,714
I gotta go see the CAP off.

56
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:55,300
We'll talk when I get back.

57
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:00,394
Hold up.

58
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,538
I think I'll go with you on this one.

59
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,003
You haven't flown a CAP
since we left the fleet.

60
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:12,589
I think I'll go with you on this one.

61
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:31,149
I need you to tell me

62
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,590
that all this somehow makes sense.

63
00:04:34,814 --> 00:04:36,673
This was my husband, James.

64
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:38,281
My two children, Danya

65
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:39,660
and Reece.

66
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,495
They were on Picon
when the Cylons attacked.

67
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:49,292
What do you feel
when you look at this photograph?

68
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:52,045
I feel rage.

69
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:53,933
Against the Cylons.

70
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:56,220
Not just the machines.

71
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:57,933
Anyone involved.

72
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,640
The engineers who designed them.

73
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:03,011
The corporations,

74
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,432
the politicians

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,843
who provoked this war
and then did nothing to protect us.

76
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,605
And most of all the Gods.

77
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:11,729
The Gods.

78
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:15,048
They stood by and let it all happen.

79
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:16,233
Yes, I know.

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,441
I know.

81
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,833
I am so sorry, Phoebe.

82
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:39,133
I sympathize.

83
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:58,929
Unfortunately, the Gods cannot be blamed
for not coming to your aid.

84
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,818
It's not because they weren't listening.

85
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:08,747
It's because they don't exist.

86
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:13,953
The Gods we've been praying to
for thousands of years do not exist.

87
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,462
They can't help you

88
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:18,277
because they are not real.

89
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:20,930
We have been pandering

90
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,295
to our own ignorance

91
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,329
for far too long.

92
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:29,038
<i>Now on my own journey,</i>

93
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,306
<i>I've been wronged,</i>

94
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,356
<i>persecuted.</i>

95
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,281
<i>I prayed to the Gods</i>

96
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:39,984
<i>on my knees</i>

97
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:41,890
<i>begging them for mercy.</i>

98
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:43,047
<i>Tortured.</i>

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,257
<i>I received nothing in resp...</i>

100
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:57,015
<i>I could've lived</i>

101
00:06:57,135 --> 00:06:59,503
<i>in that abyss of bitterness,</i>

102
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:03,005
<i>but that will destroy you
like nothing else.</i>

103
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,658
<i>But I chose to forgive.</i>

104
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:07,706
<i>And most importantly,
I began with myself.</i>

105
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:12,853
"Third time's the charm?"

106
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:15,959
And you just went along with it?

107
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,703
It's called following orders,
Lieutenant.

108
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:27,320
It's called dragging our feet.

109
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:32,039
Starbuck's pushing our go back deadline
to the last second.

110
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,123
She's afraid of what Adama's gonna say

111
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:36,916
when he realizes her vision
was just a pipe dream.

112
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,649
- You've got to be kidding me.
- She's taking a Viper out now?

113
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:45,981
She can't be serious.

114
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,125
Maybe she could do
a little finger painting...

115
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:50,681
I've heard enough bitching and moaning
to last a lifetime.

116
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:53,162
Two more days
and we're back with the fleet, okay?

117
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:56,059
Until then, everyone just shut up
and do your jobs.

118
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:19,946
Come on.

119
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,258
Come on.

120
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:27,818
Come on.

121
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:30,847
Starbuck, Hot Dog. Didn't catch that.
What are your orders?

122
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,876
Hot Dog, Demetrius. You know the drill.

123
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:36,329
Keep your eyes open
and stick close to Starbuck's wing.

124
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:39,031
I know you're out here somewhere.

125
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:40,933
<i>Come on.</i>

126
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:47,583
Starbuck, dradis contact.

127
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,879
<i>Demetrius, we've got an inbound.
One bogey bearing 1-4-9er.</i>

128
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,991
Roger that.

129
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:55,557
Call action stations.
Spool up the FTL for emergency jump.

130
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,292
<i>Action stations, action stations.
Set condition one throughout the ship.</i>

131
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:02,920
<i>This is not a drill.
Repeat, action stations.</i>

132
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,380
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

133
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,071
Son of a bitch, I knew it.

134
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,550
<i>Demetrius, Hot Dog. I've got visual.</i>

135
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,809
<i>Cylon heavy Raider.</i>

136
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,265
Starbuck, Demetrius. Report.

137
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:22,406
Report!

138
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:30,615
<i>Demetrius, I'm seeing blast damage</i>

139
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:32,201
<i>all over this thing.</i>

140
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,911
<i>Starbuck, what are your orders?</i>

141
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,434
Come on.

142
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,416
Talk to me, shoot me, do something.

143
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,992
<i>Starbuck, what are your orders?</i>

144
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:48,957
Frak!

145
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:51,727
<i>Kara.</i>

146
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:55,659
<i>I'm alone.</i>

147
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,275
<i>It's not an attack.</i>

148
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,333
<i>I knew I'd find you.</i>

149
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:03,602
<i>Knew you'd be out here searching.</i>

150
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:06,744
Leoben?

151
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,794
<i>I'm here for you,
to offer a truce between Cylon</i>

152
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:12,718
<i>and human.</i>

153
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:17,798
<i>And a chance for you
to complete your journey.</i>

Heavy Raider's docked
at the aft airlock.

160
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:20,561
The animal part
that controls it looks dead.

161
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,245
We only found the one Leoben onboard.

162
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,562
Starbuck is still taking
one hell of a chance.

163
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:26,618
If he wanted to kill us,
we'd all be dead by now.

164
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:28,894
Just means he wants something else.

165
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,039
Kara.

166
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,200
Thank you for this.

167
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:51,130
We were praying for a miracle.

168
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,260
It wasn't a miracle.

169
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,181
It's like I knew you were out there.

170
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,186
I'm not picking up
any gamma emissions, Sir.

171
00:11:57,306 --> 00:12:00,180
Raider's packing conventional
weaponry only. No nukes.

172
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,371
All right.

173
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,588
Keep checking for tracking devices.

174
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,049
Anything that might
give up our position.

175
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,398
Don't look at me like that.

176
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:10,536
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:13,077
The difference between the way
you were on New Caprica

178
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:15,444
- and now is...
- I'm the same person.

179
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,237
I have eyes. I can see.

180
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:20,562
God has taken your hand

181
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,092
and purged you
of the questions, the doubt.

182
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:24,997
Your journey can finally begin.

183
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,928
But there isn't much time.
The others, the ones I left behind,

184
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,435
they need your help.

185
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:31,212
But not as much as you need theirs.

186
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:32,693
Why?

187
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:36,246
Your crew.

188
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,786
They don't trust you.

189
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,553
I need you to tell me why you're here...

190
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,930
Captain, we should move the prisoner.

191
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:43,602
A blue planet

192
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:45,888
surrounded by clouds.

193
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:46,936
Stop!

194
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:57,295
The hybrid.

195
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,074
When she first described it to me,

196
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,287
how beautiful it was,

197
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,078
I cried.

198
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:05,134
You need

199
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,153
to go to her, Kara.

200
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:08,165
The hybrid,

201
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:10,897
she'll tell you things. Amazing things.

202
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:14,243
We're done here. Get him out of here.

203
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,507
Wait!
Take him to my quarters.

204
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:24,347
Just do it!

205
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:57,682
It may never make any sense.

206
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,441
Hangar deck crew tells me
you've been obsessing over this place.

207
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:03,836
Going over the logs.

208
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,457
Replaying the accident again and again.

209
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,930
Accident.

210
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:12,553
What is it?

211
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,011
I spoke to Cottle.

212
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,453
Cally was on

213
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:20,462
Moxopan and Cosapine.

214
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,594
Antidepressants.

215
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,236
How did she go
from antidepressants to suicide?

216
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:30,733
Well, she was...

217
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,089
emotionally disturbed.

218
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:36,534
She would've left me.

219
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:39,840
She never would've left Nicky behind.

220
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:41,642
So...

221
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:45,093
what do you think then?

222
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,490
Someone killed her?

223
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,244
Galen, you have to let it go.

224
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:53,646
No, I gotta figure out what happened.

225
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,270
What if she knew?

226
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:03,865
How would she have known?

227
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,085
Maybe she sensed it.

228
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:07,910
I mean, she was your wife.

229
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,501
You've been

230
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:10,522
different

231
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:12,019
since the Nebula.

232
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,388
Maybe she was afraid of you.

233
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:18,152
Maybe it was God's will.

234
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:21,011
We don't know why these things happen.

235
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:23,294
But God does.

236
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,778
And he has a plan for us.

237
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,211
For whatever reason,

238
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:31,432
her death, our awakening,

239
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:33,996
you gotta trust
that it's all for the best.

240
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,563
Why are you here?

241
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,820
Because we are in this together.

242
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:39,912
And I am here for you,

243
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:40,886
Galen.

244
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,243
I know exactly where you are right now.

245
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:44,679
I have been there.

246
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:47,975
Until Gaius helped me realize that...

247
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:51,128
what...

248
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:53,558
whatever has gone before,

249
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:56,457
whatever I have done, it doesn't matter.

250
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,923
We can still change.

251
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:07,428
You spend way too much time with Baltar.

252
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,867
So I guess I missed
all the excitement, huh?

253
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,931
So what's the deal?
This Leoben, has he said anything?

254
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:29,931
Don't know.

255
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:31,535
Starbuck ordered the guards

256
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:33,495
to wait outside, lose the cuffs.

257
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,829
Said she didn't want to be disturbed.

258
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:41,634
- Guess I'll talk to her.
- Yeah, why don't you do that?

259
00:16:58,672 --> 00:16:59,376
Hey.

260
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:02,993
- Get the hell away from her.
- Sam... Sam, stop it!

261
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:05,001
What is wrong with you, Kara?

262
00:17:06,782 --> 00:17:09,198
- I can see why she's so fond of you.
- Just leave him alone.

263
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:13,051
You know... you know what we have to do.

264
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:17,558
- Just remember there isn't much time.
- Get him the frak out of here!

265
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:19,720
Cuff him and lock him in storage!

266
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:23,460
What is going on with you?

267
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,427
Kara!

268
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,749
He can help us.

269
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,218
The Cylons, they understand about Earth.

270
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:30,867
And you believe him?

271
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:33,043
After everything he's done to you?

272
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,428
Kara, he kept you locked up
for months on New Caprica.

273
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:38,698
The frakkin' mind games.

274
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:41,811
I swear to Gods

275
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,081
this is not a dream.

276
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:45,864
It's real.

277
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:02,161
I'm glad you're here.

278
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,378
You and Kara,
did you get things worked out?

279
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,592
Because you should.

280
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:08,691
You weren't meant to be

281
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:09,842
enemies.

282
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,094
No. That'd be you and me.

283
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:15,963
What do you want from Kara?

284
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,876
The same thing I've always wanted.

285
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,771
For her to understand her destiny.

286
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,942
- That's not good enough.
- It's good enough for her.

287
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,952
What is the most basic article of faith?

288
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:41,814
That this is not all that we are.

289
00:18:53,703 --> 00:18:55,035
C-Bucks rule.

290
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:58,015
- What did you just say?
- Forward guard, right?

291
00:18:58,747 --> 00:19:00,642
I saw a couple games. You were good.

292
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:04,277
Yet after all the celebrity and acclaim,
what were you?

293
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:07,320
Just another face selling magazines.
Another piece of scoreboard trivia,

294
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,290
and you always knew
you were destined for more.

295
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:13,238
You were just waiting
for your singular moment of clarity.

296
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:16,239
Well, maybe I just found it.

297
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:18,744
You kill me, Kara's dream dies with me.

298
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:21,840
I don't think so.

299
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,208
I think you download
into another Leoben body

300
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:25,883
and you spew more lies.

301
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:30,419
No one's coming back.

302
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:36,392
We were lured out of resurrection range.

303
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:38,515
Ship was attacked. We survived.

304
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,642
The baseship was damaged.
We were set adrift.

305
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:46,781
What are you talking about?
Who attacked you?

306
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,824
War has broken out between the Cylon.

307
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:55,922
Battle lines have been drawn

308
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:58,767
between those who embrace their nature

309
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,251
and those who fear it.

310
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:03,705
Good.

311
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:07,556
You can blow yourselves to hell
for all I care.

312
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:09,586
That's one way.
There's another.

313
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,079
An alliance.

314
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,526
Allow our paths to converge.

315
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:19,227
You save us from our savage brothers.

316
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:22,140
And our old one, the hybrid,

317
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:24,925
will show Kara the righteous path.

318
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,603
And together,

319
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:29,356
they'll lead us to the promised land.

320
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,034
Together, we will find Earth.

321
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,704
He said his baseship was attacked;

322
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,474
that they were ambushed
by their own kind.

323
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,365
So now the Cylons
want us to rescue them.

324
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:49,510
That's novel.

325
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,628
Well, he's proposing an alliance
between us and his damaged baseship.

326
00:20:54,408 --> 00:20:55,757
How's that supposed to work?

327
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:59,360
Yeah, are we supposed to let them
piggyback on our nav and FTL systems

328
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,593
and help them jump out of harm's way?

329
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:03,348
They'll join forces with the fleet.

330
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:04,500
Right.

331
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:06,844
If... it's true.

332
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:08,179
Frak.

333
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,551
- Are you thinking about doing this?
- XO, listen.

334
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:14,417
Bringing Leoben on board,
that was questionable at best.

335
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:17,010
But jumping back to his baseship?
It's suicide.

336
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,662
Nothing's been decided.

337
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,659
And what, you trust Starbuck
to make the right decision?

338
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:24,330
- Because she's out of control.
- What are you saying?

339
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,830
We are running on fumes, Anders.

340
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,874
In two days, we are gonna be overdue
for our <i>rendezvous </i>with the fleet.

341
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:33,837
We gotta do something
before she takes us all down with her.

342
00:21:35,898 --> 00:21:37,424
Are you talking mutiny?

343
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:40,878
'Cause that's sure what it sounds like.

344
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:43,397
You want to tear this ship apart,

345
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:46,165
then keep riling up the crew
making your crazy Starbuck cracks.

346
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:48,518
Otherwise, I suggest
you both shut the frak up.

347
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:51,290
Starbuck is leading us into a trap.

348
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,008
Cylons are gonna capture the freighter.

349
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:57,379
They're gonna have nav data
leading straight back to the fleet.

350
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:00,049
Then we better keep that from happening.

351
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:04,700
Order the CAP back
and lock down the ship.

352
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:08,821
As soon we can work through the jump
coordinates from Leoben's Raider, we go.

353
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,432
It's a chance to find Earth!

354
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:14,973
I intend to take it.

355
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:30,902
Not that I particularly care,

356
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:34,367
but since I haven't been arrested
recently or beaten up, can I...

357
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:38,257
can I surmise that the President
has not been apprised

358
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,396
of my pirate broadcasts?

359
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,747
Actually, I told her all about them.

360
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:50,238
I even suggested
she speak to the Admiral.

361
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:57,754
Really.

362
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,449
I guess you'll have to do
something about that.

363
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:04,302
Or not.

364
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:08,623
Even Roslin and Adama must realize

365
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:11,173
the movement's taken on
a life of its own.

366
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:16,022
It's gonna take them more than
bashing in a few heads to stop this.

367
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:19,770
The truth is you're not worth
another confrontation in the Quorum.

368
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:24,600
You may be drawing
more bodies to your crusade,

369
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,670
but they're from the fringes.

370
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:28,672
No one of consequence.

371
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:31,877
Get some clothes on.

372
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:33,881
They're waiting for you.

373
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:36,729
Think we have enough?

374
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,983
It doesn't matter.
They're not coming to be fed.

375
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:41,442
They're coming to hear
Dr. Baltar's word,

376
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:43,684
and learn from it, just like we did.

377
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,020
The past is written.

378
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,902
Impossible to change.

379
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,227
Why are so many of us
living in the past?

380
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,674
Living with the shame
of what we have done.

381
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:17,329
<i>When we could live</i>

382
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,861
<i>in awe of what we might do.</i>

383
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:22,530
<i>What we might do.</i>

384
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,715
<i>What will we do?</i>

385
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:29,253
<i>Spiral endlessly through the heavens</i>

386
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:32,783
until humanity itself comes to a close?

387
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:38,219
<i>Or do we look inward...</i>

388
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:43,049
<i>and find that strength within?</i>

389
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:46,305
Can you believe these people
are actually buying into Baltar's crap?

390
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:48,175
<i>We have the opportunity...</i>

391
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,130
We need to talk.

392
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:53,066
I don't have anything to say to you.

393
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:55,205
Well, then you can listen.
Come with me.

394
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:03,769
I've been cutting you some slack
because of Cally, but that's over.

395
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:06,458
You gotta pull yourself together now.

396
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:09,249
Suck it up.

397
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,213
Just like you, huh?

398
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:14,590
Now what is that supposed to mean?

399
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,136
I hear you've been spending some time
in the lockup with the Six.

400
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:21,347
Remember when this all started?

401
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:24,011
You said nothing would change you
from the man you want to be.

402
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:25,687
How about it, Colonel?

403
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,501
You still the same old Saul Tigh?

404
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:30,349
Anything I've done

405
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:32,400
I can live with.

406
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,875
That's the difference
between you and me.

407
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,113
I can't.

408
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:44,704
Tory's got in her head that we can be
the salvation of the human race.

409
00:25:45,957 --> 00:25:47,666
All I know is if there is a God,

410
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:50,232
he's laughing his ass off.

411
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:02,638
EVA is almost complete, Captain.

412
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,891
<i>Demetrius, Mathias.</i>

413
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,659
I've finished inspection
of the aft section.

414
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,645
She's a big sucker.

415
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:14,094
Okay, wrap it up, Sarge.
Get back to the nest asap.

416
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:16,163
<i>Roger that, Athena.</i>

417
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:19,554
I was getting bored
with the view anyhow.

418
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:22,908
Hold up.

419
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,734
Got a leak.

420
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,624
Some kind of

421
00:26:29,884 --> 00:26:32,085
gas venting through a crack in the hull.

422
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,472
Something's happening.

423
00:26:48,894 --> 00:26:50,545
Mathias, report.

424
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,047
Mathias, report!

425
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,814
Please.

426
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:38,334
Please don't clap.

427
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,209
What are you all doing here?

428
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,098
The reason that we are all here

429
00:27:55,748 --> 00:27:58,107
is 'cause the old ways have failed us.

430
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,450
It doesn't matter if you're a believer

431
00:28:01,275 --> 00:28:04,345
or a nonbeliever.
It certainly makes no difference to me.

432
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:08,308
You are all welcome.

433
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:13,979
Mr. Tyrol.

434
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:15,854
Mr. Tyrol!

435
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:21,882
I know that we have had our differences,

436
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,388
but I am begging you right now
to set those aside.

437
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:32,159
Come down here and take my hand.

438
00:28:36,191 --> 00:28:38,478
If not for yourself, then for your wife.

439
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:41,492
For Cally.

440
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:47,984
She would've wanted this.

441
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,909
Cally wasn't like me.

442
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:02,125
She forgave you for New Caprica.

443
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:04,945
Even read your bogus manifesto,
but not me.

444
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,562
You may have your sheep fooled.

445
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:10,688
They may be buying
into your message of forgiveness.

446
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:13,506
But let me tell you. There are some sins

447
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:15,942
that even your imaginary god

448
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:17,637
can never forgive.

449
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,185
I have not been talking
about an imaginary god.

450
00:29:22,732 --> 00:29:25,144
I am asking you to take my hand.

451
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,479
Take my hand, Mr. Tyrol.

452
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:32,003
For Cally.

453
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:43,025
It's what she would've wanted.

454
00:29:50,544 --> 00:29:51,751
Get off of him!

455
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:53,003
Leave him!

456
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,069
Leave him!

457
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:02,881
You didn't know her!

458
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,415
I heard an explosion.
You all right?

459
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:17,086
What'd you do?
Blow the tylium stores?

460
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:21,226
- That's the Kara I used to know.
- The Raider's in pieces mother-frakker!

461
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:24,443
Sergeant Mathias is dead.

462
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:26,671
Not that you give a damn!

463
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:31,426
You can't think
that I had anything to do with that.

464
00:31:31,686 --> 00:31:33,507
I wasn't even on the deck.

465
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:38,099
I was too busy believing you
instead of watching out for my crew.

466
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,524
My ship was under fire.
The reactor could've been damaged.

467
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:43,354
It was a setup.

468
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:44,647
Say it!

469
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:47,816
Hit me again.

470
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:50,820
You used me to get close to the ship.

471
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:53,907
How many times did you kill me
on New Caprica? Don't stop now.

472
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:56,031
- Frak you.
- Go on, do it.

473
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:58,650
I won't come back this time, I promise.

474
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,311
Resurrection ship's well out of range.
Go on, do it.

475
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:02,519
Do it!

476
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:13,044
It doesn't help...

477
00:32:14,414 --> 00:32:15,463
does it?

478
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,870
Nothing feels quite like
it did before...

479
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:24,468
does it?

480
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,416
What are you doing to me?

481
00:32:34,563 --> 00:32:36,055
All of your life...

482
00:32:39,978 --> 00:32:41,454
you forced back the truth

483
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:44,249
by lashing out at everyone around you.

484
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:47,684
Anesthetizing yourself
with ambrosia and empty affairs.

485
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:50,797
But you've lost the taste
for those petty things.

486
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:53,466
- I'm the same person.
- No,

487
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:57,178
an emptiness that can only be filled
by taking the next step on your journey.

488
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,807
What happened to me
the two months I was missing?

489
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,434
- I don't know.
- The mandala,

490
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:05,511
the paintings, my mother.

491
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:09,852
- It had to mean something.
- You have to make peace with your past.

492
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:11,840
Why?

493
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,820
Because that part of you is gone.

494
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:17,615
I told you when I arrived
that you had changed.

495
00:33:17,993 --> 00:33:20,568
I don't see Kara Thrace. I see...

496
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:24,059
an angel blazing with the light of God.

497
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:27,750
An angel eager to lead her people home.

498
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,992
This is bad. This is really bad.

499
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:37,977
- She can't explain this one away.
- So you think she's a Cylon now?

500
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:41,797
Starbuck's racked up more kills
than any pilot in the fleet.

501
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:43,467
Yeah, Starbuck maybe.

502
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:47,937
Okay, but who the hell knows
who got off that Viper two months ago?

503
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:06,284
I'm not really very good at any of this.

504
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,793
We've all come
to remember Sergeant Erin Mathias.

505
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:14,713
To grieve for our loss. To honor her.

506
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:19,594
Mathias is dead because of me.

507
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:21,981
We've all heard the words, the prayers,

508
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,599
but I don't know
what any of it means anymore.

509
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,434
We want to believe
that she died for something.

510
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:32,323
But in this war,
people die and it is just stupid.

511
00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:34,860
It's an accident.
There's no nobility to it.

512
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,640
There's nothing we can grab onto
that's gonna make it any easier.

513
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,549
They're just gone.

514
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,491
I have to live with that.

515
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,102
You know, I know...

516
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,877
that this has been a difficult mission.
And...

517
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,756
maybe I haven't...

518
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:15,423
Captain, we've downloaded
the <i>rendezvous </i>coordinates to the FTL.

519
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:18,851
We're ready to jump back to the fleet
on your order.

520
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,914
We're not going back to the fleet.

521
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:26,211
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We came here to complete a mission.

522
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,963
That baseship
has something to do with it, I know it.

523
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,798
Captain Agathon.

524
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:33,854
Lock down the ship.
Prepare to jump.

525
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,768
No, you know what? Frak her
and frak her little pet Cylon, okay?

526
00:35:42,078 --> 00:35:43,895
This baseship
was never part of the mission.

527
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:45,516
Okay, one of us is dead now.

528
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:47,723
One of us is dead,
and if we don't leave right now

529
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:50,318
we are all going to die, all right?

530
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:51,531
Just let it go!

531
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:54,363
If I don't do anything,
we're all gonna die!

532
00:35:54,523 --> 00:35:56,603
- Get out of my way!
- You have your orders, back off!

533
00:35:56,723 --> 00:35:59,021
You better choose
which side you're on, Captain.

534
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:02,538
Walk away
and this doesn't go any further!

535
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:05,208
You'd be the one
who protect that Cylon thing, right?

536
00:36:37,414 --> 00:36:40,789
I don't understand what you're trying
to accomplish. He is psychotic.

537
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,536
My message is for everyone. Especially
the ones who don't want to listen.

538
00:36:43,656 --> 00:36:46,036
- I don't think it's safe.
- 5 minutes, that's all.

539
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:54,460
Mr. Tyrol.

540
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:59,385
- Gaius, I really don't think...
- There's nothing to be afraid of.

541
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:00,582
Be careful.

542
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:18,156
Look, uh, Chief, I...

543
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:25,496
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

544
00:37:26,154 --> 00:37:27,999
About my presumption earlier.

545
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:30,796
You were right, you know.

546
00:37:33,813 --> 00:37:35,256
I hardly knew your wife.

547
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,146
I'm sorry.

548
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,464
Would you mind if I...

549
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:47,328
just...

550
00:37:57,257 --> 00:37:59,163
I know it's hard to...

551
00:38:00,886 --> 00:38:02,994
make sense of things sometimes.

552
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,021
In my own life...

553
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,325
In my own life,
I joined the fleet as a scientist,

554
00:38:10,445 --> 00:38:13,263
as a skeptic,
as supposedly a man of reason.

555
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,302
Only to have fate

556
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,912
turn that all on its head.

557
00:38:22,713 --> 00:38:25,398
But I understand now
that there is a purpose to it.

558
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:27,186
We change.

559
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:29,268
We evolve.

560
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:34,802
Maybe we even learn something
along the way.

561
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:48,602
I have committed...

562
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:53,584
unconscionable crimes.

563
00:38:55,553 --> 00:38:58,401
And I have been offered
one last chance at redemption.

564
00:39:01,894 --> 00:39:04,154
Because I chose to accept my fate,

565
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:06,171
not fight it anymore.

566
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:21,236
I'm so sorry for your loss, Chief.

567
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:26,659
She was a very beautiful woman,
your wife.

568
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:28,494
I'm also told quite spiritual.

569
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:32,580
You know,
I don't expect you to believe me, but...

570
00:39:34,617 --> 00:39:37,151
I would very much like
to have known her better.

571
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,455
Thank you.

572
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:10,536
<i>Action stations, action stations.</i>

573
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:12,908
<i>Set condition one throughout the ship.</i>

574
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:15,157
Are you really gonna do this?

575
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,546
I don't have any choice.

576
00:40:22,455 --> 00:40:24,175
Yes, you do.

577
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:34,143
FTL's spooled, Captain.

578
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:35,287
Good.

579
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:37,521
Set the clock.

580
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,998
Captain.

581
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:44,949
Captain, I'm asking you to reconsider.

582
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,865
There's not enough time.

583
00:40:47,098 --> 00:40:49,025
We don't go now, we lose our shot.

584
00:40:49,145 --> 00:40:51,243
That's assuming we believe the Cylon,

585
00:40:51,403 --> 00:40:53,152
and that Leoben's coordinates are right.

586
00:40:53,272 --> 00:40:55,638
We don't jump into a nest of baseships
or in a star...

587
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:57,666
Galactica's standing orders are clear.

588
00:40:58,263 --> 00:41:01,780
If we miss the <i>rendezvous</i>, Adama
will assume we're dead or captured.

589
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,720
- They will leave us.
- No.

590
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,633
- Not adama.
- Listen to me,

591
00:41:05,793 --> 00:41:07,316
we can jump back to Galactica.

592
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:10,843
If the Admiral's for it, we can
re-supply. Send out an armed patrol.

593
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:15,242
Do not do this, Helo.

594
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,099
I can't allow you
to risk the lives of this ship's crew.

595
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:30,810
When the admiral put me in command,
he told me to trust my instincts.

596
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,815
Find the next marker,
see if it checks out.

597
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:35,492
Lead the people from the fleet home.

598
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,833
That is what I intend to do.

599
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,235
Now... prepare to jump!

600
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:44,749
I'm sorry, Sir,

601
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:47,162
but I cannot obey that order.

602
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:57,117
Then you are relieved, Captain.

603
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:14,118
Mr. Gaeta, you are now the new XO.

604
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:18,111
Prepare to jump on my mark.

605
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:20,207
No, Sir.

606
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:24,537
Okay, everybody needs
to think about what they're doing here.

607
00:42:25,814 --> 00:42:27,740
They have thought about it, Sam.

608
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:36,569
They all have.

609
00:42:37,492 --> 00:42:38,822
It's a mutiny.

610
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,946
Captain Thrace,

611
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:45,280
as XO of the Demetrius,

612
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,026
and acting under article ten
of the colonial military code,

613
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:53,490
I'm hereby relieving you of command.

614
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:02,383
 - =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
