00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:22,710
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:23,176 --> 00:00:25,737
I'm giving you a ship. Now go.

3
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:27,453
Find the way to Earth.

4
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:30,748
<i>Kara, I'm alone. This is not an attack.</i>

5
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:32,735
- <i>I knew I'd find you.</i>
- Leoben?

6
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:36,164
<i>I'm here to offer a truce
between human and Cylon</i>

7
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:38,186
<i>and a chance for you
to complete your journey.</i>

8
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:39,580
The Hybrid.

9
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:41,929
You need to go to her, Kara.

10
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:44,547
She'll tell you the way to get to Earth.

11
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,022
We're done here. Get him out of here.

12
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:49,135
We're ready to jump back on your order.

13
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:51,554
- We're not going back to the fleet.
- Captain Thrace,

14
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:55,183
as XO of the Demetrius,
I'm hereby relieving you of command.

15
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:56,434
You son of a bitch.

16
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:58,895
Gaeta, abort the jump!

17
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:05,936
I'll take Leoben to the baseship,
see if his story checks out.

18
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:07,759
We'll be waiting
till the clock runs out.

19
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:10,778
Looks like he wasn't lying
about a civil war.

20
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:12,367
This is it.

21
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:14,411
The comet. It's the ship!

22
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:16,204
Thus will it come to pass.

23
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:18,372
You are the harbinger of death,
Kara Thrace.

24
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:20,332
You will lead them all to their end.

25
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:25,755
<i>- Cylon baseship.
- Demetrius, Athena.</i>

26
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,540
- The baseship is ours.
- Then let's go home.

27
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:35,306
<i>Now I have learned</i>

28
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:37,317
<i>from unimpeachable sources</i>

29
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:40,265
<i>that President Laura Roslin
has for some time now</i>

30
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:43,180
<i>been sharing hallucinogenic visions</i>

31
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,527
<i>with two Cylons within our fleet:</i>

32
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,305
<i>one, Sharon Agathon,</i>

33
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:49,863
sent on the classified
Demetrius mission,

34
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:53,218
and the other, a Cylon prisoner
being held aboard the Galac...

35
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:57,617
- It's not that easy, Madam President.
- No? You should try it sometime.

36
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,914
Most of the population
has heard that broadcast.

37
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:01,916
I would assume that's the point.

38
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,625
Look, I take no pleasure
in putting this before you.

39
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:07,765
They practically had
to push me through that door.

40
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:09,416
I'm sure you're happy to stay.

41
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,820
I can't put one foot in front of another
without someone blocking my path

42
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,296
asking me what the hell is going on!

43
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:17,944
- For the welfare of the fleet...
- Excuse me.

44
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,781
As long as I am in this office,

45
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:21,648
the welfare of this fleet

46
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:25,148
is not something
you need to worry about.

47
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:27,400
You owe the people a response.

48
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,360
I owe the people?

49
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,071
That's what I believe.

50
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,113
What if your beliefs
were called into question?

51
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,882
- Madam President...
- Up is down.

52
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,124
Black is white. Scripture is fiction.

53
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:41,664
Home is thin air
instead of solid ground, etcetera.

54
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:42,963
I'm really sorry

55
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:45,826
for everything you've had to endure.
I really am.

56
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:48,438
But the people, they deserve a response.

57
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:51,508
- Do they?
- Is there any truth to this broadcast?

58
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,885
And what would you do
if I told you the truth?

59
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,426
What if it were you instead of me

60
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:59,907
and all that's left of humanity
has just been told

61
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:02,584
that you are sharing visions
with the enemy?

62
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:04,160
What would you do, Mr. Adama?

63
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,356
Would you think
that the Gods were testing you?

64
00:03:07,383 --> 00:03:09,651
So Baltar is telling the truth?

65
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:13,029
Is it true?

66
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:14,717
Yes.

67
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:34,592
Demetrius reports their sys ops
will be synced with ours in 5 minutes.

68
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,345
When you came knocking
and asked for our help,

69
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:41,246
you gave away the future
of all the Cylons here, you know that?

70
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:44,348
- I gave it to the right person.
- Save it. No guarantees.

71
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:46,230
When we meet up with the fleet,

72
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,390
I don't know
if they'll feed you or frak you.

73
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,625
Since you've been calling
the plays up till now,

74
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:52,777
I'm assuming you're doing the talking.

75
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:54,654
Good.

76
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:56,607
Gods help us.

77
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,335
Sys ops of both vessels are synced.
We're as ready as we're ever gonna be.

78
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,963
Good. Tell the Demetrius
to set the board to green.

79
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:16,161
Unless both ships jump in together,
Galactica will blow us out of the sky.

80
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,937
<i>Demetrius, Athena.</i>

81
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:29,896
<i>Set your board to green.</i>

82
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:37,697
Athena, Demetrius. Starting to green.

83
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:40,127
Let's run the horn, guys.

84
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,956
- Sublight.
- Go.

85
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:43,852
- Helm.
- Go.

86
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:46,344
- Tactical.
- Go.

87
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:47,370
Nav.

88
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:48,817
Go.

89
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:49,751
FTL.

90
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:51,711
Spun up. Go.

91
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:53,838
Athena, Demetrius.

92
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:55,126
<i>Board is green.</i>

93
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:59,761
I was just thinking
how beautiful she must be.

94
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:03,014
Your daughter, Hera.

95
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:08,720
- How do you know her name?
- We all know her name.

96
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:10,610
You were blessed.

97
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:13,505
All right, everyone.

98
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:15,193
Let's go home.

99
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:18,029
Demetrius, Athena.

100
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:19,487
<i>Execute jump.</i>

101
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,715
Clock is running. Ten,

102
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:24,258

103
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:25,845

six,

106
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:29,533
five,

107
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,152
four,

108
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,709
three,

109
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:34,754
two, jump.

110
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:44,222
We had a problem with the sync points
and the jump coordinates.

111
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:47,266
It'll take a few minutes
to spool up the FTL drive again.

112
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:50,103
Gods damn it!

113
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:58,403
All hands. Battle stations!

114
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:01,072
Set condition one throughout the fleet!

115
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:02,539
Launch alert five.

116
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:05,467
Get me some more frakkin' birds
in the air!

117
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:08,743
Gun batteries stand by
for target bearing!

118
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,855
Demetrius, Athena. Report.

119
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:21,634
Demetrius, Athena. Report.

120
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:25,786
Baseship bearing 3-3
carom 4-9-8 at 15 MSU.

121
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:27,946
Frakkin' thing
is sitting right on top of us.

122
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:28,991
M. Hoshi,

123
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:31,219
order the fleet
to make an emergency jump!

124
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:35,325
All colonial vessels jump immediately
to emergency rendez-vous coordinates.

125
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:37,454
The President's shuttle is en route.

126
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:39,861
Tell them to land on landing bay 1.
Checkers green.

127
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,993
Galactica, Athena.

128
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:54,625
Last jump must've cooked the wireless.
We've got no com. They can't hear us.

129
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:55,574
Frak.

130
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,630
Galactica's scrambling Vipers.

131
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,588
They're going to shoot us down.

132
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:13,474
What the frak?

133
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:21,027
Eight vipers inbound.
Entering firing range.

134
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:22,584
Where the hell is the Demetrius?

135
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:29,786
- Baseship targeted. Weapons free.
- Something isn't right.

136
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,329
Gunnery reporting
firing solution correct.

137
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:35,119
Main battery standing by
to fire on your command.

138
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:38,217
On my command.

139
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:39,928
Three, two,

140
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:42,340
- one.
- Weapons hold!

141
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,497
Dradis contact!

142
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,773
<i>Galactica, Demetrius, do not fire.</i>

143
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:01,442

148
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,536
Do not fire.

155
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:49,752
Colonel,

156
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,801
they're with me.

157
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:54,527
They're with you?

158
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:09,110
So which one of them shot Gaeta?

159
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:12,990
Lieutenant Gaeta, stay with us.

160
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:14,328
Prep an IV.

161
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,995
All right, everybody. Stand back.
Get a cut down tray in here right now.

162
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:22,583
We became divided according to models.

163
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:24,671
The Twos, Eights, and Sixes

164
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:26,855
have come to

165
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,391
believe that our destiny lies
in seeking out the Final Five.

166
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:34,104
The Ones, Fours,
and Fives violently opposed such action.

167
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:37,283
We know that there are seven
different models of Cylons.

168
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,134
You only mentioned six.

169
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:40,833
The Threes.

170
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:42,025
The D'Annas.

171
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:44,299
They were boxed after the battle
on the algae planet.

172
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,262
Boxed?

173
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,142
Her entire line
was punitively deactivated.

174
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:50,048
Her consciousness

175
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:52,016
placed in a boxing facility.

176
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:53,545
Why?

177
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:57,941
D'Anna saw the faces of the Final Five,
which was forbidden.

178
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:00,211
But if we unbox her,

179
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,205
she can reveal their identities to us.

180
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:04,793
The Final Five have been to Earth.

181
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,671
If we help find them,
they can help us get there.

182
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:12,021
Our ship can heal itself.

183
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,510
But most of our Raiders
were destroyed in the ambush.

184
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,763
We're asking for your help here.
We can't do it alone.

185
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:21,100
What could possibly motivate us
to trust you now? What have you got?

186
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,665
The boxing facility

187
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,982
resides within
the Cylon resurrection hub.

188
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:30,877
This hub controls the functions

189
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:33,240
of every resurrection ship in existence.

190
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,431
It protects itself by periodically
jumping to a new set of coordinates

191
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:38,743
and then relaying them
back to the baseship.

192
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:40,111
Madam President,

193
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,133
you asked for a reason to help us.

194
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,918
Vengeance.

195
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,462
You destroy the hub,

196
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,525
Cylons lose their ability to download.

197
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:55,344
All of us.

198
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:01,265
Why would you be willing
to lose your ability to resurrect?

199
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:02,713
We're rebels.

200
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:04,895
We can't go back.

201
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,240
What matters most to us

202
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,080
is being with the Five.

203
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:13,020
D'Anna will be able to identify them.

204
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,635
We'll take you to the hub

205
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,734
if you help us unbox D'Anna.

206
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:23,453
Give us the coordinates
of the hub first.

207
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:26,290
No, I won't do that.
I said we would take you there.

208
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,124
Take her out. We're finished.

209
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,170
Wait.

210
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:33,352
Is your word good, Admiral?

211
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,800
I'll give you the coordinates.
But I want your word.

212
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,758
Stand down.

213
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:42,890
You have my word.

214
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:45,123
Once their identities are revealed

215
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,253
and we come back here,

216
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:50,231
we'll be free to leave
your fleet with the Five.

217
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:54,092
Yes.

218
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:55,977
They're here with you.

219
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:00,950
The Final Five are in your fleet.

220
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:03,935
That's why our Raiders
turned back the attack

221
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:05,388
in the nebula.

222
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:14,214
The weapons hold.

223
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:16,507
How the frak did you see that?

224
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:20,048
To be absolutely honest with you, Bill,

225
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,008
I didn't.

226
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:25,808
What can I say? We got lucky.

227
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:33,115
Well, let's get a Raptor up

228
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:35,945
to those coordinates
that that Cylon gave us.

229
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:38,946
- Maybe we can get lucky again.
- Sir.

230
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,928
Tigh.

231
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:46,266
Thank you.

232
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:01,260
Lords of Kobol, shield your eyes.

233
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,223
Get it with the gun camera.
Hit override.

234
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:10,796
Kinda pretty, isn't it?

235
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,272
Tell it to the fleet.

236
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:37,035
No. No. Don't put me under. Please.

237
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,757
Just... just numb everything.

238
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:41,257
Felix.

239
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:42,419
Just do it.

240
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:44,309
I don't want to wake up...

241
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:47,033
I don't want to wake up
with my leg gone.

242
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,003
Okay, son.

243
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:40,562
If we go in on our own horse,
we won't last five minutes.

244
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:44,446
But we go in with that baseship,
nobody's gonna notice us for awhile.

245
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:46,740
What do we fight with?
Their Raiders are frakked.

246
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:49,010
We don't use theirs. We use ours.

247
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,507
- Take half the Viper wing.
- Half the wing?

248
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:53,872
Yes. We'll sneak them in
on the rebel baseship.

249
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:56,750
Hoshi did some calculations
from Racetrack's photos.

250
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,384
We take out the FTL, the hub's stranded.

251
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:01,163
We blow the hub and

252
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:04,204
billions of skin jobs
lose their bath privileges.

253
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:05,509
Imagine.

254
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:09,263
Once they're gone, they can't come back.

255
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,265
Mortal enemies.

256
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,975
Before we blow the hub,
we need to get a team in

257
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,376
to unbox D'Anna.

258
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:18,139
Well, now, maybe we just don't.

259
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:22,276
Maybe we just forget
the Gods damn boxing facility.

260
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:25,029
- Lie to the rebels.
- Well, they're lying to us.

261
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,156
The skin jobs said
their Raiders won't fight

262
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:30,213
because the Final Five is here?

263
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:33,321
We tangled with those slit-eyed
black bastards

264
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:36,258
for three years now,
and they haven't turned back before.

265
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:37,166
Why now?

266
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:40,586
What if they're telling the truth?
What if the Final Five are here?

267
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,322
The Five could know the way to Earth.

268
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:44,783
If they knew, they're not
gonna lead us there after we've just

269
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,990
destroyed their resurrection capacity.

270
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,094
Maybe they're different,
like the rebels.

271
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:50,382
What if they're not?

272
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,057
What if their sole purpose
is to destroy us?

273
00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:56,381
I say we blow
the whole Gods damn thing to dust...

274
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,437
lock, stock, and barrel...
and trust the President's vision,

275
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:02,274
her scriptures, her way to Earth.

276
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:07,112
Why don't we split the difference?
Unbox D'Anna and find the Five.

277
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:09,597
Keep the 5 till we get to Earth.
Turn them over to the rebels.

278
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:12,117
They've waited this long.
It'll be on our terms.

279
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,953
It's all pie in the sky, gentlemen,

280
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,873
until we know what's true
and what's not.

281
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,340
And we put a lid on it.
The real plan stays in this room.

282
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,453
If the plan gets leaked to the Cylons,
all bets are off.

283
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,509
Have someone escort the rebel leader
back to her baseship

284
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,428
so she can inform her people
they have a deal.

285
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,043
"In 36 hours,
the Colonies will unite forces

286
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:05,367
"with insurgent rebel Cylons

287
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:06,857
"and their leader

288
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:10,556
"in an unprecedented
joint military operation

289
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:13,915
"to destroy the Cylons' ability
to download

290
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,573
"into..."

291
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,683
Blah blah blah.

292
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:24,033
Why weren't we consulted?

293
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,130
I'm sorry. I'm in the dark
as much as all of you.

294
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:39,246
You know, if they unbox the D'Annas,

295
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,631
at least we'll find out
who the fifth one is.

296
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:44,418
All that's gonna do
is crowd the airlock a little more.

297
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:48,359
Do you think they're gonna give you
a medal when they find out who you are?

298
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,197
What about you?

299
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,201
He sings, you know.

300
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,984
- What?
- Gaeta.

301
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:01,009
Whenever he feels the tingling,
whenever he feels his phantom leg.

302
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:04,323
Cottle says it helps him get through it.

303
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:12,595
He sings.

304
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:19,174
Good morning.

305
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:25,146
Morning.

306
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:32,760
What is it about the Galactica
that gives you such a glow?

307
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,261
I come over here, it's like I'm going
from one dungeon to the next.

308
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,504
Oh, I hadn't noticed. But thank you.

309
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:40,050
- You ready?
- Yes.

310
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:43,852
I want you to find out
who's behind the shared vision rumors.

311
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:45,675
Who's talking to him?

312
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,232
- With Baltar?
- You're sleeping with him, right?

313
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:53,306
Don't.

314
00:19:56,222 --> 00:19:58,815
I've just been informed
that you've been spotted down there

315
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:02,037
enough times to be a charter member
of his nymph squad.

316
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:11,912
All right.

317
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,289
I have

318
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:18,762
come to believe
in Baltar's spiritual message.

319
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:21,890
I don't know how or why.
It just happened.

320
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:25,201
I wish you knew how many times
I wanted to tell you.

321
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:29,356
Your friendship and your trust

322
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:30,826
- means...
- Frak.

323
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:36,322
Clearly my friendship
and trust mean frak.

324
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:39,572
And I don't really care
if you have to spend the night

325
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:42,407
on your knees praying
or just on your knees.

326
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:43,502
I want a name.

327
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:46,094
I want to know
who's responsible for these lies.

328
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,497
Madam President.

329
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:56,139
Laura,

330
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:58,567
I am so sorry.

331
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:00,283
You have a job to do.

332
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:19,364
The humans are never going to allow us
to have the Final 5 and go our own way.

333
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:22,075
Are you sure of this?

334
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:23,323
Not entirely.

335
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:26,930
I'd rather be wrong.
But we need insurance.

336
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,939
Trust has to begin somewhere.

337
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:32,406
Not with us.

338
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:34,588
It's our ship.

339
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:36,871
When we jump,

340
00:21:37,372 --> 00:21:39,785
we take control of it
with the Centurions.

341
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:42,629
We carry out the mission as promised.

342
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:44,199
But when we return,

343
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:47,184
we take hostages.

344
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:49,689
The humans on this ship
stay on this ship

345
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,647
until we have the Five.

346
00:21:52,935 --> 00:21:54,066
Look at me.

347
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:57,144
We've changed, but the humans haven't.

348
00:21:58,471 --> 00:21:59,780
We've come too far

349
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,150
to risk everything on their trust.

350
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,565
What a way to discover
such a beautiful voice, huh?

351
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:56,164
How'd you find me?

352
00:22:56,863 --> 00:22:59,830
- Your chief of staff.
- Needs to be horsewhipped.

353
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:04,321
If you came down here to kiss my ass
to get information, save your breath.

354
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:08,214
The Quorum's considering
a vote of no confidence against you.

355
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:19,472
I won't compromise
the success of this operation

356
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:22,393
or the safety of this fleet to indulge

357
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:26,586
the neediness of twelve
perpetually unhappy representatives.

358
00:23:27,154 --> 00:23:28,148
I can't.

359
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:42,216
I was with them on the emergency jump.

360
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:47,076
And I saw something
in the faces of the delegates.

361
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:49,964
It wasn't the anxiety from waiting.
It went beyond that.

362
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:52,861
I was anxious. It was my first time.
But they...

363
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,559
They were empty.

364
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,210
The Quorum had given up.

365
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:02,598
And then it struck me that

366
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:05,754
after going through the same routine

367
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:07,355
so many times,

368
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,326
it was the only way that they could

369
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:12,799
cope

370
00:24:13,422 --> 00:24:14,883
with the uncertainty.

371
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:17,700
To presume the worst.

372
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:20,265
You felt their

373
00:24:20,722 --> 00:24:21,894
suffering.

374
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:24,324
Now try

375
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:28,428
holding their lives in balance
every day.

376
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:34,584
Talk to them.

377
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,687
 No need to tell them everything.
I know how it works.

378
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,764
Just talk to the Quorum.

379
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:42,706
Let them put a face
to this joint mission.

380
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:46,571
Let them hear from the Cylon leader.
Anything.

381
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:49,371
Anything to put their fears to rest.

382
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:03,653
What's the matter?

383
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:07,594
Nothing.

384
00:25:08,296 --> 00:25:11,629
Nothing at all.
We've been lying here doing nothing.

385
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:12,748
What?

386
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,804
You've been lying

387
00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:23,108
about the President
sharing visions with Cylons.

388
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:27,311
That happens to be
the God's honest truth.

389
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:30,142
Sorry. I can't accept what you've done.

390
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,851
What I've done? What have I...

391
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,424
What are...

392
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:42,408
- Where's this coming from?
- These rumors you've started.

393
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:48,076
I've seen what they've done to her.

394
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,543
You seriously believe
that I'm making all this up?

395
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:54,588
I am not saying I'm not capable,
but why would I?

396
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,370
Six revealed it.

397
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:10,469
Caprica Six revealed them to me
through my attorney

398
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,011
in the last days of my trial,

399
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:17,782
when a guilty verdict was a certainty.

400
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,897
I suppose I could've gone public.

401
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,078
- Caused a stir.
- And all this time, you kept quiet.

402
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:32,647
I'm not saying I'm a saint, Tory.

403
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:34,619
I'm many things.

404
00:26:36,993 --> 00:26:38,642
But I try not to be spiteful.

405
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:41,636
Got no bloodlust to go get her.

406
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:43,846
But she's a hypocrite.

407
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:45,497
The lies.

408
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:48,321
The secret missions.

409
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,501
Co-opting the rhetoric of patriotism

410
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:54,271
to keep everyone in the dark,
including you.

411
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,318
That's rather worrying, isn't it?

412
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,096
So I had to speak.

413
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:06,781
The truth is,

414
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:09,631
no good ever comes from concealing it.

415
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:13,918
I've got a broadcast.

416
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:56,093
I didn't come here to beg
or plead or apologize

417
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:59,513
or to keep my job.
You know me better than that.

418
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:01,468
And I didn't come here
to create sympathy

419
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:04,093
by parading my illness in front of you.

420
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:07,263
On the contrary,
there are some that probably believe

421
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:09,975
that along with my cancer and drugs,

422
00:28:10,185 --> 00:28:12,852
I have inoculated myself
against compassion.

423
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:16,324
That is a joke.

424
00:28:19,494 --> 00:28:22,749
I am here because I want
to tell you face to face

425
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:26,316
that I believe in this mission
and what it means for our future.

426
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,860
I'm here to profess my trust

427
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:31,001
in our new allies.

428
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:34,008
I'm here to ask you to listen.

429
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:37,334
I'm here to ask for your support.

430
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,770
Bring her in.

431
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:14,738
In our civil war,

432
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:17,776
we've seen death.

433
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:20,571
We've watched our people die.

434
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,083
Gone forever.

435
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:23,940
As terrible as it was,

436
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,488
beyond the reach
of the resurrection ships,

437
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,110
something began to change.

438
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,690
We could feel a sense of time,

439
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,732
as if each moment

440
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:38,342
held its own significance.

441
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:41,646
We began to realize

442
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:43,525
that for our existence

443
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:45,366
to hold any value,

444
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:46,969
it must end.

445
00:29:47,556 --> 00:29:49,466
To live meaningful lives,

446
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:52,911
we must die and not return.

447
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:56,117
The one human flaw

448
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,626
that you spend
your lifetimes distressing over,

449
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:02,858
mortality,

450
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:06,257
is the one thing...

451
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:10,812
Well, it's the one thing
that makes you whole.

452
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,175
I believe it was no accident
that we were found by Kara Thrace.

453
00:30:17,154 --> 00:30:18,099
It was destiny.

454
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:21,990
She asked me to leave my people,
and I accepted.

455
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:26,652
No matter what the sacrifice
even if it should mean my death...

456
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:27,946
<i>... it come to pass.</i>

457
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:30,500
<i>The dying leader
shall know the truth of the opera house.</i>

458
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,925
<i>You are the harbinger of death,
Kara Thrace.</i>

459
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:40,518
Our destiny.

460
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:43,421
Our future

461
00:30:44,246 --> 00:30:45,296
begins here.

462
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:55,678
Thank you for giving me the opportunity

463
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,255
to speak.

464
00:30:58,907 --> 00:30:59,944
Take her out.

465
00:31:54,352 --> 00:31:55,559
Hera!

466
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,132
Hera?

467
00:32:48,796 --> 00:32:49,846
Bye-bye.

468
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,282
I gotta hand it to you.

469
00:33:13,402 --> 00:33:16,341
If you are a Cylon,
that was a great plan.

470
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:19,152
Dangle yet another way to Earth.

471
00:33:19,272 --> 00:33:22,292
Throw in the hub, the Final Five,
and the real kicker,

472
00:33:22,412 --> 00:33:24,387
put the Final Five on the fleet.

473
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:26,674
Even I couldn't pass that one up.

474
00:33:29,003 --> 00:33:31,179
You are having those visions,
aren't you?

475
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:40,594
Thus shall it come to pass.

476
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,525
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

477
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:51,574
What did you say?

478
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:55,501
- Thus shall it come to pass.
- The opera house.

479
00:33:56,673 --> 00:33:59,248
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

480
00:34:02,468 --> 00:34:03,663
Where did...

481
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,422
Where did you hear that?
Who told you that?

482
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:09,676
The Hybrid from the baseship,
before they unplugged it.

483
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,773
The Hybrid.

484
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,062
How does the Hybrid know
what's in my dream?

485
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:20,105
I wish I knew.

486
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:27,731
This has got to stop.

487
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:31,681
These visions. I've got to find out
about these visions.

488
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:33,575
I've got to know.

489
00:34:39,062 --> 00:34:40,387
Will you help me?

490
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:43,164
Yes.

491
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,211
Find Captain Agathon.

492
00:34:54,558 --> 00:34:56,013
When I spoke to the quorum,

493
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:57,827
I could feel it.

494
00:34:58,272 --> 00:35:00,974
- The contempt.
- You were right.

495
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,354
They're not ready to trust us.

496
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:04,792
No, I was wrong.

497
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,775
We're not ready.

498
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,609
We're deceiving them.

499
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:11,612
For protection. For necessity.

500
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:14,275
Out of suspicion and fear.

501
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:17,535
Why haven't the Final Five come forward?

502
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:20,998
What if they're watching,
judging us on our actions?

503
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:24,534
We're about to resort
to violence and coercion.

504
00:35:27,152 --> 00:35:30,047
What if they refuse to come with us?
We can't do this.

505
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:34,342
It's too late.

506
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:38,722
We have to order the Centurions
to stand down.

507
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,812
It's too late.

508
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:42,685
They're committed.

509
00:35:43,104 --> 00:35:45,492
Then we have to tell the humans
the truth.

510
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:46,514
No.

511
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:48,274
You can't do that.

512
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,917
They'll never trust us again.

513
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:54,416
They already know the coordinates.
They'll just go destroy everything.

514
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,066
Go.

515
00:35:56,912 --> 00:35:58,186
Stall for time.

516
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:00,395
Talk to Adama.

517
00:36:00,864 --> 00:36:02,258
Tell them anything.

518
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:03,817
Anything but the truth.

519
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:05,879
I'll deal with the Centurions.

520
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:40,535
Of course.

521
00:36:40,695 --> 00:36:41,861
Have a seat.

522
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:48,668
We're going to settle this now.

523
00:36:49,237 --> 00:36:50,773
What's to settle?

524
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:53,548
Your chief of staff
is incomparably talented.

525
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,177
I've been sharing visions
with Sharon Agathon and the Six.

526
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,090
So I was only speaking the truth.

527
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:03,298
Yes.

528
00:37:04,036 --> 00:37:06,228
The Hybrid on the baseship spoke

529
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:08,646
of an opera house and a dying leader.

530
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:11,899
We're going to talk to the Hybrid.

531
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:14,735
And why would you require my presence?

532
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,809
Because you're in my visions.

533
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:44,229
What are you doin', baby?

534
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,394
Are you drawing?

535
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:54,568
Can I see what you drew?

536
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:08,644
No!

537
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:10,333
No!

538
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:14,681
Why?

539
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:16,835
Why?

540
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,727
Hera?

541
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:23,463
Hera?

542
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:30,296
Hera...

543
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:51,374
<i>Raptor 1-2-4,</i>

544
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:53,001
<i>You are clear for landing...</i>

545
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:11,686
Hera!

546
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:19,820
Hera!

547
00:39:20,582 --> 00:39:21,340
Hera!

548
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:24,782
- Have you seen my daughter?
- No, I haven't.

549
00:39:25,176 --> 00:39:26,055
Hera!

550
00:39:51,712 --> 00:39:53,269
I can't find Hera.

551
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,901
Get away from my child.

552
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:45,696
Get your hands off of my child.

553
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:47,372
Athena.

554
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:48,783
Stay back!

555
00:40:50,945 --> 00:40:51,994
Stay away.

556
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:53,621
Stand down!

557
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:11,305
Plug it in.

558
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:12,765
I need to talk to it.

559
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:17,988
- Let God's will be done.
- Shut up.

560
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:21,035
It's time to get some answers.

561
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:29,927
Tyrol, will you come in here
and take Hera, please?

562
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:33,001
Just do it, Tyrol.

563
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:42,072
Come on.

564
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,096
Is she gone?

565
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:53,514
Yeah.

566
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:12,074
You are never gonna take my child.

567
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:15,171
We didn't come here to.

568
00:42:29,371 --> 00:42:30,426
Jump!

569
00:42:55,446 --> 00:42:59,623
