<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:24,132 --> 00:00:25,818
You'll be safe here, Gaius.

3
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:27,080
Please, God.

4
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:29,186
Don't let this child die.

5
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:31,446
God answered your prayers,
you have to see.

6
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:33,536
- Look at him.
- And no trace of a fever.

7
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:34,779
It's a miracle.

8
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:36,400
Tory, Tory...

9
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:38,458
Fancy finding you in the cafeteria.

10
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:43,328
- You have an abundance of feeling.
- I suppose I couldn't be a Cylon.

11
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:44,870
Cylons can feel.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,328
- You believe that?
- Yeah, I do actually.

13
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:48,593
I want to explain.

14
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,888
- She sought us out.
- You know what has to be done here.

15
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,100
Now, it would be better for her sake
if it was you.

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,521
Let's say Cally does find out.
What do we do then?

17
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:02,440
The last thing we need
is for your Cylon-hating wife

18
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:05,856
to find out there's a bunch of skinjobs
running around this ship.

19
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:08,272
And that her husband is one of them.

20
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:10,740
- Cally!
- Stay the frak away from me!

21
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:12,867
I heard you. You're Cylons.

22
00:01:13,028 --> 00:01:14,744
A bunch of frakking skinjobs.

23
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,377
I couldn't keep you safe from harm,
my love,

24
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:36,474
but I kept you in my heart.

25
00:01:38,177 --> 00:01:40,109
You were the breath in my lungs,

26
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,063
the blood in my veins,

27
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,571
the light in my eye,

28
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:49,293
and now that breath is gone.

29
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:51,792
That blood

30
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:55,018
and the light are gone.

31
00:01:58,587 --> 00:01:59,787
And I am left

32
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:02,433
a voice.

33
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:12,669
And the Lords of Kobol,

34
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,347
as many and as varied as mortal men,

35
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,978
must bend down and lean low

36
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:21,723
to hear that voice

37
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:26,148
and hear my lament.

38
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:41,760
With all our thoughts and love,

39
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,405
Calandra Henderson Tyrol,

40
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:48,457
we send your spirit into the universe.

41
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:53,959
So say we all.

42
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,837
So say we all.

43
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,325
I liked this service.

44
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,816
It's not for me, I'll tell you that.

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,461
I know, but I want you to know
what I like.

46
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:21,686
It was lovely.

47
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:23,712
Thank you.

48
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:26,179
Why do they have to do
these things at dawn?

49
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,824
It's all right.
They do because they have to.

50
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,091
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:35,796
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thank you.

52
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:48,400
Sorry about your loss.

53
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,881
Sorry, Chief.

54
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:52,413
What the frak was that?

55
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,414
He'd get us all killed.

56
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:55,702
Chief.

57
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,395
I'm so sorry.

58
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,018
What's it up to today?

59
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:20,402
Same as... Sleeping, pacing.

60
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,516
Don't know how it doesn't go nuts.

61
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:26,294
Probably turns its brain off.
Frakkin' toaster.

62
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:29,883
Yeah.

63
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,628
Colonel.

64
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:42,035
Your request to see the child,
Hera Agathon, has been denied.

65
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,569
And you felt the need to come
all the way down here in person

66
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:46,998
to tell me that again?

67
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,429
You think I want to come down here?

68
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,957
We're done.

69
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,004
I think we're not.

70
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,424
You come every day.

71
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:00,219
<i>But you never ask questions anymore.</i>

72
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:07,719
Is there something
that you want from me?

73
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,924
Is there something that you need?

74
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,367
Stay back.

75
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,881
See you tomorrow, Colonel.

76
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,505
Door!

77
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:36,518
What was that at the service
this morning?

78
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:39,663
Why don't you get on the wireless
and tell the fleet about us?

79
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,263
Are you gonna deal with that kid?

80
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,584
Probably needs to be changed.

81
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:50,478
All right.

82
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:54,649
You think Cally killed herself
because of you, don't you?

83
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:57,902
She thought we were having an affair.

84
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,226
But we weren't.

85
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:05,512
I don't even know what I am anymore.

86
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,842
I don't know
which of my memories are real.

87
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:13,519
I don't know that I've had one action
in my life that isn't programmed.

88
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:15,841
Galen.

89
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,913
You're perfect.

90
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,142
You don't need guilt.

91
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:24,266
- We were made to be perfect.
- What is that?

92
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:26,973
More of Baltar's crap?

93
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:28,699
So...

94
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:32,143
You just...

95
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:34,313
live without guilt?

96
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:35,431
Just...

97
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:37,099
shut it down.

98
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,517
No.

99
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:40,433
That wasn't the deal.

100
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,123
Colonel, you said it yourself.

101
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:46,587
"Be the man you want to be
till the day you die."

102
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,973
- We're still the same people?
- Of course, we are.

103
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:51,729
- You shut up.
- That is not the same as human.

104
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:53,734
Like we're stronger,

105
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:54,584
right?

106
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:55,989
Chief,

107
00:06:57,002 --> 00:07:00,867
what you're feeling is what a man feels
when this happens.

108
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:03,633
It's normal and it's human.

109
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:08,261
And it's not gonna end anytime soon.

110
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,302
It'll be there every day.

111
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:13,895
You'll see her every day.

112
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:16,234
You'll see her...

113
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:21,924
Be a man, Chief.

114
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:24,500
Feel what you gotta feel.

115
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,116
But don't risk us.

116
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:27,695
Come on, Tory.

117
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,994
Just think about it.

118
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,455
Think about what we are.

119
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,617
What we can do.

00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:55,387
Dear Gods, what...?

126
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,540
Gods?

127
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:59,917
- Thought there was only one.
- What are you doing?

128
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,799
Pulling one hair
from your head at a time.

129
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,757
- It's intense, isn't it?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,734
If it happens at the same time

131
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,721
as a pleasurable touch...

132
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:14,422
Frak!

133
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,467
- Signals get crossed, don't they?
- Yeah.

134
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,981
It's hard to tell the pleasure
from the pain.

135
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:23,730
Yeah.

136
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:26,263
Listen, I think that...

137
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:30,611
You're very strong, aren't you?
You really...

138
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:36,996
I think I preferred it when you cried.

139
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,760
If you sin,

140
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:41,253
that God forgives you,

141
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,045
then it's gone, right? Erased?

142
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,172
Forgiveness.

143
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:48,519
You must consecrate the sin.

144
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:51,385
- Make it benign.
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:53,799
- Bad becomes good.
- Yes, it does.

146
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,423
Pain becomes pleasure.

147
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:58,060
And doesn't that mean,

148
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,353
if you really become one with God,

149
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:01,856
you can never do wrong?

150
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:05,236
Well, no,

151
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:08,376
not really, because that...

152
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,833
that would more than imply

153
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:13,407
we're all perfect.

154
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:15,928
Perfect?

155
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,048
Well, yeah.

156
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,134
- Perfect just as we are.
- No,

157
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:28,882
no, no, no!

158
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,082
Go, go, go.

159
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:31,689
You're all heretics!

160
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:35,519
Two minutes, go!

161
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,697
- Where is Gaius Baltar?
- He isn't here.

162
00:10:58,237 --> 00:10:59,884
You, on your feet.

163
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,215
Find him.

164
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,935
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

165
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:13,183
<i>Security alert.</i>

166
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:15,594
<i>- Deck 8, section 14.</i>
- One minute!

167
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:17,319
Down! Down! Down!

168
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,864
Everybody move down!

169
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:22,101
Go.
Where is Gaius...

170
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:24,827
We're coming back for Gaius Baltar.

171
00:11:31,118 --> 00:11:31,947
Frak!

172
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,321
Finishing up, Chief?

173
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:35,489
Yeah. Just give me one more relay.

174
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,203
I think it's a boy.

175
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,224
Here you go, Chief.

176
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,275
Nice to be small, huh?

177
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:55,592
We ready to go?
I gotta get out of here.

178
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,362
Yeah.

179
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:04,384
Go ahead.

180
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:24,914
- Raptor away. Readings nominal.
- <i>Racetrack, Redwing.</i>

181
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:27,165
We been waiting
for that school bus of yours all day.

182
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:28,639
School bus?

183
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:31,044
What's that make those things?
Bicycles?

184
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,631
Racing cars, sweetheart.

185
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,033
<i>Top fuel racers.</i>

186
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:38,214
It's not gonna look very good
when they get beat by a school bus.

187
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:40,011
Okay, let's ride.

188
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:46,519
What the frak?

189
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:49,655
Galactica, Racetrack,

190
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:53,609
<i>I have no control
in my port rear lower RCS thruster.</i>

191
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:57,113
Skulls, get your ass up here.

192
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:59,380
Galactica, Racetrack, coming about.

193
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,972
Clear port landing deck
for emergency landing.

194
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,641
<i>Racetrack, Galactica,
dock cleared for emergency landing.</i>

195
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:06,155
One,

196
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,276
two,

197
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:08,556
<i>three,</i>

198
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:09,951
<i>four.</i>

199
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:12,373
One, two, three.

200
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:14,543
Coming in hot.

201
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:16,497
<i>Too hot!</i>

202
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,245
Where's the Admiral? Where is he?

203
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:33,899
And what are you doing, taking notes,
standing here. Mister Officious?

204
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:37,161
You should be out there, now, trying
to find the people, whoever they are!

205
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,573
Whatever you say, Sir.

206
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,178
You can read the old text,
can't you, Gaius?

207
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:43,998
Sons... of...

208
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:44,994
ar-is?

209
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,799
Ares. Sons of Ares. They're the people
who committed this attack.

210
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,160
Obviously,
a fundamentalist splinter group.

211
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:52,351
Although,

212
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:54,849
all they're doing is trying

213
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:58,265
to protect the old Gods.

214
00:13:58,385 --> 00:13:59,893
Old Gods die hard.

215
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:03,457
Even among your people.

216
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:15,544
I've seen you here before, haven't I?

217
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:17,901
Your name is...

218
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,429
don't tell me...

219
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:21,863
begins with "M"...

220
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:24,438
- Lilly.
- Lilly.

221
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,020
What's in your hand, Lilly?

222
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:38,610
Asklepius.

223
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:41,768
God of healing.

224
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,189
I know you'll heal our people.

225
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,369
But I thought...

226
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,777
The old Gods are fighting back.

227
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:02,696
<i>- Where come on to do...</i>
- Those capacitors are still hot.

228
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:04,279
Watch yourself, Chief.

229
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:06,783
Take my glove.

230
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,429
Frak me.

231
00:15:25,873 --> 00:15:27,939
My fault, didn't get swapped out.

232
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:29,276
We could have died.

233
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,517
- Was that in your pocket?
- We don't have to do this.

234
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:33,500
You're right,

235
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:35,212
we're okay.

236
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,885
It's okay.

237
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:38,355
Is it?

238
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,608
Skulls, is it?

239
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,686
- Galen.
- I don't need to be patted on the head.

240
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:44,863
- You can tell me I frakked up.
- Nobody got hurt, okay? Forget it.

241
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:47,366
- You're only human.
- No! Don't say that!

242
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:48,700
Tell me I frakked up!

243
00:15:48,862 --> 00:15:49,813
Say it!

244
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:51,852
Tell me I frakked up!

245
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:54,303
Any one of you.

246
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:55,732
Cowards!

247
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,811
Chief, I can handle this.

248
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:02,101
Why don't you take a little down time?

249
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,346
Get out of the Raptor, Figurski.

250
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:29,437
People have room in their hearts
for one great belief,

251
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,027
you or the old Gods.

252
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:34,830
Which one will it be?

253
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:41,830
Why can't I just be a man?

254
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:46,100
Do I really need to take
on the Gods single-handed?

255
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,360
No. But imagine the kind of man
you'll be when you do.

256
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:54,075
Surely such a man must be magnificent,

257
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:57,454
larger-than-life, godlike himself.

258
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,900
What are you talking about?

259
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:03,406
It's not about that at all.

260
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:11,504
It's about this.

261
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:19,470
Stop!

262
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:21,789
Stop.

263
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,456
This is unacceptable.

264
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:30,087
We have been targeted

265
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:32,189
because of what we believe.

266
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:36,751
By those who answer to faceless Gods 
that bear no relevance in our world.

267
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:39,819
They want us to be afraid.

268
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:43,947
And I'm tired of being afraid.

269
00:17:47,021 --> 00:17:49,059
The time has come to make a stand.

270
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:52,363
And that time is now.

271
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:57,872
Gaius, what are you doing?

272
00:17:58,229 --> 00:17:59,666
Where are you going?

273
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:01,916
Gaius?

274
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:08,512
We want justice,
not looking at stupid old Gods!

275
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:10,912
Sir, we're having a service.

276
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:11,894
Are you?

277
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:13,594
But whom are you serving?

278
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:15,369
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Do you?

279
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:16,924
Would you be serving Zeus?

280
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:19,222
Apparently, king of the Gods,
who also happened to be,

281
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:20,881
let me tell you, a serial rapist.

282
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,804
Prone to giving birth out
of his own forehead.

283
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:25,435
That's very likely, isn't it?

284
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:26,831
Well, Gods strike me down.

285
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:28,606
- What are you going to do?
- Damn you.

286
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:31,613
You ignorant witch,
telling the people lies and stories.

287
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:34,031
Maybe you want me
to pray to Asklepius,

288
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,083
who healed wounds
with the blood of Gorgons,

289
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:40,221
or Aphrodite or Artemis
or any other of this rubbish!

290
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:45,761
How awful!
Out of the way, you hideous old witch.

291
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:48,477
That's the kind of rubbish
that you made!

292
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:51,082
I will not be destroyed at this level!

293
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:55,179
God!

294
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,925
Haven't enough of us died already?

295
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:05,772
Am I that late?

296
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:09,401
No, this wasn't a treatment.
It was just a blood test.

297
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,877
- You brought a new book?
- Yes. Something different this time.

298
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:14,795
It's a classic. My favorite.

299
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,384
<i>Searider Falcon</i>,

300
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,660
I haven't read it in years.
I don't remember how it ends.

301
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,038
I don't either. I never read the ending.

302
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,377
- You're kidding. It's your favorite.
- I like it so much,

303
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,326
I don't want it to be over.

304
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:30,421
- So I'm saving it.
- Maybe I should do that.

305
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,881
That's a bad idea. Maybe not.

306
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,225
Let me do that for you.

307
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:42,700
Okay, thanks.

308
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:47,941
Baltar's back at home in the brig again.

309
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,415
Desecration of a temple.

310
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:53,520
It's his revenge for what happened
to him this morning.

311
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,966
It was brutal.

312
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:59,728
I have my personnel trying to track down
anything on the Sons of Ares.

313
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:02,350
- But nobody's talking.
- The thing is that Baltar knows

314
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,803
that there are religious hardliners
in Dogsville,

315
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:06,841
but he continues to provoke.

316
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:10,035
I just can't have
a religious war in this fleet.

317
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,389
Oh, please, no.

318
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:14,019
The whole damn thing'll become
our frakkin' responsibility,

319
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,681
yours and mine. Seriously, Bill,

320
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,950
we have 30,000 people left
and they're not happy

321
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,215
unless they're kicking
each other's teeth in.

322
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:22,406
- This is what we've become?
- No.

323
00:20:22,844 --> 00:20:23,750
It's him.

324
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,937
Baltar has an uncanny way of

325
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:28,100
stirring up all the crap.

326
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:32,643
I wonder if he'd be willing
to stay in lockdown,

327
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:35,433
indefinitely, for his own safety.

328
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,431
And make a martyr out of him? No way.

329
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:40,263
Those girly, groupie,

330
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,695
sex whatever-they-are,
they already think he's a god.

331
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:47,525
- So we kick him off of the Galactica.
- No, I want him close.

332
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,501
I'm going to the brig.

333
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:52,955
You want to see him?

334
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,177
I want him to see me.

335
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,635
Oh, we didn't even make it
to tomorrow, did we?

336
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,726
You asked what I want.

337
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,388
I want to know how it feels

338
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,910
to have killed billions of human beings,

339
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,471
to have all that blood on your hands.

340
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,814
Think it through.

341
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,300
Because that's what I want.

342
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,913
I feel it.
Do you really think that I couldn't?

343
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:27,182
Do you?

344
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:29,832
Or do you turn it off?

345
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:33,299
Is there a switch in your head
that you turn off?

346
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:36,505
You talk like we're different,
but you know we're not.

347
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:40,968
Weapons.

348
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,520
Working late, or up early, Chief?

349
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:20,032
You act like you think
I'm made of switches and relays.

350
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:21,840
Look...

351
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,053
veins, not wires.

352
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:26,285
We're the same.

353
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:34,105
Do you see we're the same?

354
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:39,645
Then tell me.

355
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:42,029
Tell you what?

356
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,891
How you live with what you've done.

357
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:49,879
Saul,

358
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:54,399
are you asking for absolution?

359
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:57,412
Forgiveness?

360
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:01,302
I can give you that.

361
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,301
Stand down.

362
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:07,644
Step outside.

363
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:18,024
Just tell me what the trouble is.

364
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,430
You have nothing to offer me.

365
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:29,285
We're not the same.

366
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:36,500
Were you asleep?

367
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:38,842
What is it this time?

368
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,421
Here to strip-search me?

369
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:45,408
Or could it possibly be
that your presence here means

370
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:48,512
that the President has been made
aware of my situation.

371
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:51,140
It's being looked into.

372
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:54,143
- Is it really?
- Aggressively.

373
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:56,353
Now here's the thing.

374
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,618
I want you to look at me, Gaius.

375
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:04,847
Just look at me.

376
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,618
This is a wig.

377
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:14,369
I'm dying.

378
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:19,730
Now, if you look in my eyes...

379
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:21,634
Go ahead, look.

380
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:23,523
You can probably see it.

381
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:27,997
- I'm very sorry.
- No, I don't want your pity.

382
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:30,235
I'm still doing my job. In fact,

383
00:24:30,787 --> 00:24:33,499
I'm gonna aggressively pursue
the men that attacked you.

384
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,163
And I'm going to limit the size
of public assemblies

385
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:38,275
to protect your people, but...

386
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:43,196
I'm going to be slipping away
from this life very soon,

387
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:46,599
and I've gotten kind of curious
as to what that's going to be like,

388
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,322
and so, I did some research.

389
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:51,815
There are some people who say
that when people are getting closer

390
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:55,635
to their death, they just don't care
as much about rules and laws and...

391
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:57,498
conventional morality.

392
00:24:57,995 --> 00:24:59,251
Are you threatening me?

393
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:01,920
No, no,
I'm just saying "have a quiet life".

394
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,536
And I'll die a quiet little death.

395
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:07,883
And everyone will be happy.

396
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,990
It's just that I'm not in the mood
any longer to indulge you.

397
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,508
And that's...

398
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:19,060
all.

399
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:24,688
And you are

400
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:26,730
being released, so...

401
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:28,233
stay safe.

402
00:25:45,957 --> 00:25:47,084
Hey, Chief.

403
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:57,150
We all miss her, Chief.

404
00:25:58,678 --> 00:26:00,995
I understand if you need some time off.

405
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:04,941
Or even if you might need more shifts
to keep yourself busy.

406
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:07,818
No one knows how they're going to react
to loss like this,

407
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:09,956
or what they're gonna need.

408
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:12,998
I don't need special treatment.

409
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:19,455
I guess she just couldn't take it, huh?

410
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,591
Being married to a Cylon?

411
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:24,192
Being the mother
of a half-breed abomination?

412
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:32,587
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

413
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:37,932
She was a good woman.

414
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,911
If you really believe that,

415
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:52,238
you wouldn't have threatened to stick
her up against a bulkhead and shoot her.

416
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:57,065
It's okay, though.

417
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:01,584
I thought about doing it
many times myself. Believe me.

418
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,666
- Chief...
- How many of us ended up

419
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:06,604
with the people
we really wanted to be with?

420
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,446
Got stuck
with the best of limited options?

421
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:12,874
And why?

422
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:16,967
Because the ones we really want,

423
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:19,862
the really loved, were dead

424
00:27:20,544 --> 00:27:21,428
dying,

425
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:25,376
turned out to be Cylons
and they didn't know. If Boomer had...

426
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:30,014
- if I had known...
- Listen, let's...

427
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:31,677
- No.
- Let's go. Come on.

428
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:32,505
No.

429
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:34,582
I didn't know.

430
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:36,480
- Let's go.
- I didn't know.

431
00:27:36,894 --> 00:27:40,080
So I buried my head in the sand
and I took it and I settled!

432
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:42,660
I settled for that shriek,

433
00:27:43,158 --> 00:27:44,910
those dull vacant eyes,

434
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:47,377
the boiled cabbage stench of her.

435
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:49,713
And why?
Because this is my life!

436
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:51,923
This is the life I picked.

437
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:55,145
And it's fine,
but you know what? It's not.

438
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:56,643
I didn't pick this life.

439
00:27:56,763 --> 00:27:58,513
This is not my frakkin' life.

440
00:27:58,673 --> 00:28:00,543
What the hell's gotten into you?

441
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,196
Don't do this.

442
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:04,615
Don't do this to her memory.

443
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:05,891
You know what?

444
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,826
I'm sorry if I'm not gonna do this
the way you want me to,

445
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:10,412
or the way you might.

446
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:14,478
But I will not make an angel
out of someone who wasn't an angel.

447
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:17,584
But I can see you have.

448
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:21,208
And now you've come down here
to be in my club,

449
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:22,787
but you're not in my club.

450
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:24,986
You don't know what frakkin' club I'm in

451
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:27,376
'cause you never asked
the right questions.

452
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:29,833
Chief, let's get out of here.

453
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:30,841
No.

454
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:32,735
Why don't you go?

455
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:35,334
- Take care of your precious ship.
- Stop it.

456
00:28:35,454 --> 00:28:36,836
Stop all of this.

457
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:40,013
If you don't, I'm gonna have
to act on it. Shut up.

458
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,228
Great!

459
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:42,173
Do it!

460
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:45,273
Please! For the love of Gods,
please demote me.

461
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:47,239
Get me off your frakkin' ship!

462
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:52,203
Specialist Tyrol,

463
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:54,943
I want you off my hangar deck

464
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:57,673
before you endanger another pilot.

465
00:28:58,145 --> 00:29:00,658
You're to report to Petty Officer Bassom

466
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,042
tomorrow morning at 0600

467
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,770
for reassignment.

468
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,250
Do you understand?

469
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,494
You have authority
over emergency measures,

470
00:29:55,614 --> 00:29:58,059
but you bulldozed this through
after the session was closed.

471
00:29:58,179 --> 00:29:59,259
Yes, exactly.

472
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:01,228
It's a crowd control measure.

473
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,096
I also authorized the repair

474
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:05,701
of a cargo elevator,
do you want to talk about that too?

475
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:08,565
Crowd control? Looks to me
like it was designed purely to stop

476
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:11,187
- Gaius Baltar's organization.
- You mean his cult?

477
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:14,107
Well his "cult" was attacked.

478
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:16,623
And from what I'm hearing
around the fleet,

479
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:18,778
- it was pretty brutal.
- It was brutal.

480
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:19,954
Exactly.

481
00:30:20,202 --> 00:30:22,210
And this measure is designed explicitly

482
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,908
to protect those people.

483
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,333
If they aren't gathering in mass,

484
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:28,206
they aren't provoking resentment.

485
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,976
It limits his group, while permitting
more mainstream worship.

486
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,238
Wherever Gaius Baltar is,
violence happens.

487
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:35,385
And if he doesn't cause it, he draws it.

488
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:37,099
My job, Mr. Adama,

489
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:39,828
is, and always will be,

490
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,146
to keep the people safe.

491
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:47,577
Madame President,
I have to wonder if this resolution

492
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:50,602
couldn't be used
against other offshoot religious groups.

493
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:51,790
Absolutely not.

494
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,416
Gaius Baltar is a special case.
You know that.

495
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:56,458
And we're making him a special case.

496
00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:58,693
- How are we doing that?
- We're fueling his argument.

497
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:01,075
After all, is he preaching violence?
Immoral acts?

498
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,382
I don't know.
I haven't been to one of his...

499
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:06,400
- What are they called? Services?
- It's not that far

500
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,955
from what some of our own
Mithras followers believe.

501
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,175
We have Mithrasaries among the Gemenese.

502
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:12,999
Can this order be applied to them?

503
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,049
Clear your heads.
We are talking about Gaius Baltar.

504
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:18,778
Everyone in this room experienced

505
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:20,673
tragedy at New Caprica.

506
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:22,188
Have we forgotten?

507
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:27,145
Will you open this order
to a full Quorum vote?

508
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:28,097
No.

509
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:30,331
We can override, Madam President.

510
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:32,029
I cannot let this stand.

511
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,988
You can override, and you cannot
let this stand, Mr. Adama?

512
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:37,941
Then you open it up to a vote.

513
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:40,859
And if you strike this down,
you can all go back

514
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:43,530
to your constituents
and you can tell them what you've done,

515
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,657
and "we, the people,"
will have triumphed.

516
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:48,096
But think about
what it's gonna cost you.

517
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:51,959
Because every single one of you
remembers

518
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:55,954
what it was like
when Gaius Baltar had political power.

519
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,163
And you should be terrified

520
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,449
to think about what this man will do

521
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,810
with blind religious devotion.

522
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,225
So go ahead.

523
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:06,746
Vote.

524
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:28,579
Should I get used to waking up
to this face?

525
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,736
You're traveling light.

526
00:32:35,616 --> 00:32:36,995
An informal chat.

527
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:39,525
Just you and me.

528
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:42,563
<i>And the man watching
through the cameras.</i>

529
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,082
You haven't answered my question.

530
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,038
You want to know how I work?

531
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,423
If I can turn off pain?

532
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Can you?

533
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:55,805
I want the pain.

534
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:57,238
It's how I learn.

535
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:01,891
I was instrumental

536
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:04,663
in the destruction of humanity.

537
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,217
But at the same time,
I learned because...

538
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,336
because I fell in love.

539
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:13,021
With a human man.

540
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,538
And he was mortal.

541
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:19,004
And fallible.

542
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,341
And he had this incredible

543
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:23,825
pride in himself.

544
00:33:25,124 --> 00:33:27,419
He thought he knew everything
there was to know.

545
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,332
And I loved him

546
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:30,896
with my whole heart.

547
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,838
And then one day,

548
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:36,557
I realized

549
00:33:37,856 --> 00:33:39,354
I wouldn't have him forever.

550
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:43,787
I understood what I'd done.

551
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:48,355
How I betrayed him and humanity.

552
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:52,311
And that pain

553
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:54,734
taught me to understand death.

554
00:33:58,198 --> 00:33:59,541
Baltar could die.

555
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:02,377
- And I loved him.
- No.

556
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:05,371
- Baltar's heart was ephemeral.
- No.

557
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:07,735
Baltar's body was fragile in my hands.

558
00:34:07,905 --> 00:34:10,406
No, we are not gonna talk
about the fragile body

559
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:13,138
of Gaius frakkin' Baltar! Door!

560
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:14,894
Door!

561
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:18,655
Dismissed. Clear out, out!

562
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:22,323
Frak, what's he gonna do to her?

563
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:31,814
- I can tell you how to turn it off.
- How?

564
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:34,607
Pain is how I learn from the guilt.

565
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:36,361
There's wisdom there.

566
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:39,370
Clarity. You know yourself there.

567
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,448
Pain.

568
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:42,215
Our minds

569
00:34:42,782 --> 00:34:45,001
were designed based on your minds.

570
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:49,238
We learn things about how you work
that you've never known.

571
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:54,512
When you're in pain,

572
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:58,328
that's when you learn
who you really are.

573
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,845
That's when you focus,

574
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,855
sharp as the point of a knife.

575
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:18,194
I can give you that clarity again.

576
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:24,575
I'm sorry, Sir,
I'm not supposed to let you enter.

577
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:26,165
What are you doing?

578
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,121
There are 12 people inside already.

579
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:29,914
- You can count?
- Yes, Sir.

580
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:33,126
You can't enter without breaking
emergency provision 1-7.

581
00:35:33,386 --> 00:35:35,759
- If I leave, he can come in.
- If she leaves, I can come in.

582
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,762
Everyone stay inside for safety reasons.

583
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:40,436
- This is absurd. You're counting heads.
- I have my orders.

584
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:43,004
But I live here,
and so do some of these women.

585
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,434
Where are we supposed to go?

586
00:35:46,902 --> 00:35:48,405
This is your moment, Gaius.

587
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:50,685
Step forward. Make a stand.

588
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:54,261
I don't want to be a hero.

589
00:35:54,431 --> 00:35:56,733
- I just want to go to bed. Go to sleep.
- Look at me.

590
00:35:57,332 --> 00:36:00,903
I promise you.
Step forward, and you will not be hurt.

591
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:04,007
- Promise to me?
- Yes,

592
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:06,308
you can lie down inside. Go in.

593
00:36:10,131 --> 00:36:11,122
Stop, Sir.

594
00:36:12,842 --> 00:36:13,976
Gaius!

595
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:23,710
Get your damn' hands off me,

596
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,512
you frakkin' freak machine!

597
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:41,683
Can you feel it, Saul?

598
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:44,531
Can you feel the clarity of it?

599
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:56,848
Stay down or clear this area, Sir!

600
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:59,058
You have to do this.

601
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:01,693
The gain will outweigh the cost.

602
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:15,537
I really want to stay down.

603
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:17,313
No, you don't.

604
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,969
- Stay down, please, Sir!
- Wait, wait, stop!

605
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:33,830
- Lieutenant.
- Stand down.

606
00:37:35,015 --> 00:37:37,583
The Quorum has just met
in an emergency session.

607
00:37:37,843 --> 00:37:39,961
Full right of assembly
has been restored.

608
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:43,255
You can...

609
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,731
you can go back into your home.
No one will stop you.

610
00:37:53,495 --> 00:37:54,681
Thank you.

611
00:37:55,502 --> 00:37:57,448
I don't do these things for you.

612
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:02,718
You do them
because your God compels you.

613
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,514
Lee has no idea.
He really has no idea.

614
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,737
Have you heard anything I said?

615
00:38:24,907 --> 00:38:29,018
There are pragmatic realities
he refuses to face.

616
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,423
Well, that's a problem, of course.

617
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:37,051
He's doing what he thinks is right.

618
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,427
Well, yeah, he's Lee.

619
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,896
Thing is,
it probably is the right thing, but...

620
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:48,029
sometimes the right thing is a luxury.

621
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:50,899
And it can have
profoundly dangerous consequences.

622
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:54,983
And yet it's almost
as if he doesn't want that to be true.

623
00:38:56,392 --> 00:38:58,811
Okay, I gotta stop this.
I'm not supposed to...

624
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:01,811
get upset during treatment.

625
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:05,470
Will you read the next chapter?

626
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,261
I must warn you that I'm getting
into the part that I haven't read yet.

627
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:12,673
Oh dear.

628
00:39:13,248 --> 00:39:15,782
Are you going to be able to continue?

629
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:26,817
Chapter seven:

630
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,819
"The raft was not as seaworthy
as I had hoped.

631
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:34,617
"The waves repeatedly
threatened to swamp it.

632
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:36,738
"I wasn't afraid to die.

633
00:39:39,597 --> 00:39:42,678
"I was afraid of the emptiness
that I felt inside.

634
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:49,408
"I couldn't feel anything.

635
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:53,060
"That's what scared me.

636
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:56,942
"It came into my thoughts.

637
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:00,439
"It filled them.

638
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,647
"It felt good."

639
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:06,260
More.

640
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:09,301
No.

641
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:12,744
Keep going.

642
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:15,498
No, I made a mistake.

643
00:40:17,353 --> 00:40:19,167
This isn't what you need.

644
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:28,175
I'm not a priest.

645
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:32,091
I've never even been
a particularly good man.

646
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,775
I have, in fact,

647
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:39,181
been a profoundly

648
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,247
selfish man.

649
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:44,005
But that doesn't matter, you see.

650
00:40:45,163 --> 00:40:47,433
Something in the universe

651
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,941
loves me.

652
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:56,151
Something in the universe

653
00:40:57,002 --> 00:40:59,719
loves the entity that is me.

654
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:03,986
I will choose to call this something
"God."

655
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:06,589
A singular spark

656
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:09,716
that dwells
in the soul of every living being.

657
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:14,054
If you look inside yourself,
you will find this spark too.

658
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:16,752
You will.

659
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:20,588
But you have to look.

660
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:23,355
Deep.

661
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,741
Love your faults.

662
00:41:28,657 --> 00:41:29,964
Embrace them.

663
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:32,812
If God embraces them,

664
00:41:33,481 --> 00:41:35,163
then how can they be faults?

665
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:37,309
Love yourself.

666
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,776
You have to love yourself.

667
00:41:42,255 --> 00:41:44,384
If we don't love ourselves,

668
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:47,373
how can we love others?

669
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:52,927
And when we know what we are,

670
00:41:53,282 --> 00:41:56,150
then we can find
the truth out about others.

671
00:41:57,104 --> 00:41:58,675
See what they are.

672
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:01,239
The truth about them.

673
00:42:03,763 --> 00:42:05,577
And you know what the truth is,

674
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:08,978
the truth about them.

675
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:11,877
About you.

676
00:42:12,826 --> 00:42:14,269
About me.

677
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:16,245
Do you?

678
00:42:22,095 --> 00:42:24,112
The truth is we are all perfect,

679
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:27,737
just as we are.

680
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,794
God only loves that which is perfect,
and he loves you.

681
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:36,015
He loves you because you are perfect.

682
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:38,980
You are perfect...

683
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,478
just as you are.
