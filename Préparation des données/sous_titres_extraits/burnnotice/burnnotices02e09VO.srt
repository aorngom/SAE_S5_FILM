1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:03,646
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:06,925
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:12,015
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.

4
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:14,562
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

5
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,019
- Where am I?
- Miami.

6
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:19,064
You do whatever work comes your way.

7
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:22,359
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

8
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:25,320
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,198
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

10
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:30,575
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

11
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:32,994
- Family, too...
- Is that your mom again?

12
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:35,205
- If you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help.

13
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,208
Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,795
you're not going anywhere.

15
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:46,501
<i>When you have to get information
about an enemy position,</i>

16
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:47,964
<i>you have a choice.</i>

17
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:50,934
<i>You can watch from a distance...
slow and safe.</i>

18
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,857
<i>Or you can go inside
and take a look...</i>

19
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:56,927
<i>quick, but potentially fatal.</i>

20
00:00:58,102 --> 00:00:59,652
Mike, I'm just saying.

21
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,482
For you to go waltzing in there,
we don't have enough intel.

22
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:06,027
The people who burned me
got a specialized rifle for a sniper,

23
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:08,201
got him an access card
for this building,

24
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:10,464
and sent him to the conference room
on the fourth floor.

25
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:13,576
- That's a fair amount of intel.
- We don't know what he was doing there.

26
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:15,476
You might be walking into
a hornets' nest.

27
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:16,697
Chance I got to take.

28
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:18,540
What has he done
since he was last here?

29
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,334
Well, my fed buddy's
been tracking his credit card.

30
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:23,294
Your sniper's in Daytona,

31
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:25,247
hitting all the strip clubs.

32
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:26,381
I mean, Mike,

33
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,883
do you think he's blowing off steam
before he starts shooting?

34
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:31,010
- Could be.
- You sure you want to do this?

35
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,527
They killed someone for this badge, and
I went to a lot of trouble to steal it.

36
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:36,097
Shame not to use it.

37
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:15,513
Hey, Mike, what are
you seeing up there?

38
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:17,723
A mastermind petting a persian cat?

39
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:19,392
No, the floor's empty.

40
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:21,811
Empty? Why were they so hot
to get their sniper in there?

41
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,271
Who knows?

42
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:53,635
Hang on a sec.

43
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:56,646
<i>Most people think snipers
like to shoot from ledges.</i>

44
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:58,681
<i>The fact is,
the best sniper position</i>

45
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,184
<i>is inside a room
through an open window.</i>

46
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,920
<i>It hides the shooter,</i>

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,944
<i>masks the report
of a supersonic round,</i>

48
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:08,399
<i>and makes the muzzle flash
impossible to see.</i>

49
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,818
It's a sniper perch.

50
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:11,569
He's scouting a perch, Sam.

51
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:13,321
What's he gonna shoot at, Mike?

52
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:17,115
The nearest building is miles away,
and the freeway's not an issue.

53
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:22,922
I think I found his target.

54
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:34,884
Mike...

55
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:39,495
You better scoot. Your burn-notice lady
just showed up.

56
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:43,351
Burn-notice lady?
Yeah, your overseer,

57
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,782
boss, manager, whatever.
Get out of there!

58
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:14,654
Good news, Mikey. I just planted
a tracker on Carla's bike.

59
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:15,999
You had a tracker on you?

60
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,761
- "Always be prepared". Navy seal motto.
- That's boy scouts.

61
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:21,681
Are you gonna argue with the man who
just planted a tracker on your handler?

62
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:24,291
- Sam, I could kiss you.
- Get in line.

63
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:29,730
<i>Subbers in Black</i>

65
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:32,483
<b>www.subbers-in-black.com</b>

66
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,704
- Sam?
- Hey, Mikey.

67
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,217
To surveillance!

68
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,178
- Were you careful booking this place?
- Yeah, don't worry.

69
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:08,163
Carla's not gonna know
we're watching.

70
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:10,881
Costs a few bucks,
but we're clean. Trust me.

71
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:14,025
You gotta love it. When you tail someone
to a place that makes a good mojito.

72
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,028
- Where is she now?
- First chair all the way at the end.

73
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,494
Tell me about Carla.

74
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:26,287
She's got a hell of a breaststroke.

75
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,706
- The woman can swim. She's a machine.
- Good to know.

76
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,543
About the assassination she's planning?
Anything on that?

77
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:34,717
If the sniper's hitting
someone on the ferry,

78
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:37,647
you're gonna have to ask tall,
blonde, and evil down there

79
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,258
who the target is 'cause

80
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,719
there's no passenger list,
you buy a ticket on the day.

81
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,679
About security?

82
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,388
Not much at the hotel. I don't think
she wants to draw attention,

83
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:47,684
I've been working my sources
and checking on her room.

84
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:51,521
Did I mention that the drinks here
are just a little bit pricey?

85
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:53,523
That should do it.

86
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,269
You better not let Carla catch you
with that access card.

87
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,939
You may need it later.

88
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:02,156
<i>It's always a challenge
hiding something sensitive</i>

89
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:04,158
<i>that you might need quickly.</i>

90
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:08,168
<i>Any hiding place involves a trade-off
between security and access.</i>

91
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,998
<i>Hiding something in the sewer main
under your floor,</i>

92
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:13,793
<i>and it's secure,
but good luck getting to it.</i>

93
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,595
<i>Hide something in your sock drawer,</i>

94
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:18,358
<i>and it's easy to get to
but hard to secure.</i>

95
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,579
<i>The best hiding places are easy
to get to but tough to find.</i>

96
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:27,140
<i>The do-it-yourself versions are known
in the spy trade as "slicks".</i>

97
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,268
<i>Easy to slip something in,
easy to slide it out.</i>

98
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:34,886
Fiona.

99
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,870
And Campbell.

100
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,655
Good to see you again.

101
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:44,945
Got you a yogurt drink.

102
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:47,301
Fiona said you'd like it.

103
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,155
Thank you.

104
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:52,086
Is this a social call?

105
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:54,375
Oh, I think we've socialized
enough for one day.

106
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:58,087
It's purely business.

107
00:06:58,514 --> 00:06:59,286
Tell him.

108
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:01,912
Yesterday, a call came in
about a guy passed out on the street,

109
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:04,500
and my ambulance
was the first one on the scene.

110
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,346
It was crazy. I mean,
somebody had worked this guy over.

111
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:09,294
Took a lot of blows
to the stomach area.

112
00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:10,757
He was coughing up blood.

113
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,564
I'd say this guy's in real trouble.

114
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:15,852
I was kind of hoping maybe
you and Fiona could talk to him.

115
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:17,822
I know you guys help people.

116
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,534
Now is...

117
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:22,869
The timing couldn't be worse.

118
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:26,502
Michael, Campbell almost got fired
helping us with our last job.

119
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:29,160
It's okay, Fiona.
I know it's a lot to ask.

120
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,752
If Michael's too busy...

121
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:42,187
I'll handle it myself.

122
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:44,443
Fi, stop.

123
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:47,762
You shouldn't do this job alone.

124
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,045
- So you're saying you'll talk to him?
- Yes.

125
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:53,515
Oh, man, that is great.
Thanks, Mike.

126
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,514
I work for a company that does
private bodyguard work.

127
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:17,416
And a few weeks ago,
I met this guy Lesher.

128
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,594
Says he was a corporate headhunter.

129
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:21,464
He seemed like a good guy.

130
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:25,133
But when he started asking
about security procedures,

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,678
I got suspicious, and I stopped
returning his calls.

132
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,096
A few days later,

133
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:34,475
my best friend, a guy that I've known
since I was 10,

134
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:36,438
they said

135
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:38,437
he committed suicide.

136
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:40,722
I knew it wasn't true.

137
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:43,043
It didn't make any sense.

138
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:45,820
And then I got a call from Lesher.

139
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,241
And he said that more people
will die if I don't cooperate...

140
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:52,118
or if I call the police.

141
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:54,412
- They're planning a kidnapping.
- Yeah.

142
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,182
They're going after this

143
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,620
Venezuelan family, the Arroyos.

144
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:00,793
Oil money, I think.

145
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,503
Whenever they come to Miami,

146
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:05,631
they hire a bodyguard
for each of the family members.

147
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:07,592
You know who Lesher's
planning to take?

148
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:10,754
He wanted to know about
the guard for the daughter,

149
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:11,637
Isabella.

150
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,405
I told him I hadn't assigned
a team yet.

151
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:17,475
He wanted files on all
the guards, and I said no.

152
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:19,353
And that's when he worked me over.

153
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,490
He wants the personnel files
tomorrow.

154
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,192
The family...

155
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:25,818
They get here in a few days.

156
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,528
I don't know what to do.

157
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:30,098
I'm gonna need those files

158
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:33,201
and whatever else you have
on the Arroyo family.

159
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:39,819
I remember when kidnapping used
to be a mom-and-pop business.

160
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:43,489
Everything's going corporate
these days, Fi, even kidnapping.

161
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,006
Isabella

162
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:49,049
needs a new bodyguard.

163
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:50,660
Lucky me.

164
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,638
I guess I'll need
a company personnel file.

165
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,049
I can do that.

166
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,894
Give you a drinking problem,

167
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,768
some money issues,
ex-wife, couple kids.

168
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,592
You'll be the easiest target
to get leverage on.

169
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:05,024
Since when are you so enthusiastic
about doing paperwork?

170
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,068
I just want to do a good job.

171
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:08,653
You like him that much?

172
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:10,613
Campbell.

173
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,366
Yeah, maybe.

174
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,902
What do you think of him?

175
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,022
He's nice.

176
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,081
Listen...

177
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,288
I need to go over to my mom's
for this family thing.

178
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:24,858
I'll call you later.

179
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,018
Hey, Mike!
Come on in!

180
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:36,831
Why the celebration?

181
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:39,058
Nate's starting a limo company.

182
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:41,798
I figure, why should I drive
someone else's car

183
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:43,604
when I could just
drive my own, right?

184
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:46,983
A limo company?
Do you even have a car?

185
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:49,986
He does now!
I took a loan out on the house.

186
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:52,780
Okay, look, bro,
I know what you're thinking.

187
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,825
You let mom take a loan out
on the house?

188
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,743
He didn't let me do anything.
I wanted to help him.

189
00:10:57,903 --> 00:10:59,745
- Mom, what if...
- If he screws it up?

190
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,856
I'm just saying.
Nate!

191
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:05,668
No, I know what you were saying.
I deserve that.

192
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:07,278
Enjoy the champagne.

193
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,770
Nate worked really hard on this.

194
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:14,397
- Couldn't you support him a little?
- Mom,

195
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:17,513
given his track record,
if things go wrong...

196
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:19,557
Well, it's off to
a really good start, Michael.

197
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:21,600
Thanks a lot.

198
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:28,248
Guess I'll let myself out.

199
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:35,050
It's all right, Henry.
There's no one around.

200
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,986
Lesher called again.
He wants those files.

201
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:40,456
And you're going
to give them to him.

202
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:44,498
He's going to go through the files
and make you choose a guard for Isabella

203
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,126
- that he thinks he can control.
- And it's you?

204
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:49,045
How do you know he'll pick you?

205
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:51,273
I've kind of done this thing
before, Henry.

206
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,934
A recently divorced alcoholic
with money problems...

207
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:55,718
he'll open my file
and think it's Christmas.

208
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:58,495
- And then?
- Then I let slip some information

209
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:01,182
that convinces him this kidnapping
isn't worth the trouble.

210
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:03,349
- Is there anything I can do?
- Just play ball.

211
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,419
It's my job to make him
walk away from the game.

212
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:09,774
He looks a little jittery.

213
00:12:10,115 --> 00:12:11,845
You think he'll hold it together?

214
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,695
Fear is the greatest motivator.

215
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,505
I don't know about that.

216
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:18,582
Look at why you're doing this.

217
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,744
- What does that mean?
- Well, you wanted to protect me.

218
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:24,830
- What are you doing it for?
- I wanted to make Campbell happy.

219
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:31,837
Here we go.
That must be Lesher.

220
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:37,912
And the muscle.

221
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:44,472
He better go for it.

222
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:48,813
If I did all that paperwork for nothing,
I'm gonna shoot someone.

223
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,422
<i>When an operative recruits someone,</i>

224
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,337
<i>he lets the target
make the first move.</i>

225
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:02,319
<i>He'll dress like him,
drink like him, move like him,</i>

226
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,189
<i>but he won't talk to him.</i>

227
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,978
<i>He'll wait to be approached.</i>

228
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:08,948
I'm not saying
she deserved nothing, but half?

229
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,319
If I'd known we're gonna get divorced,
I'd have had her come to the office

230
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:14,469
and do half my job.
Know what I'm saying?

231
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:18,741
Besides, after I pay a lawyer
and get a new place,

232
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,311
what am I left with?

233
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,085
- Squat.
- Exactly.

234
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,224
You want to hear
a funny story about my divorce?

235
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:26,517
Sure.

236
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:27,812
Me too.

237
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:34,454
Another round.
On me.

238
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,944
To my friend at the end of the bar.

239
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm not asking for too much, okay?

240
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,794
Can I get you anithing else?

241
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:49,457
Well, just, you know, just come back.
That's all I'm asking, but...

242
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:55,838
Just a wife who doesn't just
get on my ass about, you know,

243
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,048
"stop drinking" all the time,

244
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:00,729
"come to church" all the time.

245
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:01,969
For Christ's sake.

246
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:04,726
You know, a decent job,
a decent paycheck...

247
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:06,223
is that too much to ask for?

248
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:09,185
So, you never told me.
What exactly do you do, Brad?

249
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:12,730
Special forces, you know,
officer... 15 years.

250
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:16,663
Now I carry a tennis bag
for a spoiled little rich girl.

251
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,770
I work for a bodyguard company.
It's a joke.

252
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,246
How about you?

253
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,916
Well, it's not too far
from your line of work.

254
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,243
I do security testing.

255
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:28,954
What a coincidence!
You ex-military?

256
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:30,915
I spent some time in the service.

257
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:33,486
You should really think about
coming into my side of the biz.

258
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,128
- Nah, it's all just b.s., you know?
- Think about it.

259
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:38,339
What kind of training
do they do at your company?

260
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:41,980
<i>When selling yourself as a traitor,
you can't be too eager.</i>

261
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,671
<i>A good op will walk away
from a recruitment</i>

262
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,347
<i>that seems to good to be true.</i>

263
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:49,917
That's confidential. Why are you
asking me these questions?

264
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:51,037
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:54,817
If I want to offer you a job,
I should just come out and say so.

266
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,495
I just think it's a shame
to see a man with your...

267
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,443
talents wasted on a job
that's beneath him.

268
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:01,195
If you're interested,

269
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:03,005
give me a call tomorrow.

270
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:11,749
<i>Surveillance is the leading cause
of weight gain among operatives.</i>

271
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,410
<i>In a job that's equal parts
boredom and tension,</i>

272
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,530
<i>eating is a way to pass time
and calm nerves.</i>

273
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,505
Whatever Carla's up to,
it's something big.

274
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,541
Lots of meetings, international types,
nobody we know.

275
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:24,859
If you want to get in her room,
now would be the time.

276
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:27,801
Sure, I'll just teleport myself
over there.

277
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,599
- Or do you have a better suggestion?
- You could use this master key.

278
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:33,071
I copied up
to the housekeeping manager.

279
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:35,598
The stuff I had to do to get that,
you don't even want to know.

280
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:38,268
Whatever you had to do,
it was worth it.

281
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:40,359
What's the security like
in Carla's room?

282
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,956
She's got a facial-recognition
computer at the door.

283
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,526
Anybody unauthorized
sets off an alarm.

284
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:47,198
That's the room-service guy.

285
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:49,076
He's authorized.

286
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:52,663
Call me if Carla makes a move and order
yourself some dessert. You earned it.

287
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,271
I'm all over it, buddy.

288
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:55,708
Doesn't have to be food?

289
00:15:58,203 --> 00:15:59,598
<i>Facial-recognition systems</i>

290
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:01,992
<i>are often used to replace
human guards</i>

291
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:05,862
<i>since they're cheap, they don't sleep,
and they can't be bribed.</i>

292
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:08,098
<i>They have a big weakness, though.</i>

293
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,680
<i>Unlike guards, computers
can't tell the difference</i>

294
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,869
<i>between a photocopy of a face
and a face.</i>

295
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:20,407
<i>When you search a spy's room,
you don't waste time checking the safe.</i>

296
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:23,694
<i>You have to assume
they're as creative as you are.</i>

297
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:27,656
<i>Slicks come in all shapes and sizes.</i>

298
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:43,404
Yeah, Sam.

299
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:45,878
Carla's meeting's wrapping up, Mike.
Time to go.

300
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:47,926
- Find anything?
- We hit the jackpot.

301
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:58,575
Looks like you found Carla's
whole file on this operation, Mikey.

302
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:01,446
Yeah, but the name of
the sniper's target is not in there.

303
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,817
Maybe the supreme overlords
haven't given it to her yet.

304
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:07,128
If you get it before Carla, that might
be enough to get you off the blacklist.

305
00:17:07,248 --> 00:17:08,220
Worth a try.

306
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,074
Well, there's some
familiar faces in here.

307
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:16,519
- You know who this is?
- No.

308
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,374
Maybe he's another operative.

309
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:20,000
I think we're getting close.

310
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:21,794
Well, I got to get back
to the hotel.

311
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll let you know
if she makes a move.

312
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,170
Thanks, Sam.

313
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:28,842
- Hey, go easy on the mojitos.
- They always go easy on me.

314
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,410
The Arroyo family arrived
in town yesterday.

315
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,583
You were right.

316
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,980
Lesher asked me to put you
on Isabella's security.

317
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,110
You're gonna take her from the house
to the country club.

318
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,732
Here's your key.

319
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:49,404
That's your car right out there.

320
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:53,742
You're doing fine, Henry.
Just try to relax.

321
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:55,817
Lesher's asking for a schedule.

322
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:58,706
And you're gonna give it to him.
You're gonna keep cooperating with him.

323
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:02,645
Lesher's gonna get
a whole lot of information

324
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:05,796
about Isabella's security tonight,
and he's not gonna like what he hears.

325
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:12,017
<i>There's an art to drinking
without getting drunk.</i>

326
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:14,648
<i>Start with a lot of ice
to dilute the alcohol.</i>

327
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:16,746
<i>Order a new round before you're done</i>

328
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:18,773
<i>so your half-full drink
gets taken away.</i>

329
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:20,443
<i>And, of course, spill.</i>

330
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:23,272
No worries. I got it.

331
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:25,607
You want to talk business,
let's talk business.

332
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,103
Yeah, we deal with high-end clients.

333
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,673
We're always looking
for good people...

334
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:31,826
like you.

335
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:34,853
I know your time's valuable, so...

336
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:38,854
I'll make it worth your while
to hear me out.

337
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,042
A thousand bucks.

338
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:47,352
Just for considering my offer.
Here's the deal, Brad.

339
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:50,059
If I'm gonna hire you,
I need to see you in action.

340
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:52,665
And I know it's against
regulations, but...

341
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,698
I'm in a bit of a bind here.

342
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:56,571
You got to work with me a little.

343
00:18:56,691 --> 00:19:00,142
Check me out tomorrow when
I drive little Miss Sunshine

344
00:19:00,302 --> 00:19:02,936
to her tennis match.
But be careful that you're not seen.

345
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,606
They always hire extra security.

346
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,816
Extra security aside from you?

347
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:11,375
They got two more guys
locked and loaded...

348
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:13,777
watchers watching the watchers.

349
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:16,116
Can you believe that?
For one girl.

350
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:19,411
- Two more cars. Seriously?
- See for yourself.

351
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:21,885
They got more money than sense.

352
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:24,291
- Another drink. Another drink?
- Why not?

353
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:25,667
Princess.

354
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:27,643
This job sounds good.

355
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:31,543
Hey, do you think you could
drop me off at the Hilton?

356
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:34,134
I got kicked out of...
you know, Amanda...

357
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:36,801
she kicked me out of staying there.
Can you...

358
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:38,180
Yeah, no problem.

359
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:47,018
<i>A cover I.D. that involves drinking
comes with a price.</i>

360
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,871
<i>But the tactical advantages
make the hangover worth it.</i>

361
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,492
How'd it go with Lesher?

362
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:02,830
Told him about the security,
and I got a bug in his car.

363
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:06,708
Time for a demonstration
of Isabella's air-tight detail.

364
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:09,962
Sam's in the Buick. Who's the other
member of our little team?

365
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:11,713
I was thinking about calling Nate.

366
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,437
I was hoping you could
monitor the bug from here.

367
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:15,424
Nate?

368
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,828
You're asking your brother
for help on the job?

369
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:19,798
I'm trying to be supportive.

370
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,576
Is that my last yogurt?

371
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:28,981
There's some tuna tahini
in the oven.

372
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:30,698
Your favorite.

373
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,254
Campbell made it.

374
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,865
He's so grateful
you're helping Henry.

375
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:40,492
You know me...
anything for Campbell.

376
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:43,468
By the way, you never told me
what you thought of him.

377
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:44,496
I told you.

378
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,729
No, he's nice.

379
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,709
I'm just gonna go out and pick up
some yogurt. Be right back.

380
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:56,758
Hello?

381
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:58,083
<i>Michael.</i>

382
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,178
Carla, so good to hear from you.

383
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:02,489
I got an interesting report today.

384
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,935
Someone used a key card to get
into a certain office building.

385
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:09,154
- <i>Know anything about that?</i>
- Key card?

386
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:11,023
All the key cards I had,
I gave to you.

387
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,524
Is that so?

388
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:15,499
But if I hear anything,
you're my first call.

389
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,491
Let me get a pen.
What's your number?

390
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,031
<i>Word of advice...</i>

391
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:22,687
there are things in the works
that are far, far over your head.

392
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:24,703
Stay out of them
or there will be consequences.

393
00:21:25,028 --> 00:21:27,278
You know me...
good little soldier.

394
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:29,156
<i>Good night, Michael.</i>

395
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:50,467
Mike, you want some of these?
They got plenty of them.

396
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:51,476
Mints, too.

397
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:54,608
I mean, they keep restocking the room.
It seems a shame to waste them.

398
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:58,088
So I tried to get ears on her
with the directional Mike,

399
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,630
but whenever they're out in
the open, it's just small talk.

400
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,453
She's good at what she does.

401
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:05,327
So she called you, huh?
Do you think she knows anything?

402
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,875
Maybe. Maybe not. It doesn't change
much. We still have to watch and learn.

403
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,509
At least she's locked down here.

404
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,903
Tight enough that I can borrow
you to be my extra bodyguard?

405
00:22:13,023 --> 00:22:14,503
Yeah, sure, if we make it quick.

406
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:17,273
I can get back before
she's done swimming.

407
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:20,634
At least try the shampoo, Mike.
It smells really good.

408
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,329
I got to be honest with you, bro.

409
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:27,437
I didn't expect you to call me
with a limo job.

410
00:22:27,557 --> 00:22:29,118
You didn't seem too hot on the idea.

411
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,308
As someone who has
lent you money in the past,

412
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:33,178
I was a little concerned.

413
00:22:33,973 --> 00:22:36,024
I'm not gonna screw this up.
I want you to know that.

414
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:38,092
I'm turning things around.

415
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:43,263
All right, I just drive up the street,
and then I look at you and some girl.

416
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:47,458
- You sure that's all you want me to do?
- That's it. Sit there and don't smile.

417
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:50,861
Not exactly what I expected
for my first job.

418
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:54,918
It's more important than taking
people to the airport. Trust me.

419
00:22:58,688 --> 00:22:59,838
You know what?

420
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm gonna frame this.

421
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:07,322
Well, maybe I'm gonna break this up into
smaller Bills and frame one of them.

422
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,099
Thanks, Mike.

423
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:14,512
<i>Operatives do a lot
of bodyguard work.</i>

424
00:23:14,632 --> 00:23:16,582
<i>On any given day,
the average commando</i>

425
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:19,192
<i>is more likely to be
watching a V.I.P. walk his dog</i>

426
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:21,759
<i>than engaging the enemy in battle.</i>

427
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:24,740
<i>Not glamorous, but part of the job.</i>

428
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,690
You're cute.
Do you speak Spanish?

429
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,258
Oh, no español.

430
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:35,075
Thanks for drive me.

431
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:36,842
No problem.

432
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:39,421
No... problemo.

433
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,501
So serious.

434
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:28,970
How was tennis?
Fine.

435
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:30,972
What's wrong?

436
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:33,763
I'm listening to the bug
in Lesher's car.

437
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:37,119
They were impressed
with the extra security,

438
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:39,689
but this is more than
a kidnapping for money. Listen.

439
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:42,080
- <i>It doesn't matter.</i>
- <i>Well, it does matter!</i>

440
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,936
<i>They got both sides
of the street covered!</i>

441
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:46,532
- <i>The plan was that...</i>
- <i>I know what the plan was!</i>

442
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:50,063
<i>But the people that paid for this job
have a multinational oil concession</i>

443
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:53,410
<i>riding on us getting that girl.
We have to find a way.</i>

444
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:56,806
Sounds like Lesher
needs a little more convincing.

445
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:58,625
- Michael, you don't have to...
- Fi...

446
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:01,127
we both know I have to.

447
00:25:03,797 --> 00:25:05,382
Did you see me in action today?

448
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:07,527
Yeah, I saw you.
Yeah, and how many others?

449
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:10,133
I mean, you could send
a Delta Force team after that kid,

450
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:12,283
and you wouldn't even
scratch her tennis racket.

451
00:25:12,403 --> 00:25:13,975
I mean, it's a waste of my time.

452
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,561
When can I start with you?

453
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,894
- We need to talk.
- Can we start talking about salary?

454
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:20,128
'cause if I'm gonna make a move,
I got to give notice.

455
00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:22,566
- Who's your friend?
- That's what this talk's about, my man.

456
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:24,772
What are you doing?

457
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:26,778
You want a new job?
I'll give you a new job.

458
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:29,900
- You're gonna help us take the girl.
- No, no, no.

459
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,908
Yes, yes, yes, yes, Brad!

460
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:33,535
You cashed my check.

461
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:37,074
How's that gonna look for your company?
Or to the cops?

462
00:25:37,194 --> 00:25:39,207
I own you, Brad.
You're mine.

463
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:42,669
- Oh, god! I can't do this.
- We just need the girl.

464
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:45,344
You need to get her away
from the other security team.

465
00:25:45,464 --> 00:25:46,970
You're gonna get her isolated,

466
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,925
hand her over to us,
and you can walk away.

467
00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:50,927
I can't do that.

468
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:58,132
You need to do as you're told, or
life's gonna get real short real quick

469
00:25:58,252 --> 00:26:00,187
for your ex and your kids
up in Orlando.

470
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:02,772
Now, do you understand me?

471
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,025
Yeah. I understand.

472
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,748
Thought you would.

473
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:17,913
Just hold still.

474
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,543
So, what's happening?
Lesher's gonna take Isabella?

475
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:24,981
I thought there was a plan.

476
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:29,046
This isn't just a snatch-and-grab
for kidnapping insurance.

477
00:26:29,773 --> 00:26:32,033
Someone's putting the pressure
on her father's oil business.

478
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:34,273
- There's a lot at stake.
- So that's it?

479
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,636
He's just gonna take her,
and there's nothing we can do?

480
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:40,060
It's trickier now, Henry, but I'm hoping
I can still get him to call it off.

481
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,220
How?

482
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:44,157
If Lesher thinks Michael's gonna
blow the job, go to the cops,

483
00:26:44,277 --> 00:26:46,735
then hopefully he'll decide
there's no way he can pull it off.

484
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,443
But he said he'd kill you.

485
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:52,309
I know. I just have to make him
believe that I don't care.

486
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:59,926
- Have you been drinking?
- A little. A little. I just...

487
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:01,831
I can't sleep, and...

488
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,995
with my divorce and now what's...

489
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:06,884
what's going on with this, it's...
I just can't take much more of it.

490
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:08,797
Would you shut up and pay attention?

491
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,162
I'm gonna be parked right there.

492
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:13,556
You bring her out of the club
5 minutes early, we'll grab her

493
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:15,845
- before the security team gets here.
- What if she runs?

494
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:18,181
She's not gonna run.
We're gonna drug her, all right?

495
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:20,232
Day after tomorrow,
she'll be out of the country.

496
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:23,684
Well, what about the other
security detail showing up early?

497
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:25,854
Just make sure they don't, Brad.

498
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:27,896
If anything happens...

499
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:30,110
I mean anything, you're dead.

500
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:34,938
<i>Anybody who runs a few assets</i>

501
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:37,634
<i>knows that some crack
under the pressure.</i>

502
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:40,264
<i>You have to be tough enough
to keep them in line,</i>

503
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:42,794
<i>supportive enough
to keep them stable.</i>

504
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:44,664
Let me help you with that.

505
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:47,293
I don't know if I can do it.

506
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,365
I just...

507
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:51,743
I don't think it's in me.

508
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:54,216
It's a piece of cake, man.
It's a piece of cake.

509
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:56,759
- No, no, I can't. You just...
- Brad!

510
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:59,368
Trust me.
This is not my thing.

511
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,225
Go home. Sober up.

512
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:06,729
You can do this.
Here's your top.

513
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,656
- Yeah, Sam?
- <i>Yeah, Mike, I got some news.</i>

514
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:20,327
You know how my FBI buddy was tracking
Carla's sniper, running his cards?

515
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:24,282
Well, the bar crawl is over.
He's back in town.

516
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,959
And our girl Carla has had a very busy
meeting schedule this morning,

517
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,919
Think the sniper's gonna do
his thing soon.

518
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:32,231
- Keep me posted.
- Will do.

519
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:34,716
And you better wrap up
this kidnapper business.

520
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:37,414
I'm trying, Sam.
I'm trying.

521
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:41,931
<i>When someone turns you into an asset,
their main weapon is fear.</i>

522
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:44,476
Is Brad the security guard
ready to change his life?

523
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:45,832
Just about.

524
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,646
<i>If you fear poverty
or exposure or death,</i>

525
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:50,416
<i>that's what they use against you.</i>

526
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:53,222
<i>Their worst nightmare, then,
is an asset with no fear.</i>

527
00:28:53,342 --> 00:28:54,692
Lesher, it's Brad.

528
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:56,511
Are you drunk?

529
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,751
Why are you calling me now?

530
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,902
It's 3:00 in the morning.
What the hell are you...

531
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,279
I'm not doing it.

532
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,371
I'm not helping you
kidnap that girl.

533
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:05,533
What?

534
00:29:05,998 --> 00:29:07,648
Brad, we went over this.

535
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:09,655
I couldn't sleep tonight.

536
00:29:11,391 --> 00:29:14,005
So I came down,
I started watching tv, and...

537
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:16,174
there was this Bible program on.

538
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:17,842
And it was like...

539
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:19,719
it was like they were
speaking to me.

540
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:22,514
And suddenly I realized

541
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,248
for the first time, you know?
I saw.

542
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:28,561
Wait.
What... the Bible?

543
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,276
They said this thing...

544
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:32,690
"as iron sharpens iron,"

545
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:35,804
so man sharpens another man."

546
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:38,324
And I realized,

547
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:41,304
Proverbs 27:17...

548
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:43,993
that's you and me.

549
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:48,061
You showed me the way.

550
00:29:48,181 --> 00:29:51,163
- Have you been drinking?
- No, I'm done with that.

551
00:29:51,283 --> 00:29:53,872
No more drinking.
No more hate.

552
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:57,635
You, guys at work,
my ex-wife...

553
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:00,677
you're all angels sent to test me.

554
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:02,753
What are you talking about?

555
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,522
The kidnapping...

556
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,851
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna help you kidnap that girl.

557
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:09,245
I see that.

558
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:11,527
Now.
It was all a test.

559
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,171
Brad, listen to me!

560
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,150
You breathe one word of this,
and you're dead.

561
00:30:15,462 --> 00:30:16,943
Don't you see I'm not afraid?

562
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:20,697
I'm not afraid anymore.
I'm not afraid of death.

563
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:22,684
I'm not afraid of anything.

564
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:23,754
I'm free.

565
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:27,495
We should meet.

566
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,323
Listen to me carefully, Brad.

567
00:30:38,443 --> 00:30:41,293
You're in this.
You're a part of this already.

568
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:42,868
If this gets out...

569
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:45,638
I will be punished.
I know. I accept that.

570
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,320
What is this?

571
00:30:48,975 --> 00:30:49,961
A confession?

572
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,325
It's my sins...
Our sins.

573
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:54,065
Like they say,

574
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,983
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death..."

575
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:59,816
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- "... I will fear no evil."

576
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,905
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me."

577
00:31:02,065 --> 00:31:03,789
You want to kill me, kill me.

578
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:05,972
Do it. Do it. I deserve it.
I deserve it.

579
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:08,994
And all these people will
bear witness to my sacrifice.

580
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:10,764
I am ready to be judged.

581
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:12,415
Forget it.

582
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,014
Forget it.

583
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:16,377
We call it off.

584
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:21,049
It was a test, all right?

585
00:31:21,955 --> 00:31:25,261
I'm an angel, I was testing you,
and you passed.

586
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:27,347
Just go home.

587
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:28,979
It's over.

588
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:46,591
<i>Blowing an operation
is a delicate business.</i>

589
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:49,582
<i>You have to convince your opponent
to abandon his plans,</i>

590
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:53,081
<i>make a case that the smart move
is to just pack up and go home.</i>

591
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,853
<i>Problem is, even when
you do your job well,</i>

592
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:58,628
<i>people don't always
go with the smart move.</i>

593
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,695
Lesher sent you to kill me,
didn't he?

594
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:08,564
Well, then, you need
to make a phone call.

595
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:10,110
You'll tell him you did the job,

596
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,642
but you got hurt and you
had to go to the hospital.

597
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:16,062
You're gonna spend time in your trunk.

598
00:32:16,223 --> 00:32:18,690
How does that sound?
Hold that thought.

599
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:23,171
Michael, it's Henry.
I just got a call from Lesher.

600
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:27,290
The kidnapping's on for this afternoon.
He made me assign a new security guard.

601
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:31,584
He's going to kill the guy,
and he wants me to help him.

602
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,402
I'm supposed to meet them
at the country club.

603
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,325
I get the guard
away from Isabella,

604
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:41,032
saying that there's...
there's a mix-up at headquarters,

605
00:32:41,152 --> 00:32:44,507
and then Lesher...
he drives up, he's gonna grab her

606
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,464
- while the other guy shoots the guard!
- I'm not gonna let that happen.

607
00:32:47,584 --> 00:32:48,901
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

608
00:32:49,021 --> 00:32:51,188
I'm supposed to meet him
in half an hour.

609
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:52,390
And you still will.

610
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,892
Henry, Lesher still has
to believe you're cooperating.

611
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,728
If you try anything right now,

612
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,480
he's got every reason to kill you
and no reason to keep you alive.

613
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:02,205
- I don't think I can.
- Yes, you can. Listen to me.

614
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,024
I'm gonna take care of this.

615
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:07,905
You just do what they say.
And when you see me, Henry, run.

616
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:10,074
Run... when I see you.

617
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:12,084
- When you see me.
- Okay.

618
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:18,041
You ready?
They're gonna be here soon.

619
00:33:18,183 --> 00:33:19,658
I still don't like this. I mean...

620
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:22,086
You don't have to like it.
You just have to do it.

621
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,095
She's here.

622
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:42,775
Who is that?

623
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:44,484
Oh, my god!

624
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:46,132
Oh, my god!

625
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,828
Get her inside now!

626
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:57,789
Okay. Go!

627
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:00,083
You thought you could kill me?

628
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:03,836
I gave you a chance to be redeemed!

629
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:06,380
But you turned your back!

630
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:11,469
These are your sins, Lesher,
here on this paper!

631
00:34:11,877 --> 00:34:13,641
Do you hear them coming?!

632
00:34:13,944 --> 00:34:18,139
They will find everything you've brought
to kidnap that poor girl!

633
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:21,160
And you will be judged!

634
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,513
I don't know what I would have done

635
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:40,183
if you hadn't responded
to that 911 call.

636
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:41,940
Thank you. Really.

637
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,320
They did all the heavy lifting,
so...

638
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:50,419
Well, whoever Lesher was working for
must have been pretty disappointed.

639
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:53,845
I heard he tripped and fell
on a knife last night in jail.

640
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:56,952
- He fell on a knife?
- You're safe, Henry.

641
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:58,975
But keep your mouth shut
about all of this.

642
00:35:00,102 --> 00:35:00,989
No problem.

643
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:03,583
The family's keeping
this really quiet.

644
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:05,813
They're really stepping up
the security.

645
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,874
Oh, Isabella...

646
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,945
she's been asking why
you're not around anymore.

647
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,219
- What do I tell her?
- Tell her Brad the security guard

648
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,389
had to take some time off
for some personal issues.

649
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:20,040
What do you think of Campbell?
You haven't told me.

650
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,510
Why is it so important what
I think about your boyfriend?

651
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:27,901
- 'cause I want you to like him.
- I'm happy that he makes you happy.

652
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:30,089
Give me a real answer, Michael.

653
00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:31,891
- Oh. Saved by the phone.
- Yeah, ma?

654
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:34,744
- <i>Michael, what is going on?</i>
- What do you mean? What's wrong?

655
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:37,180
<i>There are cops here, and they're
arresting your brother!</i>

656
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:40,823
Ma, I didn't do anything!
I swear! Tell him.

657
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:43,765
They said it's about
his limo company,

658
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:47,023
that it's some kind of a front
laundering money or something.

659
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:48,399
It's ridiculous!

660
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,942
Tell him not to say anything.

661
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,529
Michael, I got a call
from some woman.

662
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:57,482
And she said that...
that Nate is in serious trouble.

663
00:35:57,602 --> 00:35:59,068
I could lose my house.

664
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:01,996
And she said, Michael, to tell you

665
00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:04,123
<i>that you should stay out
of people's business.</i>

666
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:07,835
- Her name was Carla.
- I'm gonna call you back.

667
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,520
Sam, is Carla there?

668
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,486
Just about to call you, brother.
Something's up. She's on the move.

669
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:16,756
I need a ride.

670
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:34,759
Well, there's our mystery operative.

671
00:36:35,347 --> 00:36:36,942
Any idea what's going on, Sam?

672
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,742
No, she just checked out of the hotel
and came over here. That's it.

673
00:36:40,018 --> 00:36:42,912
Just say the word, Michael. I have
a nice rifle in the trunk of my car.

674
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:45,503
Tempting, but since
she's the only one

675
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:48,084
who knows what's going on,
I might want to keep her alive.

676
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,110
<i>There's a reason they call the spy trade
the hall of mirrors.</i>

677
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:55,851
<i>You can never know for sure</i>

678
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:58,629
<i>whether you're in control
or you're being played.</i>

679
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,722
<i>But if you do it long enough,
you learn to trust your instincts.</i>

680
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:13,860
- It's a setup.
- What?

681
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,945
- What are you saying?
- She knows we're here.

682
00:37:16,453 --> 00:37:18,821
She's gonna have her sniper
take his target out now.

683
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:20,998
She wants me here watching
when it happens.

684
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:24,912
- How can you be sure, Mike?
- I can't, but it's how I would do it.

685
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,208
Last ferry's in an hour.

686
00:37:29,368 --> 00:37:32,420
If I get home and get that access card,
I can get to the sniper before he shots.

687
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:35,717
Sounds good. I'll get to his house,
see if I can catch him there.

688
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,925
Still leaves me free to shoot Carla.

689
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:41,433
Just saying.

690
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,401
As soon as I leave, they'll be on me.
Can you?

691
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:44,974
Yes, I can.

692
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:02,700
<i>Unlike cars, motorcycles don't have
much of an aftermarket in stolen parts.</i>

693
00:38:03,903 --> 00:38:07,481
<i>So antitheft measures are outdated
and easy to get around.</i>

694
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:11,397
<i>The steering lock on a smaller bike
breaks fairly easily.</i>

695
00:38:11,533 --> 00:38:13,419
<i>Then it's just a matter
of getting away.</i>

696
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,232
<i>When you're tailed by multiple vehicles,
you're at a disadvantage.</i>

697
00:38:35,392 --> 00:38:38,642
<i>They can flank you,
take alternate routes, box you in.</i>

698
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:41,364
<i>It helps to have
a team of you're own.</i>

699
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,581
<i>The electronic stability program
was originally developed</i>

700
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:53,292
<i>to help keep cars
from sliding on icy roads.</i>

701
00:38:54,578 --> 00:38:57,195
<i>But it's a great tool
for the precision driver.</i>

702
00:38:57,315 --> 00:38:59,882
<i>When you need to slide,
you can simply turn it off...</i>

703
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:08,432
<i>... and turn it on again
when you need to maneuver.</i>

704
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:12,462
<i>A semi has about
4 feet of clearance under it.</i>

705
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:16,227
<i>Sliding beneath it on a motorcycle
is possible, but risky.</i>

706
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,393
<i>Too low, and the pavement
will grind you to a pulp.</i>

707
00:40:18,513 --> 00:40:21,714
<i>Too high, and any part of your body
that hits the trailer</i>

708
00:40:21,874 --> 00:40:23,799
<i>will no longer be part of your body.</i>

709
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:59,253
- Did you make it to the sniper's house?
- Yeah, I got some news, Mikey.

710
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,723
The sniper's dead.

711
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,214
Dead?
Why would anyone...

712
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:05,590
I don't know, but it's pretty nasty.

713
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:07,401
Something is very wrong.

714
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:08,999
I don't get what's going on.

715
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,806
They went to a lot of trouble
to put this guy in place.

716
00:41:11,966 --> 00:41:15,101
Slow down. Just tell me.
What happened, Sam? How?

717
00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:17,770
Someone booby-trapped
his front door, Mike.

718
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,980
They blew him up.
