1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:03,896
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:07,177
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:12,265
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.

4
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,812
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,269
- Where am I?
- Miami.

6
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:19,314
You do whatever work comes your way.

7
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,609
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

8
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:25,570
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,448
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the F.B.I....

10
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,826
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

11
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:32,035
Family, too...

12
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,245
Is that your mom again?

13
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:34,329
If you're desperate.

14
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,455
Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,458
Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,045
you're not going anywhere.

17
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:53,149
<i>Get your hands on any
classified document worth having,</i>

18
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,364
<i>chances are, it's going to be redacted,</i>

19
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:58,672
<i>which makes reading it a lot like
watching a movie on an airplane.</i>

20
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,006
<i>All the juicy parts are missing,
but you still get the basic idea.</i>

21
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:03,271
Anything good?

22
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:06,848
Hard to tell when you only get
every third word.

23
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,550
Well, are you surprised?

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,746
These are the people
who burned you, Michael.

25
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:14,410
You're lucky if you get any information
about their operatives.

26
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,592
Looks like Carla's cover in Kurdistan
was an irrigation consultant.

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,253
Maybe she could set something up
to water the ferns in my apartment...

28
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:25,824
when she's not threatening
your family or...

29
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:27,547
forcing you to run black ops.

30
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,009
I'll be sure to ask her.

31
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:30,623
Cheer up.

32
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:32,637
It's a start, isn't it?

33
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:33,646
Yeah.

34
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:37,684
There's a decent chance she's using
a similar cover here in Miami.

35
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:40,830
<i>Jobs in agriculture
are a convenient cover.</i>

36
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,003
<i>Makes it easy to explain your presence
in the field and the boardroom.</i>

37
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:45,493
<i>The only downside is</i>

38
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:48,318
<i>you might have to become
an expert on chickpeas.</i>

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,629
Why don't you put that away?
Give it a couple hours.

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,150
You, uh...

41
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,577
you might see something
that you missed,

42
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,041
like a tail.

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,374
Lincoln town car
up the street.

44
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,878
I saw them before
we left my place.

45
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:08,392
Do you think it's them?

46
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,311
Could be.

47
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:12,177
It's gonna be a very interesting conversation

48
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:14,846
if they catch you with that file.
Can I watch?

49
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,970
You drive.

50
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:28,211
<i>You can tell a lot about
who's following you</i>

51
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,652
<i>by the maneuvers they use.</i>

52
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,865
<i>Quick, evasive driving,
a casual bailout,</i>

53
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:35,306
<i>feigning car trouble...</i>

54
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:38,476
<i>these are signs you're dealing
with a professional.</i>

55
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:41,849
<i>Smashing into a rickshaw
like a crash-test dummy...</i>

56
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:44,125
<i>that's a sign you're dealing
with an amateur.</i>

57
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:45,884
<i>Someone who doesn't know
what he's doing.</i>

58
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:47,538
Easy, easy, bro!

59
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,801
Come on, it's a rental, man!

60
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,092
<i>NATE
THE BROTHER</i>

61
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,932
<i>That's when you've
really got a problem.</i>

62
00:02:58,174 --> 00:03:00,764
- Is it safe here ?
- As safe as it can be.

63
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:02,597
You want to tell me
what you were doing?

64
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:04,450
Well, I was following you,

65
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,481
just making sure
you weren't followed.

66
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,232
Don't look at me
like I'm crazy, all right?

67
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:12,820
The last time I saw you,
you were being chased by guys with guns.

68
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:15,472
And, by the way, I never got so much
as a phone call from you

69
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,216
to let me know
that things were cool.

70
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:19,629
- And I guess you called mom.
- Mom called me.

71
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:22,711
I just figured you wouldn't leave me
twisting in the wind in Fort Lauderdale

72
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:24,374
after I risked my ass for you.

73
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,224
It was just a little unclear at the time,

74
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:27,708
whether I should...

75
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:28,586
call you.

76
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:31,922
I'm not here to talk about that.
I got a friend at work who's in trouble.

77
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:32,757
Work?

78
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:35,514
Yeah, I got a job.
Driving for a limo company.

79
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:38,012
A real job, an actual job?

80
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:39,353
I'm friends with the receptionist,

81
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:42,016
and she's in trouble
with some Russian mafia guys.

82
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:44,894
They're holding her sister.
I was hoping you could help out.

83
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:46,579
What's the angle?

84
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:50,968
There's got to be an angle?

85
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:52,485
There's always an angle, Nate.

86
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:55,113
Are you trying to get money from her,
you're trying to sleep with her?

87
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:57,448
Maybe I'm just changing my life.
Did you think of that?

88
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,701
You blew up my truck, right?
You got me shot at.

89
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:03,271
You had me hide mom.

90
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:06,708
That's the kind of thing that gets a guy
to step back and make a few changes.

91
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,495
And, by the way,
I'm still paying off that truck.

92
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,423
- It's like $600 a month.
- $200.

93
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,341
Well, $300, but you see
what I'm saying.

94
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,426
Look,

95
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,136
would you just talk to her?

96
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:20,866
Fine.

97
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,100
- Where is she?
- Mom's house.

98
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:34,402
- I don't need tea, ma.
- It's good. It's herbal.

99
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:38,531
- So, you're gonna help, right, Michael?
- That's what I'm here to find out.

100
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:40,856
Excuse me.

101
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:42,619
Uh, ma,

102
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:44,691
could you...

103
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:46,956
Ma.

104
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:50,752
I'll leave the three of you to talk...

105
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:51,722
alone...

106
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:54,172
without me.

107
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,658
It's all right.
Tell him, just like you told me.

108
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:00,970
My sister, Elena.

109
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,265
I've tried to bring her
to America for years.

110
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,434
One day, she writes to me,

111
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:08,269
says she found someone
to take her here.

112
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:10,855
I knew something is wrong...
is too good to be true.

113
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:12,273
She doesn't think.

114
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:14,473
She gives me a name, and I go.

115
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:17,111
It's this <i>Patsan</i> Ivan...
a gangster.

116
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:18,908
He brings people here
for money.

117
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,049
First, he wants $25,000, all I have.

118
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:27,166
I go to pick her up this week,
and now he wants $50,000 more.

119
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,165
Or you'll never see
your sister again.

120
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,459
And if you go to the police,
he'll kill her.

121
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:34,329
That's usually how
this kind of thing works.

122
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,801
How'd you get this?
He hit you?

123
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:41,552
Yes. After I attack him
with the... the bar.

124
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:44,347
You know, the metal bar
for taking out the nails?

125
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:46,307
- You hit him with a crowbar.
- Yes.

126
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,322
He's lucky.

127
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:50,004
His <i>okhrany</i> take me away
from him, hauled me away.

128
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:52,397
If they were not there,
I bite his finger off.

129
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:56,150
Katya asked me
to help her get a gun.

130
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,310
After I heard what her problem was,

131
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,240
I figured the best thing for her
and her sister would be talking to you.

132
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,368
Nate says you could help.
He says you do these things every day.

133
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:07,807
I don't do them every day,

134
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,164
but I'll see what I can do.

135
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:15,153
<i>KATYA
THE CLIENT</i>

136
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,002
Thanks. Just put that
on my friend's tab.

137
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,758
A crowbar?
That sounds like a handful.

138
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:31,787
Come to think of it,
I dated a few Ukrainians in my day.

139
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:33,811
- Feisty.
- Fi's doing the surveillance.

140
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:36,481
Hopefully, we'll track the guy
back to where the girls are

141
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:39,082
before Katya gets her hands
on a blowtorch.

142
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:44,657
- How's it going with the file on Carla?
- Pretty good.

143
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:47,866
Talked to a guy named Harvey Gunderson.
He's the secretary-treasurer

144
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:51,518
of the agricultural association of
South Florida, among other things.

145
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:55,043
So, if Carla is still using
agricultural specialist as a cover,

146
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:56,889
chances are pretty good
that he's heard of her.

147
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,940
Nice work, Sam.
Just keep it quiet, all right?

148
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,204
Can't have this getting back
to Carla.

149
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:02,957
Quiet's my specialty, Mike.

150
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:04,510
Hey, what's your budget on this?

151
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,058
You know, I'm thinking
it should be face-to-face with Harvey,

152
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,827
you know, so I can
thoroughly debrief him.

153
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:11,100
I'll cover it, Sam.

154
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,410
I'll try and keep it
reasonable.

155
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,003
Who is she?

156
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,624
Someone I work with.
She's gonna tail Ivan.

157
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:25,114
Hopefully, he'll lead us
to where your sister is.

158
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:27,769
Uh, he's there.
That is his van.

159
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:31,746
<i>IVAN
HUMAN TRAFFICKER</i>

160
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:35,593
Guy's got interesting tattoos.

161
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:38,753
Russian prison ink.
Each one means something.

162
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,684
Really?

163
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,505
- What's the spade for?
- It means he's a thief.

164
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,177
- Tiger means "enforcer."
- Yeah?

165
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:54,352
What about the skulls?
What are those for?

166
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,522
Mike, what do the skulls mean?

167
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,233
- It means murderer, Nate.
- Murderer?

168
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,902
He has my sister!
Why we just sit here?!

169
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:05,896
I won't let anything happen.

170
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:07,265
I promise.

171
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:26,134
<i>Cultivating intelligence assets
usually requires some wining and dining.</i>

172
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:30,615
<i>The more connected someone is...</i>

173
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,110
<i>the more they know...</i>

174
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,579
<i>the more they feel entitled
to a little special treatment.</i>

175
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:39,238
Another cocktail?

176
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,982
I think we're ready for
a bottle of something, don't you?

177
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:43,109
uh, I'm still working
on the scotch, thank you.

178
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,361
Okay, a bottle of scotch.
I'm kidding.

179
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:48,698
- '96, uh, Château Lafite.
- Excellent choice.

180
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:51,451
I know it's an excellent choice.
I made it.

181
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:54,288
I'll pick 'em, you bring 'em.

182
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,547
Mmm, it's a hell of a wine.
You're gonna love it.

183
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:58,707
So, anyway,

184
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,961
You're thinking of growing hops in...
Turkey, is it?

185
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:03,369
Yeah, outside Ankara.

186
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:05,011
hey, um, so, Harvey,

187
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,892
were you able to put together that list
of irrigation specialists?

188
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:10,595
You know, I need to make a few calls
and work some things out.

189
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:12,917
I was thinking about it... You don't want to
waste time going through a bunch of names.

190
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:14,557
I can point you
some top flight people.

191
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:16,067
But you know what?

192
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:18,688
Maybe you and I can take them
to dinner together,

193
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,021
so you can get to know them,
that's all.

194
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:21,819
Oh, oh, great idea.

195
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:23,335
Yeah, yeah, but,

196
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,971
you know, I really need
that list, Harvey,

197
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:27,192
just to make sure I got
all the bases covered.

198
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:30,090
<i>Smart operatives know how</i>

199
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,908
<i>towards the information they need.</i>

200
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,035
You know what you really need, Sam?

201
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:35,828
<i>Clever assets,
on the other hand,</i>

202
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:38,169
<i>know how to make
the wine-and-dine phase</i>

203
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:39,968
<i>last as long as possible.</i>

204
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:41,443
The lobster.

205
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,009
No, I'm serious.
You ever had the lobster here?

206
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,631
Swimming off the coast of Maine,
four hours ago.

207
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,133
which reminds me, we should get
a bottle of white

208
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,391
if we're gonna have the seafood.
Montrachet grand cru.

209
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:54,612
Unbelievable.
It's liquid gold.

210
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:00,914
$600?

211
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:04,315
What can I say, Mike?
The guy ate like it was his last meal.

212
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:05,549
And the liquor... I mean,

213
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:08,280
I've had gunshot wounds hurt less
than this hangover.

214
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,656
You got, like, a bag of frozen peas
or something cold for my head?

215
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:12,949
Did you get the list?

216
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,787
600 bucks and no names?

217
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:20,331
Look, he's just trying
to drag it out, okay?

218
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:22,117
Don't worry.
I'm getting close.

219
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:24,015
Do you think he knows Carla?

220
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:27,399
As far as I can tell, he knows everyone
who's ever set foot on a farm

221
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,369
in the northern hemisphere.

222
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,620
How'd that thing with Ivan go?

223
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,664
Not as well as I was hoping.

224
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:35,769
I followed him all day.

225
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:39,433
It's pretty clear
he just collects the money,

226
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:42,186
stays away from the girls till it's over.
It's smart security.

227
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:44,146
If he has no contact with his guys,

228
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:45,940
no calls, no conversations,

229
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,110
then the cops can't make
a decent case,

230
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,695
and we can't find
the girls.

231
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:52,989
If we're gonna find the girls by friday,

232
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,491
we'll need to extract the information.
How about it, Sam?

233
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,837
Interrogation?
Well, it's...

234
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,581
It's been a while, Mikey, but,
you know, it's just like riding a bike.

235
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,709
If we can snatch him by this afternoon,
we'll have three days to work on him.

236
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:07,503
That's cutting it close. I mean,
maybe if we hit the ground running,

237
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:09,088
make him think he's up
against the big boys

238
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:10,673
you know, the government types.

239
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,300
We don't have
a deep bench here.

240
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:15,052
I don't know. I think we can do it.

241
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:17,388
Fi grabs the guy.
She's the extraction team.

242
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,172
You and me tag-team the guy
on the questions.

243
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,183
We do the sunglasses, the suit,
the whole bit,

244
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:24,145
make him think he's up against
every agency with initials.

245
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:26,397
You think you can bag him alone, Fi?

246
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:51,047
I like your taste.

247
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,550
Thank you.

248
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:57,511
I am Ivan.

249
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,863
<i>Stun guns are a great way

250
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:19,033
<i>The only problem is,

251
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:21,160
<i>who's touching you,

252
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,788
You brought a toy.
You want to play.

253
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:26,315
I love to play.

254
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:35,580
Fi, you are one crazy chick.

255
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,038
How's our friend Ivan behaving?

256
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:49,508
Like an altar boy.

257
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,833
He even asked me to use
the stun gun on him again.

258
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,985
He asked you with a gag in his mouth?

259
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:56,904
Oh, he has expressive eyes.

260
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:58,672
Feeling better?

261
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,368
Everyone could use a few thousand volts
from time to time... It clears the mind.

262
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:04,912
All righty.

263
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:06,829
I got a pal in organized crime.

264
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,994
Ran down everything he had
on this Ivan character.

265
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:11,292
Whew, he's a hard rock
from the motherland.

266
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,754
And what brings him
to these fair shores?

267
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:16,441
They got him linked up to what
they think is a Russian syndicate

268
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,585
active on the East Coast,
pretty much from here to New York.

269
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:22,346
Now, the guy who handles the day-to-day
operations in Miami, guy named Takarov.

270
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:23,802
But this guy, Ivan,

271
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:26,223
he's seen the inside of every prison
from Moscow to Minsk,

272
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:27,974
so I think the best approach here is,

273
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:29,150
we know everything,

274
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,656
we're rolling up his whole gang,
and he's just a little fish.

275
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:33,357
You're the expert, Sam.
What else?

276
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:35,177
Good news.

277
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,775
I found the perfect place
for our secret facility.

278
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,645
It's an old concrete plant
in the middle of nowhere.

279
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,560
They condemned it
after the last hurricane.

280
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,530
This is gonna be fun, Mike.

281
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:47,448
<i>A lot of people's first instinct when
they need information out of a captive</i>

282
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,818
<i>is to grab a baseball bat or a gun.</i>

283
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:51,911
This works.

284
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:55,240
I've been in plenty of secret facilities
a lot less impressive than this.

285
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,796
you get a cooler, a drink,
some snacks...

286
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,717
Fi's driving Ivan to
the Everglades and back.

287
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:02,636
- Is that enough time?
- Plenty.

288
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:07,427
<i>The fact is, torture is
for sadists and thugs.</i>

289
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,708
<i>It's like getting groceries
with a flamethrower.</i>

290
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:12,178
<i>It doesn't work, and it makes a mess.</i>

291
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:16,250
<i>Getting useful information</i>
<i>is about creating a new reality</i>

292
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,003
<i>for the interrogation subject

293
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,645

294
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:23,915
<i>How they eat,</i>

295
00:14:24,435 --> 00:14:25,785
<i>where they sleep,</i>

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,050
<i>even whether it's day or night.</i>

297
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:31,259
<i>When it's time to ask questions,</i>

298
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:33,594
<i>you want them disoriented, anxious,</i>

299
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:36,504
<i>wondering who you are
and what you can do to them.</i>

300
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,372
<i>you have to make them understand</i>

301
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:47,264
<i>that their entire future,
their hopes, their dreams,</i>

302
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:50,051
<i>every breath they will ever take
from then on,</i>

303
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,977
<i>it all depends on one thing...</i>

304
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:53,535
<i>Talking.</i>

305
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:54,811
Hello, Ivan.

306
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:57,874
I want a lawyer now.

307
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:00,652
I know my rights!

308
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:02,988
You have to get me a lawyer now!

309
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:04,744
That would be true...

310
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:05,950
if I was a cop.

311
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:08,922
Who are you?

312
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:10,595
C.I.A.?

313
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:11,744
C-I what?

314
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,697
No, no, see, they're only allowed
to operate on foreign soil, so...

315
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,661
just think of me as uncle.

316
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,549
Uncle Sam.

317
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,759
Do I get a phone call, uncle?

318
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,683
You get whatever you want...

319
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:26,887
after I get what I want.

320
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:27,972
What do you want?

321
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:30,409
I want to get to know you better.

322
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,924
I want to know all about
a day in the life of Ivan.

323
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:35,767
Where do you go?

324
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:36,933
What do you do?

325
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:38,816
Just think of me
as your personal diary.

326
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:43,248
I deliver cheese, caviar, and sausage
to Russian markets and restaurants.

327
00:15:43,814 --> 00:15:44,989
Can I go now, uncle?

328
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:47,163
Don't waste my time, Ivan.

329
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,441
We know what you do.

330
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,369
We know who you are.

331
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:52,933
And you, sir...

332
00:15:53,824 --> 00:15:55,474
are just a little fish.

333
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:58,991
You know the difference
between big fish and little fish?

334
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,742
When big fish get caught,

335
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:02,612
they get cooked and eaten.

336
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,967
When little fish are caught,

337
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:07,322
They get thrown back
in the lake to swim away...

338
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:10,378
unless they piss off Mr. Fisherman.

339
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,311
I'm offering you a chance
to swim away, Ivan.

340
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:17,062
It's better for both of us, really,

341
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,760
'cause if you don't accept it,
whoo, boy,

342
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,708
it's a lot of paperwork for me

343
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:23,903
and a dark, little room for you.

344
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:26,935
It's not so bad.

345
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:30,104
I've been in nightclubs
darker than this.

346
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:32,995
Maybe I like it here.

347
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:36,665
Now, look, Mike,

348
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:40,433
we could send you back in there
as good cop, bad cop, whatever.

349
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,302
I don't know what good
it's gonna do.

350
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:44,838
I mean, this guy is gulag-tough.
I've seen the type.

351
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,473
Now, after a month, when
he's been in isolation so long,

352
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:48,996
he's howling at the moon, maybe.

353
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:50,292
We got three days, Sam.

354
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:54,308
Well, that's why I think our best bet
might be to have a friend inside.

355
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:56,936
They speak the same language,

356
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:59,088
someone to talk to,
confide in.

357
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,648
- Prison buddy?
- Yeah.

358
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:03,192
Now, look, I'd do it, Mikey,
but he knows me already.

359
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:05,818
Come on, it's not gonna be that bad.

360
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,624
We'll set up a cell
for the two of you,

361
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:09,406
bring your brother in.
He can play guard.

362
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:10,215
Nate?

363
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:13,264
Mike, give the kid a break.
I mean, we need a fresh face here.

364
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:16,872
I can't sell Ivan on a secret
C.I.A. compound run by one guy.

365
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:19,813
I got to get back to Harvey Gunderson
and see if he knows Carla.

366
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:21,794
I'm tap-dancing as fast as I can.

367
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:24,672
I'll call him.

368
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:27,578
So, wait a minute.

369
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,919
You go in the cell with Ivan,
and you make friends with the guy?

370
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,389
That's your plan?

371
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:37,184
If he knows what we want, he can lie,
hold out until the girls are gone.

372
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:41,901
We need him to think that I'm
on his side, that I'm safe to talk to.

373
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:46,181
Nate, these are for you.
Do what Sam tells you to do, all right?

374
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:47,800
Hey, I can handle it.

375
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,697
You just take care of you,
all right, bro?

376
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:53,882
<i>It's unfortunate but true that no makeup
can simulate blood and bruises</i>

377
00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:56,453
<i>well enough to stand up
to close observation.</i>

378
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:59,289
<i>So if your cover requires looking
like you've been beaten...</i>

379
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,458
<i>...you have to get beaten.</i>

380
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:16,229
Nate!

381
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:18,892
What? Just trying to be a team player.

382
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,594
Today is your lucky day, Ivan.

383
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:27,776
Got one of your boys in there
to keep you company.

384
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:31,238
<i>It can take a lifetime
to convince someone to trust you.</i>

385
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:32,614
You two play nice, now.

386
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:36,694
<i>It's much quicker to make them feel
like they need you to trust them.</i>

387
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,537
You have the face of a traitor.

388
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,747
What?

389
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:44,126
Who are you?

390
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,211
You talked.

391
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:50,036
- You don't know me.
- I kept quiet.

392
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,384
You, not a scratch.

393
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,471
Be careful what you say.

394
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,991
How much did they pay ?

395
00:18:59,111 --> 00:18:59,933
I am no traitor.

396
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:01,351
What did you tell them?

397
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:02,436
You piece of crap!

398
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:05,086
What did you tell them?

399
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:06,045
Nothing.

400
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:08,067
<i>A fight is one of the quickest ways</i>

401
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:10,861
<i>to tell if someone isn't
who they say they are.</i>

402
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:13,447
<i>If you say you're Russian</i>
<i>but fight like an American,</i>

403
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,650
<i>consider your cover blown,</i>

404
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:17,785
<i>which means you better know sambo,</i>

405
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:19,995
<i>the mixed martial art of Russia.</i>

406
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:25,084
<i>Of course, you also</i>
<i>have to win the fight.</i>

407
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:28,829
<i>A great cover I.D.
doesn't help much if you're dead.</i>

408
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,515
What did you tell them?

409
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:42,461
I told them...nothing!

410
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:46,518
- What did you tell them?!
- Nothing!

411
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:48,328
I swear it.

412
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,591
Good.

413
00:19:58,551 --> 00:19:59,451
Who are you?

414
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,289
Sergei Yablonovich.
I work up in Tampa.

415
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:05,469
You're Russian?

416
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,167
Born in Volvograd.

417
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:09,245
Raised in America.

418
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:12,923
You're Ivan Petrov.

419
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,556
You run the girls, right?

420
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,599
Who do you think gets
your shipments through customs?

421
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:26,420
They shut down the operation
in Tampa. It's done.

422
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:28,520
They're moving down here.

423
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,064
They're closing in.

424
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:31,358
How did they find you?

425
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:33,582
i was ambushed by a little <i>suka.</i>

426
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,613
They said they know about
Takarov's headquarters.

427
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:37,739
Did you tell them?

428
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:39,074
I said I told them nothing.

429
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:41,753
Then how do they know these things?!
They know when your deliveries are!

430
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,163
They know what kind
of vodka Takarov drinks!

431
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:45,581
Maybe they are watching!

432
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:47,741
Maybe they have someone in the deli...

433
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,711
or the café.
I don't know!

434
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:51,587
I kept quiet.

435
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:53,505
Yeah, make sure you stay that way.

436
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:07,737
So, if Mike's information was right,
that's probably the place.

437
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:10,355
I mean, there's not too many
Russian restaurants next to a café,

438
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:11,965
across from a deli.

439
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:19,949
Hi, Harvey.

440
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:21,921
How's it going, bud?

441
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,077
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I got the list.

442
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,706
I've got to tell you, i was hoping for
more than two names on it, though, but...

443
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:31,251
oh, well, I'm sure
they're the best, yeah.

444
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:33,722
Okay.

445
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:37,090
Yeah, sure.
I'll -- I'll see you then.

446
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:40,179
Another meeting.

447
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,637
He is working you.

448
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:45,786
I've gotten nuclear secrets out of
K.G.B. agents for less time and money.

449
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:49,206
Good thing my liver is flexible
because a lesser man would be dead.

450
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:51,271
Okay, where did we get
a thermal camera?

451
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:52,856
I borrowed it

452
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:54,631
from my neighbor's boat.

453
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:57,538
He's been using it to peek at me
through the walls in my apartment,

454
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:59,171
so I figure we're even.

455
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,300
<i>A thermal camera</i>
<i>is a great tool for scouting.</i>

456
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,319
<i>It'll tell you where the warm bodies
are in a building</i>

457
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:08,783
<i>or which rooms are designed</i>
<i>to make those bodies invisible.</i>

458
00:22:09,123 --> 00:22:10,457
Top floor is heat-shielded.

459
00:22:15,353 --> 00:22:17,803
See the guy in the corner?
That's him.

460
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,091
Takarov.

461
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:22,394
<i>TAKAROV
THE BOSS</i>

462
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,638
He runs half the Russian mafia
in South Florida.

463
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:29,768
Looks like there's a little
business upstairs, too.

464
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:31,783
You ready?

465
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:48,120
Oh, my... Oh!
Oh, man, that's horrible!

466
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,829
Whoa! Get the manager!

467
00:22:50,126 --> 00:22:51,456
Somebody get the manager!

468
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:53,998
- What is problem, sir?
- Are you the manager?

469
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:56,014
I didn't think so.
Go get a manager.

470
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:58,017
Make him go away.

471
00:22:58,379 --> 00:22:59,829
You call that food?

472
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,842
Get the chef!

473
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:03,773
He's an imposter, the freak!

474
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:04,931
oh, there he is.

475
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,097
Mr. Manager, i got a big...
What?! Hello!

476
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,746
Hey, ho, I needed that.

477
00:23:11,011 --> 00:23:13,811
Get your hands off me.
I'm an American citizen.

478
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,064
<i>One issue in dealing</i>
<i>with modern criminal gangs</i>

479
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:19,734
<i>is that their operations</i>
<i>are diversified.</i>

480
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,917
<i>The heat shielding you hope is hiding
a human-smuggling operation...</i>

481
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:29,438
Sorry, I was looking
for the ladies' room.

482
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:33,331
<i>...could be hiding radio emissions
from software-pirating computers.</i>

483
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,796
We call it "customer service"!
Ah! Ah!

484
00:23:41,124 --> 00:23:43,518
You break my arm,
you're hearing from my lawyer!

485
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:45,688
Keep it up
I'll own this place!

486
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,733
Take your hands off my father!

487
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:51,224
He has...dementia.

488
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:53,560
Do you understand?

489
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:55,645
Can't you see his mind is gone?

490
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:58,398
He doesn't even know
what he's saying.

491
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,211
Come on, daddy.

492
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:04,438
Daddy?

493
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:07,324
Bet you never thought
you'd hear me call you that.

494
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:18,729
It has been days now,
and all you do is talk!

495
00:24:19,062 --> 00:24:20,949
Katya, we're working on it, okay?

496
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:23,463
I know it's hard,
but you have to be patient.

497
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,718
And my sister...
How long does she have to be patient?

498
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:27,844
Take me to Ivan.

499
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,596
What do you want, Katya?

500
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:32,265
You want to hit Ivan with a wrench,
or you want your sister back?

501
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:34,799
'cause it's got to be one or the other.

502
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,520
And this place Romanov's --

503
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,356
Nate says that Ivan's boss is there.
Why don't we go there?

504
00:24:39,516 --> 00:24:43,527
I don't know what Nate told you,
but we have to stick to the plan.

505
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:47,322
My sister doesn't have time
for your plans.

506
00:24:47,632 --> 00:24:50,742
I'm going to them now
and trade myself for Elena.

507
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:52,863
Nate, you told her about Romanov's?

508
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:54,704
It's called "Need to know" for a reason.

509
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:57,727
I'll take care of it.

510
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,170
Katya?

511
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:03,244
Katya, hold up.

512
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:05,132
She's my sister.

513
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:06,142
I know,

514
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,149
and Michael's my brother.

515
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:11,523
And I can't stand that guy sometimes,
but he's good at what he does.

516
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,624
If he says that this is
the right thing to do,

517
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:15,686
then this is the right thing to do.

518
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,434
It's gonna be all right.

519
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:22,962
Just...

520
00:25:24,076 --> 00:25:25,485
Go and talk to him.

521
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:37,414
Nate, I was just in the hall,

522
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:39,958
and I heard what you said
about your brother.

523
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:41,751
That is so sweet.

524
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:44,880
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

525
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,361
Not that he'd do the same for me.

526
00:25:55,491 --> 00:26:00,003
<i>A good interrogator paints a picture
of the world outside for a detainee.</i>

527
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,939
<i>Whatever he's holding onto,</i>
<i>you take it away.</i>

528
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,758
<i>His organization... crumbling,</i>
<i>his friends... traitors,</i>

529
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:09,070
<i>his preaious information... useless.</i>

530
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,880
Gum?

531
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:16,995
Cinnamony.

532
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,300
Ivan, good news.

533
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:21,614
We're about to wrap this up.

534
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,497
Looks like
we won't need you much longer.

535
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:28,256
That's why you have me in this hole...
because you don't need me?

536
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:31,009
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.
I'm giving you a chance to come clean.

537
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:34,512
You know, we're moving
on Romanov's next week.

538
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:38,705
Great restaurant.
Try the borscht.

539
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:43,707
Look, the point is, if you want
to see daylight again,

540
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:47,317
you'll give me something useful.
And, hey, now would be the time.

541
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,100
Well, I can see you're on the fence.

542
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,523
So, I'm gonna give you some time
to consider your options.

543
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,744
You can wear the thinking bag.

544
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:07,473
And here's some thinking music!

545
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:18,371
- Is he tenderized yet?
- Oh, he's getting there.

546
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:21,850
Said he likes nightalubs,
so I thought I would oblige him.

547
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,282
So, I figure we let him stew in there
for another couple hours,

548
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:25,981
then put him back
into the cell with you.

549
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:29,608
He'll be nice and loopy
and happy to see his old friend Sergei.

550
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:32,457
Are you off to see
Harvey Gunderson again?

551
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:35,573
Mike, I underestimated him, that's all.
he's going down.

552
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:39,846
- "The best of Bulgarian disco"?
- Yeah. We'll save that for bedtime.

553
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:42,151
It'll peel the paint off the walls.

554
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,821
Wish me luck, fellas.

555
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:53,351
<i>Working an information source
is a delicate art.</i>

556
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:56,428
<i>Ideally, you can get all
the information you need</i>

557
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,221
<i>with kind words and free drinks.</i>

558
00:27:58,582 --> 00:28:00,432
- More wine?
- You betcha.

559
00:28:01,392 --> 00:28:04,410
<i>When drinks and good company</i>
<i>aren't enough, however,</i>

560
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,974
<i>a good operative
has to apply pressure,</i>

561
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:10,657
<i>and that means knowing
just what a source loves.</i>

562
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,005
So, um, Harvey...

563
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:16,488
just wondering about
that, uh, that list.

564
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:17,703
How's that going?

565
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:19,409
Great. I'm working on it.

566
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,037
There's a lot of agricultural experts
in Miami, believe me.

567
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:24,201
I'm making that list,
checking it twice.

568
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:26,249
Just want to make sure
I don't leave any names off.

569
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,501
Could we get some more
crab cakes here, please?

570
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:31,310
Sure, sure, in just a minute,
but first I want to ask you something.

571
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,880
Sure.

572
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,789
Do you like being secretary-treasurer

573
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:36,217
of the agricultural association
of South Florida?

574
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:38,636
nah, I'm trying to get back
to teaching high school.

575
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:44,334
Do I like it? What, are you kidding?
What are you talking about?

576
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:45,226
I love it.

577
00:28:45,386 --> 00:28:48,456
It's the largest agroeconomic trade
association east of the Mississippi,

578
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:51,078
and I'm two heartbeats away
from the presidency.

579
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:51,816
Why?

580
00:28:51,976 --> 00:28:54,539
'cause I think you're jerking me
around, Harvey.

581
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,696
I came to you asking
for a very simple list

582
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:58,436
of Miami agricultural specialists,

583
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:01,117
and you drank my wine and ate my food
and you gave me nothing!

584
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:04,287
You have no idea who
you're dealing with here, Harvey.

585
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:07,957
Do you know why I'm interested
in agriculture in central Turkey?

586
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:10,800
Let me tell you, I don't give
a rat's ass about growing hops, okay?

587
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,870
I care about opium poppies.
I'm with the D.E.A.!

588
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,708
D.E.A.?

589
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:19,595
One call to my buddies
at the department of agriculture

590
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:21,806
and let's just say they have
a little bit of influence

591
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,850
over who can be the president
of the board of soil scientists.

592
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,228
I mean, one day you're the chairman
of the Miami water resources board,

593
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:30,397
and the next day they won't even
let you in the front door.

594
00:29:30,557 --> 00:29:34,028
Now, I've seen the bad boys of
the U.S.D.A. destroy people, Harvey,

595
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,819
and believe me, it's not pretty.

596
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,627
No, wait. Please, please!
Don't go. Sit down.

597
00:29:45,154 --> 00:29:47,556
You'll have the list tomorrow.
I swear.

598
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:49,696
make sure I do.

599
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:55,048
Liquid gold.

600
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:57,208
Oh, yeah, it's the best.

601
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:02,761
They have you for hours
and still they don't touch you?

602
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:07,264
They asked me questions, then left me
in a room with a bag on my head.

603
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,644
I guess you're just lucky.

604
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:11,942
You want to say something, say it.

605
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,274
Every day they have new information!

606
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:15,664
I know.

607
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:17,682
The American...

608
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:20,224
he says they're moving on Romanov's.

609
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:22,866
Someone in your organization is talking.

610
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:24,050
They gave us up.

611
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,725
- If they know where the girls are...
- Impossible.

612
00:30:26,845 --> 00:30:29,247
No one knows where is
the safe house but me.

613
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:35,670
Ivan, if the Americans link
Takarov to the girls...

614
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:37,604
You think I'm stupid?

615
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,315
My men have orders.

616
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:43,553
If anyone but me comes to the safe house,
they kill the girls and leave.

617
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:46,347
If they don't hear from me
by friday, same thing.

618
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,808
Takarov has nothing to worry
about from me.

619
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:51,939
I'm sorry.

620
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,620
I should not have doubted you.

621
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,391
The American can ask whatever he wants.

622
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:15,244
So I got to tell Katya
that we did all this for nothing,

623
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:16,872
that her sister's gonna be killed?

624
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,180
- I'm not gonna let that happen.
- How?

625
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,490
What are you gonna do,
use your spy magic?

626
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,567
Come on, Ivan has got to be at the safe house by tomorrow,

627
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:25,937
or Elena's dead.

628
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:29,204
He can't be there because we've got him
in a box in a concrete plant.

629
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:31,274
He's going to have to escape.

630
00:31:31,775 --> 00:31:32,592
Escape?

631
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:35,896
- Are you serious?
- He's got to go to the girls himself.

632
00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:38,931
He's not gonna buy it
if we just let him go.

633
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:41,691
- That's crazy, man.
- Have you got a better idea, Nate?

634
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:43,691
Because we don't have
a lot of time here.

635
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:45,615
You asked for my help.
You want it or not?

636
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:49,110
If you want my help, we got to go
to the concrete plant and do this.

637
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,496
If you don't, tell Katya
to get ready for her sister's funeral.

638
00:31:59,082 --> 00:31:59,832
Okay.

639
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:02,851
I'll get my suit.

640
00:32:09,522 --> 00:32:13,034
- Michael, your brother is trying.
- Ma.

641
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:15,106
Please, you sent him off
to Fort Lauderdale

642
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:17,007
and left him there for weeks.

643
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:20,191
I mean, what is that,
some sort of covert-operations thing,

644
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:22,360
or is it just a lousy way
to treat your brother?

645
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,894
Ma, I've been living in a
storage container for two days.

646
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:26,312
maybe we can call it even.

647
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:28,982
Michael, it isn't just
about what you do.

648
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:31,369
It's about what you say, too.
He cares what you think...

649
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,871
more than you know.
Do you know what his first word was?

650
00:32:36,098 --> 00:32:37,000
It was "Michael."

651
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,295
It was "juice." I was there.
His first word was "juice."

652
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:42,203
He was looking right
at you when he said it.

653
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:43,752
you know what he meant.

654
00:32:43,872 --> 00:32:44,891
You were his hero.

655
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:46,646
I just don't want to get
into this right now.

656
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:50,388
Michael, please, look, I know
that Nate has had his problems.

657
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:52,931
But you know when it all first started

658
00:32:53,092 --> 00:32:55,973
and when he first got
into really serious trouble?

659
00:32:56,093 --> 00:32:57,478
It was right after you left.

660
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,231
Give him a chance.

661
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,394
What? What is wrong with you?
You can't stand still.

662
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:16,764
you heard them.

663
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:18,329
This is almost over.

664
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:19,828
And when they're done with us,

665
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:23,528
they're gonna throw us in some C.I.A.
hellhole for the rest of our lives.

666
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:26,591
If, by some miracle, they let us go,
we're gonna be dead anyway.

667
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:28,773
Dead?
What are you talking about?

668
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,736
What will Takarov think?

669
00:33:31,422 --> 00:33:33,180
He will hold us responsible!

670
00:33:33,772 --> 00:33:35,468
We will speak for each other!

671
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:38,610
I will tell him you were strong.
You kept your mouth shut.

672
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,011
Before he cuts your throat or after?

673
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:42,897
No, no, no, no,
we need to get out of here.

674
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:44,720
Listen, if we can get to the girls,

675
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,821
maybe grab them, move them,
show Takarov that we fought.

676
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:50,740
Escape? You are dreaming.

677
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,150
Can I trust you?

678
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:56,579
Can I trust you with my life ?

679
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:57,409
Yes.

680
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:02,293
They showed me a file
with surveillance photos.

681
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:06,005
Takarov... I swore I didn't know him.
They beat me, but I got this.

682
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:09,617
I can open the handcuffs.
We can overpower the guard.

683
00:34:09,737 --> 00:34:13,582
Maybe we get out, maybe we die.
But if we don't get out, we die anyway.

684
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:15,556
- Are you with me?
- Then what?

685
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:17,850
We don't even know what's
on the outside of that door.

686
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,479
Oh, I heard them talking.
It's not a real jail.

687
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:26,317
It's temporary. They're gonna
move us to a real prison.

688
00:34:27,284 --> 00:34:29,278
You have to decide now.
Now!

689
00:34:31,144 --> 00:34:32,683
He'll handcuff you to the wall.

690
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:35,785
You keep him busy. You distract him.
I'll take care of the lock.

691
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:37,620
- You understand?
- Sergei!

692
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,578
Understand?

693
00:34:38,698 --> 00:34:40,048
Da, I understand.

694
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:46,504
All right, let's go.
Feeling a little more talkative now?

695
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:48,818
You really think
you can do this to us?!

696
00:34:48,938 --> 00:34:49,675
Shut up.

697
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:51,340
We have people everywhere.

698
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,157
Doesn't matter who you are...
C.I.A., F.B.I., ...

699
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:56,681
we can find you and kill you
just the same.

700
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,892
You ever want to see the light
of day again, shut your face.

701
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:01,772
Let's go.

702
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,480
<i>One of the hardest things
to do in a fight</i>

703
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,022
<i>is to make it look like
you're trying to kill someone</i>

704
00:35:07,142 --> 00:35:08,609
<i>without doing permanent damage.</i>

705
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:13,031
<i>They don't teach any half moves
in combat training.</i>

706
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,960
<i>there are moves designed to kill
and maim as efficiently as possible.</i>

707
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:26,727
<i>If those are off limits,
one option is opening your fist</i>

708
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:28,337
<i>right before a punch lands.</i>

709
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:30,858
<i>Painful, but the force is distributed.</i>

710
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:34,301
<i>Another showy option</i>
<i>is a kick to the shoulder.</i>

711
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,414
<i>You might break a rib or two,</i>

712
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,598
<i>but if you aim right,
nobody's going to the morgue.</i>

713
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:45,533
Put it down!

714
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:47,221
I said drop it!

715
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:49,417
Don't. Don't kill me!

716
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:50,996
No, please!

717
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:00,567
Let's go.

718
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,334
- Where is the other one?
- Back there.

719
00:36:07,454 --> 00:36:08,527
I heard him begging.

720
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:11,964
After the beatings he gave me,
he deserved to die more slowly.

721
00:36:12,124 --> 00:36:13,846
We have to go to Romanov's.

722
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:16,758
What, and show up at Takarov's
empty-handed? No.

723
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:19,054
We got to show them we thought
of the organization first.

724
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:20,624
Where are the girls?

725
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:24,477
Ivan, we don't have time for this!
Where are the girls?!

726
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:27,525
They're in Hialeah.

727
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:28,918
I will show you.

728
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,665
- This is it?
- Yes.

729
00:36:56,785 --> 00:36:58,834
You think they've been here?
Does anything look different?

730
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:00,588
It's fine.
See the van?

731
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:03,238
It means the girls are still here.

732
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:07,518
- Where have you been?
- I'll tell you later.

733
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:10,184
- We need to move the girls now.
- What?

734
00:37:10,304 --> 00:37:12,483
- Who is he?
- This is Sergei. He's all right.

735
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:14,360
Now move! Go!

736
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:36,383
- We have to get them out of here.
- Do you have a place?

737
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:39,997
Yes. There is another safe house
that Takarov uses for guns.

738
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:41,804
How do you know the C.I.A.
isn't already there?

739
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:43,389
We can't use anyplace
they might know about.

740
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:45,183
Then where?
Where can we take them?

741
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:47,010
I got a place down by the docks.

742
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,705
No one knows about it but me.

743
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:50,475
You are sure it's safe?

744
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:51,496
You're right.

745
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:54,385
I should bring some of your guys,
take some guns along, just in case.

746
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:58,455
You go to Takarov's. You tell him
they might be moving on Romanov's.

747
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:00,156
Who knows?
We might come out heroes.

748
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:09,332
Sergei, I don't forget this.

749
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:11,945
I'm sure you won't, Ivan.

750
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:21,661
There's been a change of plans.

751
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:26,933
It's all over. Drop the gun.

752
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:39,001
It's all right. You're safe now.

753
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,903
<i>In the spy game,</i>

754
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:45,192
<i>you spend a lot of time getting
people to betray their own.</i>

755
00:38:45,312 --> 00:38:47,834
<i>Most do it for money.
Some do it for spite.</i>

756
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:49,956
<i>But the greatest achievement</i>

757
00:38:50,116 --> 00:38:52,455
<i>is to get a guy to turn</i>
<i>on his own people</i>

758
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:54,678
<i>because he thinks he's being loyal.</i>

759
00:38:54,798 --> 00:38:57,171
- You have to get out.
- What? What are you talking about?

760
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:59,664
They busted the operation in Tampa.
They're coming here next.

761
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:01,425
They had me and Sergei, but we escape.

762
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:04,929
What operation in Tampa?
We never had an operation in Tampa.

763
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,832
- But... but Sergei...

764
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:09,725
Who's Sergei?

765
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:11,235
He took the girls!

766
00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:13,645
He said he worked for you in Tampa!

767
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:15,919
it was the C.I.A.

768
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:18,025
They had us.

769
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:19,934
You talked to the C.I.A.?

770
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,881
You gave the girls to this Sergei,

771
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:26,367
and then you come here?

772
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,955
Take him upstairs.
Now!

773
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:36,852
Sam talked to the police by the affairs.

774
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:40,856
Sounds like Takarov was worried enough
to skip town with most of his crew.

775
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:43,912
Apparently, he headed north
because they found Ivan's body

776
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:45,624
in a dumpster in fort lauderdale.

777
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:47,346
A dumpster is too good for him.

778
00:39:48,072 --> 00:39:50,349
What my sister means say
is "Thank you."

779
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:51,436
Yeah.

780
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:56,363
How is your pain?

781
00:39:56,926 --> 00:39:59,233
Breathing's a little difficult.
Mike cracked three of my ribs.

782
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:04,087
but, you know,
it was a small price to pay.

783
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:08,096
I'm sorry I was angry.

784
00:40:08,758 --> 00:40:12,371
Nate said you know what to do...
always you were right.

785
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:15,082
this Nate?
Nate said that?

786
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:19,003
You wanted me to keep her at mom's.
I just said what I had to say.

787
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:23,989
Thank Nate, Katya.

788
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:26,402
i couldn't have done it
without him.

789
00:40:26,522 --> 00:40:27,803
And I'm not always right.

790
00:40:50,244 --> 00:40:54,038
$1,350, and all Sam got on Carla

791
00:40:54,158 --> 00:40:55,289
is a P.O. Box.

792
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:56,749
More than I had, Fi.

793
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:59,969
Besides, I don't think he could have
survived any more intelligence gathering.

794
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:02,669
Sam's liver can take a vacation
while we...

795
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,458
What do we do now?

796
00:41:06,578 --> 00:41:10,321
Now we watch. Someone's got
to pick up the mail sometime.

797
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:15,003
I hate surveillance.

798
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:22,698
<i>Intelligence-gathering</i>
<i>isn't all running around</i>

799
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:24,670
<i>with a gun and a spy camera.</i>

800
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,882
<i>when the operation demands it,</i>
<i>you get to sit in a hot car</i>

801
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:31,200
<i>with no air-conditioning</i>
<i>in downtown Miami.</i>
