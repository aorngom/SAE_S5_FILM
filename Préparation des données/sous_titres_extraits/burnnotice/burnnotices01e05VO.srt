00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,020
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,470
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,400
We got a burn notice.
You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,000
<i>When you're burned,
You've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,630
<i>no cash,no credit,
No job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,770
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
They decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,080
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,630
<i>you do whatever work
Comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,950
<i>you rely on anyone
Who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,850
<i>a trigger-happy
Ex-girlfriend...</i>

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,890
Should we shoot them?

12
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,570
<i>... an old friend who's
Informing on you to the FBI...</i>

13
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,120
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,040
<i>... Family,too...</i>

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,160
Is that your mom again?

16
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,770
<i>... If you're desperate.
someone needs your help.</i>

17
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,750
<i>bottom line... Until
You figure out who burned you,</i>

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,150
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,480
<i>there's a good reason covert
Operatives keep their work</i>

20
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,760
<i>a secret from their families.</i>

21
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,950
<i>once your family knows what
You do,you've got problems.</i>

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,790
<i>best case... they're scared.</i>

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,000
<i>worst case... They figure
They can get into trouble</i>

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,380
<i>and you'll get them out of it.</i>

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,740
Yeah. Mike,it's your brother.

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,950
Listen,uh,
I'm out at opa-locka airport,

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,820
And I got a situation.

28
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,020
I need you to come out and meet me.

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,880
I got to go.

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,010
Come on,man.

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,030
First you told me to leave,
And now you're gonna kill me?

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,900
That doesn't even
Make sense,all right?

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,110
I mean,it's gonna take you
Hours to deal with my body,

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,040
And then there's the cops.

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,980
Come on,man.

36
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,430
Come back,I shoot you in the face.

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,550
What the hell were you doing?

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,930
Working.

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,400
You're always on my ass
To get a job,so here...

40
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,370
I'm working.

41
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,160
Lying in a heap in an airport
Parking lot... How's that pay?

42
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,220
My buddy got into some
Trouble with some guys

43
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,380
And needed someone to talk to them.

44
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,930
I said I'd do it for a grand.

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,210
"some guys?" what guys?

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,530
Guys. I don't know.

47
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,910
Look,I'm just trying
To make a living here.

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,920
Besides,you have
No business giving me crap,bro.

49
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,830
You're driving around in my car.

50
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,690
<i>your car?</i>

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,780
Yeah,I busted ass for an entire
Summer working on this car.

52
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,270
Mom had no right
To give it to you.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,770
She said that dad wanted me
To have it.

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,120
Oh,okay.

55
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,890
So you bailed,

56
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,860
I take a double dose
Of dad's crap for years,

57
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,080
And you get the car... Yeah,that's fair.

58
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,410
Nate,is this your way
Of asking me

59
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,690
To help you with this job?

60
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,190
Is that what this is?

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,330
It's like you read minds,bro.

62
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,750
We work on this together,
You clean up your act.

63
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,330
Http://www.ragbear.com

64
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,320
If I don't help him with this job,

65
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,720
He's gonna get himself killed.

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,460
Oh,now he's decided
That the car is his.

67
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,920
I've never seen you this
Attached to anything,Michael.

68
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,320
If my dad left me this car,
It was for a good reason.

69
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,620
He wasn't the sort of guy
Who would just leave me this

70
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,030
Because he was feeling generous.

71
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,730
I almost lost a finger putting
In that air-filter case.

72
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,220
I don't think he did you any favors.

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,530
Yeah. Well,that was more his style.

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,060
Try it now.

75
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,910
Uh,check the ignition.

76
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,020
You know,you've got a bug in there.

77
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,930
A bug?

78
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,260
Under the dash.

79
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,840
Looks like Sam's work.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,150
Fi,you don't know it's Sam.

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,880
I know Sam's style.

82
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,400
I thought you had an arrangement...

83
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,160
He tells the feds what you're up to,

84
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,840
Tells you what the feds are up to?

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,120
I'll handle it.

86
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,790
No,no,no,no.
I'd be happy to take care of it.

87
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,400
There's nothing like
A smashed kneecap

88
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,290
To remind Sam
Who his friends are.

89
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,840
Don't say anything.
I know it's there.

90
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,350
They'll only hear
What I want them to hear.

91
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,950
Is that tradecraft,Michael?

92
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,510
Or just protecting your friend?

93
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,520
It's both,fi.

94
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,840
I got to get cleaned up.

95
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,120
Could you put this back
together and don't...

96
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,970
I'll... I'll behave.

97
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,320
Maybe.

98
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,440
I've worked airport
security for a year.

99
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,050
Log planes in and out,
deal with the cargo manifests.

100
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,560
So there's this family...
Lebanese,I think... the Zamars.

101
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,450
They're two brothers and a dad.

102
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,380
They run some kind of
import-export business.

103
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,950
So the thing is,
we became kind of friends.

104
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,990
They gave me some stuff.

105
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,820
Stuff? What kind of stuff?

106
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,820
Basketball tickets,some nice tequila,

107
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,110
Loaned me money a few times.

108
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,330
My... my wife's pregnant.

109
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,630
We're trying to get ready for the baby.

110
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,350
It's been hard.

111
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,750
I get it. You needed the money. Go on.

112
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,020
Anyway,I-I did them some favors.

113
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,190
I'd change the arrival
times on planes in the log.

114
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,600
It's against the rules,
but it seemed like little stuff.

115
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,000
Then,last week,they told me

116
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,800
They wanted me to leave
a flight off the log entirely,

117
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,190
And that's serious.

118
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,670
I-I didn't want to do it.

119
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,670
And I remembered... Nate told me

120
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,850
That you two had this kind
of business helping people.

121
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,050
Nate said we had
a business together...

122
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,380
The two of us,like a team?

123
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,640
Yeah.

124
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,750
Yeah,he said he was gonna
talk to the guys

125
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,840
And get them off my back.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,240
I saw how well that went.

127
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,430
They came to my house.

128
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,450
They threatened me,
threatened my wife.

129
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,230
I-I said I was gonna quit my job.

130
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,950
They said they were gonna
hurt me if I did.

131
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,400
I just want to give
the money back and walk away.

132
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,420
Can you just talk to them and...

133
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,510
It's a little late for that,jake.

134
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,810
I know I screwed up,okay?

135
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,890
I just don't want
my family to pay for it.

136
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,850
And my wife,she...

137
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,230
I'm barely hanging
on to her as it is,man.

138
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,010
I don't know what else to do.

139
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,290
Please.

140
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,760
I'll look into it.

141
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,620
Thanks.

142
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,050
I told your friend
I'd help him out. You happy?

143
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,690
You should be,too.
I'm hustling you work.

144
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,440
Yeah,it's almost like we're a team.

145
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,490
You want to get in the car?

146
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,010
Hey,about the car...
did mom show you dad's Will?

147
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,620
No,all I saw was an old pack of kools

148
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,570
And an unfinished to-do list.

149
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,590
Come on. You hated him.

150
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,120
I put up with his crap.
I rebuilt the car's engine.

151
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,480
I'll give you the distributor cap

152
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,430
If you agree we should find dad's Will.

153
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,470
Deal?

154
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,540
Mike,you been doing some
work on the charger?

155
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,420
There's enough grease
in here to lube a semi.

156
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,140
You know,these pants are new.

157
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,410
Yeah,Fi and I have been
doing a little work on it...

158
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,920
Exhaust,electrical.

159
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,620
Yeah?

160
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,810
Yeah.

161
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,790
What's wrong with it?

162
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,410
Just glitchy.

163
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,020
Glitchy? Yeah.

164
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,950
Well,glitchy i
s my specialty,Mike.

165
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,740
Really? Your specialty? Yeah.

166
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,620
Might take you up on that.
Thanks,Sam.

167
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,210
Here we go.

168
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,050
I've looked into these guys
a little bit for you.

169
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,370
That's Eli Zamar.
He runs the company.

170
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,570
Ari and Ilan are the sons.

171
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,860
Eli's the one that beat up Nate.

172
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,550
The name sounds Israeli,

173
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,830
But jake said they were lebanese.

174
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,780
Yeah,the business is registered there.

175
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,650
They got an office here,

176
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,620
And they got a hangar out
at the airport.

177
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,200
Now,this guy... Eli...  Mike,
I think he's had some training.

178
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,510
Every time he comes outside,
he does a perimeter scan.

179
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,720
You see that?

180
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,150
<i>in gathering intel,little
things can tell you a lot...</i>

181
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,530
<i>a topflight alarm system,</i>

182
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,640
<i>well-placed cameras
without blind spots,</i>

183
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,620
<i>paying attention
to strangers in the area.</i>

184
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,580
Uh-oh. Time to go.

185
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,730
<i>more aggressive
intelligence gathering</i>

186
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,280
<i>is more delicate.</i>

187
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,310
<i>but someone who knows what
to look for can find out a lot.</i>

188
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,290
Hey.

189
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,680
Is this hangar 12?

190
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,790
What you looking for?

191
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,210
Hangar 12. I think.

192
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,750
I met this guy at a club,

193
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,870
And he told me that
he had a private plane

194
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,260
And that he would take me up in it.

195
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,210
And I-I get here,

196
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,140
And it's nothing like
a regular airport.

197
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,970
No,this is a private airport.

198
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,250
I mean,this is hangar 12,

199
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,410
But it's not your friend's hangar 12.

200
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,230
God,what a jerk.

201
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,340
What's the problem?

202
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,700
No problem. Relax.

203
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,080
You have to leave.

204
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,980
You guys are working,huh?

205
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,760
You know,before I go,
do you guys have a bathroom?

206
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,230
I mean,I drove all the way out
here from south beach

207
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,010
And it looks like I have to go
all the way back and...

208
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,690
I'm sorry. You have to leave.

209
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,610
Hey.

210
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,070
You're the,uh,boss?

211
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,990
That's right.

212
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,920
I-I was just looking for a bathroom.

213
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,030
No bathroom.

214
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,120
Out.

215
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,140
Okay. Unh. God,I just need to pee.

216
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,310
<i>if you know what to look for,
a bunch of little things</i>

217
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,030
<i>can tell you everything
you need to know.</i>

218
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,620
Arms dealers. Great.

219
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,780
Heavy stuff,too.
That plane had new engines.

220
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,740
It could probably carry a few
.50-caliber machine guns,

221
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,940
Maybe even a small tank.

222
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,810
Probably shipping off
to some african war

223
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,580
Off limits to legit dealers.

224
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,350
You're sure? I mean,you saw guns?

225
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,060
Didn't need to.
know a gunrunner when I see one.

226
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,390
They're my people.

227
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,340
They ship in a special lubricant,

228
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,580
And the whole hangar smells like it.

229
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,760
Mmm! There it is!

230
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,030
No wonder I got my ass kicked.

231
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,020
Oh,you were lucky.

232
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,190
The old guy had a desert eagle
9 millimeter with combat grip.

233
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,520
Ex-mossad.

234
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,430
What do you mean?
Like Israeli spies?

235
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,580
Sure.

236
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,910
Every other retired
spook is an arms dealer.

237
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,510
Not a bad gig,
if you can stand the ex-spooks.

238
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,300
You should probably call your client.

239
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,140
So... so,what do I do,huh?

240
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,440
I mean,Inever saw anything
like that there.

241
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,180
No,of course not.

242
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,500
They're too smart
to keep anything around

243
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,150
That would get them busted.

244
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,120
Listen,jake,now that we know
what we're dealing with,

245
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,750
We can try to do something.

246
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,040
I should call the police.

247
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,350
I-I know I'm gonna get busted.

248
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,250
No,if you call the police,

249
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,080
The only crimes they'll find are yours,

250
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,030
And the zamars will know
you turned on them.

251
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,450
That's not good,jake.

252
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,280
Take a look at this.

253
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,170
This is how your job opened up.

254
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,320
The old security manager
died in a car accident.

255
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,140
All of his brakes just happened
to fail at the same time.

256
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,370
Jesus.

257
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,490
I can't believe this.

258
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,150
I went to a goddamn basketball
game with these people.

259
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,590
The seats weren't even that good.

260
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,370
Well,next time you accept a bribe,

261
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,660
I'd hold out for courtside seats.

262
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,030
Jake,focus.

263
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,510
We need to deal with the problem.

264
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,620
I'm sorry. I don't... what do I do?

265
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,010
Cooperate.

266
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,960
We need to get them busted
with the guns,

267
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,060
And they need to go down
in a way that's unrelated to you

268
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,970
So it looks like you had
nothing to do with it.

269
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,970
Get them busted with the guns.

270
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,020
But where are the guns?

271
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,680
That's what we're gonna go find out.

272
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,310
Mike,um,there's something
I want to talk to you about.

273
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,990
Yeah,Sam? What is it?

274
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,140
I know you've been pushing
hard on this burn notice,

275
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,990
Trying to get yourself off
the blacklist and all,

276
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,540
And I understand that,

277
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,200
But I'm getting a lot of pressure.

278
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,010
Pressure? What kind of pressure?

279
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,270
Well,you know,they...
they want me to give them more.

280
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,680
It's always more,but the thing is that...

281
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,120
Yeah,Sam?

282
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,200
Oh,hey,there they go.

283
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,900
Talk about this later.

284
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,000
<i>one cheap and effective
security measure</i>

285
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,970
<i>is working in an area
with low or no traffic.</i>

286
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,360
<i>anyone is a car is too obvious,</i>

287
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,640
<i>so you force any would-be
followers to get out and walk.</i>

288
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,430
They're in there somewhere.

289
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,230
Oh,Mikey,come on.
It's 10 square blocks.

290
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,670
My cardiovascular fitness
isn't what it used to be.

291
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,530
You never said
we were gonna be walking.

292
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,120
Rest frequently.
Drink plenty of fluids.

293
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,930
You'll be fine,Sam.

294
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,920
Okay. Where do I find fluids?

295
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,430
I'm telling you,
there's no one here.

296
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,780
Dad thought he saw someone.

297
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,200
This is stupid. There's no one.

298
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,420
But we have to check.

299
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,860
I'm getting my shoes dirty.

300
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,450
<i>fighting is something
you want to avoid.</i>

301
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,830
<i>once you fight someone,
he knows your face.</i>

302
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,260
There's nobody here.

303
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,250
Shut up.

304
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,100
<i>you kind of blow your cover</i>

305
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,210
<i>when you hit a guy
with a piece of rebar.</i>

306
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,200
<i>but when you have no choice...</i>

307
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,550
<i>rebar it is.</i>

308
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,770
Send that to china,you sons of bitches!

309
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,780
Go ahead and offshore that!

310
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,490
You know,they used
to have 30 union welders here

311
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,640
<i>and a foreman.
What are you doing?</i>

312
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,750
What the hell does
it look like I'm doing,Pal?

313
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm throwing crap at a warehouse!

314
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,160
Oh,you got a gun.
What are you... security?

315
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,800
Hey,go ahead,come on.

316
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,270
Shoot me. I'd thank you for it.

317
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,820
There's no jobs around here anyway.

318
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,460
You want to shoot him? Shoot him.

319
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,350
Let's go.

320
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,800
Oh,you don't want to shoot him?

321
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,680
Yeah,lovely.

322
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,520
Huh? Yeah,batter up,huh?

323
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,750
Oh,strike three!

324
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,610
You're laid off!

325
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,340
Yeah!

326
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,780
They're careful.

327
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,210
If we're gonna get them caught
on anything serious,

328
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,460
It's gonna take some more time.

329
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,700
Then I want melody out of here.

330
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,940
I mean,this was my mistake.

331
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,350
She shouldn't have to pay for it.

332
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,660
When the zamars ask
why your wife left town,

333
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,370
What are you gonna say?

334
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,580
They came to see me yesterday.

335
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,670
They got another shipment
going out soon.

336
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,930
They gave me more basketball tickets.

337
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,700
They're expecting my answer today.

338
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,830
What do I say?

339
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,610
Since they're probably
planning on killing you

340
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,980
If you say anything else,I'd suggest "yes."

341
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,740
Mike,I save your ass at the warehouse.

342
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,620
The least you could do is have
some decent beer in the fridge.

343
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,770
Next time you plan on saving my ass,

344
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,870
Tell me before I go to the store.

345
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,880
We still have to find out
where they keep their guns.

346
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,970
I think you're gonna have
to do the spy thing,Mike.

347
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,730
Make a new friend.

348
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,820
But I can't get an angle on this father.

349
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,970
I mean,his security drill is airtight.

350
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,260
What about the brothers?

351
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,210
The older brother's the same.

352
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,650
He goes to work. He goes home.
There's no way in.

353
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,550
Younger?

354
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,270
I talked to him in the hangar.

355
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,020
He's not so bright.

356
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,880
I could check him out.
Maybe you should bug his car.

357
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,020
Yeah,maybe I should.

358
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,380
I'll do the recon.
I'll see you guys around.

359
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,880
<i>when you want to turn
someone into an asset,</i>

360
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,220
<i>get him to betray
the people he loves,</i>

361
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,470
<i>you have to get to know him.</i>

362
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,190
This wine is warm.

363
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,110
This is very good wine.

364
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,140
You're supposed
to drink it a little warm.

365
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,340
Well,I like it colder.

366
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,940
Why did you spend $300
on a bottle of warm wine?

367
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,780
Did you speak to
your dad about that trip?

368
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,080
Yes. He said not this year.

369
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,210
How are we supposed to have a life

370
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,790
If he barely lets you do anything?

371
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,440
<i>you need to know
his frustrations.</i>

372
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,170
Who's coming?

373
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,020
<i>you need to know how
he spends his time and money.</i>

374
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,390
Paulie? What? He sucks.

375
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,110
<i>you need to understand
his hopes and dreams.</i>

376
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,340
Cover up a little bit.
Everybody is looking,okay?

377
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,280
Cover up a little bit.

378
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,560
Uh-huh.

379
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,260
Okay. Well,call me.

380
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,050
<i>tonight,
we'll go to the club.</i>

381
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,390
<i>we'll have a nice time
and no more talk about work.</i>

382
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,710
<i>okay,and then
we have to be home by 2:00</i>

383
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,500
<i>because you're
a 30-year-old guy with a curfew.</i>

384
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,180
<i>oh,come on.
Don't be like that.</i>

385
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,920
Ouch.

386
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,990
<i>Ari,I don't understand you.</i>

387
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,800
Hey,Mikey.

388
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,400
You read this guy's profile,
you're gonna kiss me.

389
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,710
I am not gonna kiss you,Sam.

390
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,490
Look,I'm not saying
I'm gonna like it.

391
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,070
I'm just saying
you're gonna kiss me.

392
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,950
It is that good.

393
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,360
All right.

394
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,020
Let's make you into an arms dealer.

395
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,470
<i>c-4 has a plastic sheen
and a putty like consistency.</i>

396
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,850
<i>if you need to counterfeit it,</i>

397
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,720
<i>the best thing
I've found is cake icing,</i>

398
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,150
<i>or fondant,as it is known
in the baking trade.</i>

399
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,020
Hey,how's the rest of the cover i.d.?

400
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,920
Pretty good. Got you a fake rolex.

401
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,090
Got a buddy who can rent us
an Aston Martin pretty cheap.

402
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,010
There's your business card.

403
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,870
"steve remington"? That's my name?

404
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,560
Yeah. I got to have some fun,Mike.

405
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,030
Oh,here we go.

406
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,180
Got you a list of Ari's favorite wines,

407
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,950
His position in the family business,

408
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,980
Favorite clubs,even
where he likes to vacation.

409
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,170
Nice work.

410
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,330
Are you done making
the fake plastic explosive?

411
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,790
Can I lick that?

412
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,770
Knock yourself out.

413
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,190
<i>if you need a moldable
explosive that makes a bang,</i>

414
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,070
<i>someone with fiona's skills can

415
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,230
<i>with spackle,petroleum jelly,</i>

416
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,790
<i>and a bunch of other things I
don't even want to know about.</i>

417
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,050
How's it coming, fi?

418
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,850
Dangerous.
Unstable.

419
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,750
Remind you of anyone?

420
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,950
Pack it up,
Put a detonator on it,

421
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,250
And make it look pretty.

422
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,050
We have to put
Our best foot forward.

423
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,550
I'll wrap it in a bow.

424
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,850
All right, I got to go
To my mom's place.

425
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,550
Sam.
Mike.

426
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,350
Fi, be good.

427
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,650
Hello, Michael.

428
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,150
Mom. Nate, you find
Dad's will yet?

429
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,150
No, not yet.

430
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,950
I didn't know you were arrested
So many times.

431
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,250
You know that dad kept notes?

432
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,650
Not surprised.

433
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,150
On paper, you're a bigger
Screw-up than me.

434
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,950
You stole more cars
By the time you were 12

435
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,150
Than I did my entire life.

436
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,650
Dad was never around.

437
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,150
You ever wonder how we got
To the store to get groceries

438
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,350
When dad was on a tear?

439
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,750
I'm gonna get
Some more files.

440
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,650
Mom, I need to borrow
Dad's cuff links

441
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,950
And his cigarette case.

442
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,650
Nate is tearing up
This house

443
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,050
Trying to find
Your dad's will.

444
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,850
This is gonna be
One more thing

445
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,050
You two
Are gonna fight about.

446
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,750
I'll give them back
In a few days.

447
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,150
I just need it
For the job, mom.

448
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,350
He's so angry about the car.
Why is it so important?

449
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,850
I think he just wants to know
What it means,

450
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,050
Why dad gave it to me.

451
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,550
Because he loved you.

452
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,450
He wanted you to have something
To remember him by.

453
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,450
Now, why is that
So complicated?

454
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,750
It's not complicated.

455
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,250
It just...
Doesn't sound like dad.

456
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,950
Excuse me.

457
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,650
Do you have the 2003
Fisher vineyards coach insignia

458
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,450
By the glass?

459
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,850
Not by the glass.
By the bottle.

460
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,850
What the hell?
I'll take the whole bottle.

461
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,650
Okay.

462
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,550
It's a good bottle.

463
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,450
For $300, it better be
A very good glass.

464
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,450
You know your wine.

465
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,250
A little.

466
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,050
Thank you.

467
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,050
Try this?

468
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,650
I'd love to.

469
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:02,950
A glass, please.

470
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,250
What's your name?
Steve Remington.

471
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,650
Steve, Ari Zamar.

472
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,250
Mmm.
I love it.

473
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,650
You want to join me?
I have a table.

474
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,650
Who are you with?

475
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,950
I'm with my girlfriend,
Debbie.

476
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,550
I don't want to impose.

477
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,550
No, no, no. Please.
Beautiful wine.

478
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,350
You can come join us
At the table. Come on.

479
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,650
Another glass, please.

480
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,150
Let's go.
Follow me.

481
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,750
<i>you ever meet someone, and it
Just seems to click instantly?</i>

482
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,150
<i>you like the same things,
Share the same opinions.</i>

483
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,350
<i>it seems like you've known them
All your life.</i>

484
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:41,950
<i>it could be fate,</i>

485
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,050
<i>or it could be that you have
A listening device</i>

486
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,750
<i>planted in the air-conditioning
Vent of your car.</i>

487
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,350
So there I am,
In the mountains of afghanistan,

488
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,350
And I don't speak a word
Of the dialect.

489
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,950
I got all this training,
I'm sent over there,

490
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,150
And I'm stuck
With a bunch of guys

491
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,750
From the wrong side
Of the country.

492
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,350
I love it.
I love it.

493
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,450
Excuse me. Excuse me.

494
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,250
Ah, it's just my brother.
So, what did you do?

495
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,550
Well, I tried like hell
To learn the language,

496
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,250
And I ate goat for a month.

497
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,350
Oh, I love it.

498
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,650
Afghanistan?
Are you serious?

499
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,450
That's crazy.
Why were you over here?

500
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,850
Business... this and that.

501
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,150
To miami.

502
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,650
Where the beautiful women
Are allowed to go outside.

503
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,050
<i>you'd be surprised
How often covert operatives</i>

504
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,550
<i>pose as international men
Of mystery.</i>

505
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,950
<i>fantasies about glamorous
Covert ops</i>

506
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,050
<i>can be extremely useful
To exploit,</i>

507
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,650
<i>though some secret-agent
Fantasies</i>

508
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,850
<i>are more useful than others.</i>

509
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,350
Now that we know each other,
I have a confession to make.

510
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,450
It's not a coincidence
That we met tonight.

511
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,150
I want to talk to you
About something, about work.

512
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,650
I do import-export...
Furniture, regional food,

513
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,750
Import the cigarettes.

514
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,950
Ari, we're adults here.

515
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,950
The fact is,
The people in my business know

516
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,850
About your family's operations,
And we respect it.

517
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,850
I'm listening.

518
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,750
We also know
That your father does not work

519
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,150
With anyone
Outside of the family.

520
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,250
Still,
Your name gets around.

521
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,950
We also hear about your brother.
He's a hard-ass.

522
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,250
Yeah, he's been
Calling me all night.

523
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,750
He's probably
On his way here now.

524
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,950
That's why I want to talk to you
About an opportunity.

525
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,550
What opportunity?

526
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,950
Why don't you mind
Your own business?

527
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,350
I don't want
To cause problems.

528
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,550
If you're not allowed
To talk about your family's...

529
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,050
No, no, no. I'm allowed
To do whatever I want.

530
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,150
It's just that my father
Is a little, you know...

531
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,150
Jesus.
Your father again?

532
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,150
I don't want to get
In the middle of this.

533
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,150
God, it's my brother.

534
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,850
Ari, where you been?

535
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,750
I called you
Three, four times.

536
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,150
I've been here.
What do you want?

537
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,050
Let's go.

538
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,350
I'm having fun.
Now.

539
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,650
Nice car.

540
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,150
I'm a little tired
Of it, actually.

541
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,250
I want to upgrade
To the new model.

542
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,550
Sorry about earlier.

543
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,350
My, uh, family
Is a little paranoid.

544
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,150
Comes with the territory.

545
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,150
So, tell me about the deal.

546
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,750
I was in town to do a deal
With some plastique...

547
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,050
Good stuff,
Military-grade...

548
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,450
But the contact fell through.

549
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,950
<i>anybody in the arms trade knows</i>

550
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,250
<i>that the mark of a pro
Is the blow and burn.</i>

551
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,550
<i>it's a detonator
On whatever you're selling</i>

552
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,750
<i>in case the deal goes bad.</i>

553
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,150
This is very high grade --

554
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,150
40% cheaper than what
You can get commercially

555
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,050
With all the same kick,
Of course.

556
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,750
I just need a distributor.

557
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:17,850
You get the buyers,

558
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,250
You could double
Your profits, Ari.

559
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,650
How do I know this is good?

560
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,850
Oh, it's very good stuff.

561
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,450
You want
A little demonstration?

562
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,650
Please.

563
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,850
Are we in business?

564
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,050
So, you gonna go see
Your new girlfriend?
Debbie?

565
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,850
She's not coming, no,
Which is good,

566
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,250
Because I think Ari
Is the jealous type.

567
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,550
Well, I can see
Why she likes you.

568
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,250
You look like
A secret agent.

569
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,450
Listen, Fi,
I just need Ari to show me

570
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,750
Where daddy keeps his guns.

571
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:14,850
We bring in the cops.

572
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,450
Everyone goes home happy
Except debbie.

573
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,150
Well, maybe you shouldn't
Be so hasty.

574
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:28,150
Imagine some south beach model
Hanging on your every word.

575
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,050
How many times
She call you?

576
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,450
Five.

577
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,750
Maybe she wants Ari
To do the deal.

578
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,250
She wants to trade up.

579
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,250
Admit it.

580
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,550
* you are tempted

581
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,250
Not for a minute, fi.

582
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,950
If I need a beautiful woman
To mess up my life...

583
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,450
I could do a lot better
Than debbie.

584
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,850
Oh, you know
Your chardonnay.

585
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:04,950
A little.

586
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,050
Don't be modest.

587
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,150
You should come to my place
In france.

588
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,550
They call it a château,

589
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,850
But really,
It's just a big house.

590
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,850
So about this deal...

591
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,250
I think we should start
With something small.

592
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,450
Okay.

593
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,450
In addition to the c-4,
I can get you...

594
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,250
Military-grade
.50-caliber machine guns.

595
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,250
.50-caliber?
Wow.

596
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,550
And then we can go bigger.

597
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,850
I just need to see
Your operation.

598
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,350
Oh, no, operation...
No, I can't do that.

599
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,150
My father would kill me.
Are you kidding me?

600
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,350
Ari, this is about trust.

601
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,250
I can't just give you a
.50-caliber machine gun to sell

602
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,750
Without knowing
What warehouse it's going to,

603
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,150
What transport
It's getting on.

604
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,250
I can't.
It's impossible.

605
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:47,950
You know what?
Forget it.

606
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,150
I'm going out on a limb here,
And you don't trust me.

607
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,550
No, I get that.
I understand, and that's fine.

608
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,050
It's just not
How I do business.

609
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,550
So thank you for your time.
I'll get the check.

610
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,050
Ah, sit, sit,
Sit, sit, sit.

611
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,550
I like you.
I like you.

612
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,850
Okay,
Meet me tomorrow night.

613
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,450
We'll see.

614
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,250
Okay?
Are you happy?

615
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,450
Very happy.

616
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,850
<i>I can do the deal
And then talk to Ilan and dad.</i>

617
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,550
<i>you can make
A lot of money.</i>

618
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,650
Okay, sounds like
He's gonna go for it.

619
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,750
Just goes to show you...

620
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,350
A car is a bad place
To have a conversation.

621
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,050
Mike, you know
I was gonna tell you.

622
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,250
What's that, Sam?

623
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,650
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
The bug in your car.

624
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,050
I thought
We had a deal, Sam.

625
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,250
Mike, we do.
I help you out.

626
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,050
I tell you what I know.

627
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,750
But they know
You got something.

628
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,950
They wanted me to bust
Into your place and search it.

629
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,350
I told them
I wouldn't do it,

630
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,550
So they made me plant a bug

631
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,050
And said if I told you,
They'd be all over us.

632
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,450
At least I tried
To make it obvious.

633
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,850
I mean, I practically signed
My name on the goddamn thing.

634
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,050
Oh, that you did, Sam.

635
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,050
Mikey, I'm with you,
But this FBI crap...

636
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,750
I'm grinding my teeth
At night.

637
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,750
It's bad
For my blood pressure.

638
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,450
So break into my place.

639
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,150
Yeah?
Search it.

640
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,050
These FBI guys
Don't know anything.

641
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,150
It might get the attention
Of someone useful.

642
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,450
I got to go.

643
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,450
Jake's meeting
With the zamars tonight,

644
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,050
So you should have
A couple of hours.

645
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,050
I would search
In the kitchen area.

646
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,350
Cabinets?
Sink.

647
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,050
Behind?
Under.
Don't break anything.

648
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,350
All right, then.

649
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,850
So, tomorrow,
You'll do this, huh?

650
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,950
You'll talk
To the customs people, yes?

651
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,050
Yeah.

652
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,650
Is there a problem?

653
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,850
N-no, there's no problem.

654
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,850
You need
Some motivation, huh?

655
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,150
Huh? Huh?

656
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,150
Ow!

657
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,650
Hey!

658
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,550
I'm sick and tired
Of waiting.

659
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,750
I have to be somewhere,
And this...

660
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,250
Get up.

661
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:47,950
Get up!

662
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,950
It's me.
You never answer my calls.

663
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,350
Where's Ari?

664
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,350
He's coming.

665
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,950
He's getting bitched out
By his dad or something.

666
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,050
I wanted to talk
To you alone.

667
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,750
How long are you in town?

668
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,050
Aren't you and Ari engaged?

669
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,650
Whatever.

670
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,450
Come on.
Can you have a little fun?

671
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,750
You've been
Around the world,

672
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,250
But you never talk
About a girlfriend.

673
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,650
I want to see...

674
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,550
Your gun.

675
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,950
Okay, that's not my gun.

676
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,950
Not my gun.

677
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,450
Debbie.
Get out of here.

678
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,950
Now I know your secret,
You son of a bitch.

679
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,150
Get in there!
Get in there!

680
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,750
Ari, calm down.

681
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,450
I don't know
What you think you know.

682
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,250
You lied to me!

683
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,250
<i>dealing with a blown cover
Is about stalling for time.</i>

684
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,650
<i>stay alive long enough
To figure out what they know</i>

685
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,150
<i>and tell a bigger lie
To save yourself.</i>

686
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,350
You lied to me
Since day one!

687
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,750
What is this secret
You're talking about?

688
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:12,850
You wanted debbie, huh?

689
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,650
You wanted debbie
From the beginning.

690
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,850
Debbie?
That's what you thought?

691
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,350
You were watching me
The whole time, weren't you?

692
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,450
You sent her over
To test me.

693
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,050
You wanted to see
How I handled the pressure.

694
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,950
Oh, that's good.

695
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,250
Oh, you are good.

696
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,050
So, what... did I pass?

697
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

698
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,850
Oh, your father
Trained you well, Ari.

699
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,750
Yeah.

700
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,250
So, I see the operation?

701
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,750
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

702
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,550
<i>riding in a car
With a blindfold on</i>

703
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,650
<i>takes some getting used to.</i>

704
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,250
<i>the good news is,
If the driver's busy</i>

705
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,150
<i>making sure
You can't see anything,</i>

706
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,550
<i>he's not paying attention
To whether he's being followed.</i>

707
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,200
I'll take you to the warehouse,
But if you screw me...

708
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,500
Why would I want to
Screw you?

709
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,100
I've got merchandise to sell.
You've got buyers.

710
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,300
It's that simple.

711
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,300
I just want to know
What I'm getting into.

712
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,200
Okay.

713
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,600
Okay.
Security is airtight.

714
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,700
The warehouse
Is not connected to us.

715
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,700
We keep the weapons there
Till we ship.

716
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,700
If the cops come,
They can't arrest anybody.

717
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,300
A dead drop.

718
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,400
So what if someone tries
To steal your merchandise?

719
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,800
Nobody knows where it is --
Just the family.

720
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,700
Out.

721
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,600
There.
Now you see the operation.

722
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,200
Not bad...

723
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,500
On the warehouse front.

724
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
What about security?

725
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,200
We have no problems
With cops.

726
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,500
We have cops
On the payroll.

727
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,200
They let us know
If there's a problem.

728
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,500
Great.
M1a .308.

729
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Nicely balanced.

730
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,100
Special forces.

731
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,800
Airport security?

732
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,800
We have a guy.
Reliable?

733
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah.

734
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
If not, we, uh --
How do they say? --

735
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,400
We liquidate him.

736
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,500
Fn p90 with halo sight.

737
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
State of the art... Very nice.

738
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,300
Looks like you have things
Wired here.

739
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,100
So, are we gonna do
Some business?

740
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,400
After we send out the shipment,
We'll make a deal.

741
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,700
You and I...
We put it together,

742
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,600
And then I take the deal
To my father.

743
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,900
Trust me.

744
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,400
You're doing him a favor.

745
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Shall we?

746
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You want me
To talk to them again?

747
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,700
They'll kill me.

748
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,500
You see what they did.

749
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,800
I thought the plan was to find
The guns and call the cops.

750
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,200
That plan
Won't work anymore.

751
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,900
They've got cops
On the payroll, jake.

752
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,600
If you want to get out of this,
It's your best chance.

753
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,500
For your family.

754
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,000
What do I do?

755
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,700
I think it's about time

756
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,400
The zamar family learned
About Ari's new friend.

757
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,200
<i>any good operative is going to
Be a bit of a control freak.</i>

758
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,300
<i>above all,
They don't want to hear</i>

759
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,600
<i>that the people
They think they own</i>

760
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,600
<i>really belong to someone
Who can destroy them.</i>

761
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,600
Look, I said
I would help you.

762
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,700
I got to help
Your friends now?

763
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,800
I can't do this...

764
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,100
What are you talking about?
What friend?

765
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,300
Steve something.
He said he worked with Ari.

766
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,100
He checked out the logs,
Had me show him the airport.

767
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,100
He said
I belong to him now.

768
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,100
What the hell
Is that supposed to mean --

769
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,000
I belong to him?

770
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,800
He had
My social security number,

771
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,100
My passport information.

772
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,800
He had all kinds of stuff
About you guys, too... pictures.

773
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,200
What are you
Talking about?

774
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,300
I don't know
What's happening to me.

775
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,900
I want my life back.
Give me my life back.
Shut up!

776
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,500
Shut up!

777
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,200
Hey.

778
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,400
Who is this person?

779
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,500
Who is he?

780
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,500
I don't know.
Okay, that's what I'm saying.

781
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,700
He said
He was friends with Ari.

782
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,500
I don't know anything.

783
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,700
Get out.

784
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,900
Get out!

785
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,100
Ari, what did you do?

786
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,100
I've told you
Never to talk to anyone!

787
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,300
No, no.
This is my deal.

788
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,000
I did this on my own.

789
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,200
A deal?
Who asked you to do this deal?

790
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,100
Who is this friend, huh?

791
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,200
What... what... he has documents
About us, pictures.

792
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,000
Met him at a club.
He came to me.

793
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,500
What does he know?
Did you tell him anything?

794
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,200
Did you
Show him anything?!

795
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,100
I showed him
The warehouse.

796
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,300
We took a little tour.

797
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,800
But... but it's okay.
He was blindfolded.

798
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,900
He just wanted to see
The operation and --

799
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,400
Ilan,
Go to the warehouse now.

800
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,700
Come, you fool!

801
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Was that okay?

802
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,500
Fiona: perfect.
Michael trained you well.

803
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,600
They're on their way,
Michael.

804
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I am telling you,
He was the real deal, okay?

805
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,200
He had the trunk
Full of c-4 --

806
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,400
Stop!
Someone's there.

807
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,500
It's all gone...

808
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,000
...everything.

809
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,500
<i>there's nothing worse</i>

810
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
<i>for anyone who spent time
In intelligence work</i>

811
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,200
<i>than being up against a ghost.</i>

812
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,000
<i>you can deal
With an enemy you know,</i>

813
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,100
<i>but an enemy you don't know?</i>

814
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,400
<i>he could be a competitor</i>

815
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,400
<i>who knows all about
Your operation...</i>

816
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,000
<i>...could be law enforcement
Getting ready to bust you...</i>

817
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,900
<i>could be a foreign agent</i>

818
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,000
<i>setting you up
In some deep spy game.</i>

819
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,200
<i>your only option
Is to disappear.</i>

820
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,300
Steve remington --
He said he was special forces.

821
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,000
Try again. He could be
Using a different name.

822
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,800
Enough, Ari!

823
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,700
Let's go.

824
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,400
As long as they think
Steve remington owns you,

825
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,400
You're safe.

826
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
As far as they know,
There's a mystery man out there

827
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,300
Who can destroy them,
And you're his property.

828
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,700
Thank you.

829
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,600
Yeah. I'm not here
Fishing for thanks.

830
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,100
You need to understand
The situation.

831
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,200
Eli will have his ear
To the ground forever.

832
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,300
If word gets out he got conned,
You're dead.

833
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,000
You guys look so serious.

834
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,800
Come on.
It's not that hard, man.

835
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,900
I mean, secrets are what keep
A family strong, right?

836
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,800
Something like that.

837
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,700
I'm just glad
That you guys are finally happy.

838
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,300
I got to tell you, though,
When I busted into Mike's place,

839
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,600
I didn't know
If I was gonna find anything,

840
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,100
And then I find
This document here

841
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,600
In a hidey-hole
Under the sink.

842
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,300
I don't know. Maybe he's as bad
As you guys say.

843
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
We sent this
Up the ladder, Sam.

844
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,500
This document's classified.

845
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,900
Westen shouldn't have
Had this.

846
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
They're looking for leaks.

847
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,400
Well, that's nice.

848
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,500
But the point here, Fellas, is,
I brought home the bacon.

849
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,200
You got prime goods
On my buddy Mike right there.

850
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,500
We're off the case, Sam.

851
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,000
This thing's serious enough

852
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,500
Washington's sending
Someone else down.

853
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,900
Westen's
Someone else's problem now.

854
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,100
Yeah?
New surveillance?

855
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,300
What... what department?

856
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,500
Don't know.
Don't care.

857
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,200
Enjoy your lunch, Sam.

858
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,700
See you around.

859
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,700
Yeah.

860
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,200
Huh.

861
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,100
Thanks, Fellas.

862
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm gonna miss you guys,
You know?

863
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,500
Mike.
Hey, Sam.

864
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,100
Yeah, good news
And bad news.

865
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Good news is,
Your FBI tail got pulled.

866
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,300
Bad news is, they're sending
Someone new down.

867
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,500
Sounds heavy.

868
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,300
Thanks, Sam.
Who's the new surveillance?

869
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,500
Hell if I know.
Oh, uh, there's more good news.

870
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,800
They were so eager
To get rid of you,

871
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,600
They dropped three $20s
On a 10-buck tab.

872
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,600
Lucky you.

873
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,500
All right,
Check you later.

874
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,800
Hi there.

875
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,700
My frien
Just abandoned me.

876
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,300
Any chance I could get you
To keep me company?
Maybe.

877
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,200
I'm Sam.

878
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,200
Hi.
I'm Veronica.

879
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,800
What are we drinking?

880
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,200
I knew it wasn't gonna be
In there.

881
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,400
Well, she said
It was in here.

882
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,100
Of course she --
Well, it's not.

883
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,700
So, will you
Stop arguing now?

884
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,700
Ma, it doesn't mention the car
In the will.

885
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,100
I know.

886
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,300
You know?

887
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
I wanted Michael to know

888
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,500
That his father remembered him
In the end,

889
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,200
And, Nate,
You spent more time with him.

890
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,400
You lied.

891
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,800
Yeah.

892
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,000
Makes sense.

893
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,000
You know what, Nate?
Fine.

894
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
I'll flip you for it.

895
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,800
All right.
Heads.

896
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,600
Yeah.
Of course.

897
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,100
You know what?
You won it fair and square, bro.

898
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,500
Now, you see, Michael,
You're too hard on him.

899
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,600
I mean,
He can be so sweet.

900
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,800
I just want us
To be family.

901
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,000
I know, mom.
I know.

902
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,800
He just stole my wallet.
Nate!
