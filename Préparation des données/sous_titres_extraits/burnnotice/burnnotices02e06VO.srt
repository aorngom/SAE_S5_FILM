1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:03,687
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:06,968
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:12,056
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.

4
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:14,603
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,060
- Where am I?
- Miami.

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,105
You do whatever work comes your way.

7
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:22,400
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

8
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,361
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

9
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:28,239
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

10
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,617
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

11
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:31,826
Family, too...

12
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:33,036
Is that your mom again?

13
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:34,120
If you're desperate.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,246
Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:38,249
Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,

16
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:41,836
you're not going anywhere.

17
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:58,461
<i>When meeting a covert operative</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

18
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:00,188
<i>the arrangements can tell you a lot.</i>

19
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:03,473
<i>If they give you a map and a photo,
they trust you.</i>

20
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:04,951
<i>A place and a time?</i>

21
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:08,070
<i>They want to check you out
before they make contact.</i>

22
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,910
<i>A cryptic clue, like "Tidy pelican"?</i>

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,537
<i>They've just got
an irritating sense of humor.</i>

24
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:40,645
You look like you could use a partner.

25
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,316
Tidy pelican. Cute.

26
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,789
Carla wanted to leave a harder clue
for the crossword.

27
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,672
You know how
she loves these things, but...

28
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:51,829
I was worried it would
go right over your head.

29
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:53,163
Love the shirt.

30
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:55,448
Careful.
The last man who insulted me

31
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:58,455
had to fish pieces of his tongue
out of a garbage disposal.

32
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,875
I'm kidding. Sit.

33
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:05,754
Don't worry.
It's a nice, public place.

34
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:08,074
We're just two guys talking, sport.

35
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,424
Call me Victor.

36
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:11,259
So, what exactly do you do, Victor?

37
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,377
Well, you could think of me
as a wrangler.

38
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:15,378
I make sure the broncos
don't buck too much,

39
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:17,182
wander from the pen.
That kind of thing.

40
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:18,641
Like a rodeo clown.

41
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,667
You've been a busy boy, Michael,

42
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:24,937
sneaking around town,
breaking into people's offices.

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,305
- You've shown a lot of initiative.
- I've had a lot of time on my hands.

44
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:31,196
Well, we'd like to put your talents
back to good use.

45
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:33,239
We've got a little operation,
and you'll help.

46
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,707
And if I'm not interested?

47
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:37,952
Then I suppose we turn the
screws until you get interested.

48
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:39,400
My advice is,

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,623
don't make this more difficult
than it has to be.

50
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:43,866
Meet your new best friend.

51
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:46,790
This stays with you at all times.
I call, you answer.

52
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,005
And, no. No, you do not
get a return number.

53
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:52,217
You know, I already have
plenty of these things.

54
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:55,194
And I'm not doing a job
until I hear what it is.

55
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:57,347
<i>Sometimes when you meet
a new operative,</i>

56
00:02:57,507 --> 00:02:59,891
<i>it's a good idea to open
with an aggressive move.</i>

57
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:01,001
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:02,936
That's not how it works.

59
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:06,523
<i>You learn about people when
you make them play defense...</i>

60
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:08,511
<i>their reflexes, weaknesses,</i>

61
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:10,810
<i>how they handle themselves
under pressure.</i>

62
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,897
Keep smiling, sport.
Just two guys talking.

63
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:15,990
You'll tell me about your bosses,
or I open your radial artery.

64
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:19,494
My guess is you'll tap out
in a minute, maybe two.

65
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:23,581
Mm, Carla said you might be difficult.

66
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,187
See, Mikey, the people we work for,
they're into the whole...

67
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,257
carrot-and-stick thing, and...

68
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,588
I'm the stick.

69
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:35,677
A .22... It does
some nasty things up close.

70
00:03:36,388 --> 00:03:40,174
It'll probably tumble around
your femoral artery, your groin.

71
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:44,874
Now, I'm no expert, but my guess
is you tap out first.

72
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,388
<i>And even if they're able to counter,</i>

73
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:50,637
<i>it never hurts to know how far
they're willing to go.</i>

74
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:55,765
<i>Subbers in Black</i>

77
00:03:58,816 --> 00:03:59,966
New car, Sam?

78
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,460
Pre-owned.

79
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,042
After the breakup,
Veronica took the caddie back,

80
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:07,103
so I used some saved-up pension
cheaks and bought this baby.

81
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:10,503
It was tough, but me and the buick,
we're gonna get through it.

82
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:12,824
How'd your little spy meet go?

83
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:16,122
Seems the folks that burned me
want me for a new errand.

84
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:19,560
If the operative they sent is
any indication, it's... it's heavy.

85
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,046
And if you take a rain check?

86
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,016
Oh, the usual. They'll work their way

87
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,150
through my friends and family
with a 9 millimeter

88
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,103
until I change my mind.

89
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,601
Sam, this, uh...

90
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,189
this could get bad.

91
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:33,457
I need someone to go stay
over at my mom's

92
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:35,401
just until I figure out
what's going on.

93
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,196
I wouldn't ask
unless it was serious.

94
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:39,644
What, it's serious like
"don't finish that beer" serious

95
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:42,314
or "go over there
right after your d..."

96
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:44,888
Hey, Madeline.

97
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,081
It's Sam axe.

98
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,495
Oh, I'm okay.

99
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:52,254
You know, I've been staying
over at Mike's place

100
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:54,920
ever since Veronica and I
broke up and, well,

101
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,233
he's getting tired
of me moping around,

102
00:04:57,353 --> 00:05:00,803
and I just wanted to know if
I could stay at your place for

103
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,259
just a couple of days
while I'm on the mend.

104
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,599
Aw, thanks, Madeline.

105
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,969
Yeah, Mike wants to talk to you.

106
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:11,926
Hey, mom.

107
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,332
- What are we up to here, friend?
- Whoa! Dude!

108
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:31,770
Little surveillance? Planting a bug?

109
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,547
Something more exotic, maybe?

110
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,089
What are you talking about, man?
I came here to talk to Michael.

111
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,884
- I'm a friend of the family.
- Mm-hmm. On your feet.

112
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,385
I found the old VCR in the attic.

113
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:45,515
Good as new. You just have to hook up
these little things in the back.

114
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:48,467
Madeline! There you are.

115
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,019
Ricky, you met Sam.

116
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,783
Oh, yeah. We just had the pleasure.

117
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:56,138
Ricky's older brother Andre used
to get in more trouble with Michael.

118
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:58,379
They were like frick and frack,
weren't they, honey?

119
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:59,929
Yes, they were, Mrs. Westen.

120
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,420
How about that, huh?

121
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,878
Ricky came by to see Michael,

122
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:05,593
but he was kind enough to help me
install my home-theater system.

123
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,078
So, how's it coming, Ricky?

124
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,623
- Actually I think it's time to upgrade.
- Really?

125
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,039
It's a perfectly good machine.

126
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:19,816
Sam, what's this?

127
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:22,401
He was at your ma's house
when I got there.

128
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,371
Michael, you remember Ricky.

129
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:27,724
- Ricky. Ricky Watkins.
- Yeah.

130
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:29,234
Long time, right?

131
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:31,370
I heard you were back in town.
Looking good, man.

132
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,937
What's, uh, what's Andre up to?

133
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:35,857
25 to life up in Starke.

134
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:37,468
That's too bad.

135
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:40,278
Yeah, Ricky thought it'd be fun
for the two of you to catch up.

136
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:44,029
- We've got to get to that store.
- Oh, that VCR situation. That's right.

137
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,124
- Well, we got to do that.
- What? You're gonna...

138
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:48,661
Yeah, thanks. We got to just pick
this thing up. Little shopping.

139
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:50,594
You boys have fun, okay?

140
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:55,460
- How you been, Ricky?
- Oh, man. You wouldn't believe it.

141
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,795
You probably remember me
as that little screw-up kid,

142
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,964
trying to raise hell
like you and Andre used to.

143
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:01,815
it's not like that anymore.

144
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:04,510
Put myself through school,
got a business degree.

145
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:08,011
Head accountant,
Sweet Valentine Enterprises.

146
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,368
you know Valentine?

147
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:14,771
- The hip-hop mogul?
- The radio in my car is broken, so...

148
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:16,606
Oh, well, trust me... It's big.

149
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:19,461
The thing is, the other day,
Valentine calls me into his office,

150
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,965
tells me there's $2 million
missing from a charity account.

151
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:24,489
I said, "it must be a mistake,"
and I'll look into it.

152
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:26,471
Money's gone.

153
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:28,993
My name's on all the records.

154
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:30,787
I'm being set up, man.

155
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,664
You have any idea
who might be behind it?

156
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:35,388
Eddie Ash,
Valentine's number two.

157
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:37,651
Only other cat
with access to the accounts.

158
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,962
He's been with Valentine
since the beginning.

159
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:42,423
He's the only guy
Valentine really trusts.

160
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,467
If I say anything, I'm dead.

161
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:47,303
Dead... Not a figure of speech?

162
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:49,138
Valentine started as a gangster.

163
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,095
He thinks I'm stealing from him?

164
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:53,838
No. I wouldn't last 15 minutes.

165
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,687
What you need, Ricky,
is a forensic accountant.

166
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:59,142
What I need is Eddie's books, okay?

167
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:02,724
If I get the records, I give them
to Valentine, I'm in the clear.

168
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:04,570
Eddie keeps them locked up
in his office.

169
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,864
And you want me to go in there
and get it?

170
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:07,774
Look.

171
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:10,750
I got $10,000.

172
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:13,746
All right? It is everything I got,
and you can have it.

173
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:16,457
Let's see how the job
goes first, all right?

174
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,380
So, you really never heard of Valentine?

175
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,415
Haven't had a lot of time
for musical exploration, Fi.

176
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:27,040
Well, he has a clothing line, too.

177
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,846
Lingerie, wonderful shoes.
How much you paying me for this again?

178
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:31,597
I bought you the espresso.

179
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,424
That's Eddie.
Not a bad way to travel, huh?

180
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:12,042
We have to figure out how we can get in
and check out his security.

181
00:09:12,162 --> 00:09:13,312
Ricky said...

182
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:16,385
- Yeah.
- Hollywood beach, 15 minutes.

183
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:19,604
Your new friend?
Chatty, isn't he?

184
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:21,614
I'll have to take care
of this now. Can you...

185
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:22,684
Run along.

186
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,477
Okay. Class is in session.
Now listen carefully.

187
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:34,976
I'm only gonna say this once.

188
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,746
There is a certain location.

189
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:40,082
From this location, an item
is being shipped to...

190
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:41,417
another location.

191
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:42,750
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

192
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,224
Something is being shipped from
somewhere to somewhere else.

193
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:46,380
I think I follow.

194
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,758
Now, we're going to hijack
the something.

195
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:50,635
- What's the something?
- Oh, dear.

196
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,926
Sounds like someone's got a case
of the need-to-knows.

197
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:56,140
Left untreated,
that could prove fatal, Michael.

198
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:58,418
Dismissed.

199
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:03,456
Traffic is brutal this time of day.

200
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:06,025
You should probably hustle if
you're headed back to, uh...

201
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:08,945
Biscayne boulevard?

202
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,809
<i>You can use cellphone towers</i>

203
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,237
<i>to triangulate the position
of someone's cellphone,</i>

204
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:19,028
<i>but you're going to have problems
anytime they go out of range.</i>

205
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,632
<i>Use an enhanced GPS, on the other hand,</i>

206
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:24,239
<i>and you can pinpoint
their location in real time</i>

207
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,420
<i>almost anywhere
on the face of the planet.</i>

208
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,648
<i>Try disconnecting a GPS wired
into a phone's motherboard,</i>

209
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,597
<i>you risk disabling the phone.</i>

210
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:48,091
<i>A much simpler solution
is call forwarding.</i>

211
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,807
Ricky's getting us the security codes,
so that should take care of the doors.

212
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:56,664
There are cameras all around
the building, though.

213
00:10:56,784 --> 00:11:00,434
- What kind of cameras?
- Wireless. Nothing too hard to handle.

214
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,083
Of course, the tactical support
I'm giving you will cost you.

215
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:06,252
I need new shoes.

216
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:07,900
You've got plenty of shoes.

217
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,880
Now that I'm on the open market,
I need more.

218
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:21,731
<i>If you want to empty a building,
pulling a fire alarm is useless.</i>

219
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:24,591
<i>No one pays attention unless
they're actually on fire.</i>

220
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:28,472
<i>A bomb scare next door to your target
strikes the right balance.</i>

221
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:31,861
<i>Everyone clears out and then
pays attention to the other building.</i>

222
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,571
Impressive. What did you tell them?

223
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:35,395
That I was a disgruntled customer.

224
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:38,505
Disgruntled enough to hide
a remote-activated explosives device

225
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,712
in the ladies' room.

226
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,081
They're evacuating the entire
block before they look for it.

227
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:42,997
Have fun.

228
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:46,717
<i>Most modern bomb squads
are equipped with an R.F. jammer.</i>

229
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:49,665
<i>It blocks a wide spectrum
of radio frequencies,</i>

230
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:52,590
<i>preventing people from
detonating bombs by remote control.</i>

231
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,843
<i>it'll block all electronic
transmissions in the area.</i>

232
00:11:56,003 --> 00:11:57,261
<i>Cellphones, for example.</i>

233
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,928
<i>Or wireless security cameras.</i>

234
00:12:25,122 --> 00:12:28,376
<i>The interior locks in an office suite
are usually low-end...</i>

235
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:31,712
<i>just there to keep white-collar workers
from stealing coffee cups.</i>

236
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:38,844
<i>File-cabinet locking bars,
on the other hand,</i>

237
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,097
<i>are a more serious security measure.</i>

238
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:45,601
<i>Their main vulnerability is that they
depend on people's faith in padlocks.</i>

239
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:48,311
<i>People have too much faith in padlocks.</i>

240
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:17,554
Why are you out here?

241
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:19,677
Cops said we had to leave.
There's a bomb in the building.

242
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:22,555
Don't care if there's a mushroom cloud.
You're paid to guard the building.

243
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:24,348
Get your asses in there and guard it.

244
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,300
Now!

245
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:40,281
Y'all hear that?
Yeah. What was that?

246
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,069
<i>Air ducts in a modern office</i>
<i>are 18 inches wide,</i>

247
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:52,877
<i>so if you need to make a quick escape
and you're older than 4,</i>

248
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:53,940
<i>you won't fit.</i>

249
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,630
<i>A more viable option</i>
<i>is the subceiling.</i>

250
00:13:58,288 --> 00:13:59,702
<i>Once you're in the subceiling,</i>

251
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:03,471
<i>You can get to a bathroom or closet
and make your way out from there.</i>

252
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:06,689
Uhu. This... this can't be right, man.

253
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:10,102
There was nothing in the files?
You're sure you looked everywhere?

254
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:11,037
I'm sure.

255
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:12,998
And Valentine is asking
questions, all right?

256
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,690
I don't think I can
hold him off much longer.

257
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,610
Eddie has a prospectus
for a tanning salon.

258
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,320
He's got another for a car wash.

259
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:22,359
He's shopping for a way
to launder his money.

260
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:25,326
He did a pretty good job of making it
look like you stole the money.

261
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:28,454
But if he suddenly has 2 million $
in his bank account

262
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:30,442
- People are gonna ask questions.
- Exactly.

263
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,388
He's looking for a front business,

264
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:35,002
a way to make it look like
he actually earned this money.

265
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,339
So he needs to clean his money.
How does that help me?

266
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,711
I'm gonna talk to Eddie.
I'm gonna convince him

267
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,593
that he should wash his money with me.

268
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:45,095
And that is something
you can take to Valentine.

269
00:14:46,757 --> 00:14:47,507
Okay.

270
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:55,467
I just want an introduction, Barry.

271
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:58,150
Chances are good that this guy Eddie
is talking to friends of yours.

272
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,260
I just want to make my pitch.

273
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,798
And the next day,
you do the Michael Westen thing,

274
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,874
stuff starts exploding,
and everyone's saying,

275
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:10,421
"Hey, Barry, wasn't that guy
a friend of yours?"

276
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,872
Sorry. No can do.

277
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:13,629
Sam's working up a cover I.D. for me.

278
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:16,044
I'm just a guy from out of town,
a friend of a friend.

279
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:18,242
The blow won't get back on you.
I give you my word.

280
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:19,644
I guess I can work it through

281
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:21,170
- some intermediaries.
- Yes.

282
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,489
- Doable.
- Yes.

283
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,385
- Expensive.
- How much?

284
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:27,555
To get someone to vouch for you, put you
in the room with a guy... Say 5 grand?

285
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:30,580
Promise nothing will happen to him,
maybe I can do $3,000.

286
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,850
$5,000 it is.

287
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:33,936
Okay.

288
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:37,435
Oh, Mike. Good timing.

289
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:38,986
Check this out.

290
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:40,684
Madras curry.

291
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,977
Just take a little bit.
Little sippy sip.

292
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:48,442
Your mom's got me into
these cooking shows.

293
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:49,743
It's addictive as hell.

294
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,789
How's the "protecting her
from danger" show?

295
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,491
I do a perimeter check once an hour.

296
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:01,271
I just say that I need some alone time
to ponder the whole Veronica thing.

297
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:04,675
- Works like a charm.
- What are you boys whispering about?

298
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:06,552
Nothing, mom.

299
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:07,750
Okay.

300
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,891
Sam, did you get a chance
to do that cover I.D. for me?

301
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,519
You're Jimmy Glynn.

302
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,397
Flashy real-estate
developer/cash churner.

303
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:21,272
I threw in some vague Boston
mob connections just for good measure.

304
00:16:21,392 --> 00:16:23,277
What did I do...
Oh. Here we are.

305
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:25,863
Here's your business card.
You're all set, brother.

306
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:42,046
<i>When you're working a target,
it's all about getting a good read.</i>

307
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,673
<i>What makes him tick?</i>
<i>Is he insecure?</i>

308
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,441
<i>Does he have something to prove?</i>

309
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:48,204
<i>You might only have a few seconds,</i>

310
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:50,012
<i>but it all factors into your approach.</i>

311
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:51,722
Eddie Ash.

312
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:53,509
- Right?
- You must be Jimmy.

313
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:56,340
Good to meet you, brother.
Yeah, guy. Yeah.

314
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,187
You're in the music business, right?

315
00:16:58,347 --> 00:16:59,883
What, are you a performer? A rapper?

316
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:02,775
I hear the ladies go crazy for
the music types. Am I right?

317
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:04,250
I'm in management.
Oh.

318
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,424
rather not talk about my business,
if you don't mind.

319
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:08,710
No, not at all. I hear that
a lot in my line of work.

320
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,325
Let's get us some drinks.
Sweet... Oh! Ooh! Ooh!

321
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:14,530
Johnnie Walker blue on the rocks
for me and my friend here.

322
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,853
Wow. They don't make them
like that in beantown.

323
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:19,750
I hear you have a pretty good
real-estate thing going on up there.

324
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:21,626
Word is you're the best in the business.

325
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:23,522
Yeah, yeah, you hear right. But...

326
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,714
in my line of work, you got
to move with the economy.

327
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:28,926
Now, if I understand you,
you want to wash some bills.

328
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,029
I might. I might not.

329
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:34,807
You're careful. I like that.

330
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:44,817
What if I told you you could get a return
on your investment in six months?

331
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:49,446
Comes back clean, untraceable,
plus a 30% to 40% profit, minus my cut.

332
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:52,533
- I'd ask about the catch.
- No catch.

333
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:54,952
you get me, by the end
of the week, $2 million...

334
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:56,339
2 million?

335
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:57,409
This week?

336
00:17:58,574 --> 00:18:00,999
No worries, brother.
Yeah, I hear this a lot.

337
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,174
Fella's got
a couple hundred g's to move,

338
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:05,129
thinks he's a player,
and he comes to Jimmy.

339
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:08,468
Well, Jimmy's a seven-figures,
Deep-end-of-the-pool kind of guy.

340
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,208
So when you take off your floaties

341
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:12,408
and you want to do some
real business, you come to me.

342
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:14,962
- You know what? I'm gonna get the check.
- Hey! All right.

343
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:17,015
It's not about the money, right? Sit.

344
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:18,325
Come on, sit.

345
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:20,227
It's just the time frame is all.

346
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:22,938
What can I say?
My investment group, we move fast.

347
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:24,648
This is big-time, Eddie.

348
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,301
Well, I'd need to see
where this real estate is.

349
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:30,488
I'm not investing in something
if I can't see it.

350
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:32,258
I wouldn't want you to.

351
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:38,691
<i>There's nothing in the world
easier to get into</i>

352
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:41,874
<i>than an empty condo that's been
on the market for six months.</i>

353
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,879
<i>Never mind picking the lock,
you can just call and ask for the keys.</i>

354
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,700
I mean, the way the Florida market
is right now, I mean, it's a gold mine.

355
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,991
I'm negotiating right now
for this piece.

356
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:55,469
I could pick this place up
for 10, 15 cents on the dollar.

357
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:57,604
- Yeah, but it's empty.
- Yeah, that's the point.

358
00:18:57,724 --> 00:18:58,688
Eddie, listen.

359
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:01,345
I take your cash under the table.
I buy.

360
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:04,603
Granite countertops,
new appliances, new carpeting.

361
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:08,601
We flip the property 'cause
there's no receipts, there's no records.

362
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:11,571
All that money comes back
to you squeaky clean.

363
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,604
- All right, I'll think about it.
- Don't think too long.

364
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:19,426
I got a couple of guys looking
to move on this in 48 hours.

365
00:19:19,546 --> 00:19:20,540
Are you in?

366
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:22,308
Are you gonna be in?

367
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,553
Look at me. You in?

368
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:25,882
I got to go. All right?
I got to run. I'll be in touch.

369
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:26,752
Eddie,

370
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,151
it's not gonna last.

371
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,592
Yeah.

372
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,834
Valentine is calling everyone
into the conference room

373
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:38,427
for an emergency meeting in 10 minutes,
and he is pissed.

374
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:40,797
That must be where Eddie's heading.

375
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:44,069
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but it is not good.

376
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:45,437
What do I do, man?

377
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:47,313
Well, it's a risk, but if you run,

378
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:50,983
you'll be running for the rest
of your life. It's your call.

379
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:52,899
I'll go.

380
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:55,739
Leave the phone on. I'm gonna go get Fi.
We're gonna be listening in.

381
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:58,330
- So you got my back on this?
- We're gonna do the best we can,

382
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,100
but if it looks like something's
going bad down there, get out.

383
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,670
We should go in there.
One or two bullets in the right place...

384
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,829
Yeah, I think storming the building is
probably not good for Ricky long-term.

385
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,986
The meeting's starting.

386
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:17,135
<i>Loyalty...</i>

387
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,757
Respect...

388
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:21,584
Standing tall.

389
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:25,394
These are bricks I used
to build this label from the street up.

390
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,217
Without them...

391
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,301
these platinum records
got no place on my wall.

392
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,221
Y'all a jumpy bunch today.

393
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,036
Anybody in here
got a reason to be jumpy?

394
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:48,305
<i>Last chance to come clean, people.</i>

395
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:49,752
No?

396
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,017
I'm disappointed.

397
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:54,715
<i>Though I can't say I'm surprised.</i>

398
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:55,897
Marcus.

399
00:20:58,813 --> 00:20:59,887
You recognize this.

400
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,227
Aftershock's debut album.

401
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:03,946
Double platinum.

402
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:06,101
Whose logo is that on this record?

403
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:07,853
- Yours.
- Mine's.

404
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:09,771
And whose signature
is on your paychecks?

405
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:11,732
Yours, Valentine.

406
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:13,090
<i>That's right.</i>

407
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,443
<i>So explain to me</i>

408
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,528
why you told Static Records

409
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:19,448
you could deliver Aftershock
if they brought you into the fold?

410
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,433
Static Records?
Man, I don't even...

411
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:26,747
Eddie saw you
kicking it at their offices.

412
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,789
You take my artists,

413
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:31,043
you take the cash out my pocket.

414
00:21:33,152 --> 00:21:33,952
Eddie.

415
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:36,089
What do I do to thieves?

416
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:40,794
- What you have to, Valentine.
- What I have to.

417
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,071
Rick... What you think?

418
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:47,851
I think you're in a conference room
full of witnesses, "V".

419
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:53,178
My man.

420
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,859
Always appealing to my better half.

421
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,820
You know what, Marcus?
Get your ass out of here.

422
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,700
You forgetting something, homey?

423
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,710
You wanted my record, right?

424
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:06,828
Take it.

425
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:13,918
Somebody come clean this up!
Everybody out!

426
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:16,522
Now! Let's go!

427
00:22:18,593 --> 00:22:19,393
Fi!

428
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:21,054
Except you, Rick.

429
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:25,811
Wait.

430
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:27,383
Damn it.

431
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,684
Fi.

432
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,019
Figure out what happened
to that guap, Ricky?

433
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:34,022
Yeah. It looks like it was a bank error.

434
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:36,191
I'm taking care of it, "V".

435
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:37,151
Wait.

436
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:40,570
Two days...
I need to see that cash.

437
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,200
Stand down.

438
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,620
- Tell me you heard that.
- Yeah, we heard that.

439
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:51,373
Sounded like Eddie was letting Valentine
know who he can trust.

440
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,041
When Valentine finds that money gone,

441
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:55,022
there's no question
it's me that gets capped.

442
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:58,588
Well, I'm not gonna let that happen.
I'm seeing Eddie tonight.

443
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:07,933
These are just Boston numbers.
Miami numbers are gonna be even better.

444
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,472
Bigger slide in the market.

445
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:11,896
Now, I know this is
a big move for you, Eddie, but

446
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,566
I need a decision now.

447
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,440
I need to approve spending.

448
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,394
I wanna know where
my money is at any point.

449
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:19,964
You got it, brother.

450
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:21,500
For me?

451
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:28,079
Would you... hold this for a second?

452
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,656
Victor, you should have called.

453
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:34,623
I just can't figure out
how you misunderstood

454
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:36,501
this stays with you at all times.

455
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:40,111
You ever pull another stunt
like that, Michael, and, uh...

456
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,425
well, don't pull
another stunt like that.

457
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:47,135
Now, a Chevy Impala's parked outside.
We're going for a little ride tomorrow.

458
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:49,283
- Doesn't that sound like fun?
- I'm busy tomorrow.

459
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:52,419
Yeah, you have been spreading
yourself kind of thin lately.

460
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:55,090
I was just talking to your waitress,
Michelle. Great gal. She, uh...

461
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,106
She tells me you're getting
into real estate now, too.

462
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:03,533
You're a real wicked skinner,
you know that, Jimmy?

463
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:06,589
I talk to you, now I got the FBI
crawling all over the place.

464
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,617
Oh, who's this? Another investor.

465
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,982
if he don't want the feds
camped out in his backyard,

466
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:13,952
he should stay the hell away
from Jimmy Glynn.

467
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:22,798
Maybe that, uh...
helped clear up your schedule.

468
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:24,699
See you tomorrow, pal.

469
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:31,973
Whoa. Hold on, hold on.

470
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:34,142
So, he's not gonna move the money now?

471
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:37,896
- He thinks I'm under FBI investigation.
- FBI?

472
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:39,858
I'm running out of time here, man.

473
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,234
Valentine said, what, 48 hours?

474
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:44,215
Most important thing
is for you to stay calm.

475
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:46,570
- Fi, can you?
- I'll take care of him.

476
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:49,658
Ricky, we need to talk.

477
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:53,703
So, do you get much of a discount
on Valentine's clothing line?

478
00:24:56,924 --> 00:24:58,431
<i>When your cover's compromised,</i>

479
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:00,586
<i>often, the best defense
is a good offense.</i>

480
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:04,159
<i>Admit nothing, deny everything.
Make counteraccusations.</i>

481
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,812
You friggin' dubba.
I ought to wring your neck.

482
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:08,321
What the hell did you do to me?

483
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:09,938
What? What are you talking about?

484
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:12,737
I talk to you, and suddenly
I got feds on my ass.

485
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:15,133
- What are you saying?
- What do you have to say about that?

486
00:25:15,253 --> 00:25:18,330
They came to my office!
They came to my place of business!

487
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,693
What? The FBI? Are you serious?

488
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:22,307
Do I look like I'm joking?

489
00:25:22,427 --> 00:25:25,498
Now I got to kill my deals,
all my investors are lost.

490
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:27,122
I got to move my money offshore.

491
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:30,050
Do you know how much
of a bath I'm gonna take

492
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,203
- plus my sterling reputation?
- Okay, okay.

493
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,055
- OK, OK.
- Now, I'm gonna ask you this just once.

494
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:40,075
Did you say anything to them?

495
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:44,921
N-no, I didn't. They didn't...
They didn't talk to me. I swear.

496
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,180
All right, let's keep it that way.

497
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,655
Luckily, moving money offshore
is a Jimmy Glynn speciality.

498
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:54,711
I'm sorry about the suit.
We got to stick together on this, pal.

499
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:57,992
If you hear anything, you see anything,
you talk to me, all right?

500
00:25:58,112 --> 00:26:01,062
- You call me. Understood?
- Yeah, I understand.

501
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,931
Sam, I need a favor.

502
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:13,037
I need you to take my mom
on a field trip.

503
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:15,874
I got to go see what
this Victor project's about.

504
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:29,935
<i>Once somebody's watching for cops,
they see them everywhere.</i>

505
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,510
<i>Anyone in dark sunglasses is FBI.</i>

506
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:35,254
<i>Any car with tinted windows is a tail.</i>

507
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:38,326
<i>Their paranoia does
most of the work for you.</i>

508
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:40,274
I still don't see the point
of driving around

509
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:42,356
taking pictures of hotels and condos.

510
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,080
I mean, if you really want to find
a new place, you know,

511
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,442
you're gonna have to
eventually go inside one, Sam.

512
00:26:47,602 --> 00:26:48,777
I know. I know.

513
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:50,362
It's just that if I do,

514
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:52,864
well, then it means
it's really over with Veronica.

515
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:55,242
It's just one of those
psychological things, you know?

516
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:58,197
I know. I went through the same stuff.
You know, when Frank died?

517
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,571
And it's hard, but you got to move on.

518
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:02,141
I'm just not ready.

519
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,862
Our shipment's coming in
tomorrow afternoon.

520
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:11,466
It'll be held in one of those
loading bays there awaiting transfer.

521
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:14,146
I'll go in and cut the bolts on the door
and remove the object

522
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,234
while you babysit the car
and play lookout.

523
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:19,419
- We've got an hour window, maybe less.
- You sure you don't want me to grab it?

524
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,442
And give you a chance to peek?
Nice try, though.

525
00:27:21,562 --> 00:27:23,982
We drive for the drop and go
our separate ways, you ditch the car.

526
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,231
- Questions.
- Just one. What are we taking, again?

527
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,528
Bigger than a bread box,
but it'll fit in the trunk,

528
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,903
- that's all you need to know, sport.
- That is not all I need to know, Victor.

529
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:33,518
How heavy is the cargo?

530
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:36,187
Are we talking about a big metal
container or something fragile?

531
00:27:36,307 --> 00:27:38,767
If it's explosives,
it will affect how I drive.

532
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:41,579
Wooden crate, no explosives.
Don't worry your pretty little head.

533
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:44,373
What about the guards?

534
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:46,501
Well, if they come by,
you give me the heads-up.

535
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:47,544
And then?

536
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:50,630
I take care of them.

537
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:55,260
<i>Knowing what someone wants
can tell you a lot about who they are,</i>

538
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,411
<i>so if what they want
comes in a wooden crate</i>

539
00:27:58,531 --> 00:28:00,348
<i>that you're not going
to be allowed to open,</i>

540
00:28:00,508 --> 00:28:03,685
<i>you might have to turn your trunk
into a makeshift X-ray machine.</i>

541
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:16,429
<i>The tube from an old TV set
is a good place to start.</i>

542
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,160
<i>As part of the projection
process, they emit X-rays.</i>

543
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:22,939
<i>They're meant to handle
around 30,000 volts.</i>

544
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:26,265
<i>Any more than that and they'll
cook your eyes with radiation.</i>

545
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:35,717
<i>So pump 100,000 volts</i>
<i>into one from a taser,</i>

546
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:39,031
<i>and you won't be able
to diagnose a hairline fracture,</i>

547
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,101
<i>but you'll get the basic idea.</i>

548
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,274
Yeah, Jimmy here.

549
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,898
<i>It's Eddie. We need to meet now.</i>

550
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,236
It's just like you said, Jimmy.

551
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:56,571
The FBI's tailing me.
They're taking pictures.

552
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:59,553
Before, you said you could
move cash o-offshore?

553
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:02,452
Well, with the feds circling,
got enough heat moving my own money.

554
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:09,538
You gotta help me.

555
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:13,088
<i>Criminals are, as a rule,
paranoid and self-serving.</i>

556
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:16,416
<i>So if you're using a criminal cover I.D.
you can't be too helpful.</i>

557
00:29:16,536 --> 00:29:20,436
Sorry. I wish I could help you, guy...
I really do... but it's risky.

558
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:21,780
Too risky.

559
00:29:24,882 --> 00:29:28,666
<i>Luckily, you can usually count on
the other guy not to let you off easy.</i>

560
00:29:31,806 --> 00:29:33,156
All right, well...

561
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:35,840
You know, if the feds
take my money, then, uh...

562
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,612
I guess I'll have to talk to them.

563
00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:39,656
And they seem
pretty interested in you, so

564
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:41,533
might be too risky
to keep my mouth shut.

565
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,284
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No need for that.

566
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,165
How do the Seychelles sound to you?

567
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,131
I got a bank out there
who works with me.

568
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:53,247
Fine.

569
00:29:53,871 --> 00:29:56,840
Sounds fine. I have one more loose end
to tie before I move the money.

570
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,427
Loose end? You said nobody else knew.
They won't. Not for long.

571
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:03,179
I got guys taking care of it right now.

572
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:09,644
Good for you. Look at you.
Look at you moving up.

573
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,312
We should have a party, then.

574
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:13,610
I should call some ladies,
have them come over?

575
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,322
Let's toast. Get me a bottle.
Let's get a new bottle out here.

576
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:18,111
- Sound good?
- That sounds great.

577
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:23,979
Fi, get over to Ricky's.
Eddie's sending a hit squad.

578
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:27,645
Yeah, you call Ricky. You tell him
to stay low, find a good hiding place.

579
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:29,389
If he shows up, they're gonna kill him.

580
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:30,943
<i>I'll bring some firepower, then.</i>

581
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,236
No, no, no. It can't look like
you're helping him.

582
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:35,962
Do something else... anything else.
Just do it now.

583
00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:44,677
<i>In any kind of covert operation,
one of the toughest challenges</i>

584
00:30:44,797 --> 00:30:47,265
<i>is using information
that you're not supposed to have.</i>

585
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:52,983
<i>If going in guns blazing
will blow your cover,</i>

586
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:54,667
<i>sometimes you've got to get creative.</i>

587
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,688
I know you're in there, Ricky!

588
00:30:56,808 --> 00:30:59,068
You come on out and face me like a man!

589
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,155
<i>Under the right circumstances,
a well-placed rock...</i>

590
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:06,347
<i>... is as good as a bullet.</i>

591
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:14,869
The good news is Eddie believes
he's being investigated by the FBI

592
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:16,294
and wants to move the money.

593
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:20,204
The bad news is he's not gonna do it
with you still alive, Ricky.

594
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,218
So the only way to clear my name
is to die a violent death?

595
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:26,012
Great.

596
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:28,181
Eddie has a Ricky problem.
We'll help him solve it.

597
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,934
Can you find out when
Valentine's leaving the office today?

598
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:32,060
Yeah.

599
00:31:33,304 --> 00:31:34,562
Sam, I need a favor.

600
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:37,190
Can you stash my mom some place safe
for a couple of hours?

601
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,367
I reached out to some of my people.
I found the source of your FBI problem.

602
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,919
It's an accountant named Ricky Watkins.

603
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,543
Yes. Damn it! Damn it!

604
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:56,821
Now, if you're gonna move the money,
you're gonna have to take him out.

605
00:31:56,941 --> 00:31:59,367
I know. That's the loose end
I was talking about, okay?

606
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:02,335
I sent guys, but then his girlfriend
showed up or something.

607
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:03,672
The whole street saw her.

608
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:06,506
Looks like somebody's gonna
have to get his hands dirty.

609
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:07,976
What, you mean me?

610
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:09,775
- Do it myself?
- I got a gun.

611
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,683
I stole it from a coke dealer
up in Boca.

612
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:15,658
Anybody traces it, it looks like Ricky
was stealing to buy into drug business.

613
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:17,855
You'll get away clean,
but you got to do it right now.

614
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,867
Oh, yeah, all right. I get it.

615
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:22,819
Can't do anything for yourself.

616
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:25,675
Been living off of Valentine's
table scraps for too long.

617
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:29,158
You call this table scraps?

618
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:30,566
This...

619
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:33,413
is limited edition.
10 people in the world have this watch.

620
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:36,583
- What's so funny?!
- Yeah, you got the car,

621
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,117
you got the watch,

622
00:32:38,237 --> 00:32:40,712
but you're still living
like a rat in the shadows,

623
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:42,547
not manning up to your business.

624
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:44,718
- You shut your mouth!
- What are you gonna do?

625
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,391
You gonna wait for your guys
to come back into town

626
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:50,352
and hide behind them like a rat
while they shoot...

627
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:54,350
<i>One of the most difficult skills
to master in combat is taking a dive.</i>

628
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:58,146
<i>Sometimes an operation demands
that you lose a fight.</i>

629
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,483
<i>But it's the hardest thing
in the world to see the opening</i>

630
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:04,055
<i>and let it go.</i>

631
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:08,656
All right, all right!
Okay, okay, okay!

632
00:33:08,816 --> 00:33:10,994
I can take care
of my business just fine!

633
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,864
Let's do this, all right?

634
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:18,313
Where's the gun?

635
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:24,955
<i>Merci beaucoup</i>, sugar bloomers.

636
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:30,536
Hey! I think I know you. Huh?

637
00:33:31,422 --> 00:33:32,972
Aren't you the singer rapper?

638
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:36,184
- Is that Valentino? Valentine?
- Yeah.

639
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:39,395
I just got one thing to say to you.
You're what's wrong with our country.

640
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:41,814
Yeah, you call that music?

641
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:43,274
What's going on there?

642
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:45,151
First of all,
what do you listen to, old-timer?

643
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:47,056
Barbara Mandrell.
Nothing wrong with that.

644
00:33:47,176 --> 00:33:48,908
- Kenny G, Captain & Tennille.
- Whoa.

645
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,032
That's, like, too gangster
for me right there, man.

646
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:53,201
I got something for you
right here. A melody.

647
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:54,827
Man, get this fool out my face.

648
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:59,332
Oh, are these your gangstas?
This is cool. Am I gonna get whacked?

649
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:01,834
I'm hip-hopping now, man.
Look at me!

650
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:04,131
<i>Bonjour.</i>

651
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:13,206
Want to take a ride, sugar bloomers?

652
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:36,577
What the hell are you doing here?

653
00:34:37,363 --> 00:34:39,113
- Oh, come on, man.
- Go.

654
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,498
- Man, hey, hey!
- Get down. Get down!

655
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:46,868
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, listen to me.

656
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:49,224
All right, you don't have to do this.

657
00:34:49,344 --> 00:34:51,966
There's still time.
We can make this right.

658
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:54,561
No one needs to know.

659
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:57,017
You know, I almost wish they did know.

660
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:00,020
You couldn't have pulled off that scam,
not in a million years.

661
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,198
That was beautiful. That was mine.

662
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:06,182
I never did anything to you, man.
Why are you doing this to me?

663
00:35:06,302 --> 00:35:08,693
Oh, man. This is your fault, Ricky.

664
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:12,697
I mean, why'd you have to push it, man?
Why'd you have to go to the feds?

665
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:14,198
Because it's not your money.

666
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:15,518
The hell it isn't!

667
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:17,001
I built that company!

668
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:17,921
Me!

669
00:35:18,473 --> 00:35:20,830
Valentine was rapping for
pocket change when I met him!

670
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,623
I sold his CDs out of a van!

671
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:24,500
He trusted you. He loved you.

672
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,044
He loved me?
He made a half a billion dollars.

673
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,295
Me?

674
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:30,757
I'm a financial adviser
with a weekly paycheck.

675
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:32,162
Yeah.

676
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:35,922
"Oh, here, Eddie, take this car.
Eddie, you know what? Have a watch."

677
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:37,346
Table scraps.

678
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,353
You know, between me and you, Ricky,

679
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,644
I don't even like the music anymore.

680
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:44,937
I can't stand it.

681
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:50,318
I got to say,

682
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:52,528
it feels good to do this myself.

683
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:56,136
I should have stepped up
like this a long time ago.

684
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,536
What the hell?

685
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:11,005
Oh, no, no.

686
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,217
- Please.
- Everybody out.

687
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:16,093
- Valentine.
- Except you, Eddie.

688
00:36:16,253 --> 00:36:17,566
No, wait, wait.

689
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,555
Hey. Hey, man. It's me, man.

690
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:23,975
- It's me. Let's talk.
- Go ahead... Talk.

691
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:27,186
- It's not like it looks, man.
- Yeah, I see that.

692
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,349
So your boy Eddie took a ride
with Valentine on his yacht.

693
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:38,659
Didn't come back.

694
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:40,785
And I believe

695
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:44,080
I owe you guys a little more
than thank you.

696
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,706
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

697
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:51,103
On the other hand, Fi needs new shoes.
Cover our expenses, we'll call it even.

698
00:36:53,657 --> 00:36:55,132
- That work for you?
- Mm-hmm.

699
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,552
I'm not gonna forget this.

700
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,471
You ever need anything...
I mean, anything...

701
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:02,981
Just say hello to your brother for me.

702
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:07,994
That's a deal.

703
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,403
The incendiary rounds you asked for.

704
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:18,061
Sounds like you're planning
quite a party.

705
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:19,625
You sure you don't need a date?

706
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:21,678
Victor's an invite-only type.

707
00:37:21,882 --> 00:37:25,544
He's willing to make a few corpses
just to get his hands on that box.

708
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:29,051
I need to take a look inside without him
turning this thing into a bloodbath.

709
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:32,061
So shoot Victor and take a look.
What's the problem?

710
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:33,713
I take out one of their operatives,

711
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,476
and then everyone I care about
is in danger, including you.

712
00:37:36,596 --> 00:37:39,034
No, I want this to go off
without a hitch.

713
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:41,204
And that's where these come in?

714
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:44,517
Just...

715
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,050
wish me luck.

716
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:55,724
Cute gun.

717
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,510
Look at you.

718
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,410
<i>Notorious for causing brush fires,</i>

719
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,423
<i>12-gauge incendiary rounds
create a small explosion</i>

720
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:27,358
<i>that burns at 3,000 degrees.</i>

721
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:30,728
<i>It'll also stop a car pretty well.</i>

722
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:33,667
<i>People don't drive
when their tires are on fire.</i>

723
00:38:42,577 --> 00:38:45,076
<i>Water sealant is a common sight
around Miami</i>

724
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:48,079
<i>where it's used to protect buildings
from hurricane flooding.</i>

725
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,202
<i>It's also extremely flammable,</i>

726
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:56,089
<i>which means it can be useful
in other ways, too.</i>

727
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:43,538
I dont like your field tactics.

728
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:46,311
I don't like your whining.
Are you gonna pout all night?

729
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:50,182
A little harmless gunfire attracts
less attention than a double homicide.

730
00:39:51,128 --> 00:39:53,644
I warned you what would happen
if you pulled another stunt, Michael.

731
00:39:56,071 --> 00:39:57,121
But that one

732
00:39:58,471 --> 00:39:59,996
had some style!

733
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:12,582
Bet you're dying
for a peek inside, aren't you?

734
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,755
No. You know what you're meant to know.

735
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:17,125
That's how it works, right, Victor?

736
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:20,213
You're learning, Michael.
I'll see you around.

737
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:31,639
Osso buco.

738
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:34,547
Newest weapon in my arsenal.

739
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,067
Not bad, Sam.

740
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:37,237
Bon apptit.

741
00:40:37,983 --> 00:40:39,065
I got to get going.

742
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:41,515
I got an appointment
to check out a townhouse.

743
00:40:41,635 --> 00:40:43,125
Looks right into a yoga studio.

744
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:45,988
I'm proud of you, Sam.
That's a big step.

745
00:40:46,148 --> 00:40:48,197
Thanks, Maddy. See you guys around.

746
00:40:48,317 --> 00:40:49,158
Uh, Sam.

747
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,118
Didn't you forget something?

748
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:55,838
Ooh, looks like bullets.

749
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:59,172
I found them in your pants.

750
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:00,834
I heard rattling around
in the washing machine

751
00:41:00,954 --> 00:41:03,828
- when I was doing your laundry.
- Yeah. 9 millimeter.

752
00:41:03,948 --> 00:41:06,884
Uh, hey. I don't know what to say.

753
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:09,762
I'd say nothing. Nothing's good.
Go with nothing.

754
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:16,158
I hope Sam wasn't
too much trouble, mom.

755
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:17,478
We had a lovely time.

756
00:41:18,598 --> 00:41:21,190
But the next time, Michael, that
you want someone to babysit me

757
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:23,067
just tell me.

758
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,186
Mom, I...

759
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:26,431
What, you didn't think
I was gonna figure it out?

760
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:29,119
I mean, he insisted on coming
to aqua aerobics with me.

761
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:31,189
I'm sorry you had to see that.

762
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:35,329
Thank you, Michael,

763
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:38,832
for trying to protect me from...

764
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:41,001
whatever it was.

765
00:41:47,523 --> 00:41:49,173
Did you bring the thing?

766
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:51,915
My friend from
the veterinary clinic said

767
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:54,885
she'd never seen a species
quite like this one.

768
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:04,315
Sniper rifle.

769
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:07,778
That's an awful lot of trouble
to go through for a gun.

770
00:42:07,938 --> 00:42:09,669
Must be for quite the occasion.

771
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:12,639
And they sure don't want me
to know what it is.
