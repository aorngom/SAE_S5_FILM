1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:01,709
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,137
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,709
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:09,776
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:12,094
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:14,729
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,098
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:18,998
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,438
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,399
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:28,277
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,655
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:33,074
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,284
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,912
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:39,789
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:48,148
<i>It's dangerous to say no to a spy.</i>

18
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:50,549
<i>In a business where motives
are questionable</i>

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,134
<i>and loyalty is skin-deep,</i>

20
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,054
<i>declining the wrong request
can earn you a trip to the morgue.</i>

21
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:59,836
<i>So if you're asked to soak
in a jacuzzi by a black-ops sociopath</i>

22
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:02,461
<i>who's paranoid
about listening devices,</i>

23
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,064
<i>you pick out your favorite trunks</i>

24
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,187
<i>and wade in.</i>

25
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,637
Come on in, Michael.
The water's warm.

26
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:11,237


27
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,695
- Am I being punished?
- Not at all.

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,776
I just thought we could use a spot
where we could talk freely

29
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,701
about our future together.

30
00:01:27,852 --> 00:01:30,156
I like you.
You know, like a friend, but...

31
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,765
You're cute.
But don't interrupt.

32
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,311
My mood's been a bit dodgy
since you failed to steal that file

33
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:35,761
I wanted from the Chileans.

34
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,846
I wouldn't say I failed
as much as your plan failed.

35
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:43,260
Don't partner me up again
and you'll get your file soon enough.

36
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,146
I won't.
The file's been destroyed.

37
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:50,014
And I confess my first thought
was to kill you and take my leave.

38
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:52,319
But, no.
We must keep calm and carry on.

39
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:53,738
Thanks?

40
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,698
I think I've sussed out a way
to get the information that I need.

41
00:01:56,823 --> 00:01:59,510
I'll leave the details to you,
but the gist is this.

42
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:03,497
You're to steal flight data for every
private plane flying in an out of Miami

43
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,315
for the next six weeks.

44
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:08,711
- What are you doing?
- Me? I'm offering you a job.

45
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,338
You do it, you get paid money.
That's all you need to know.

46
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:13,758
I don't like prison food.

47
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:16,625
Operations that have
to do with flight traffic...

48
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,989
Extremely risky.

49
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:19,930
I need to know more before I commit.

50
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,433
And I am telling you
that simply cannot be.

51
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,827
This is another moment of truth.

52
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:27,354
Do we have a future together or not?

53
00:02:30,894 --> 00:02:31,901
Double my fee.

54
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:33,527
The price of ignorance?

55
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,862
The price of privacy.

56
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:36,211
Fair enough.

57
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,283
Can I get out now?

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,957
I pushed as hard as I could, Sam.
He's not talking.

59
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,711
To be fair,
the guy's a scheming psychopath.

60
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,383
Keeping their cards
close to the vest is what they do.

61
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:01,806
You may have to stay in longer
to find out what he's holding.

62
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,593
I may lose my seat at the table
if I don't come up with six weeks'

63
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,143
worth of private flight records.

64
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,411
We could try the FAA, the DEA...

65
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,631
I was thinking the Coast Guard.

66
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:13,040
The navy's little sister.
That's a good choice.

67
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:14,825
How are you gonna get in?

68
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:16,987
Don't give me that look.

69
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,366
They hire ex-Seals all the time
for Homeland Security check-ups.

70
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,561
You could get one of your buddies
to hire you on for a temp gig.

71
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:25,651
You could get in, out,
no questions asked.

72
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:28,959
But the thing about buddies
is that they're your buddies.

73
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,585
You can't make them
unwitting accomplices to a felony.

74
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,171
Do you have an alternative
with a lower risk of a dead body?

75
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:37,883
Really. I don't want
to do this any more than you do.

76
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:41,220
All right, I'll do it.
But I'm getting an itchy feeling.

77
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,240
- You sure that's from a moral dilemma?
- That's not nice.

78
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,825
- Dead bolt was cut with a blowtorch.
- Probably not to steal your blender.

79
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:03,158
Sorry about the mess.

80
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,288
What are you doing here?

81
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,997
It's nice to see you, too.

82
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,165
And, Sam!

83
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:10,999
I also see you.

84
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,543
Seriously, pal,

85
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,213
we do 20 missions on 3 continents,
and this is how you greet me?

86
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,507
That was before you faked your own
death and came back without a soul.

87
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:21,376
Little harsh ?

88
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:24,227


89
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,140
You do kill people for money.

90
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,976
Last time we said goodbye, I was
staring at you through a sniper scope.

91
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,645
What made you think
I ever wanted to see you again?

92
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,082
Come on, now.
Don't be like that.

93
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:37,443
I am not here to kill you.

94
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,345
He was.

95
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,528
I saved your life.

96
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:43,574
All right, talk.

97
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,784
I'll explain,
after we get rid of this body.

98
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,762
I've been looking around this place,
trying to find something to stuff him in

99
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:51,422
so we can carry him out
without spooking your neighbors.

100
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,126
How attached are you to that couch?

101
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,632
Would you look at that?

102
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:04,845
Three to the chest.

103
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,723
He didn't even get a shot off.

104
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,658
I just get better with age.

105
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:11,727
That's a Santa Muerte tattoo.

106
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,812
Six tears.
It's a pro with half a dozen kills.

107
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,189
Pro? That's generous.

108
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,524
Six is a promising start, I guess.

109
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,776
Larry, why is a hitman
in my apartment?

110
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,863
Well, I think
that Juan Doe here would

111
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,115
have preferred the term "Sicario".

112
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:27,035
A cartel wants me dead?

113
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:28,509
Not exactly.

114
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:32,039
So far, it's only the guy who runs
their cash-processing center, Carlos.

115
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:34,291
He sent this fellow, and he wants

116
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,169
his money back
so he won't have to tell his bosses.

117
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:38,902
You robbed the Colombians?

118
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:41,013
2 million bucks!

119
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,885
They haul in
all this wrinkled-up street cash.

120
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,259
Dirty bills. They got to be cleaned
and sorted somewhere.

121
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:50,807
And then when I heard that these
idiots do it all in the same place...

122
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:52,768
You used my name to get close.

123
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,734
I'm a burned spy. I'm here to help.

124
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,188
It's a pretty good approach.

125
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,773
I mean, especially with
your dossier attached...

126
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,235
Okay. I admit,

127
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,820
we have a situation.

128
00:06:03,318 --> 00:06:04,363
I tried to close

129
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,345
the loop, but Carlos
wasn't there when I hit the place.

130
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,617
I killed four guys,

131
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,203
and he is angry.

132
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,415
I'm just gonna say it.
There's room for two in that couch.

133
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,506
It's heavy as it is.

134
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,129
Always such a softie.

135
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,623
I love this kid.

136
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:30,723
I got the perfect solution.
We feed

137
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,433
this body to the sharks,

138
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,954
and then you and I kill Carlos,

139
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,318
and I will give you
a brand-new identity.

140
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:41,400
That's your solution for Mike
to kill a man and go on the run?

141
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,862
Honestly, Michael, how do you put up
with this guy's constant mothering?

142
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,192
That is exactly the plan.

143
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:49,950
And it will work.

144
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:53,579
I have a whole new network.
Protection, guns,

145
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,330
IDs, and you...

146
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,723
will be safe under my wing.

147
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,170
You really think
I'm gonna be your partner?

148
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:06,508
I'm gonna give you 24 hours
to change your mind

149
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,349
and get in touch.

150
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:11,263
After that,
I got to think about my own liability.

151
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:14,359
Someone has to clean this up.

152
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,187
You're Larry Garber now?

153
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,506
With the kind of money I make, you can't
just leave it laying around the house.

154
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:24,650
You want to invest,
you need an identity.

155
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,580
And there was this shoe salesman
up in Buffalo,

156
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:31,033
and he was kind enough
to fall on a knife and give me his.

157
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:34,656
Think about it. Call me.

158
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,229
That guy sucks.

159
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,975
When you asked if you could come over,
you did not mention Sam.

160
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,602
It's nothing I haven't seen before.

161
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:00,938
I didn't want to get into details
on the phone.

162
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:04,023
I have a body in the trunk of my car,
and Larry's back.

163
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:07,401
And a cartel wants to kill Mike,
if you can take Larry's word for it,

164
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:08,945
which, you know, we can't.

165
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,030
Damn it.

166
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,040
The last time he was here,
you should have pulled the trigger.

167
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:15,485
No more bodies until we figure out
what I'm up against

168
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,665
and we find a place
to store the one we've got.

169
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,790
You can use my neighbor's apartment.

170
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,709
The place is tented for termites.
They're fumigating next week.

171
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:31,027
<i>Preserving a corpse is not
a frequent job requirement for a spy.</i>

172
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:36,675
<i>But if you must, stashing a body is
a lot like storing high explosives.</i>

173
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,727
<i>Air, water, and heat are the enemy.</i>

174
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,110
His name is Justino Valverde.

175
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,734
Not an organ donor,
in case you were feeling guilty.

176
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:50,070
So far, nobody's called him.

177
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,114
Fi and I can track down
where he lives.

178
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,950
Probably not a good idea for you
to show your face around cartel central.

179
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:57,504
Right. I'll lay low
and dig in to his phone.

180
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,567
I guess I got to go by
and alert my mom.

181
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:00,692
Nate, too.

182
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,978
You forgot your brother
was coming into town, didn't you?

183
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:09,275
Meet Mrs. Nate Westen.

184
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:11,318
Nate, you're married?

185
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:14,643
Yep! Me and Ruth
pulled the trigger Tuesday in Vegas.

186
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:17,418
Welcome to the family, new bro!

187
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:20,948
Your brother is so amazing!

188
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:24,021
We met last month
at my blackjack table and...

189
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,732
six decks with him,
and I was done.

190
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,368
Surprise, right?

191
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,565
They just arrived
just a little while ago, and I...

192
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,065
It still hasn't sunk in.

193
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,543
This is great.

194
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,539
To Nate and Ruby.

195
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:41,369
- Ruth.
- Ruth.

196
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,876
She's incredible, right?

197
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,799
She is. Yeah.

198
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,421
I have a problem.

199
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,753
There's a shocker.

200
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,633
I need you to watch mom.

201
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,440
Are you kidding me?

202
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,691
No, dude, this is,
like, my honeymoon, bro.

203
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:58,847
You want me to subject Ruth
to that right away?

204
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,183
I can appreciate that,
but I need you to keep an eye out.

205
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,309
Larry's in town.

206
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,144
Dead Larry? The assassin?

207
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,438
Take this. Don't tell mom.
She'll freak out.

208
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,956
I'm freaking out.

209
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,608
All right, fine.

210
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,860
But you got to check in...
Often.

211
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:13,844
Thank you. I mean that.

212
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,656
You know how to kill a buzz.

213
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,868
I have to go, but congratulations!
The two of you!

214
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,117
Michael, don't you da...

215
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:26,917
So, my cop buddy says this house has
gotten some noise complaints recently.

216
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,801
Bunch of young guys.

217
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:30,879
Probably sicarios waiting
around between hits.

218
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,085
It's sort of like a frat
house for cartel soldiers.

219
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,633
It looks like they installed
the security cameras themselves.

220
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,399
Coax coming from the inside.
There must be more in the house

221
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:40,326
so the bosses can keep an eye
on these guys.

222
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,566
And somebody forgot
to pay the gardener.

223
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:44,162
Lucky us.

224
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:51,108
<i>Sometimes, the least-secure parts
of a security system</i>

225
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,151
<i>are the security cameras themselves.</i>

226
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:57,579
<i>If leaves obstruct the lens because
the landscaping hasn't been maintained,</i>

227
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:00,055
<i>you can approach from a blind spot.</i>

228
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:08,650
<i>And if you get close enough,</i>

229
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:12,475
<i>borrowing the video feed
is as easy as stealing pay-per-view.</i>

230
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,344
This week on "casa de sicario",

231
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,462
the killers sleep late
and eat cereal for lunch.

232
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,939
You okay with the first shift here?
I've to exploit a friend

233
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:28,026
in the name of an unsanctioned
national security operation,

234
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:29,670
and I don't want to be late.

235
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:31,680
Helping Michael with Gilroy.

236
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:33,900
- Have fun.
- Yeah, define "fun".

237
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:42,457
That Gilroy bastard
better be worth it.

238
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:44,248
You got the stuff
from the coast guard?

239
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,040
And I feel like crap about it.

240
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:48,665
I'm pimping my SEAL ink down here, Mike.
It's disgusting.

241
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,167
<i>No more favors like this.</i>

242
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,960
And if your job goes sideways
and blows back on my friend,

243
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:55,547
you and me, we're gonna have
some problems, pal.

244
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:03,638
Justino's phone's a dry well.

245
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,406
Brand-new. His only calls
were his grandma and a pizza place.

246
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,600
You got here just in time.

247
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:12,105
We're meeting
a mysterious new character.

248
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:15,168
Some kind of boss type.
Showed up about five minutes ago.

249
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:16,777
I don't like him so far.

250
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,737
He's kind of a sourpuss.

251
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:21,345
So...

252
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:24,117
Just met Nate's wife.

253
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:29,535
- There's a Mrs. Nate Westen?
- Blackjack dealer he just met.

254
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:32,128
The whole thing seems
pretty well thought out.

255
00:12:33,445 --> 00:12:36,460
I say good for Nate. Good for him.
Life is short. You gotta grab it...

256
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:39,674
I should take this.
Looks like boss is texting the dead guy.

257
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:42,905
- Is it coded?
- Kind of.

258
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,425
It's in spanish.

259
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:47,432
Look, if it was
in Russian or Farsi, I...

260
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,775
"What's taking so long?"

261
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,648
Mystery solved.

262
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,358
This is the guy who wants you dead.

263
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:03,698
He called him "Apendejo".

264
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:06,295
That's like idiot, but ruder.

265
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:09,795
It says to hurry up with you,

266
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:12,249
get over to finish the job
at the hotel Victor.

267
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:16,745
Sounds like Larry forgot to mention
I'm not the only target.

268
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,807
You look upset.

269
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:33,728
- So, who's Carlos gunning for here?
- He's my front man.

270
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,606
I hired a guy to drop your name.
You'd have done the same thing.

271
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,817
He's a disposable part-time hustler.

272
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:40,610
You're working with an amateur?

273
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:42,085
Amateur criminal.

274
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,720
Professionally, he's a magician,
like for kids' parties.

275
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:46,945
Great card tricks.
Great smile.

276
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:48,493
Jack Fleetwood.

277
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,165
Real name's Yablonski.

278
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,290
Not too bright.

279
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:53,440
Sleeps with the manager,
so he stays for free.

280
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:56,293
- I'm surprised he's still breathing.
- I was gonna take care of him later.

281
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:02,520
"Tu air-es"...
"Tu airs"...

282
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:03,645
"Eries"?

283
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:06,261
You have lived in Miami
for how long?

284
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:08,725
He's calling him "Apen..."

285
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,850
It's sort of like an idiot,
but ruder.

286
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:15,628
And he's saying he is sending
some more guys over

287
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:17,353
to clean things up.

288
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:22,860
Look. Nature's taking its course.
We can just relax.

289
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,405
Relax? You think I want
a police investigation into this?

290
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,490
- My name is attached.
- I told you I could give you a new one.

291
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,365
Why bother saving some poor schmuck?

292
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:37,065
Coming, Nina.

293
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:48,621
- Michael. Hey, what's going on?
- I'm Michael.

294
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,455
Okay, two Michaels.
What's going on?

295
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,808
We'll explain later.
I just need you to get dressed.

296
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,905
- Why?
- A Colombian cartel wants you dead.

297
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,004
They're sending
a couple of guys over to kill you.

298
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,129
What?

299
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:01,448
Is this about those latin guys
you had me talk to?

300
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:03,538
- Didn't I say I'll explain later?
- They're here.

301
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,196
- No more bodies.
- You got a better idea?

302
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,557
Does this room have a pool view?

303
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:24,285
I said a better idea!

304
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,640
- Can't we climb over there?
- It's safe. Hit the mattress.

305
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:29,588
If you stay on this floor,
they will hunt you down and kill you.

306
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:35,642
<i>The key to surving a fall
into shallow water</i>

307
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,623
<i>is safely displacing
your body's mass.</i>

308
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:44,645
<i>A flat surface floating on top</i>

309
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,654
<i>can help absorb and distribute
your weight evenly.</i>

310
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,823
<i>Miss the target...</i>

311
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,826
<i>And you may as well be jumping
right onto concrete.</i>

312
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:54,925
I think I broke my foot!

313
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,843
Crazy, huh?

314
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:12,556
Why would you bring him here?
I want that nut job out of my house!

315
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,071
It's not like he didn't
already know your address.

316
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:17,712
- Why would that make me feel better?
- If I let him out of my sight,

317
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,617
that's when he starts
killing everyone.

318
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:21,271
I really think

319
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,649
it would be better
if I kept this elevated on the bed.

320
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,096
Forget it, Houdini.

321
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,621
That is a Hungarian
goose-down duvet.

322
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:30,238
Listen, Michael, I...

323
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,242
I apologize
about all this cartel stuff.

324
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:36,161
But can you help me out?

325
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:38,038
'cause I'm really confused.

326
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,877
Jack, you and I have a problem.

327
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:41,958
This guy, Carlos, you talked to,

328
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,962
he thinks
we robbed him of $2 million

329
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,180
and killed four of his friends.

330
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:53,801
So, we need to convince him
that somebody else did it,

331
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:56,973
preferably somebody who's already dead
so the body count doesn't go any higher.

332
00:16:57,764 --> 00:17:00,814
We need to convince Carlos
this was an inside job.

333
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,571
His own sicario,
Justino Valverde, robbed him.

334
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:08,269
And this is something you're...

335
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:10,058
hopefully really good at.

336
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:12,296
We zero out Justino's bank account,

337
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:14,806
buy some conflicting airline tickets,
some clothes...

338
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:17,457
It'll look like this guy
stole Carlos' money

339
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,829
and is about to skip town
with the cash.

340
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:21,957
Got it.

341
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,208
He didn't.

342
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,501
Like an illusion.

343
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,590
- I'm starting to regret saving him.
- He knows too much now.

344
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,866
You can't have the cartel find him.

345
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:34,431
What's going on?

346
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:37,075
You guys making some
kind of decision?

347
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:42,519


348
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:53,921
<i>Orchestrating a fake sighting
isn't a job that calls for subtlety.</i>

349
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:56,449
<i>It's not enough to dress
an imposter in the right clothes.</i>

350
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,759
Am I doing all right?

351
00:17:57,884 --> 00:18:00,118


352
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:04,701
You are doing just fine, Justino.

353
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,543
You're kinky.

354
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,911
And I like it.

355
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:09,946
<i>You need to make grand gestures</i>

356
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:12,721
<i>and attract attention
to colorful details.</i>

357
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,302
Justino here thinks
that his tattoo is sexy.

358
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,012
I think it's scary.
Who's right?

359
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,348
It's Santa Muerte.

360
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:23,727
<i>Do it right,
and eyewitnesses will be lining up</i>

361
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,545
<i>to swear they saw a dead man
buying drinks.</i>

362
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,707
Drinks are on you, my friend.

363
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:30,953
This round is on Justino!

364
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,944
He just inherited a fortune!

365
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,951
You need to get out of town.
Go vacation in the Keys.

366
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,111
Go now.

367
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:42,537
And burn the clothes.

368
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,617
<i>Every class of criminal
has their own set of fears.</i>

369
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:55,303
<i>Usually,
the bogeyman lives in the mirror.</i>

370
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:57,400
<i>Thieves triple-lock their doors.</i>

371
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:00,339
<i>Embezzlers check
their bank accounts obsessively.</i>

372
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:02,064
<i>And cartel soldiers...</i>

373
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,868
<i>get the hell out of any car
that won't start right away.</i>

374
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,855
- I'm Michael Westen. Good to meet you.
- What the hell...

375
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:15,502
You think I have your money?
That's all the money I have!

376
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:17,894
- You better kill me now.
- You're not the first person

377
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,116
- to tell me that today.
- You think you can rob me?

378
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,036
- Me?
- I didn't rob you, Carlos!

379
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,454
Your boy Justino did.

380
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:27,332
I never even heard of you
until I got wind

381
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,700
some cartel lackey wanted me dead!

382
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:32,796
This punk, Jack, he told me...

383
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,590
He told you
what Justino said to tell you!

384
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,176
- Justino would never betray me.
- Really?

385
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,120
I think you have too much faith

386
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,180
in the bond you share
with a mass murderer.

387
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,419
I got a call, Carlos.

388
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:48,311
Your boy Justino was spotted at a bar
down on South Beach five hours ago.

389
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:49,938
Since then, nothing.

390
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,022
He's probably gonna blow town.

391
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:53,107
Son of a bitch.

392
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,236
- If this don't check out...
- What? You gonna kill me?

393
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:57,922
Find him, Carlos.

394
00:19:58,047 --> 00:19:59,966
Do it fast, do it alone.

395
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:03,785
Trust the wrong sicario again,
the next time your car doesn't start...

396
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,367
you might not be missing
a spark plug.

397
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:19,641
How do you know
that you don't want to live there?

398
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:21,681
You've never even been to Vegas!

399
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:23,596
You have to at least
give it a chance.

400
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,637
I am not some old woman

401
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:28,393
that you can pack away
into a retirement village.

402
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:29,644
You...

403
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:32,354
do not get to tell me where to live.

404
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,017
Who said anything
about a retirement village?

405
00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:36,708
I just want you close by,

406
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,695
someplace where spies and killers

407
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,989
aren't crawling out of the woodwork
every other week.

408
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,707
Someplace safe.

409
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,033
You know, Vegas is amazing.

410
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:48,496
The weather is amazing. Someday,
you're gonna have grandkids there.

411
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:51,708
Don't you think living
near them would just be...

412
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:52,876
Amazing?

413
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,340
Are you gonna smoke that in here?

414
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:12,020
You want mom to move to Vegas?

415
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,479
I want you on my side.

416
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:15,815
Tell her it's too dangerous here.
She'll listen.

417
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,234
- She never listens to me.
- Can you at least try?

418
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,361
Give her a minute to cool down.

419
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,699
Maybe give her a day.

420
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:33,124
Is this your card?
4 of spades.

421
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,292
Still no.

422
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:39,235
Mike, you better look at this.

423
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:44,385
We have got hundreds
of individually logged flights here.

424
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:47,180
Tail numbers, nav points,
clearance codes.

425
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,050
Everything you need to create
mayhem in the sky for a month.

426
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,060
And Chuck Finley didn't get this stuff,
Sam Axe did.

427
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:56,189
That's not even the point.
We shouldn't be giving this to Gilroy.

428
00:21:56,475 --> 00:21:57,607
Is this your card?

429
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:59,776
For God's sake, man,
it's the 3 of clubs.

430
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:06,269
Okay, that's not Fi, 'cause she went out
for food, like, five minutes ago.

431
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,330
Got to hand it to you, kid,
I had my doubts.

432
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:18,892
- What are you talking about?
- Well, your plan, it worked.

433
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:22,448
I've been following Carlos all day long.
Come here. Take a look at this.

434
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:26,766
There hasn't been anything this good on
at 10:00 in a long time.

435
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:30,974
Look at him trashing that place.
Justino's not in that couch, my friend.

436
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,149
- Come on. Enough!
- You're not killing him.

437
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,902
You don't get it, do you?
Your plan worked!

438
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,416
It's time to dump Justino
and this chucklehead

439
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:46,930
on Carlos' front stoop

440
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:48,320
and walk away!

441
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,284
- Put the knife down, Larry.
- Or what?

442
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:53,037
Your trigger finger has rusted off!

443
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:57,185
- What the hell was that?
- He warned you.

444
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,310
Look, there's not gonna be
any more blood,

445
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:01,170
just as soon as your hand
stops dripping.

446
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,340
I am not talking to you, boy scout!

447
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,967
This is my show, Larry,
and I need him alive.

448
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,678
He's gonna point Carlos
to the money you stole!

449
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,264
You think I'm giving up
2 million bucks now?

450
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:13,474
Yeah, I do.

451
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,380
<i>The key to fake surveillance
is delivering real boredom.</i>

452
00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:36,120
<i>If someone suffers for the information
you're feeding them,</i>

453
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:38,190
<i>they're much more likely
to belive it.</i>

454
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:41,210
- Can I get one of them chips, man?
- What's "No" in spanish? Still "No"?

455
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,044
You didn't tell me we were gonna be here
all day. I'm hungry.

456
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:50,178
- Why don't you just go snatch his ass?
- How'd that work out for you last time?

457
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,846
I told you. Jack's too protected.

458
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,974
He's had guys watching him ever since
your boys missed him at the hotel.

459
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,311
I don't care. We can't just
sit around here all day. We got to act.

460
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:11,157
Showtime, buddy. Just read the script
exactly the way I wrote it.

461
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,493
Listen, listen.

462
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,787
- <i>What's up, Tino?</i>
- He's talking to Justino.

463
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,664
The boat slip on Grove Isle?
Yeah, 5:00's good.

464
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,160
<i>I can be there.
Should I bring a bag?</i>

465
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:22,892
Maricon is talking about his cut.

466
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:27,005
If you got it all with you, you got
to let me take a look at the whole pile.

467
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:29,675
<i>I mean, I bet
it barely fits in the trunk.</i>

468
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,575
That's beautiful, amigo.

469
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:32,804
<i>All right.</i>

470
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,479
When Justino shows up at his meeting,
he's gonna be so dead.

471
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:44,010
Fi, we're on.

472
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:46,859
If you've been procrastinating,
you can't anymore.

473
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,237
We got the money in the trunk.
Just waiting on Justino.

474
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:52,384
Tell Michael the next time
he asks me for a favor,

475
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:55,359
I'm gonna ask him what it is
before I say yes.

476
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,695
Fiona, don't shoot.

477
00:24:58,255 --> 00:24:59,555
I let myself in.

478
00:25:00,436 --> 00:25:02,974
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Just gonna go out on a limb

479
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:05,920
and guess you've never dressed a corpse,
so I'm here to help.

480
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,556
- I'm not interested in...
- Come on, let me put it another way.

481
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,920
If this job goes south
because you screwed up,

482
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,945
everybody is gonna end up...

483
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,178
Very sad.

484
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,933
Here, hand me that shirt.

485
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:22,645
It's a hell of a lot easier
when you stitch 'em in.

486
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,021
Your mom must be proud.

487
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,358
You're gonna pretend
that we have nothing in common, huh?

488
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:31,137
We both have certain capacities
and certain appetites,

489
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:33,447
and that is how
we connect with Michael.

490
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:35,283
You don't know the first thing
about him.

491
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,180
Sometimes,
you're just what he needs.

492
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:40,674
And then sometimes,

493
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:42,123
he pushes you away.

494
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:48,504
Do those have cucumber in them?

495
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,615
I'm allergic.

496
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,759
Well, I have cold cuts
in the fridge.

497
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:57,930
I thought I told you.
I'm trying to stay away from protein.

498
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:03,670
I'd like to talk about Vegas again.

499
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,356
What about what I want?
Does that matter in this discussion?

500
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,846
I think what Nate's trying to say is

501
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:11,527
you might feel better.

502
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,072
We all might feel better, maybe,
if you were someplace safer.

503
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,950
Like 3,000 miles away safer?

504
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:22,663
Look! Cucumber salad.

505
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:25,625
I'm sorry that I'm late
and that I can't stay.

506
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:27,210
Can I talk to you for a minute?

507
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:36,844
I just had a visit
from your old pal, Larry.

508
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:38,960
Okay, don't believe
everything he says.

509
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:41,200
He said that you worked together
for three years.

510
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:43,643
That's true, but the government thought
we were a good team...

511
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,618
After all you saw him do...

512
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:50,190
I don't know how you can stay
in the same room with him.

513
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:52,190
I can't be with you right now.

514
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:54,654
You need help with Carlos,
you can ask Sam.

515
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:02,370
Mikey, it's time
to celebrate my genius.

516
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,839
I was going blind futzing
with all that flight data on my laptop,

517
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,917
so I went old school,

518
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,211
and I figured out
which flight Gilroy's after.

519
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,545
All right, every page

520
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:13,339
is a flight plan.

521
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,915
This is every flight today.

522
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,629
It's like pick-up sticks.
It's all criss-cross.

523
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:22,598
It's a big cluster,
and every day is exactly like that,

524
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,016
except one day.

525
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,103
The 22nd.

526
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,771
Somebody needs a wide berth.

527
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,066
You get that
when it's mandated by the government.

528
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,276
This is some kind
of serious black flight, Mike.

529
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,445
And I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts
this is what Gilroy is interested in,

530
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,072
and this is all he's gonna get.

531
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:41,141
You're probably right
about which flight he's after,

532
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:43,661
but he asked for all of it,
every flight.

533
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:45,997
You think you get to make
this call alone?

534
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,499
I'm on the line here.
My friend is on the line.

535
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,873
Every person on every one
of those planes is on the line.

536
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:53,462
You said it yourself,
he's only after one flight.

537
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,924
But what is to stop him from selling
the rest to the highest bidder?

538
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,581
- We won't let that happen.
- You're right.

539
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,095
We won't.

540
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:02,670
You want this data, Mike?

541
00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:05,683
You're gonna have to steal it yourself,
'cause I'm not gonna give it to you.

542
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,546
If that makes me the boy scout that you
and your friend Larry think I am,

543
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:10,835
I'm okay with that.

544
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,484
I am not gonna help you anymore
until you get your head out of your ass.

545
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:19,780
You want back-up at your meeting
with Carlos, call Fi.

546
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:32,315
4:45.
Justino got here early.

547
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:41,499
He won't look so peaceful
when I'm done with him.

548
00:28:41,624 --> 00:28:43,038
What do you think you're doing?

549
00:28:43,163 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm gonna go pull his fingers off.

550
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:48,455
I got to talk to this guy, see if
the rest of my crew was in on this.

551
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,890
How the hell did you get put
in charge of anything?

552
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:53,064
We're not getting
within 100 yards of that guy.

553
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,015
You don't know
what kind of backup he has.

554
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,570
What is that doing in my trunk?

555
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,947
I put it there.
I'm gonna do him from here.

556
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,928
When we know he's alone, we'll go
down there and collect your money.

557
00:29:05,053 --> 00:29:07,412
- Then you can do whatever you want.
- Hold on, no, no.

558
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,500
He robbed me, okay.
He killed my men.

559
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,290
Give it to me.
I get the honors.

560
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,508
Don't miss.

561
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:18,714
You see what you get, pendejo?

562
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:27,755
It's all here.

563
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:30,893
I guess I got to let you
off the hook, huh?

564
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:33,200
- So, we're good?
- We're great.

565
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:36,290
<i>Large amounts of cash
present a huge temptation...</i>

566
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:40,421
<i>to steal, to kill for,
to counterfeit.</i>

567
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,279
There's no security strip,
no thread.

568
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,031
Are you trying to pull something?

569
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,450
- Were you in on this?
- That doesn't make any sense.

570
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,310
You run a cash-processing center.

571
00:29:48,435 --> 00:29:50,454
Why would I shove
monopoly money in your face?

572
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:52,665
Don't be stupid.
Put the gun away.

573
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,554
I ain't got to let you
call me stupid no more!

574
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,833
Justino must have been trying
to screw his partner over!

575
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,143
This is not my fault!

576
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:01,201
It's your fault
I can't have him alive!

577
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:03,008
I can't ask him
where is the real money!

578
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,626
I can find the money,
and you know it.

579
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,765
You shoot me, it's gone forever.

580
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:13,769
You got one day
to come up with my cash.

581
00:30:14,015 --> 00:30:16,521
You put it in the trunk of a car.
You park it by the airport.

582
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:18,941
You let me know.
You do that, I take off the hit.

583
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,485
If not...

584
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:26,395
<i>Cabrón.</i>

585
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:36,555
<i>This is Fi. Leave a message.</i>

586
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:38,090
Larry swapped the money.

587
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:41,292
I don't know where he is
or what he's doing. Call me back.

588
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,825
<i>You've reached the voicemail
for Sam Axe.</i>

589
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:49,499
Larry, what the hell
were you thinking?

590
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:51,165
Michael, I'm sorry you're upset.

591
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,301
I pulled that last-minute switcheroo
for your own good, okay?

592
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:57,537
- We should get together, I wanna talk.
- You meet at my loft in one hour,

593
00:30:57,662 --> 00:30:59,585
and if you're not there,
if you try to run,

594
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,110
I will find you,
and I will kill you!

595
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:13,645
Sorry.

596
00:31:14,245 --> 00:31:16,999
Couldn't walk away from 2 million bucks.
Not gonna happen.

597
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,321
I need that money.

598
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,685
I'll give you half of it
if you do this my way.

599
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,200
Kill Carlos.

600
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:24,825
My head is
on the chopping block, Larry.

601
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:28,155
You don't think
I'll end you to save myself?

602
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:31,931
I know you would.
And that is what I love about you, kid.

603
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:36,140
But I'm not the guy
who sent people to end your life.

604
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:38,521
All you have to do is kill him.

605
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:43,410
You're at a fork in the road.

606
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,585
I know you.

607
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:46,487
This is not a tough call.

608
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:49,865
Killing Carlos
does not solve my problem!

609
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:53,035
- My name... It's in the air!
- I'll give you a new one.

610
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,457
- I'll protect you.
- You're a shoe salesman from Buffalo!

611
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,082
I have connections.
I have guns.

612
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:02,294
And I also have what you need most...
The will.

613
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:05,990
The will to act on our instincts,

614
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:07,628
to get what we want.

615
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:10,010
And what I want
is to work with you again.

616
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:14,515
I'll cut the head off the whole cartel
if that's what it takes.

617
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:18,395
But you know what's sad?

618
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:21,564
I don't see anyone else
stepping up to bail you out.

619
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:26,585
It's do-or-die time, kid.

620
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,937
What's it gonna be?

621
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:32,736
<i>After a career spent doing
bad things for good reasons,</i>

622
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:34,994
<i>it's hard to say exactly
where you draw the line.</i>

623
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:37,997
<i>You might not know exactly.</i>

624
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:40,791
<i>Until someone asks.</i>

625
00:32:41,735 --> 00:32:42,800
I'll kill Carlos.

626
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:44,712
You take care of the rest.

627
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:03,525
Mike, open up! It's Nate!

628
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:12,965
There you are.

629
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:14,825
Not a great time.

630
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,954
Whatever.
You got me watching out for our mom.

631
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,622
You won't even answer my calls?

632
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,081
- What?
- What do you mean?

633
00:33:21,206 --> 00:33:23,685
I wanted to see if there was anything
I could do to help with Larry.

634
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:26,325
I left you, like, three messages.

635
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:29,882
<i>Turning an asset
is a multi-step process.</i>

636
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,910
<i>You back them into a corner,
you pile on stress,</i>

637
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:35,490
<i>you create tension
with the people they trust,</i>

638
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:38,060
<i>and if you can cut them off
from good influences</i>

639
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:40,017
<i>so you're the only voice
in their ear...</i>

640
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,185
Damn it.

641
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:42,853
<i>they're more likely to listen.</i>

642
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,897
- Did Larry...
- He knows I check for bugs.

643
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,525
He switched out my sim card,
used call forwarding, isolated me.

644
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,610
<i>It's a formula that works so well,</i>

645
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:53,364
<i>it even works on spies
who ought to know better.</i>

646
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,366
You thought no one
was answering your calls?

647
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,458
Jesus, bro. Dad's dead.

648
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:00,110
You're not in Afghanistan anymore.
I mean...

649
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:02,581
When are you gonna learn
there are people you can trust?

650
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:13,260
You ever have one
of these Cuban coffees? Cortaditos.

651
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,052
Fun to drink, fun to say.

652
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,120
Cortaditos.

653
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:18,614
You know, I've been thinking.
If we're going to do this,

654
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,838
I want to be thorough,
leave no trace, leave no teeth.

655
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:25,229
That's good.
That's a bumper sticker. I love that.

656
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,400
Forget shooting Carlos.
We're gonna blow up his cash room.

657
00:34:30,345 --> 00:34:33,545
We'll take the whole building down
with Carlos in it.

658
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:37,028
If it looks enough like a car bomb,

659
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:39,493
the cops will think
rival dealers did it.

660
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,311
No, I get it, I just...

661
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:43,545
I'm not sure I buy it.

662
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:46,625
A new violent plan
at the last minute?

663
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:49,590
What happened to Saint Michael?

664
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:51,922
- People don't change overnight.
- Well, I haven't.

665
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,290
That's why I'm pushing it to 3:00.

666
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:57,803
It will give me time to clear out
as many tenants as possible.

667
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:00,472
There's the old softie.

668
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,875
I'm kidding.
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.

669
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,396
This is a big step forward.

670
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,954
Are we in business?
'cause if we are, I want my money fast.

671
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,275
We're gonna have to run.

672
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,302
Relax.
I can get it really quick.

673
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:15,277
My bags are already packed.

674
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:18,949
3:00. Don't be late, Larry.

675
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,815
Michael Westen back in action.

676
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,390
I wouldn't miss it.

677
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:34,335
I've said I'm sorry before, right?

678
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,550
- I'm not sure.
- <i>I need help.</i>

679
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,969
My plan with Carlos fell apart,
and I'm scrambling.

680
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:41,560
<i>I need to find out
where Larry stashed his money.</i>

681
00:35:41,685 --> 00:35:43,690
Well, if I were him,
I would keep it close.

682
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:46,070
But I would want it someplace
where you would look guilty

683
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:47,728
if he had to bag out on the job.

684
00:35:50,745 --> 00:35:54,526
Can you meet me at the loft?
Sam, we're gonna celebrate your genius.

685
00:35:58,095 --> 00:35:59,395
My punching bag.

686
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,358
You know, he actually laughed
when he said,

687
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,115
"My bags are packed".

688
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,255
$2 million.

689
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:07,675
It's all there.

690
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:09,365
What's next?

691
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:11,960
I need to apologize.

692
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,964
I should have listened to you.

693
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:19,384
It's all right, buddy. You were marked
for death. It got to you.

694
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,261
I know I let Larry get too close.

695
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:25,515
You let him crawl inside your head
and make a nest.

696
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,172
There's a part of me...

697
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:35,651
This part that's like him.

698
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:37,611
But it's just a part.

699
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:40,697
And it gets smaller
the longer I'm with you.

700
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:49,215
Tell me you're done with him...

701
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:50,965
- Forever.
- I am.

702
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:52,584
I want him gone.

703
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:56,605
How can I help?

704
00:36:57,035 --> 00:36:59,424
I need you to help me
make a very special bomb.

705
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:07,610
How did you decide
on the binary liquids?

706
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:09,726
They're stable,
easy to smuggle as separates,

707
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,077
exotic, so the cops won't know
what they're looking at.

708
00:37:12,202 --> 00:37:13,796
It's beautiful. That's just beautiful.

709
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:16,692
You know what?
We are gonna have so much fun.

710
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:18,820
I don't think we will.

711
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,290
I dropped off Carlos' money
at the airport this morning.

712
00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:22,635
He called off the hit.

713
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,783
Me and Carlos, we're straight.
Well, we're gonna be.

714
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,236
You shouldn't have done that, kid.
That is not your money to give away!

715
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:31,349
What's with the gun? I let you live,
and you're gonna feed me to the sharks?

716
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:33,876
You betrayed me.
You know I will.

717
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,140
You know what?

718
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:39,006
I don't have to.
I'm gonna leave you here.

719
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,883
You're gonna be a smoldering corpse.

720
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,969
What are you talking about?
There's no bomb, Larry.

721
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:51,335
You framed him.

722
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:53,937
Right, nice.
And the binary liquid?

723
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:55,522
Counterfeiting ink.

724
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:58,010
The laptop is just full of graphics.

725
00:37:58,135 --> 00:38:01,320
And what was Carlos doing
with a bunch of scans of $20 bills?

726
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:06,700
Probably printing about $2 million
worth of fake bills in this dumpster.

727
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:09,145
You know what? I don't get you.

728
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,911
You don't think his bosses
will have him killed in prison?

729
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:13,165
Carlos made a choice.

730
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,209
He chose to work for the cartel.
I make my own choices!

731
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,170
I don't kill anyone
unless I have to!

732
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,715
- Yeah, well, we are different that way.
- You're not gonna kill me.

733
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:24,927
Not when the cops are coming
to talk to Larry Garber,

734
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,679
the man who called in a report
that he saw men with guns,

735
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:29,932
a dumpster filled with fake cash.

736
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,233
Having an identity
has its drawbacks, huh, Larry?

737
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:34,035
You forget
who you're dealing with here?

738
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,396
I faked my own death once.

739
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,483
Sure, but what about Larry Garber's
investments and his bank accounts?

740
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:42,700
They'll sit on that money,
and they'll wait for you.

741
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:46,073
You shoot me, and all that money
is as good as gone.

742
00:38:46,595 --> 00:38:48,075
You're at a fork in the road.

743
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,405
Go broke and go to jail

744
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,209
or run from the cartel
and live to fight another day.

745
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:53,580
I know you, man.

746
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,499
This isn't even a tough call.

747
00:38:59,285 --> 00:39:01,880
There will be another day, Michael.

748
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:03,164
Let me do you a favor.

749
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:05,641
I'll take this and hide it for you.

750
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,016
You're a hero, Larry. Larry Garber.

751
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,138
Officer! Officer, please!

752
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:15,102
Thank you for coming!
Thank you!

753
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,354
This way!
Right over here in the trunk!

754
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:28,156
Listen, I can't thank you enough.

755
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,190
You've been so cool about this.

756
00:39:30,315 --> 00:39:33,220
Jack, remember.
You're no longer Jack Fleetwood.

757
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:35,998
You're Jack Yablonski again,
forever.

758
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:39,095
I'm psyched about that.

759
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:41,987
Be safe, man.

760
00:39:42,585 --> 00:39:43,880
And, Jack, seriously,

761
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,554
if you ever come back to Miami,

762
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,808
or if I ever hear
the name Fleetwood again,

763
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,583
I will kill you myself.

764
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:51,825
Have a safe trip.

765
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:03,224
Wish we didn't have
to take off so soon.

766
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,446
It was wonderful having you.

767
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:12,993
Wish you could stay longer.

768
00:40:14,265 --> 00:40:16,715
We do, too,
but, you know, work.

769
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,410
One more day, she was gonna file
for an annulment. You owe me, bro.

770
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:22,061
You drive safe.

771
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,086
Bye, Ruth.

772
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:24,796
Bye!

773
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:33,150
So, you sorry
I'm not leaving with them?

774
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:36,070
Mom, I did not say
I wanted you to leave.

775
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:38,950
I said if you wanted
to live someplace safer,

776
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:40,141
closer to them,

777
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:41,516
I'd understand.

778
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:44,450
Well, I'm happy for Nate.

779
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,980
It's time that he settled down
and built a life.

780
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:48,405
But I have mine.

781
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:50,185
It's here...

782
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:52,135
With you...

783
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:54,675
And Sam and Fiona.

784
00:40:57,725 --> 00:40:59,875
Plus, I can't stand that woman.

785
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:14,410
<i>Weighing operational risk is tricky</i>

786
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:16,306
<i>when your life is on one side
of the scale.</i>

787
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:20,179
<i>Withholding flight-plan data
may put your life in danger,</i>

788
00:41:20,304 --> 00:41:22,179
<i>but you try to remember
that if you jeopardized</i>

789
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:24,359
<i>thousands of innocent lives
to save your own,</i>

790
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:26,358
<i>you wouldn't want to live
with yourself anyway.</i>

791
00:41:27,055 --> 00:41:29,736
You're a tad overdressed
for the jacuzzi, don't you think?

792
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:32,845
Is this your card?

793
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:34,991
It's blatantly not six weeks
of flight plans.

794
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,009
Just the one that you want.

795
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:41,289
Chile to Poland,
tail number 4 Whiskey X-ray Alpha 803.

796
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,793
Registered to a faceless corporation
in Santiago.

797
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:47,629
What's so special about the plane?

798
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:52,342
- What happened to the price of privacy?
- You hired an operative, not a child.

799
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:54,594
I need to know
what's going to Poland.

800
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:56,535
Right.

801
00:41:58,995 --> 00:42:01,351
Well, I suppose
it's only natural to be curious.

802
00:42:01,905 --> 00:42:03,105
I'll tell you.

803
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:07,045
It's a weaponized plague
and a vaccine to match.

804
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:10,485
- They're worth a bloody lot of money.
- That wasn't so hard, was it?

805
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:11,862
You're in?

806
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:15,804
I think you and I
have a bright future together.

807
00:42:24,735 --> 00:42:27,470
- Learn anything?
- Only that he's a damn good liar.

808
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:30,050
Tried to sell me some line
about a bioweapon,

809
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:32,250
but it took him a little too long
to come up with it.

810
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,840
Back to square one, then.

811
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:35,785
You're gonna have
to keep doing some digging.

812
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,571
I'm gonna need some help, Sam.

813
00:42:38,565 --> 00:42:39,715
Imagine that.
