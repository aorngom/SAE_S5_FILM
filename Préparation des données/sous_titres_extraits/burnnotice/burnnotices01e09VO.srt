1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,000
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,000
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,600
We got a burn notice.
you're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,000
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,500
<i>no cash, no credit,
no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,800
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,600
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,900
<i>You do whatever work
comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,000
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,800
<i>A trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend...</i>

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,200
Should we shoot them?

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,500
<i>... an old friend who's
informing on you to the FBI...</i>

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,200
you know spies...
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:31,900
<i>... family, too...</i>

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,900
Is that your mom again?

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>... if you're desperate.
someone needs your help.</i>

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,800
<i>Bottom line... until
you figure out who burned you,</i>

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,200
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,600
You must be getting used to this.

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,800
Isn't there a part of you that's
beginning to like Miami?

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,100
It's fine. "fine"?

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,400
There are people who come here
from all over the world.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,100
They don't have water front
like this in afghanistan.

24
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,200
It doesn't rain as much,
either, there.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,500
There are pleasant parts
of Afghanistan.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,100
The mountains are nice.

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,500
Maybe we can
vacation there someday.

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,100
Oh, when you can travel again,
of course...

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,000
some special occasion.

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,800
Speaking of which,
it's my birthday in a few days.

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,300
Did you get me anything yet?

32
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,500
Yeah, I got you something.

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,700
You know, for someone who's worked

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,500
as professional liar
for most of his career,

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,600
you're not terribly good at it
when it counts.

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,300
What's he doing...
your mystery man?

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
Getting heatstroke, it looks like.

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,700
Well, Michael,
I'm pretending that I'm here

39
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
for more than just tactical backup.

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,000
we're supposed to be playing
boyfriend and girlfriend.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,800
Do you want me to get you
a shaved ice, Fi?

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,300
I mean, I need someone, okay?

43
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,500
what's this guy's name again?

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,100
Perry Clark... that's the name
he gave me on the phone.

45
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,800
And he said he was here
to review your status?

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,500
That's desk-jockey jargon
for what, now?

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
He may be able to get me
off the blacklist,

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,900
revoke my burn notice.

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,000
And now you're about
to piss him off on purpose.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,800
just a precaution, Fi.
I have learned to be careful.

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,900
<i>work around spies for a while,
and you learn to be careful</i>

52
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,200
<i>when it looks like you're
getting what you want.</i>

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,200
<i>that's when you tend to let
your guard down, get careless.</i>

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,300
look at him, Michael.
he's a cubicle monkey.

55
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,700
<i>calling the cops on someone
can teach you a lot.</i>

56
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,200
<i>a foreign agent would run.
so might an armed assassin.</i>

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,800
<i>a bureaucrat's going to act
like a bureaucrat.</i>

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,300
you can't look in that, sir!

59
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,000
I think he just passed
your little test.

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
well, aren't you gonna talk to him?

61
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,300
now might not be the best time.

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Clark: I'm going to slowly reach
into my left inside pocket

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,700
with my right hand and give
you my I.D., very slowly.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
everybody remain calm.
I work with css.

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,500
http://www.ragbear.com

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,100
I have been
more than patient, Mr. Westen.

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,600
I was willing to meet you
in a public park,

68
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,700
as you requested,
rather than my office.

69
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,500
I came down in the middle
of my workday.

70
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,600
I'm sorry.
I must have missed you.

71
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,500
yeah, I had a conversation
with the police

72
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,700
about a suspicious man
matching my description.

73
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,200
you're not the first field op
I've dealt with, Mr. Westen.

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,000
believe me, I've been vetted
every which way.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,700
maybe we can set up
a new time.

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,400
I have had enough of new times
and places and tests.

77
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,100
I hope I don't have
to remind you

78
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,500
that my recommendation
carries weight

79
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
when it comes to removing you
from this blacklist.

80
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,200
<i>bureaucrats live for respect.</i>

81
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,600
<i>east of the balkans,
that means a bribe.</i>

82
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,500
<i>in the west,</i>

83
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,900
<i>it's more about showing
you know they're in charge.</i>

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
and I expect a little more
consideration for my time.

85
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
yeah, I apologize.
it won't happen again.

86
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,700
it's just I talked
with a man on the phone

87
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,800
who burned me recently.

88
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,100
he seemed unhappy.

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
this is not
about one nsa officer

90
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,800
who acted on information
in a file.

91
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
this is a departmental review
in which I...

92
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
let's set up a new time,
a new place to meet.

93
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,900
we'll review the file.

94
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
I'll check my schedule.

95
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,200
thank you.

96
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,800
you keep
pissing him off, Michael,

97
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
you'll be in Miami
forever.

98
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,900
at least I'll get an answer.

99
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,000
the government
sent him down here,

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,100
and he's not gonna go
back to d.c.

101
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,200
without getting
a verdict on me.

102
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,700
not at his pay grade,
anyway.

103
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,700
you think you could convince him
that you were set up?

104
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,600
I read the dossier.
it's pretty convincing.

105
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,800
yeah, Sam?
Mike,
I'm on my way over.

106
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,200
there's that thing I need you to
help me look into right away.

107
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,900
Sam,
I'm in the middle of --

108
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
new car.

109
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,500
yeah. it's a gift
from the lady friend.

110
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,100
I got it yesterday.

111
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,000
it's like
driving on a cloud.

112
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,700
what exactly do you do
for these women, Sam?

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
well --
never mind.

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,200
anyway,
thanks for coming.

115
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,300
I didn't have much choice.

116
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,200
yeah, well, you owe me

117
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,800
'cause I've been checking
into this guy from d.c.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,800
what did you find out?

119
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
well,
I'm still working on it,

120
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,200
but he's a paper pusher.

121
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,600
he's a name and a cubicle.

122
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,300
that's all you got?

123
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,100
well, hey, you know,
with the crap you've been doing,

124
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm not getting much love
in d.c.

125
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,700
keep digging, Sam.
keep digging.

126
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,600
I will, brother.

127
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,800
anyway, so this guy
we're gonna go see,

128
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,200
my lady friend
hooked me up with him.

129
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,100
he's got some kind of problem,

130
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,000
and he heard that she had
a boyfriend who could help.

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
"he heard that she had
a boyfriend that could help"?

132
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
I was vague.

133
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,200
I said I was

134
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,900
a freelance superhero/robin hood
kind of guy.

135
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,000
that's vague.

136
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,500
Mike...

137
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,900
a house like this, I mean,

138
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,900
it's probably some
expensive kitten up a tree...

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,900
a cakewalk.

140
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
you're Sam?
yeah, I'm Sam.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,400
thanks for meeting me.
yeah, no problem.

142
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
this is Michael, the guy I told
you about over the phone.

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,500
yeah, your assistant.
what's up, bro?

144
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
uh, oh, no, no.

145
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,200
it's actually more like
a partner sort of thing.

146
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,600
so, veronica said
you want to talk?

147
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,500
yeah, dude.
I've got a serious problem.

148
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
come inside.

149
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,400
after you.

150
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,300
place like this,

151
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,500
you could have called
halliburton to help you out.

152
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,300
halliburton?

153
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,700
I don't know him.

154
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm saying
you seem to be doing

155
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
pretty well
for yourself, Nick.

156
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,600
oh, no.
I don't own this.

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm a house sitter.

158
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,500
I work three or four estates
on the island.

159
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,100
that's a job --
house sitter?

160
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,100
yeah, these people are only here
a few weeks out of the year.

161
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,700
okay, so, do you need
an application for that?

162
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Sam.

163
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,500
tell me your problem,
Nick.

164
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,400
that's dawn.
she's my fiancéE.

165
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,500
she was kidnapped
the day before yesterday,

166
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,400
and the people that took her
want, like, $5 million.

167
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,300
and they think you have
that kind of money?

168
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,200
well, the thing
about this job

169
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,300
is that you drive these cars
and you stay in these houses,

170
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,500
and people kind of think
that you own them, you know?

171
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,200
and it gets harder to tell them
that you don't.

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,800
and your fiancéE thinks

173
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
that you own these things.

174
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,400
kind of...
I guess, yeah.

175
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,000
look, I didn't want to tell her
that I was lying to everyone.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
I was afraid
I'd lose her, man.

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,200
I don't know
what to do, bro.

178
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,100
what you need to do
is call the police.

179
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,900
they said that
they would kill her if I did.

180
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,400
they said they'd know.
here, they sent me this.

181
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,600
they kidnapped that girl
last year,

182
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,000
and her family called the cops,
and now she's dead.

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,400
I got, like, an hour
before they're gonna call.

184
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,700
I told them
that I was trying

185
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,100
to get the money
together, but --

186
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,800
hour?

187
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,000
man, I got nowhere else
to turn.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
look, you can have
anything you want.

189
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
I got about 15 grand.
I got a surfboard collection.

190
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
anything, you got it.

191
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
are you guys gonna help me
or not?

192
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
they're gonna kill her.

193
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,200
okay, okay.
Sam, why don't you go get Fi?

194
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,500
I think we're gonna need
a little help on this cakewalk.

195
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm on it, Mike.

196
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,700
okay, Nick.
let's get you ready.

197
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,800
<i>about 40% of kidnapping victims
are released safely.</i>

198
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
<i>these statistics are affected
by a number of factors,</i>

199
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,100
<i>including the nationality
of the kidnappers,</i>

200
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
<i>the age of the victim,</i>

201
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,300
<i>and whether a hostage
negotiator is employed.</i>

202
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,400
I can't do this, man.

203
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,900
what's the point? they want,
like, 5 million bucks.

204
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,500
<i>the odds go down sharply</i>

205
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,700
<i>if no one has any money
to pay the ransom.</i>

206
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,900
keep it together, Nick.
you're doing fine.

207
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,000
just stick to the script.
do it like we practiced.

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,300
really?
it's gonna be okay?

209
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,300
let's just
get through this.

210
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,800
okay.

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
now, do they usually call
on time or...

212
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,500
that answers
that question.

213
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,000
just like we rehearsed.
pick it up.

214
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,200
Nick, pick up the phone.

215
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,800
Nick!

216
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,500
three, two, one.

217
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,200
hello?

218
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,900
You have the money?

219
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm getting it. I just... I need
to know if she's alive first.

220
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,300
you talking to the police?

221
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,400
no, man. i...

222
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,900
I just need to know
that dawn's okay.

223
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,900
she's fine. but if you
don't pay, she won't be.

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,400
well, I'm not gonna pay
until I get to see her.

225
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
I need to know
you didn't hurt her.

226
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,000
you want 5 million bucks,
I want to see a video.

227
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,600
<i>you're pushing it, carajo.</i>

228
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,800
you're really pushing it.
now, hang on.

229
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
<i>a kidnapping
is a business deal.</i>

230
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,100
<i>the bad guys have
negotiating power</i>

231
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,900
<i>since they're selling the life
of a loved one.</i>

232
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,300
<i>but, then again,
they have a market of one,</i>

233
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,100
<i>so they have to work with you.</i>

234
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,600
go to the coconut grove mall --
two hours.

235
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,500
we'll call you.

236
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,500
jesus! oh, jesus.
I thought I was gonna puke, bro.

237
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,900
you did fine, Nick.
you did fine.

238
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,300
so you understand --

239
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,700
you pick up the package,
and you walk away.

240
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,600
you got it?

241
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
you don't look at us,
you don't talk to us.

242
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,000
you just walk out
with the video.

243
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,300
Fiona and i
will be watching

244
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,200
to see if the kidnappers
have someone there,

245
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,100
and Sam will follow in the car
if he sees anyone leave.

246
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,300
okay. so I walk to the car?
okay.

247
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,100
no, Nick. focus.

248
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,400
you just walk away.

249
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
walk away.

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,600
pick up the package,
and you leave...

251
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
like we're not even there.

252
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,700
but wait --
you will be there, right?

253
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,800
yes, we will be there.
okay, go ahead.

254
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
unlock it first.

255
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,500
okay.

256
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,700
<i>working with untrained amateurs
introduces an element of risk.</i>

257
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,900
<i>it's a risk you have to live
with in a lot of operations,</i>

258
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,800
<i>although you often
find yourself wishing</i>

259
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,900
<i>everyone went through green
beret training in high school.</i>

260
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,600
you buying me
a birthday card?

261
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
just window-shopping, Fi.
you got eyes on Nick?

262
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,300
yes...

263
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
all the way
from the escalators

264
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,700
to that charming little

265
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,100
they have a fabulous
little teddy in there.

266
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,300
it would make a great gift.

267
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
I've never seen you wear

268
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,200
anything but men's shirts
to bed.

269
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,200
fair enough.

270
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,000
there's a men's store
on the third floor.

271
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,700
nice selection.

272
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,500
the ones with the big buttons
are easier to undo.

273
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,700
focus, Fi.

274
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,700
can you see people
on my side of the mall?

275
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
'cause I can't look
at everybody.

276
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
yeah.

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,300
oh, Nick just got a call.

278
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,400
he's looking around.

279
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,900
there he goes.

280
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,300
anyone looking curious?

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,800
there's a decent candidate
at the caf?

282
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
gray shirt, on your 2.

283
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
ah, I see.

284
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,600
how's our ace operative performing?

285
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,300
looking good.

286
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,500
he's going to get the package now.

287
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,400
okay, Nick. walk away.

288
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,300
just walk away, Nick.

289
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
no, don't... don't.

290
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,500
he made me, Fi.

291
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,700
<i>once a kidnapper
knows you're on to him,</i>

292
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,900
<i>he'll try to contact
his partners to have
the hostage killed.</i>

293
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,100
<i>at that point,
you have a choice.</i>

294
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,800
<i>you can start choosing wreaths
for the hostage's funeral...</i>

295
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,100
aaaah!

296
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,000
<i>...or take a hostage
of your own.</i>

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,800
Thanks.

298
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,600
<i>Nick! just pay them
what they want, please!</i>

299
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
<i>I want to go home.</i>

300
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,800
<i>they're gonna call you tonight.</i>

301
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Jesus.

302
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,300
oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

303
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,400
okay, stop saying that.

304
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,900
ohh, god.

305
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,500
I screwed
everything up, bro.

306
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
seriously, stop talking.

307
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,700
stop moaning now.

308
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,000
the moaning --
Nick, stop moaning!

309
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,000
listen, Nick.

310
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm not saying I'm happy

311
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
with how things
went down today, either,

312
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,000
but this can still work out.

313
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,300
in some ways,
we're better off.

314
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,900
how? how are we
better off, dude?

315
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,000
you got some kidnapper
tied up someplace.

316
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,800
you got dawn --

317
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
oh, wait.

318
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,600
oh, I get it. you're gonna trade
dawn for the dude.

319
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,500
no.

320
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
he's just a hired hand.

321
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,300
if they find out
we've got their guy,

322
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,100
they'll kill her immediately,
probably leave town.

323
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,400
so, how are we
better off?!

324
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,600
they want $5 million
or they kill dawn, yes?

325
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,500
last time I checked, we don't
have $5 million, right?

326
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,300
so our only hope is
to find dawn

327
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,600
before they find out
we don't have $5 million.

328
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,200
we will convince this guy
to help us find dawn.

329
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,500
yeah, okay.

330
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,800
okay.

331
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,400
<i>Michael: the art of turning

332
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,500

<i>the target has to be put into

our friend Lucio

338
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,700
into a more
cooperative mood.

339
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
where's Sam?

340
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,900
I had to get some air.

341
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
it was getting a little,
uh, loud in here.

342
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,100
so, what do we know
about our new friend?

343
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
well, his name

he and his brother ran
an extortion racket in columbia.

347
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,500
his brother got caught,
Lucio ran.

348
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,300
good to meet you, Lucio.

349
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,100
go ahead
and taser me all you want.

350
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm not gonna
tell you nothing.

351
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,100
taser? oh, no.

352
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,900
we have something
much better than a taser.

353
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,600
we've got an instant camera.

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,900
<i>it's always easier
to turn someone</i>

355
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,300
<i>who works for a criminal gang
into a double agent.</i>

356
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,400
<i>the more secretive and ruthless
their side is, the better.</i>

357
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,400
<i>you work on their fear
that any hint of disloyalty</i>

358
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,500
<i>will get them killed
by their own people.</i>

359
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,200
Lucio, you need to think about
your situation very carefully.

360
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
you have been caught
in the middle

361
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,800
of a delicate assignment.

362
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,100
say we let you go and give this
photo to your boss...

363
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,300
...along with a cooperating
witness statement

364
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,900
you're about to give
to the FBI?

365
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,500
no, no, no, no.
I never made no statement.

366
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,300
here's the form.
looks real, huh?

367
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
we'll fill it out,
sign it on your behalf.

368
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,400
Sam's pretty good
with a computer.

369
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,100
thanks, Mike.
it's just photoshop.

370
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,100
oh, look here.
you have a summons.

371
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,300
it means you're going to testify
in court against your boss.

372
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,800
so, anyway, we take the photo,
we put it in the file.

373
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Sam here has ties to the FBI
and other government agencies

374
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,200
just in case your boss
does his homework.

375
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,900
I have to say, you guys
look pretty tight here.

376
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,300
my guess is he won't feel right
until you're dead.

377
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,900
what do you want, man?

378
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,300
you now work for us,
Lucio.

379
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,800
you tell us
what we want to know,

380
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,000
you do what we say, and that
is how you will stay alive.

381
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,900
where's dawn?

382
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I don't know.

383
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,600
you don't know, Lucio?

384
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,500
no, no, no, no, no! I swear.
I swear. I don't know.

385
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,800
Reyes keeps
everything separate.

386
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,200
Reyes... your boss?

387
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,300
I find people in clubs,
in rich neighborhoods,

388
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,500
and Reyes, he does the job
with two other guys.

389
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,300
someone else
guards the hostages.

390
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,300
everything's separate.
nobody knows each other.

391
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,500
he does that for security.

392
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
let me be clear here.
the girl dies, you die.

393
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,000
if you're lying --
I'm not lying, all right?

394
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
now, I need to check in
with Reyes. I'm already late.

395
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
he's gonna know
that something is wrong.

396
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
fine. call him.

397
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,500
you broke your foot walking down
the stairs at the mall.

398
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,800
you forgot to call.

399
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,100
broke my foot?
I didn't break my foot.

400
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,900
aah! ugh.

401
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
there you go.

402
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,600
there are a lot of little
bones in your foot, so
you'll be able to walk.

403
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,400
you want to borrow
the mercedes, man?

404
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,200
Yeah.

405
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,400
just please try not
to scratch that car.

406
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,700
it's an s550 amg worth
like 120 grand.

407
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,600
and we need a house.

408
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,900
there's a penthouse downtown
that I watch.

409
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
what do you need it for?

410
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,000
we need to find
where dawn is being kept.

411
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Lucio doesn't know.

412
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
his job is just finding targets
for Reyes,

413
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,900
so we're gonna have Lucio
bring him a new target...

414
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,800
a rich society wife...

415
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,700
<i>enchant?</i>

416
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,500
...and a disgruntled
bodyguard.

417
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,700
you bitch!

418
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
talk to Reyes,

419
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,500
tell him I'm willing
to help him pull the job,

420
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,200
but he's got to show me
where he keeps the hostages.

421
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
hopefully they'll bring Sam
to where dawn is,

422
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,700
and we can grab her,
but we got to move fast.

423
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,100
and we need a target
that will make him drool.

424
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,800
<i>from karachI to bogot?</i>

425
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,400
<i>every kidnapper's favorite
resource is a corrupt employee.</i>

426
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,400
her husband's worth
$200 million? good work, Lucio.

427
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,090
<i>an employee
can handle alarms,police.</i>

428
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,700
<i>you can get financial
information,bank accounts.</i>

429
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,080
<i>you've even got a fall guy
if anything goes wrong.</i>

430
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,640
<i>to a professional kidnapper,</i>

431
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,200
<i>a good man on the inside
is worth a lot.</i>

432
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,380
<i>and a bad man on the inside
is worth even more.</i>

433
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,040
Lucio.

434
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,240
okay,okay. I can't do this.

435
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,550
okay,man,I can't. Reyes is gonna
kill me if he finds out.

436
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,580
well,that's the point, Lucio.

437
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,890
you do your job well,

438
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,610
he won't find out,
and you'll stay alive.

439
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,590
did Reyes like our little
business opportunity?

440
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,000
the rich lady
and the bodyguard? yeah.

441
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,310
he loved it. okay,we've been
following them around all day.

442
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,200
he wants to meet
with your guy, talk terms.

443
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,140
what about dawn?

444
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,620
he's impatient.
the guy wants his money.

445
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,400
I held him off a little bit,

446
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,720
but I don't know if
I can do it much longer.

447
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm supposed to be calling
you right now

448
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,300
and telling you

449
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,490
that you only got 12 hours
or the girl's dead.

450
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,920
tell him 12 hours isn't long enough.

451
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,670
tell him Nick's family
has hired a hostage negotiator

452
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,880
and that the guy wants
to talk to him in person.

453
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,070
with Reyes? no,no,come on.
you can't be serious.

454
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,120
you convince him it's the best
way for him to get his money.

455
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,300
we just need to buy enough
time to find dawn,

456
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,950
and then you're done,Lucio.

457
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:45,870
you'll do it?

458
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,040
do I got a choice? no,you don't.

459
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,140
you've got my number.
tell me where and when.

460
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,690
<i>the thing
about doubling anyone</i>

461
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,500
<i>is that the more they do
for you,the deeper they get.</i>

462
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,260
<i>the deeper they get,the more
you can make them do...</i>

463
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,980
<i>great if you're running them,
but hard on the source.</i>

464
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,820
<i>the suicide rate is
above average.</i>

465
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,190
I understand your
concerns,Mr. Westen.

466
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,660
I have worked with field
operatives before.

467
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,930
I may find your priorities

468
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,510
somewhat baroque and unnecessary,

469
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,740
but I suppose that's why
I work in an office

470
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,200
and you run around
the world with guns.

471
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,050
I suppose so,yes.

472
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,100
so,you've now had your opportunity

473
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,960
to screen me in public.

474
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,750
are you satisfied that
I'm not some shadow figure

475
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,030
sent to liquidate you?

476
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,830
can we do our business now? yes.

477
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,820
now,I have security concerns of my own.

478
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,860
as I'm sure you're aware,

479
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,090
your case has certain
issues pertaining to...

480
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,160
national security...

481
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,000
issues that require a private venue.

482
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,890
now,my office in fort lauderdale is...

483
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,660
I would not be able to make it up there

484
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,580
for at least a few days.

485
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,360
that's unfortunate.

486
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,610
maybe this isn't important
enough to you,Mr. Westen.

487
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,850
I have to get back to d.c.

488
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,560
you could come by my place
the night after tomorrow.

489
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,940
you hope to gain some sort
of home-court advantage?

490
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,020
no,it's just that
I need to be around here

491
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,260
for the next few
days for my day job.

492
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,000
if there were any
other way, believe me.

493
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,690
fine. call me with a time.

494
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,590
thank you.

495
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,680
yeah? You wanted to talk to me.

496
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,840
Andrew Chambers... hostage
negotiator for the family.

497
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,570
okay,you got a sniper trained
on you,Mr. Chambers.

498
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,400
tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

499
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,170
Nick's family's not gonna pay
if you shoot the negotiator.

500
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,260
you'd end up with nothing
for your trouble.

501
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,950
how do I know you're not a cop?

502
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,370
cops don't make themselves
available as potential hostages.

503
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,920
they don't get paid enough for that.

504
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,190
I don't know what the magnification
is on your sniper's scope,

505
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,390
but the label... the label's armani.

506
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,270
cops don't fit armani.

507
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,350
how do I look? I look good,right?

508
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,030
you gonna keep playing games?
'cause I got all day.

509
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,540
nice suit. get in.

510
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,580
I like doing my meetings this way.

511
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,900
I hope you don't mind.

512
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,610
No. fine by me.

513
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,920
you know I'm not wearing
a wire. That's smart.

514
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,510
plus,the massage music...
it's really nice...

515
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,720
and calming!

516
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,080
okay,all right.

517
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,510
look,let me get straight to the point.

518
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,230
I'm gonna have a hard time

519
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,650
getting Nick's family
to pay $5 million for dawn.

520
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,630
oh,is that so?

521
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,850
dawn's not part of the family.

522
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,760
the engagement really
isn't that official yet.

523
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,100
I don't want to talk out of school,

524
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,300
but I don't think the family
likes her very much.

525
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,720
well,I wonder how much they would pay

526
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,920
for a smart-ass hostage negotiator?

527
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,790
trust me. at my hourly rate,
you'd be doing them a favor.

528
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,080
sweetie,can you go a little
lower and to the left?

529
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,240
I have a trouble spot right
about... yeah,right there.

530
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,220
okay,so give me a number...
a counter offer.

531
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,970
I think I can close at a million.

532
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,700
$1 million?

533
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,620
that's 20% of my price.

534
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,450
mmm,you are good with numbers.

535
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,710
I take 20% of my price,
I'll give you 20% of the girl.

536
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,830
hostage negotiators hear that one a lot.

537
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,000
it's funny the first few times.

538
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,480
oh,you think I was joking?

539
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,520
it comes down to how much
we're willing to move on the price.

540
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,680
I gave you a number.
now it's your turn.

541
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,130
$3 million. that's as low as I go.

542
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,710
$3 million's gonna be a tough sell.

543
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,790
I'll bring it to the family,

544
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,660
but they'll need at least
72 hours to think it over.

545
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,860
48 hours! after that,the girl dies.

546
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,570
48 hours I can do.

547
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,480
now,could you have one of your
boys turn the heat up?

548
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,770
'cause it's a little chilly...

549
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,010
they paid you for
the whole hour,right?

550
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,260
<i>man: 1 and 2...</i>

551
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
is that a makarov? I don't know.

552
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,800
the... the guy who owns this
place is into guns and stuff.

553
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,240
well,that's a soviet-issue
sidearm from 1951,I think.

554
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,370
it's a beautiful piece.

555
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,400
I guess,yeah.

556
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,490
<i>...in a row to begin
the evening for josh beckett.</i>

557
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,070
<i>and the last one
on the curve ball...</i>

558
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,280
how big is that?

559
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,530
it's 60 inches,I think.

560
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,940
quality's nice.

561
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,630
<i>now the curve ball.</i>

562
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,580
is that satellite?

563
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,210
it's directv... HD.

564
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,130
that's why the...
the picture's bigger.

565
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,430
what the hell are we talking about?

566
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,860
look,I know that you asked me

567
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,950
to stop talking about it and
just stay here and watch tv,

568
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,060
but I can't watch any more.

569
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,470
are you gonna be able to save her?

570
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,420
please say yes.

571
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,120
<i>foul off to the right.</i>

572
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,750
we're working on it.

573
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,220
how did we do?

574
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,120
I bought us 48 hours.

575
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,280
yeah. I'm setting up
a meeting with Lucio tonight.

576
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,640
Lucio's gonna set up
a meeting with Sam,

577
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,130
and Sam will get them to tell us
where they keep the hostages.

578
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,430
and we're gonna finish this.

579
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,310
Lucio: Reyes wants to meet your
guy tomorrow to set up this job.

580
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,350
he wants to move on it quick.

581
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,440
did you get a time?

582
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,420
yeah... noon.

583
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,830
I think he's getting sick of waiting.

584
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,060
he wants to get rid of the girl.

585
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,340
hold him off,Lucio.

586
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,170
remember, if she dies...

587
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,590
yeah,I die,too.

588
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,400
we keep this up,though,man,
I'm dead anyway.

589
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,880
we on?

590
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,930
we're on.

591
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,070
<i>GPS devices are becoming more
and more common these days.</i>

592
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,850
<i>mostly they're for nervous
parents tracking children.</i>

593
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,890
<i>but they're perfectly good
for other uses.</i>

594
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,690
Is it working?

595
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,860
Yeah,like a charm,Mike.

596
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,040
you can follow me all over
Miami with that thing.

597
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,040
but wouldn't it be easier to grab her

598
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,930
when she takes her morning
jog along the beach

599
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,200
6:00 a.m. every single day,
nice and early?

600
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,800
I'll consider it.

601
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,260
you're the big boss man here, right?

602
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,890
that's what they tell me.

603
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:12,610
okay,well, the issue now...

604
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,100
I'm taking a pretty big risk here,

605
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,930
so I expect to be rewarded.

606
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,950
I mean,this is my employer

607
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,620
we're talking about
kidnapping here.

608
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,890
so as soon as this goes down,
I'm out of a job.

609
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,920
well,if what you tell me about
her husband is true,

610
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,870
you'll be very wealthy
when you finish.

611
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,030
I like the sound of that.

612
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,730
all right,now,look,
if this is gonna happen,

613
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,410
I got to know the vehicle
you're taking her in,

614
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,690
and I want to see where
you're gonna keep her,

615
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,040
'cause I hear stories of people
being shoved in dungeons,

616
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,010
and that ain't gonna fly,okay?

617
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,310
she can't get hurt.

618
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,180
she gets hurt,we get a lot
of extra heat here.

619
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,590
hey,we take care
of the operation,okay?

620
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,240
no,you hold it right there,
my columbian friend.

621
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,050
this is 20 million bucks
we're talking about,

622
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,040
and you've been on my ass

623
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,320
about every little detail
about how I deliver her.

624
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,080
as of right now, I'm on the hook

625
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,690
for life without
parole for kidnapping...

626
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,130
same as you,buddy.

627
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,630
so,you like it or not, we're a team.

628
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,050
fine,I'll show you. come on.

629
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,210
They're on the move.

630
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,690
got them.

631
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,100
this is the type of
car you use to grab them?

632
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,270
Reyes: yeah. we prepare
them like this.

633
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,780
we use it once, and then
we discard them.

634
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,910
shame to discard it.

635
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,770
when this job is over,
might get me one of these...

636
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,330
might get two.

637
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,870
it still has that new-car smell.

638
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,450
so,this is where you keep them,huh?

639
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,240
and you have security?

640
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,000
24 hours.

641
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,060
they're well taken care of here.

642
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,800
five years we do this,

643
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,250
<i>only one  unintentional death.</i>

644
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,510
not bad.

645
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,780
all righty,then.

646
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,760
let's do this.

647
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,480
Lucio, you should have called.

648
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,560
I wanted to talk to you face-to-face.

649
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,460
I've done all I can.

650
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,110
<i>running a double agent

651
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,580
<i>there's a give-and-take...</i>

652
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,990
<i>mostly take,but sometimes
you have to give.</i>

653
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,590
Lucio,you're doing a great job.
You're almost out.

654
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,400
you stay with it,
and you'll be rewarded.

655
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,920
we'll set up a bank
account for you.

656
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,000
Reyes wants to do the other job...

657
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,920
the one with your friend.

658
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,120
he wants to do it now.

659
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,830
he said it's better

660
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,130
to kill the girl so they can
start the other job.

661
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,320
he told me to call you
to finish this.

662
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,870
finish it how?

663
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,240
you have two hours
to get him the money,

664
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,990
or the girl dies.

665
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,580
Nick: you said we had two days,

666
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,910
now two hours...
they're gonna kill her.

667
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,710
not if we get to her first.
We know where they're keeping her.

668
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,260
maybe we should just call the cops.

669
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,390
you think the cops can put
together a rescue plan

670
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,650
in two hours?

671
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,060
the bad guys will be monitoring
the police scanners.

672
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,490
one whisper of this on the radio,
and she's dead.

673
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,610
so,what? I'm supposed
to just sit here?

674
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,480
no,you're going to get me
the yellow pages

675
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,520
and tell me where the nearest
pharmacy and gardening store is.

676
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,530
I need to pick up a few things.

677
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,150
yellow pages?

678
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,320
bro,I have a computer.

679

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,760

<i>ingredients

00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,530
<i>will make a serviceable
flash grenade</i>

688
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,640
<i>that will stun anyone
for a good 20 feet.</i>

689
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,180
<i>thermite is another handy tool.</i>

690
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,580
<i>with a surface temperature
of 1,000 degrees,</i>

691
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,380
<i>it's used to weld together
railroad ties.</i>

692
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,250
<i>it will make pretty short work
of most locks,too.</i>

693
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,710
go. you don't have much time.

694
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,670
I'm not excited about you
seeing Reyes by yourself.

695
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,030
someone needs to stall him
in case you guys need more time.

696
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,190
Mike, nobody's got your back.

697
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,150
this goes bad, Reyes
could get tipped off.

698
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,410
the only other option
for backup is Nick.

699
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,650
you guys like that idea?

700
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,990
call me when you got dawn.

701
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,700
<i>Est? Limpio.</i>

702
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,930
Nice view.

703
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,570
Where's my money?

704
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,360
Would you consider
being paid in bonds?

705
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,980
bonds? I said cash.

706
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,910
I know. but a bearer bond
is as good as cash.

707
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,730
it's issued without a named holder.

708
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,430
listen,I'm not saying it's right,

709
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,220
but the family has liquidity issues,

710
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,610
there are tax implications...

711
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,570
I don't care about the tax problems!
I want my money!

712
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,640
I understand,and I am trying
to get you that money.

713
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,320
no,no,no. you're trying my patience.

714
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,310
I said cash. I expect cash.

715
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,420
your time is up.

716
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,840
Go ahead,shoot.
Good luck hiding the body.

717
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,100
my guess is the cops show up first,

718
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,020
because that is a very
loud gun you're holding.

719
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,730
I am just trying to make this deal.

720
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,540
look at it from
the family's perspective.

721
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,500
they shell out $3 million
in cash,and then what?

722
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,250
it raises flags at the bank

723
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,330
with their investment advisors,
their employees.

724
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,490
people piece it together
that they paid you off.

725
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,830
that is not my concern!

726
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,050
but it concerns me because
if word gets out

727
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,990
that this family paid a ransom,

728
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,990
other guys like you will
come out of the woodwork.

729
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,960
I just need to make sure

730
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,470
that this never happens
to this family again.

731
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,920
they're gonna call me any second.

732
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,990
would you mind taking
that gun out of my face?

733
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,280
<i>if you can't get through a door
without attracting attention,</i>

734
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:41,890
<i>the next best thing is
to attract a lot of attention.</i>

735
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,920
<i>once everyone's looking
at the door,</i>

736
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,030
<i>wondering what's going on,
you can pop in a flash grenade,</i>

737
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,160
<i>and they won't see anything
for a while.</i>

738
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,920
drop the gun! get it down!

739
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,330
get it down.

740
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,790
attaboy. you're not
as dumb as you look.

741
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,340
you're safe.

742
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,940
we're going to untie you.
you're safe.

743
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,720
look at me. you're safe now.

744
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,130
unlike stocks,bonds
are financial instruments.

745
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,540
Now,that is the family.
May I take this?

746
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,650
tell them it's cash or she dies.

747
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,060
I got it.

748
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,630
yeah?

749
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,610
Hey,Mike. it's finished.

750
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,900
no,they won't do stocks nor bonds.

751
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,850
yeah,I explained the difference.

752
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,630
I understand.

753
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,710
that's it. they won't
pay the ransom in cash.

754
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,850
now,I hope you can reconsider.

755
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,640
killing a hostage... get out.

756
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,610
get out!

757
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,440
<i>¿Qu?carajo est?pasando?</i>

758
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,040
<i>Leticia no le atendi?/i>
al teléFono.</i>

759
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,430
<i>mad...</i>

760
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,620
drop the weapons now!

761
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,110
on the ground!

762
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,540
seriously,bro. I don't even
know how to thank you.

763
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,630
uh,those surfboards
right there...

764
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,760
yeah,I don't surf.

765
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,290
You're awesome,bro.

766
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,560
oh,sounds like they're here.

767
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,110
all set,Mike.

768
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,150
hospital checked her out. she's fine.

769
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,020
is Nick here?

770
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,190
he's inside.

771
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,900
you guys should talk.

772
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,360
cakewalk,huh?

773
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,720
oh... look,Mike.

774
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,490
you know,if you ever want
to borrow my caddy,it's yours.

775
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,450
thanks.

776
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,730
Nick!

777
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,140
hey,babe.

778
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,000
you lied to me!

779
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,980
baby,I love you.

780
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,730
you lied to me!

781
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,870
another happy ending.

782
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:45,690
Mr. Clark.

783
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,900
I've never done a meeting

784
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,450
in a private home like
this before,Mr. Westen.

785
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,800
I'm not even sure it's allowed.

786
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,140
thanks for bending the rules.

787
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,060
yeah... again,
no guarantees,Mr. Westen.

788
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,190
we're gonna have to cut this short.

789
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,320
you tell me your side of the story,
I'll get back to you.

790
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,140
it shouldn't take long. oh,good.

791
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,510
my wife's expecting me to
actually make my flight tonight.

792
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,750
great.

793
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,790
you have any coffee?

794
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,270
coffee? yeah.

795
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,130
I think I have some instant.

796
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,580
that's fine.

797
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,250
<i>the longer you've been
in the game,</i>

798
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,570
<i>the more you have to be careful</i>

799
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,610
<i>about underestimating
an opponent.</i>

800
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,600
<i>say you don't think much
of bureaucrats,</i>

801
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,630
<i>don't feel they're worth
your time or attention.</i>

802
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,140
<i>then a bureaucrat is
the perfect person</i>

803
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,850
<i>to send to kill you.</i>

804
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,340
wow,you're pretty good.

805
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,950
let go.

806
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,260
it'll be less painful for you.

807
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,100
it'll look like you hanged yourself.

808
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:52,170
no surprise,really....
no work,no money.

809
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,830
this would have been easier

810
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,490
if you'd kept our appointment
in fort lauderdale.

811
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,860
I had some things arranged.

812
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:01,910
ah,well.

813
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,830
<i>there's no way to anticipate
every danger.</i>

814
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,160
<i>you need a backup plan
for when things go wrong.</i>

815
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,000
sorry to inconvenience you.

816
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,070
ugh! ughh!

817
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,360
<i>that's why home-court advantage
is so important.</i>

818
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,030
Mike,the cops found your
assassin in an alley this morning.

819
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,400
he bled to death.

820
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,530
no I.D. on him,and his
fingerprints didn't show up

821
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,740
in any government database,

822
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,740
so,officially, I guess
the guy never existed.

823
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,600
he must have been impersonating
the real Perry Clark.

824
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,810
do you think that the guy
who burned you sent him?

825
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,530
not a bad guess. Thanks,Sam.

826
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,620
you were right about him, you know?

827
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,780
you must feel a little
proud of yourself.

828
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,750
I wanted my burn notice resolved.

829
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,940
I talked myself into
denying my instincts.

830
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,540
that's nothing to be proud of.

831
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,210
I'm fine,Fi.

832
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,120
you almost died.

833
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,530
that's happened before.

834
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,640
so I'm not allowed
to be concerned,

835
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,190
to worry?

836
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,560
you can worry about me.

837
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,460
like Nick worried about dawn?

838
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,200
hopefully not exactly like that.

839
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,240
Oh,he was head over heels in love.

840
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,240
I talked to him about you...

841
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:45,140
about what I should get
you for your birthday.

842
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,180
a makarov.

843
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,400
he said you would like it.

844
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,370
ohh.

845
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,150
is it the same?

846
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,840
Nick convinced his boss to sell
it to me at a discount.

847
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,900
Thank you,Michael.

848
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,140
Happy birthday, Fi.
