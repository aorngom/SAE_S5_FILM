1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
Previously on swingtown.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,990
you got some sun today.

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,710
Does that hurt?

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,400
Not too bad.

5
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,930
I went over to susan's the day the power went out to talk about losing my job.

6
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,060
This is not about your stupid job.

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,130
This is about you confiding in another woman instead of turning to me.

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,300
You are a beautiful woman,janet.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
Don't you ever forget that.

10
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:18,510
What the hell did you do?

11
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:20,366
Nothing,man,she tongued me.

12
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,515
I've invited brad and sylvia to come home with us.

13
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:27,887
oh,my god,my parents are home.

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:29,962
Bruce Laurie,what is going on here?

15
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:31,130
- Who is this lady?
- Who is this?

16
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:32,862
- Doug stephens.
- How old are you?

17
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:34,653
The buck stops here.

18
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:37,621
We are taking back control of this family.

19
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,710
Oh,no.

20
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,570
Laurie,no,you should go.

21
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:45,513
I just got here.

22
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:46,572
No.

23
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,112
no,you didn'T.Look.

24
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:50,283
Oh,god.

25
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:51,803
Now I have to get more ice.

26
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:54,283
My dad is going to kill me.

27
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:57,202
Although,after what we caught him doing with that woman the other night,

28
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,820
he really should let me slide.

29
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:01,473
Before you know it,you're going to be up at your granddad's cabin,

30
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:03,400
hunting and fishing together.

31
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:04,621
It'll be beautiful.

32
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:06,912
I can't believe I'm missing the jackson browne concert

33
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:09,421
for a forced family bonding experience.

34
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:11,532
I wish you'd let me talk to your dad.

35
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:13,520
I am pretty charming.

36
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:15,870
He might let you come home early.

37
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,853
My dad is totally irrational where you're concerned.

38
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:20,953
Anyway,I have to show him I'm not a kid anymore.

39
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,643
I'm going to make my own decisions.

40
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,322
In fact,I just made one.

41
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:27,261
What?

42
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,891
I'm not going on this family vacation.

43
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:30,001
I'm staying home.

44
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:33,542
and you and I are going to that concert.

45
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:45,171
wake up and be you.

46
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,283
It's a life-program workbook.

47
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:49,141
I thought it might be good for you.

48
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,872
Well,I wake up "me" every day.

49
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:52,320
Not lately.

50
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,431
I think you're depressed.

51
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:56,953
I'm not depressed.

52
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:58,291
You lost your job,roger.

53
00:01:58,348 --> 00:02:00,451
Men define themselves by their jobs.

54
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:01,641
I read that.

55
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,640
It can be very destabilizing.

56
00:02:03,695 --> 00:02:04,660
Well,I'm looking for work.

57
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,120
What else can I do?

58
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:08,241
I made an appointment for you with and,now,

59
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:12,001
don't get upset by the word with a psychiatrist.

60
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,220
A psychiatrist?

61
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:14,621
Janet,who am I,woody allen?This is.

62
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,132
you're not happy,roger,

63
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:19,831
and it's hard to find a job when you're not feeling good about yourself.

64
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:21,591
Brad davis recommended her.

65
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:22,483
Her?

66
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:23,371
Janet,no,I don't know.

67
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:28,011
we can't keep doing the same things and expecting different results.

68
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,081
Do you want to fix this or not?

69
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,932
bruce,it's 800 in the morning.

70
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:55,012
You may be on vacation,but the neighbors aren'T.

71
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:56,103
I love you.

72
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:56,782
I know.

73
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:58,501
And I love our kids.

74
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,160
Even laurie.

75
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:05,662
This family is going to have so much fun in the next couple of days swimming,fishing,hiking.

76
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:09,211
Oh,that reminds me,I told janet I'd pack calamine lotion for rick.

77
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,012
Why are we taking that kid?

78
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:13,811
The whole point of this weekend is that our family is together.

79
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,852
Janet said she and roger were working some things out and needed privacy.

80
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:17,822
I wasn't going to say no.

81
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:18,903
Well,she better get here soon

82
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:21,133
'cause I want to get on the road and we need to pick up some ice.

83
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:22,893
Oh,I sent laurie for ice.

84
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:24,563
Laurie is grounded.

85
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,700
From buying ice?

86
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:28,661
Look,I know you're upset with her about doug stephens.

87
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:32,183
So am I,but she's growing up,bruce.

88
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:34,331
I think we need to be careful how we handle this.

89
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:36,652
I do not need to be careful.

90
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,512
I'm her father.

91
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:44,462
If she's not back in ten minutes,she is grounded for life.

92
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,111
- hey.
- Hey,buddy.

93
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:49,072
Let me give you a hand with that.

94
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:50,892
Oh,thanks,I'm trying to get the car packed up.

95
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,262
- Susan?
- In the kitchen.

96
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,483
Hand over those house keys and go have fun.

97
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:57,722
Trina.

98
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:00,363
Thanks so much for looking after things while we're gone.

99
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,902
No problem.

100
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:03,982
what took you so long?

101
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,663
Have you ever tried to ride a bike with two bags of ice on the handlebars?

102
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,601
Hi,mrs.Decker.

103
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:11,810
Hi.

104
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:13,860
Take your backpack to the car.

105
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:15,722
Mom,I'm not going.

106
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:17,702
there's a concert tomorrow night.

107
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:19,621
It's jackson browne.

108
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,541
I'm going with doug.

109
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:21,990
Laurie,no.

110
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:24,232
This weekend means a lot to your father.

111
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,380
This concert means a lot to me.

112
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,732
It's a couple of days.

113
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:29,403
Okay,that's all he's asking.

114
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,173
Let's be a family for a couple of days.

115
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,993
Yeah,we'd ask you guys along,but it's kind of family time.You know?

116
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:41,623
Oh,I get it.

117
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:44,101
Trina and I are having our own family time these days.

118
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:45,453
Since we stopped going to parties,

119
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:48,403
things have been a little creative around the decker residence.

120
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,461
Really?

121
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:50,783
Hello?

122
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:51,912
Hi,janet,ricky.

123
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,010
I saw the car was pretty full.

124
00:04:54,098 --> 00:04:55,702
Are,are tom and trina coming with you?

125
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:56,800
No,just the family.

126
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,183
and rick.

127
00:04:58,235 --> 00:04:59,420
Don't worry,jan.

128
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:02,903
If you're not going,I'm not going.

129
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:05,173
Hey,janet,I packed the calamine lotion.

130
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,513
Ricky just has to look at the woods to break out.

131
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:08,963
- Good morning,trina.
- Morning.

132
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,991
So what are you and roger doing with the weekend all to yourselves?

133
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,853
We'll think of something,I'm sure.

134
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:16,892
Hey,tom,trina,bruce.

135
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:17,930
Hey,susan.

136
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:22,402
Hi.B.J.,Why don't you help rick,uh,put his stuff in the car.

137
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,150
I'm not talking to you.

138
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,320
Oh,lucky me.

139
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:35,733
Well,I guess we'd better let you guys get on the road.

140
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:37,902
- have a great trip.
- Thanks.

141
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:40,222
I'll put these in the car.

142
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:41,101
Call me when you get there.

143
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:42,330
Of course.

144
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:45,226
Finally.

145
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:47,335
Laurie,let's go.

146
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:48,457
Listen,dad.

147
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,653
laurie.

148
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:52,933
What?

149
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,500
all right.

150
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:05,340
Let's go fix this family.

00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:31,481
BJ,U and rick are sleeping in the tent tonight,

155
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,550
if you want to start setting it up.

156
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:35,823
Hey,when you're finished,you can do some target practice.

157
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,101
We only have one bb gun.

158
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:37,923
Share.

159
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:39,432
Rick We tried sharing.

160
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:40,390
It didn't work so well.

161
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:41,962
Don't talk about her.

162
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:49,552
Nothing to see here,folks,you go about your business.

163
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:53,592
Hey,as soon as we get settled,I thought we could,uh,go out on the boat,

164
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:55,832
you know,do some swimming,maybe a little fishing.

165
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,332
I have to make a phone call.

166
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:58,831
Now,hol-hold on.

167
00:06:58,896 --> 00:06:59,673
I...

168
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:02,161
thought we came up here to get away from phones and tvs.

169
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,693
I came up here because you guys made me.

170
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,852
Is she going to be like this all weekend?

171
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:13,741
Try to remember what it was like to be her age.

172
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:15,192
and smitten.

173
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,090
I was never smitten.

174
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,403
I was madly in love.

175
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:22,192
And horny.

176
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:24,173
So is she.

177
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:29,741
How long are you going to stay mad at me?

178
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:34,742
Look,I kissed samantha.

179
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:35,832
Big deal.

180
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,380
It was a stupid game,I had to.

181
00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:42,711
Oh,great,yeah,real mature.

182
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:57,202
Thank you for seeing roger on such short notice.

183
00:07:57,256 --> 00:08:00,520
I hope it doesn't mean you're a terrible therapist and that you have no clients.

184
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:04,861
brad asked me to work you in.

185
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:07,452
I didn't realize that we'd be doing couples counseling,though.

186
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:09,471
Oh,I'm just here for moral support.

187
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:11,390
Roger and I are,are a team,

188
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:15,541
and I want to make sure whatever's wrong with him gets fixed.

189
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:18,563
I lost my job.

190
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,342
What happened?

191
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,612
Well,the company was cutting back.

192
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:24,943
I asked for a raise,so they let me go.

193
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:29,570
You never told me asking for a raise had anything to do with being fired.

194
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:32,842
Of course,he never told me he was fired.

195
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,582
I found out from a secretary.

196
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:37,463
He made a point to tell my best friend susan,though.

197
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:39,861
And how'd that make you feel?

198
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,162
How do you think?It'S...

199
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:42,963
horrible.

200
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:46,253
Like he was closer to her than,than to me.

201
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:47,270
Are you?

202
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:48,813
Closer to susan?

203
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:51,403
No,of course not.

204
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,801
But she's easy to talk to and I'm not.

205
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:55,050
That's what you said.

206
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:57,082
I said I didn't want to disappoint you.

207
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,392
Are you disappointed in him?

208
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,123
No.

209
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:01,512
but he's my husband.

210
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,832
I,I want him to be all he can be.

211
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,453
And do you have an idea of what that is?

212
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:09,590
More.H-he can be more.

213
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:13,371
W-we all can be.

214
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:15,310
Hmm,that's interesting.

215
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:17,603
Is there more that you'd like to be?

216
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:19,131
We're not here to talk about me.

217
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:22,901
If roger and you are a team,your issues effect him and vice versa.

218
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,732
I don't have issues.

219
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:27,142
I have a depressed husband who went to susan

220
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,152
when he should have been coming to me.

221
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,700
But I've let that go.

222
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:32,350
- Clearly.
- Roger.

223
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:39,703
are we going to talk about roger's midlife crisis or should we leave?

224
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:41,923
I think we should talk about roger.

225
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,240
I also think we should talkabout you.

226
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,651
I don'T.

227
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:47,402
Roger,let's go.

228
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:49,271
Thisis why you have no clients.

229
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,752
Janet.

230
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:54,791
Yeah,dust that table,baby.

231
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,060
Show me how clean you can get it.

232
00:09:57,147 --> 00:10:00,091
Qui,moi?

233
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:03,553
might be time for you to put that camera down and.

234
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,401
Throw me on the couch.

235
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,443
Is that how this goes?

236
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:11,270
From what I remember.

237
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:14,773
We haven't played naughty french maid in a while.

238
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:18,223
you look amazing.

239
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:20,412
I kind of like the costume closet.

240
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,672
I kind of like the toy chest.

241
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,153
do you miss it?

242
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:32,872
The playroom?

243
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:34,850
A little.

244
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,632
but I haven't noticed a slow-down in the action,

245
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:39,933
just a reduction in the number of players.

246
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:43,881
and is that okay?

247
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:45,792
Are we enough?

248
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,921
Baby.

249
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:52,260
most times we're more than I can handle.

250
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,931
uh,when will lunch be ready?

251
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,560
In a little while.

252
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:59,083
You want to make s'mores tonight?

253
00:10:59,128 --> 00:10:59,811
Uh,no.

254
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:01,630
Tomorrow night,we're gonna roast marshmallows,

255
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:03,940
tell scary stories around the campfire.

256
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,470
Tonight is charades.

257
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:08,261
Whatever you say.

258
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:11,352
Is laurie still on the phone?

259
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:16,083
She's been on that thing since we got here.

260
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,181
Uh,let me.

261
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,220
laurie,it's time to get off the phone.

262
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:27,263
I'll be off in a minute.

263
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:29,731
You said that an hour ago.

264
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,930
Come on,laurie,it's time.

265
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:33,301
I got to go.

266
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:35,250
I'll call you later.

267
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,122
I miss you.

268
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:39,060
I miss you,too.

269
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:40,643
Bye.

270
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:42,201
Bye.

271
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,803
How's doug?

272
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:51,230
He's far away.

273
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:53,412
We're not just being jerks.

274
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:57,012
You know there are reasons why we're concerned about you dating him.

275
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:58,353
I know.

276
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,891
They just don't matter to me.

277
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:06,903
Can you believe the nerve of that woman,telling me I have issues?

278
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,370
And you didn't help.

279
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:11,352
I just figur we should stay since we were paying for the whole hour.

280
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,413
No,we are not.

281
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:15,230
I refuse to pay for services we did not receiver.

282
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:16,950
And I'm gonna let her know that.

283
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:20,232
hello.

284
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:21,473
Roger.

285
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:23,010
Hi,it's susan.

286
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:23,971
Susan.

287
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,013
Let me just wash my hands.

288
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:25,893
Rick's fine.

289
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:28,871
He and bj are off having fun.

290
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:30,193
Oh,great.

291
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:34,163
So you,uh,gonna skip some rocks while you're up there?

292
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:37,012
Wouldn't be the same without you.

293
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,553
coaching me.

294
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:41,093
Pretend I'm there.

295
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:42,171
Give me the phone.

296
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:43,411
Uh,hey,here's janet.

297
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:44,320
Bye.

298
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:46,041
Bye.

299
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,023
Susan,you're not gonna believe this.

300
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:49,831
I lost the number to the cabin.

301
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:51,032
Would you mind giving it to me again?

302
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:52,612
Let me just,uh,get a pen.

303
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,523
Okay,shoot.

304
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:02,391
Uh,you're a fountain.

305
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:03,210
Water.

306
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:04,290
Uh,water fountain.

307
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:05,253
It's a movie,right?

308
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:06,420
Uh,flying.

309
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,293
Um,one flew over the cuckoo's nest.

310
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:11,361
Oh,come on,just try again,do something different.

311
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:12,761
Okay,help us,laurie.

312
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:14,603
You're flying again.

313
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:17,350
A bird.Movie's about a bird.

314
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,132
Uh,jonathan livingston seagull.

315
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:21,320
Rick You're a dancer.

316
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,173
You're a ballerina.

317
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,341
You're a beautiful,beautiful ballerina.

318
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:25,722
You're a jerk.

319
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:27,133
Bj.

320
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:29,973
It's the towering inferno!

321
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:31,981
Well,why didn't you go like this?

322
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:37,683
why don't you shut up?

323
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:38,732
Bj.

324
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,790
don't even think about using that phone,laurie.

325
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:41,761
Why not?

326
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:42,833
We're playing a game.

327
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:44,272
I don't want to play.

328
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:45,391
I'm serious.

329
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:46,183
Susan Come on,guys.

330
00:13:46,247 --> 00:13:47,030
We're having fun.

331
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:48,213
 No we're not.

332
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:49,801
We're being forced to pretend we're having fun.

333
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,910
Okay,now this has gone far enough.

334
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:54,643
You're not calling him,and you're not seeing him anymore.

335
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:55,462
Understand?

336
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:56,913
You can't stop me from seeing him.

337
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,712
I can report him to the school board.

338
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,510
See how many jobs he gets after that.

339
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:01,290
You wouldn't dare.

340
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:04,381
He is a grown man trolling for young girls.

341
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:07,511
I mean,he obviously has bad judgment and no moral character.

342
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,261
You're going to talk about morals?

343
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:13,430
You were about to have sex with another woman in our living room.

344
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:14,960
Laurie!

345
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:25,642
I have no idea what's going on between the two of you,

346
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:30,941
but you have no right lecturing me about anything!

347
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:51,461
any luck?

348
00:14:51,477 --> 00:14:54,261
Yeah,fixed it.

349
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,753
Morning.

350
00:14:58,326 --> 00:14:59,430
Laurie.

351
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:02,051
just give her some space,okay?

352
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:04,253
When did she become this?

353
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:06,580
When she met doug stephens.

354
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:08,003
Oh,god.

355
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,870
Listen,this isn't just a schoolgirl crush,bruce.

356
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:14,322
I think she's serious about this one.

357
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:16,260
And-and she'S.

358
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:18,682
confused about what she saw the other night.

359
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:21,831
I am not gonna explain myself to a teenager.

360
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,520
Then I suggest you leave her alone.

361
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:30,943
Look,look,we didn't just come up here for the kids.

362
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:33,713
We came up here for us.

363
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:36,642
So let's do something.

364
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:38,831
Just the two of us.

365
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:43,722
What did you have in mind?

366
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:47,861
Well,you remember the first time you brought me up here?

367
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:52,391
We got sandwiches atthat deli in town and drove to cave point for a picnic.

368
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:57,312
I don't think it counts as a picnic if you never even look at the fo.

369
00:15:57,397 --> 00:15:59,971
Meet me there at 300.

370
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:13,023
Yeah?

371
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:14,801
Janet.

372
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,092
Come in.

373
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:21,842
I just,uh,came to inform you that we will not be paying for yesterday's session.

374
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:26,370
Plumber failed to fix my pipes,I wouldn't pay him,and I will not pay you.

375
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:27,681
Please.

376
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,481
have a seat.

377
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:31,823
I don't expect you to pay.

378
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,063
I would like to understand what happened yesterday.

379
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:39,342
Um,roger needed help,and you didn't help him.

380
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:41,723
That's,that's what happened.

381
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:45,981
I sense you were having feelings that you couldn't or felt that you shouldn't express.

382
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,960
Was I wrong?

383
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:52,470
Not entirely.

384
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:57,212
Uh,I am frustrated that roger can't find a job.

385
00:16:57,286 --> 00:17:01,093
I could walk into an agency and get a secretarial job this afternoon.

386
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:04,210
And I would,too,but i wouldn't want to upset roger.

387
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:05,732
Why would it upset him?

388
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:08,912
Well,he's the man,he should provide for the family.

389
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:10,291
Might appreciate the help.

390
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:14,543
Your salary might take some pressure off of him.

391
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,471
I hadn't thought of that.

392
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:19,833
well,I-I do make a little money selling kitchen necessities,

393
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:22,013
but that's just once every few months.

394
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:26,173
Janet,you don't do roger any favors by making yourself less than you are.

395
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,353
He'll stay in a place that's not good for him,

396
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:30,720
you'll start to resent him and lose respect for him.

397
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:33,210
And once respect goes,love goes.

398
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:36,903
And you may start looking to other men.

399
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:41,303
Have you looked to other men?

400
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:46,241
There is a man who-who has been looking at me.

401
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,910
He,uh,he asked me to dance.

402
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:58,341
And he arranged for us to be partners in a-a scavenger hunt.

403
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,801
And,uh,he kissed me.

404
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:05,440
And how'd that make you feel?

405
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:12,082
Well,I felt bad for him,uh,because.

406
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:15,900
because obviously he,he can't have me.

407
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,933
you sure?

408
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,103
Excuse me?

409
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:24,053
Tell me about this man.

410
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:41,061
Babe.

411
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:42,870
you're gonna have to get that.

412
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:44,112
Oh,let it ring.

413
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:46,082
Whoever it is is not giving up.

414
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,802
Just answer it.

415
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,622
I'm not going anywhere.

416
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:56,590
hello.

417
00:18:57,715 --> 00:19:00,311
anthony,old buddy.

418
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,520
Haven't heard from you in months.

419
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:08,060
Oh,no,no,I'm afraid we can'T.

420
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,122
Well,we're keeping a low profile for a while.

421
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:16,400
You will be the first to know.

422
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:19,531
anthony and michelle?

423
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:20,883
They're back from italy.

424
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:23,782
They wanted to have a little private party with us tonight.

425
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:26,362
you know how we are with them.

426
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:27,922
Oh,believe me,I do.

427
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:29,763
If we're keeping it in the marriage,

428
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:34,022
we should stay far away from those two.

429
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:36,052
So.

430
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:38,062
where were we?

431
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:40,422
That's for me to know.

432
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:42,943
and you.

433
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,140
To find out.

434
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,821
And-and he's,he's gorgeous.

435
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,113
You know?

436
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:56,453
And he's,he's an airline pilot.

437
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:59,893
and he has this little mustache.

438
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:03,940
What am I gonna do?

439
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:08,511
You're absolutely sure that this is not an avenue you wish to explore?

440
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:12,103
I-I couldn'T.

441
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,431
I.

442
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:16,620
no,no,no!

443
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:18,553
No.

444
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,103
Then maybe you should think about telling this man

445
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:22,380
that his attention makes you feel uncomfortable,

446
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:24,982
that you'll remain friends and nothing more.

447
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,621
Nip it in the bud.

448
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,220
I didn't know you could skip rocks.

449
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,342
Oh,roger.

450
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,491
taught me couple weeks ago when we all came up here.

451
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,881
Why did you marry dad?

452
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:00,730
Laurie.

453
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:01,812
he's your father.

454
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:03,730
I'm not trying to be insulting.

455
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:06,270
It's a serious question.

456
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:10,603
What was it about him that.

457
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:15,790
made you think you wanted to spend the rest of your life with him?

458
00:21:16,898 --> 00:21:20,121
Well,we weren't together very long before I got pregnant.

459
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:21,783
I-I didn'T.

460
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:24,480
have a lot of time to think about it.

461
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:28,453
If you hadn't been pregnant with me,would you have married him?

462
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:30,700
Not then.

463
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,351
But-but later,sure.

464
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:36,903
Laurie,he's a good man.

465
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:41,891
He is kind and smart and.

466
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:45,081
he loves this family.

467
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:50,691
Do you still want to be married to him?

468
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:51,683
Of course.

469
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:54,723
But you're messing around with other people.

470
00:21:58,478 --> 00:22:01,680
relationships are.

471
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:02,972
complicated.

472
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:05,261
They change over time.

473
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,122
You-you can't understand that right now.

474
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,142
no,I can't,because all I want is doug.

475
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:12,632
He's all I think about.

476
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:16,792
If it ever got to the point that I wanted someone else.

477
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,592
I'd leave him.

478
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,873
Everything seems so black and white to you right now,so simple.

479
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,921
It is simple.

480
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:27,790
You love him or you don'T.

481
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:30,951
It would kill me to see doug with someone else.

482
00:22:31,027 --> 00:22:33,873
Do you think your father and i never had hat?

483
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,542
We did.

484
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:38,021
We felt exactly the same way you do now.

485
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:40,070
Felt.

486
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,950
Do you hear yourself,mom?

487
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:50,311
You can't compare what you're going through to a relationship that has lasted 18 years.

488
00:22:50,387 --> 00:22:52,741
It's not the same thing.

489
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:54,460
One day,you'll understand that.

490
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:56,870
God,I hope not.

491
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,840
I just want doug.

492
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:03,230
And it is that simple.

493
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:30,800
Hello?

494
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:32,211
Roger?

495
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:33,712
It's susan.

496
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,313
Hey.

497
00:23:35,387 --> 00:23:36,583
What's going on?

498
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:37,551
Everything's fine.

499
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:41,183
I-I just wanted to say that I.

500
00:23:41,747 --> 00:23:43,961
I skipped rocks.

501
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:45,311
Yeah?

502
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:46,511
Yeah.

503
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:49,790
I used the wrist thing.

504
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:52,000
Worked like a charm.

505
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,383
Are you okay?

506
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:56,860
This trip's not as.

507
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,882
fun as the last one.

508
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:02,851
I wish I could be there.

509
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:03,741
I wish you.

510
00:24:03,796 --> 00:24:05,141
susan?

511
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:06,573
Where were you?

512
00:24:06,665 --> 00:24:07,763
I waited for an hour.

513
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:08,691
Oh,my goodness.

514
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:11,341
I-I didn't realize what time it was.

515
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,171
Who are you talking to?

516
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,042
Just.

517
00:24:16,116 --> 00:24:17,923
checking to see if the phone is working.

518
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:20,753
Thank you,uh,for your help.Good-bye.

519
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:27,042
You stood me up.

520
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:28,831
Laurie and I had a fight.

521
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:31,390
I-I just,I lost track of time.

522
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:34,723
Come on,let's go now.

523
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:39,150
Bruce,please don't make a big deal out of this.

524
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:40,133
It is a big deal.

525
00:24:40,198 --> 00:24:43,260
Things can't always go according to your plan,bruce.

526
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:45,942
I thought it was our plan to get this family back on track?

527
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,811
Mom,dad?

528
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,373
What?

529
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:51,143
Laurie's gone.

530
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,283
I need to get to alpine valley.

531
00:25:12,348 --> 00:25:14,270
I'm going as far as honey creek.

532
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:15,782
That's fine.

533
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:22,223
Hitching ain't the smartest thing for a girl.

534
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:25,220
You trying to getyourself killed?

535
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:26,121
No.

536
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:29,172
I just got into a fight with my mom.

537
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:30,312
and my dad.

538
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:32,482
About a boy.

539
00:25:33,268 --> 00:25:34,242
How'd you know?

540
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:36,093
I've been married three times.

541
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:39,631
My folks never had a kind word to say about none of 'em.

542
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:41,023
Wait no,no,no.

543
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:44,503
I've been married four yeah,I've been married four times.

544
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:46,613
You don't remember how many times you've been married?

545
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,560
Well,men,they're like light bulbs,you know?

546
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:53,441
You keep screwing till one of 'em works.

547
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:57,400
And they don't last forever.

548
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:58,232
That's sad.

549
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,303
No,it's not.

550
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:02,422
It's best if you wear them out.

551
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:04,601
Meaning?

552
00:26:04,685 --> 00:26:09,203
Love the hell out of 'em,marry 'em,don't marry 'em just get in the game.

553
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,630
Forever is not the point.

554
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:16,332
You want to go see this boy?

555
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:18,903
That's why you need the ride,huh?

556
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:19,640
Yes.

557
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:21,091
Okay.

558
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:25,780
Honey creek,here we come.

559
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:39,732
hey,jan.

560
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:41,863
What a nice surprise.

561
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:45,401
I need to speak to you about something,and it's best not done over the phone.

562
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,403
Come on in.

563
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:50,942
Trina just,uh,left for the market.

564
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:53,833
I know.I mean,I thought I saw her driving away.

565
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:56,533
Can I get you something to drink?

566
00:26:56,607 --> 00:26:58,801
No,I'd better be sober for this.

567
00:26:58,856 --> 00:26:59,691
Okay.

568
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:01,713
Lay it on me.

569
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,983
See.

570
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:06,672
I forgot my billfold.

571
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:08,383
Oh,janet.

572
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:10,033
What are you doing here?

573
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:11,771
Jan came to tell us something.

574
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:13,473
Something important,I think.

575
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:17,810
I just,uh.

576
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:19,792
wanted to.

577
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:22,352
invite you both for dinner tonight.

578
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:23,691
Bruce and susan are out of town.

579
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:27,922
I thought it might be a nice chance for us to get to know one anotheR.

580
00:27:27,977 --> 00:27:29,820
Oh,well.

581
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:30,870
I think we're free.

582
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah.

583
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,563
We eat early,530.

584
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,371
Well,we better get dressed,then.

585
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,272
Well,I'll see you tonight,okay.

586
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:46,272
530?

587
00:27:46,336 --> 00:27:47,973
That's like lunch.

588
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:50,032
She couldn't have gotten very far.

589
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:52,243
Bj saw her half an hour ago.

590
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:53,883
"Give her space," you said.

591
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:55,793
Is this enough space for you?

592
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:57,810
You know,blaming me won't bring her back.

593
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:58,880
If you hadn't blown up at her.

594
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:00,470
as long as she's under my roof.

595
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:03,770
she's not under your roof,now is she,bruce?

596
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:14,163
I hope these taste okay.

597
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:15,902
Martinis are not my specialty.

598
00:28:16,016 --> 00:28:19,082
I've never met a martini I didn't like,at least enough to get by.

599
00:28:19,817 --> 00:28:21,530
Cheese ball?

600
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:25,082
Janet,this is a lovely wall sculpture.

601
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:28,143
My parents surprised us with it as a housewarming gift.

602
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:30,492
Well,it's unique.

603
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:32,470
Just like jan.

604
00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:34,260
Please,sit.

605
00:28:34,305 --> 00:28:36,253
Dinner will be ready soon.

606
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:40,061
This is a fine cheese ball.

607
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:41,141
Did you make that,jan?

608
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:41,901
Ys.

609
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:45,603
Well,somebody else made the cheese I formed it into a ball.

610
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,860
I like the nuts.

611
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:49,112
It's a nice touch.

612
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,253
I need to baste the chicken.

613
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:56,811
Tom,would you mind helping me in the kitchen?

614
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:03,963
Sure.

615
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:07,220
I don't know much about basting.

616
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:08,323
tom,I like you.

617
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:09,653
I really do.

618
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,462
But the attention you've been showing me is making me uncomfortable.

619
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:16,311
Oh,jan,I'm sorry.

620
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,483
no,let me finish.

621
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:22,813
It's making me uncomfortable because.

622
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:27,281
you're not alone.

623
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,490
I feel things,too.

624
00:29:32,748 --> 00:29:37,572
You live in a world where you can have any woman you want.

625
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:41,103
And I'm flattered that you think I can be a part of it.

626
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:43,353
But I can'T.

627
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:44,921
Does that make sense?

628
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:48,591
Oh,yeah,yeah,um,I'm with you.

629
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:51,760
I'm sorry.

630
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:54,751
No,I,um.

631
00:29:54,807 --> 00:29:58,353
I appreciate you bringing this up before things.

632
00:29:58,416 --> 00:29:59,930
got out of hand.

633
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:01,673
Thank you.

634
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:04,103
You're welcome.

635
00:30:04,156 --> 00:30:06,021
You're pretty brave,you know that?

636
00:30:06,078 --> 00:30:08,822
You see something that needs to get done and you do it.

637
00:30:08,877 --> 00:30:11,633
Boy,I admire that.

638
00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:13,452
As a friend.

639
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:29,843
So,you and tom really aren'T.

640
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:32,581
You know.

641
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:36,050
no.

642
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:39,920
These days,we're just like you and janet.

643
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:41,863
I doubt that.

644
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:51,182
It must be difficult,getting involved with other people

645
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,951
and not developing feelings for them.

646
00:30:53,997 --> 00:30:56,900
That must happen,right?

647
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:59,622
Sometimes.

648
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:06,482
Janet's trying,you know.

649
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:10,553
She wants to be exciting and interesting to you.

650
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:18,881
But it doesn't matter how much she tries if she's not the woman you want.

651
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:29,180
What do I do?

652
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,401
Well,the way I see it,you have two choices.

653
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:40,132
You can tell susan how you feel and take the consequences.

654
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:44,292
And there will be consequences,roger.

655
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:50,603
Or you can to find a way to.

656
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:53,202
get over her.

657
00:32:06,737 --> 00:32:08,093
what are you looking for?

658
00:32:08,158 --> 00:32:11,421
A news station in case something's happened to her.

659
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:17,152
If someone hurts her,I will never forgive myself.

660
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:18,331
Or you.

661
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:20,062
All we did was our job as parents.

662
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:21,910
We're at a party every other night.

663
00:32:21,986 --> 00:32:26,180
We are so busy trying to make ourselves feel good.

664
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:29,133
Or alive or younger I don't know,like we still love each other.

665
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:32,120
The last thing we are doing is our job as parents.

666
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:34,630
Look,you are a great mother.

667
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:38,323
And of course we still love each other.

668
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:40,901
At least I still love you.

669
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:42,570
All right,and that's another deep track

670
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,611
and that finishes this hour's rock block.

671
00:32:44,677 --> 00:32:46,763
We're going to take a commercial break,and when we come back,

672
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:50,272
jackson browne,who ll be playing at alpine valley tonight.

673
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:51,650
oh,my god.Pull over,bruce.

674
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:53,870
We need to find a pay phone.

675
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:56,380
Yes,thank you,operator.

676
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:59,821
They found two doug stephens,but only one in rogers park.

677
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:02,291
Hello.

678
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,282
Is this doug stephens,the teacher?

679
00:33:05,346 --> 00:33:06,422
Uh,yes.

680
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:07,331
Who's this?

681
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:09,022
This is laurie's mother.

682
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:10,762
Oh,mrs.Miller.

683
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:11,832
She just called me.

684
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:15,092
She's at a diner in honey creek called the way station coffee shop.

685
00:33:15,147 --> 00:33:16,801
I told her to stay put,I'd come get her.

686
00:33:16,857 --> 00:33:18,331
She got all the way to honey creek?

687
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:19,430
That's halfway home.

688
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,783
Mrs.Miller,I'm so sorry.

689
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:23,302
I have to go.

690
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,583
I know where she is.

691
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:32,292
Hit me.

692
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:33,261
What?

693
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,931
I kissed samantha and you're never gonna get over it until you hit me.

694
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:38,131
You told her I felt sorry for her.

695
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:38,942
Don't you?

696
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:40,112
No.

697
00:33:40,177 --> 00:33:41,382
I feel sorry for you.

698
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:43,813
Well,screw you and your stupid girlfriend.

699
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:45,690
She kisses like a fish and she smells like one.

700
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:55,182
get.

701
00:34:03,435 --> 00:34:04,580
you had enough?

702
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,840
Yeah.

703
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:13,993
you feel better?

704
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:16,260
Yeah.

705
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:18,351
Good.

706
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,541
I think my family's really messed up.

707
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:36,752
laurie!

708
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:37,830
How did you.

709
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:39,282
You proud of yourself?Come on.

710
00:34:39,295 --> 00:34:40,340
No.Doug's picking me up.

711
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:41,362
We're going to the concert.

712
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:42,332
Like hell you are.

713
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:43,073
Bruce.

714
00:34:43,137 --> 00:34:44,222
look,you're coming back with us.

715
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,111
Now go get in the car.

716
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:46,102
Laurie!

717
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:49,041
You see what you did?

718
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:50,682
You could have gotten my daughter killed.

719
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,153
Calm down.

720
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:53,363
He-he helped us find her.

721
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,583
You told my parents where I was?

722
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:56,902
You scared the hell out of them.

723
00:34:56,957 --> 00:34:58,070
I ought to have you arrested.

724
00:34:58,115 --> 00:35:00,542
You do that and you will never see me again.

725
00:35:00,595 --> 00:35:01,860
Okay,time out.

726
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:04,592
Everybody back off,take a breath!

727
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:08,701
We need,uh.

728
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:12,060
pie.

729
00:35:31,155 --> 00:35:33,731
so,what,you don't know anybody your own age?

730
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:35,823
- Dad.
- no,that's a fair question.

731
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:39,621
I'm 24,laurie's 17.

732
00:35:39,695 --> 00:35:41,623
Mom was 16 when you guys got married.

733
00:35:41,698 --> 00:35:45,671
excuse me,doug and I are having a conversation.

734
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:52,123
You certainly inspired her to get involved in the community.

735
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:53,533
And to do well in school.

736
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:55,902
How hard can it be to get good grades if you're dating the teacher?

737
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,090
We never did anything until summer school was over.

738
00:35:58,136 --> 00:36:01,861
Mr.Miller,you feel she's too young to be dating someone like me and I respect that.

739
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:02,790
I do.

740
00:36:02,846 --> 00:36:05,570
I fought the idea myself.

741
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:07,341
But.

742
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,390
I care about her.

743
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:15,540
And at some point,I realized,laurie's capable of making her own choices.

744
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:18,883
And I respect that,too.

745
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:30,400
would you like coffee?

746
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:32,561
I think janet made peach cobbler.

747
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:35,002
Oh,nothing for me.Thanks.

748
00:36:35,595 --> 00:36:36,721
Me either.

749
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:39,661
I-I think we're going to have to call it a night.

750
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:42,752
Well,okay,let me tell janet.

751
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:51,373
How can an evening be freaky and boring at the same time?

752
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:52,762
Oh,well,they're very sweet.

753
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,653
Is this what it's like to be normal?

754
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:03,273
do you think,uh,anthony and michelle are still available?

755
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:05,770
Seriously?

756
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:09,380
I think it's time for us to step out of the penalty box.

757
00:37:09,848 --> 00:37:11,420
Thank you for a lovely evening.

758
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:12,751
Oh,do you have to rush away?

759
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:15,241
Oh,we're going to try to get to bed early,right,dear?

760
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:16,482
That's the plan.

761
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:17,430
Well.

762
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:18,713
good night.

763
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:19,493
Good night.

764
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:20,573
Thanks for coming.

765
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:21,813
Good night.

766
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:22,931
Night.

767
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:26,160
See ya.

768
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:40,850
I can see why you like him.

769
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:45,961
Mom,I'm going with doug.

770
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:47,850
All right.

771
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:50,673
Just be careful driving.

772
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:54,131
We'll see you tomorrow night.

773
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:58,163
Mom?

774
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,593
Life is short.

775
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:04,962
We need to be happy now.

776
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:08,920
Sometimes life is long,laurie.

777
00:38:10,675 --> 00:38:13,863
Even more reason.

778
00:38:25,198 --> 00:38:26,800
Where's she going?

779
00:38:26,906 --> 00:38:28,642
With him.

780
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:30,553
I let her go.

781
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:32,013
Laurie.

782
00:38:32,087 --> 00:38:35,211
dad,don'T.

783
00:38:41,106 --> 00:38:44,051
Uh,look,um.

784
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:47,081
if you-you need something.

785
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:48,832
Thanks.

786
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:18,160
I guess we don't need this anymore.

787
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:19,781
The psychiatrist's number.

788
00:39:19,848 --> 00:39:22,590
You really hated her,didn't you?

789
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,350
Actually,I-I went back to see her.

790
00:39:25,438 --> 00:39:26,141
When?

791
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:27,490
Earlier today.

792
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:31,512
Turns out,she's a pretty smart lady,after all.

793
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:35,553
Roger,we can't keep going on with our heads buried in the sand.

794
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:37,542
I-I-I want to help.

795
00:39:37,615 --> 00:39:39,270
So.

796
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:43,970
I'm going to sign up with an employment agency.

797
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:51,930
Okay.

798
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:53,323
Really?

799
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:54,603
Yeah.

800
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:58,163
Okay.

801
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:05,982
I'm going to go upstairs and take a bath.

802
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:08,623
Don't forget to take out the garbage.

803
00:40:43,446 --> 00:40:44,883
hello?

804
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:46,890
Hello?
