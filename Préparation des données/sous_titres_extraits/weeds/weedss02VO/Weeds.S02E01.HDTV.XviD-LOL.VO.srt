1
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:19,903
Nancy?

2
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:23,413
Just a minute!

3
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:35,963
God! You're beautiful.

4
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:37,510
Come here.

5
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:40,841
Mom?

6
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,433
Mom?

7
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:16,593
Checking for monsters?

8
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,552
What? Uh... Oh!

9
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:23,843
No, I can't find my shoe.
Uh, sandal. It's a sandal.

10
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:26,352
So, I'm guessing no breakfast.

11
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,607
No, I'm not really
a breakfast person.

12
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:32,972
I like to have coffee in the
morning but after that I'm good till

13
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:37,445
lunch usually. Sometimes I
have a bagel around... 10:30.

14
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:40,363
- I'll make you some coffee.
- Uh, no, I should go home.

15
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:44,531
Ah ah! Found it.

16
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,621
You have big feet.

17
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:51,163
Why do you have a
gun in your dresser?

18
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,331
Were you snooping?

19
00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:55,713
My feet used to be smaller but
I went up a size with each kid.

20
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,423
It's just sitting there...

21
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:58,462
in your dresser.

22
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:00,883
I saw it when I went to pee.

23
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,391
I like your big feet.

24
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:12,231
They're not like Fred Flinstone feet.
They're just...

25
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:14,643
long. Uh...

26
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:18,613
What do you do exactly...

27
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:19,941
for a living?

28
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:23,742
- I'm a DEA agent.
- You never said anything.

29
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:27,702
You never asked. And it's not
really a job that you advertise.

30
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:31,703
- I need to go home.
- No, no, no. Come on! Wait!

31
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:34,371
- Wait a second!
- Oh, God! You're naked.

32
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,180
So were you until
a few minutes ago.

33
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:38,610
But now it's day time and
I'm all dressed and...

34
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:40,090
- methodist.
- Ah.

35
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:42,802
Well, I need a goodbye
kiss or I'll feel

36
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:45,930
cheap and used.

37
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,453
Should we make
another date now?

38
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:52,353
I'll call you.

39
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:54,521
Did my gun freak you out?

40
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:55,522
Yes.

41
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,692
The one in that dresser, right?

42
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:58,440
Bye!

43
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:15,622
I mean, look at this!

44
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,831
We're never getting
out of here.

45
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,250
Can you tun on the radio?

46
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:22,251
I have called the city
council office over and over

47
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:24,171
about putting in a light here.

48
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,300
Radio?

49
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:28,760
No, I can't have no
waves right now.

50
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,640
I'm too annoyed.

51
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:33,142
What are you doing?

52
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:35,682
- I'm hungry.
- Please!

53
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:37,532
Don't think I didn't see
you eating and drinking

54
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:40,100
every single sample
in the store, Miss.

55
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:43,572
Can't believe they didn't cut
you off after the 7th Chai Latte

56
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:46,362
- Those cups are tiny!
- Yeah, unlike you.

57
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:50,572
- Put the pretzels back!
- No!

58
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:51,823
- Give me the bag!
- No!

59
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:54,792
- I'm throwing them out!
- No, you're not. Stop!

60
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,002
Shit!

61
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:00,832
Oh great!

62
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:02,672
Just perfect.

63
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:12,142
Shit! Goddamn it!

64
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,523
Oh no! She be so angry!

65
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:19,271
This is not your fault.

66
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:21,372
Si, you tell the Mrs.
this is your fault.

67
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:23,022
No, it's not my fault either.

68
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:24,861
Si, is your fault, please.

69
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:28,001
You tell her or she make me sleep
with the dog and the corn snake.

70
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:31,610
There needs to be a
traffic light right here.

71
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,701
...and she made
me kill the rat!

72
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:38,083
Doug Wilson and his merry band of idiots
are just sitting up there and
doing nothing.

73
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:38,582
Asshole!

74
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:39,832
She loves this car.

75
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:42,221
Every month she pays more
for this car than for me.

76
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:43,593
And I have no license.

77
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:46,213
You have no license?
Oh, that's fabulous.

78
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:48,153
Are you even legal?
What's your name?

79
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:52,092
Wait, wait, wait, let me get a pen.
Stay right here.

80
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:54,552
Who is your Mrs.? Your lady?

81
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:56,393
- Mom!
- One second!

82
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:59,313
- What? no, mom! Mom!
- God! One second!

83
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:02,690
- Oh, shit!
- Thank you!

84
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:11,331
Did you realize if I married a non-jew,
I couldn't go to a rabbinical school.

85
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,512
I can go if I'm gay
and my lover is jewish.

86
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:14,741
I can go if I'm single.

87
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:17,492
But I'm not eligible if I
marry a beautiful shiksa

88
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:22,670
with blond silky pubes waxed
into the shape of a shamrock.

89
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:24,582
Doesn't that seem
fucked up to you?

90
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:28,061
You know, I mean, more than half of all
American jews marry outside the tribe.

91
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,011
Clearly, there's
a problem and yet

92
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:33,933
when a jewish person is interested in
pursuing his or her religious calling,

93
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:37,061
if he or she fell in love with
someone outside the faith,

94
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:40,063
- and Lord knows,
we don't always choose who to love -

95
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:43,061
that jew is turned away.

96
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:45,440
How was your sleepover?

97
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:47,823
Yeah, how was your
sleepover, Nancy?

98
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:50,613
Let anyone know you were
taking off for the night?

99
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:51,740
Yes, I did.

100
00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:55,202
Andy and Lupita knew how
to get in touch with me

101
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:59,413
and I don't have to defend my
actions to my teenage child.

102
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,873
I got scared.

103
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,412
-  Oh, honey, you were asleep.
- I woke up!

104
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:07,751
Sweety, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you nervous, okay?

105
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:09,752
I was just at a friend's house.

106
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:14,383
The dishwasher's broken.

107
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:16,473
L upita!

108
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:20,451
Maybe if you'd spend a little more
time around here, you might know that.

109
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,893
Would you please do the dishes?

110
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:24,691
The machine is broke.

111
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:28,692
I know that, that's why I'd
like you to do the dishes.

112
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:29,522
N o.

113
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,112
What do you mean "no"?

114
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:32,443
Makes my hands crack.

115
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:34,400
You need to get
the machine fixed.

116
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,433
Maybe I need to get
a new housekeeper.

117
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,990
Maybe you have too much
love and trust for me

118
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,910
to ever let me go.

119
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:50,221
Call the repair guy and get him
over here as soon as possible.

120
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:51,091
O kay.

121
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:54,303
So is this gonna be a
regular thing with you?

122
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:56,010
What is with your tone?

123
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:57,013
Morning!

124
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:59,800
She's not wearing any pants.

125
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:01,681
That's okay,
I'm almost a rabbi.

126
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:04,320
Yeah, Shane is not and you're
a lawsuit waiting to happen.

127
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,140
Go upstairs,
put some clothes on.

128
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,563
Sorry.

129
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,322
Lupita, would you
get that please?

130
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,361
I didn't say that
Megan could sleep over.

131
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:16,032
They didn't do much sleeping.

132
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:18,363
- Excuse me?
- Shut up, you spying perv!

133
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:20,581
I was looking for mom,
it was an accident.

134
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:23,123
An amazing accident.

135
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:25,910
I don't even wanna know.

136
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:28,601
You didn't tell she couldn't sleepover.
Come on, Nancy!

137
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:30,253
Stop calling Nancy!

138
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:31,883
My name is Mom

139
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:33,421
or Mommy Dearest.

140
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:39,931
For beautiful Nancy with
the lon elegant... feet.

141
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:42,390
Don't be afraid, Peter.

142
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:44,182
- Ew!
- Pete?

143
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,102
Nice work, Mommy Dearest.

144
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,567
Oh, dear God!

145
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:57,112
Were you mean to your mother
when you were a teenager?

146
00:09:57,656 --> 00:09:59,425
I didn't live with my mom,
I lived with Heylia.

147
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:01,463
And you don't pull
that shit with Heylia.

148
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:03,201
I want my kids to fear me.

149
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,873
Do what my mom did.

150
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:07,831
- Which was?
- She shot me in the leg.

151
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
Are you serious?

152
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,722
She shot me in the leg and I
am afraid of that woman now.

153
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,343
Was she on drugs?

154
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:16,352
My mom never did a drug
a day in her life.

155
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:18,552
My mom was... a drunk.

156
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,551
One night she thought
that I was my pops.

157
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:24,001
That's how we got into
the whole drug game.

158
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:27,032
The painkillers I was getting from the
doctors was making me sleep all the time

159
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:30,510
so Heylia switch me to weeds,
started meeting people in the industry.

160
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:33,273
Before that she
worked at Price Club.

161
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:36,232
Hey, team!
Solved all our problems yet?

162
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:39,780
I might shoot Silas in the leg.

163
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:44,622
Look, right now if we
liquidated everything,

164
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,801
got ourselves out of the lease,
we're looking at maybe

165
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:49,230
half of what we need to
start growing marijuana.

166
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,211
What about insurance?

167
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,091
You got some kind of sneaky awesome
plot behind them crazy eyes?

168
00:10:58,185 --> 00:10:59,092
Could we?

169
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:00,812
Baby, that shit only
works on The Sopranos

170
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:04,481
and I will guarantee you that the fire
chief is better at investigating arson

171
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:05,760
and you are commiting it.

172
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:08,471
You are a drug dealer.

173
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,233
Not a fire bug.

174
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:13,801
Why do you have to call
Nancy "baby" and I don't?

175
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:14,810
Black thing.

176
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:16,980
Fine.

177
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:19,692
Can I have your
help here, please?

178
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,993
A nyway...

179
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:31,210
baby got some problems.

180
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:36,963
Did I mention I slept with
a DEA agent last night?

181
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:43,930
I'm not going to jail for you.

182
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,270
Fuck this! I'm out.
You can kiss this nigger goodbye.

183
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,601
No, my kid bit his
kid's foot in karate.

184
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:50,781
How could he plan that?

185
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:53,653
It's just a totally
fucked up random thing.

186
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:56,701
He came right on and told me what he
does for a living, he doesn't know.

187
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:57,660
Fuck "he doesn't know"!

188
00:11:57,697 --> 00:11:59,702
And even if he doesn't,
he will and me...

189
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:00,821
I ma be gone.

190
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:02,751
Do not come around Heylia's,
do you hear me?

191
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:06,080
You have stepped in shit and you
ain't gonna track it to my house.

192
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,210
Conrad, I won't talk
to him anymore.

193
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:09,703
It's late.

194
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:11,291
Wait, wait.

195
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:17,293
Are you angry 'cause I fucked a DEA
agent or 'cause I fucked somebody else?

196
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:18,633
Oh, wow!

197
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,551
You think this is
about arrogant ass?

198
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:23,551
Let me tell you something...

199
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,611
we wouldn't be having this
conversation right now

200
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,850
if you'd have fucked
a travel agent.

201
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:32,350
Get out of my way.

202
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,863
I have asked in

203
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:44,861
every way that I know how.

204
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:47,782
You have repeatedly
ignored my requests.

205
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:52,413
But it does not change the fact
that there needs to be a light

206
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,372
at the intersection.

207
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:57,500
It's a matter of public safety.

208
00:12:58,796 --> 00:12:59,790
What is?

209
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:01,550
The light.

210
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:03,172
Celia, lights cost money.

211
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:06,053
Yes, isn't that what
the budget is for, Doug?

212
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,651
All of our money has been
allocated for the year, we...

213
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,191
we're renovating this chamber here.
Haven't you seen the plans?

214
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:14,153
I mean, come on! We got like a
full kitchen going on back there.

215
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:17,311
So I pay my taxes so
you can have a kitchen?

216
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:18,651
And a parade.

217
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:20,911
And the balance of what
we owe the branding firm

218
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:25,151
for the new town slogan: "Agrestic,
the  best of the  best-ic." Huh?

219
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,461
And a lot of other stuff.
A lot of other stuff too.

220
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:30,591
Now, if that's everything,
I wanna go home and watch the game.

221
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:32,663
And drink a little bit.

222
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:33,870
A djourned.

223
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,372
Your turn to bring
snacks next week.

224
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:38,261
I think I speak for
everyone when I say

225
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:41,462
vegetarian pigs in
blanket are bullshit.

226
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:42,631
Okay.

227
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:48,301
Oh! Celia. I'm sorry.

228
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,822
Although I do think that
counts as a touchdown.

229
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:00,232
Want a shot of Jack in that?

230
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:07,650
Great article about injecting
human growth hormone to stay young.

231
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:10,380
Except they never say where
they're getting it from.

232
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,423
Makes you wonder if
they're sucking the youth

233
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:15,080
out of small brown children
somewhere so that actors

234
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,581
and trophy wives can
stay in business.

235
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:21,212
I  was serious about the shot.
You want?

236
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:23,040
Actually, I do.

237
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:24,840
It's been one of those days.

238
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:27,470
So, you heard about
my accident? Right?

239
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:32,301
And I just got humiliated at city
council by the fuckhead Doug Wilson.

240
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,310
- So what's up with you?
- Just life.

241
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:36,772
Kids.

242
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:39,313
Baking.

243
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,151
You need to get laid.

244
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:42,563
Frankly, so do I.

245
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:44,832
You're seeing anyone?
Maybe we could share.

246
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,361
You should run
for city council.

247
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:49,151
Doug would lose his mind.

248
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:51,492
Oh, I didn't mean
run for Doug's seat.

249
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:53,951
Yeah, but Doug's seat
is up this year.

250
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:55,452
Maybe it's a bad idea.

251
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:57,583
No, I think it's a
perfectly great idea.

252
00:14:57,588 --> 00:15:00,582
Show that asshole that he
can't treat people like shit

253
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:03,591
and ignore their totally
reasonable requests.

254
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:06,050
I'm running for city council.

255
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:09,631
Thank you, Nancy.
I feel so much better now.

256
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:14,972
So, basicly, my whole life
has been leading up to this,

257
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:19,852
to the rabbinat, you know.
It's my true calling.

258
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:23,692
And as far as the Hebrew goes,
I'm a really quick study.

259
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:25,612
I know all the
brugatas already.

260
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:29,901
And I know the word for jellyfish,
it's medusot.

261
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:32,782
And glida, that's ice cream

262
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:36,411
Do you know what ... means?

263
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:37,492
As in:

264
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,372
I think you're full of shit.

265
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,711
No, I don't think
I know that one.

266
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,710
Okay. So,
this has been very amusing,

267
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:48,543
I wish you all the best in
your life and now I'm done.

268
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:51,551
- Wait. What? I'm in?
- You talk a lot.

269
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:53,610
That's a wonderful
quality in a rabbi, no?

270
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:54,840
And yet you say nothing.

271
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:58,930
Oh. Oh! Israeli snap!
That's okay, I can take it.

272
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:01,432
Resiliency is another
excellent rabbinic trait.

273
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:04,020
Time for you to go. Okay?

274
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:05,731
Goodbye!

275
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:08,362
Okay, good.
Thanks for your time.

276
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:13,111
I guess I'm gonna have to look
for another rabbinical school.

277
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:16,823
One that respects my ambition,
one that recognizes my talent.

278
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,412
Yes, our loss.
Good luck to you!

279
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:24,510
I'm begging you.
This is the end of the road for me.

280
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:27,500
Um... if you don't let
me into your school,

281
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:28,753
I'm gonna be killed.

282
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:29,463
Really?

283
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:33,420
Someone holding a gun to your
head saying be a rabbi or die?

284
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:39,060
Actually, yeah.

285
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:43,023
You're my last chance,
Yael Hoffman Director of Admissions.

286
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:46,561
I beseech you!

287
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,861
My life is in your hands.

288
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:53,953
You have 5 minutes to explain
yourself and no more bullshit.

289
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:56,240
And I'm wearing a bra

290
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:58,161
so stop looking for my nipples.

291
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:01,333
- I... How'd you know?
- 4 minutes 50 seconds.

292
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:02,543
Okay.

293
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:10,552
I didn't care what
shit was going on.

294
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,801
Every night we
had family dinner.

295
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:15,472
We were talking about
our day, arguing

296
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:17,062
or giving each
other the stink eye.

297
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:18,851
Whatever, we were all here.

298
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:22,432
All sort of studies talk about how
family dinner's like superglue.

299
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:25,242
Hold you together and fixes
everything that's broke.

300
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,902
Yeah, higher test scores,
less depression.

301
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:29,732
You guys are better than NPR.

302
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:31,731
Or we're the original NPR:

303
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:33,232
Negros Preching Right.

304
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:35,700
And if dinner don't work,

305
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:37,951
you need to smack some
sense into that boy.

306
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:39,952
I'm not much for smacking.

307
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,621
Just don't be his bitch.

308
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:44,802
Now you pushed him out your hooch,
you can puch him out your house.

309
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:46,160
You the boss.

310
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:49,543
Let's see.
You want gruyere or smoked gouda?

311
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:50,921
Smoked gouda.

312
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,251
Here you go.

313
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,383
So, uh, is Conrad around?

314
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:56,972
Now you're about to
lose your panini.

315
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:58,931
You know you ain't
friends no more.

316
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,010
Them are rules.

317
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,510
I just thought...

318
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,150
He out buying me a breast pump.

319
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:04,833
I hope he's getting
you electric.

320
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:06,390
Manual takes forever.

321
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:08,323
Shit. Did we say
electric or manual?

322
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:09,813
We didn't say nothing.

323
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,741
And don't think once you start pumping
that I'm gonna sit up in this house

324
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,911
while you're out there showing
off your brand new titties.

325
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:16,531
I've got a life too, you know.

326
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:20,212
What the hell is
she doing here?

327
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:21,192
Is that the manual?

328
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:23,540
You're gonna have
to take that back.

329
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:25,750
I need the... What do I need?

330
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:27,002
The Pump In Style.

331
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,540
Pump In Style. Electric.

332
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:31,962
This looks delicious, Heylia.

333
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,362
I'm gonna try the
gruyere next time I come.

334
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:35,780
Ain't gonna be no next time.

335
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:38,270
Heylia, Conrad is talking to
me and he's not supposed to.

336
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:41,473
That's right. Boy, get your
black ass back out to that store

337
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:42,892
and get this girl the...

338
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:43,813
Pump In Style.

339
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:45,781
The Pump In Style
and here take this.

340
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:59,781
So what about "Celia Hodes...
it's time for change."

341
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,412
And then we show a big clock

342
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:04,630
and, like, instead of numbers,
they are nickels and dimes and quarters.

343
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,121
Get it? Time for change.
Isn't that cute?

344
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:09,552
- Yeah, that's retarded.
- That is not very nice.

345
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:12,710
I have a nephew who's retarded
and he has to wear a helmet.

346
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:15,423
Where are the other girls?
Didn't we say 4:30?

347
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:18,061
- They're not coming, Celia.
- What do you mean "they're not coming"?

348
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:20,471
No, no, no, no.
This is about Agrestic.

349
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,303
I am so clearly more
qualified than Doug Wilson.

350
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:26,280
They all take stripper fitness
class with Doug's wife Dana.

351
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:28,431
It's a whole bonding thing.

352
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,023
Stripper fitness class?

353
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:31,492
Kenneth doesn't
like me to do it

354
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:34,833
'cause he thinks I'll go lesbo on
him like when I took folk guitare.

355
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:37,360
Hello, ladies.
How's the election planning?

356
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:39,571
Oh, fine.
Trying to find a slogan.

357
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:42,532
No, no, no.
That's grownup juice, not for you.

358
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,572
When can I have
some grownup juice?

359
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:46,951
When you have a daughter
who drives you to it.

360
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:49,003
Celia,

361
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:50,883
just wanted to give
you a heads-up that

362
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:53,302
Doug knows you're running
against him in the elction.

363
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,381
And I care because?

364
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:56,840
He seemed pretty upset.

365
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,641
Especially  when I told him I
couldn't be his campaign manager.

366
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,091
- Why not?
- Why not what?

367
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:02,980
Why can't you be his
campaign manager?

368
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:05,683
'Cause you're running. I...

369
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:08,681
I just assumed that...

370
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:10,433
Am I your campaign manager?

371
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:11,140
No.

372
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,351
How dare you?

373
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:17,361
I run unopposed. This is my thing.
Get your own thing.

374
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:19,573
Well, I tried to
get my own thing.

375
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:21,692
A light at the mall
in Hillgrik Road.

376
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:24,070
But when that thing
didn't work out,

377
00:20:24,205 --> 00:20:26,201
I switched to this thing.

378
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,833
I'm hoping in the end
to get both things.

379
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,163
I'm city councilman Doug.

380
00:20:30,257 --> 00:20:32,291
Not after the next
election you're not.

381
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:35,710
So you're telling me, you don't
want me to work on your campaign.

382
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,343
I wanna win.

383
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:38,552
Fuck you!

384
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:40,963
Dean, there's a child present.

385
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:43,512
Don't call me a child!
I'm a civic leader.

386
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:45,440
And you're not taking
that away from me.

387
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,893
She was talking about me.

388
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:49,012
Doug, I am so on your side.

389
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,273
Thank you, compadre.

390
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:53,062
And I would be honored to
be your campaign manager.

391
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:54,523
We'll see.

392
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:55,571
What do you mean "we'll see"?

393
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:57,743
Do you two think you could
take this little pussy party

394
00:20:57,775 --> 00:21:00,281
somewhere else 'cause
we'retrying to work here.

395
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:03,322
Dad can't say fuck
but you can say pussy.

396
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:05,993
I'll be in my room.

397
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:07,243
Let's go.

398
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:08,911
You will rue the day.

399
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:11,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rue my ass.

400
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:13,623
- Not enough rue.
- Come on!

401
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:18,002
How about "Celia Hodes...
making friends".

402
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:22,883
What's up?

403
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:27,090
Dinner in 10 minutes.

404
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,390
I'm not hungry I just
had Veggie Booty.

405
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,830
Well, you're gonna
sit with us anyway.

406
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:35,852
Family dinner, so wash up.

407
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:42,530
The repair guy didn't come.

408
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:44,403
He was gonna come today.
I was out.

409
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:47,003
Lupita had a hair appointment
so he'll be here tomorrow.

410
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:49,660
- Hey, what's in the bag?
- Family dinner. All of us.

411
00:21:49,826 --> 00:21:51,662
Yeah, I got work to do, Nanc'.

412
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,542
Clear your crap of the table.

413
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,081
Oh, I told Megan I'd
eat at her place.

414
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,251
Well, call and tell
her not tonight.

415
00:21:58,757 --> 00:22:00,251
I made plans.

416
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:02,272
Well, I bought chicken
and you're my son

417
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:04,733
and you're going to sit down
and we're going to eat.

418
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:05,923
So call her.

419
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:07,513
Funny.

420
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,390
- Take the phone.
- Mom!

421
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:13,180
We're gonna have
a family dinner.

422
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:14,743
You're a member of this family.

423
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:19,271
Take the phone,
call your girlfriend. Now.

424
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:27,031
Get your ass in this chair
before I kicked it to Tuesday.

425
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,663
Andy, set the table.

426
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:30,451
Game over, wash your hands.

427
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:32,410
So help me God, I've had it!

428
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:35,752
We're gonna be a family if
I have to kill all of you.

429
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:37,003
You hear me?

430
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,331
Fine, I'll eat twice.

431
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:40,502
Eat 7 times, I don't care!

432
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:42,501
As long as you
eat once with us.

433
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:45,312
You're really invested in this chicken,
aren't you?

434
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,461
Shut up!

435
00:22:50,018 --> 00:22:54,261
See... nice... dinner.

436
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:56,221
So...

437
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:58,482
how was everyone's day?

438
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:01,021
I got a B on my French test.

439
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:02,650
Oh, très bien.

440
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:04,071
Silas?

441
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:05,320
I take Spanish.

442
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,083
Did you get any
test back today?

443
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,192
No.

444
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:13,073
I'm writing about what
being a Jew means to me.

445
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,910
If I write well,
I'll be accepted into rabbinical school.

446
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:19,003
And if I don't...

447
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:21,923
I'll be shipped
overseas to die.

448
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:23,462
So far I've written

449
00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:28,091
"being a Jew means I have no foreskin
and I may be a Taysachs carrier".

450
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:32,261
So, uh, I think I'm gonna die.

451
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:33,760
What's Taysachs?

452
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:37,562
It's a fatal,
genetic lipid storage disorder

453
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:40,241
prevalent upon european Jews.
You don't have to worry about it.

454
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,950
If you had it,
you'd already be dead.

455
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:42,440
Cool.

456
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:43,482
See...

457
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:46,520
Look how we're
learning new things.

458
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:52,783
I'm not going to answer
the phone during dinner.

459
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:56,201
I mean it.

460
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:59,303
Hello, you've reached the Botwins,
we're not home right now.

461
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,672
But if you leave us a message,
we'll come home right away.

462
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:06,423
Uh, Nancy, hi, it's Sanjay.

463
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,773
I thought you might wanna
know that the bakery...

464
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:11,722
is on fire. Okay, bye.

465
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:20,270
So, it looks like your
employee was firing up an oven

466
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:22,850
when his cigarette
lit a gas line.

467
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:26,313
Negligence and stupidity,
pure and simple, ma'am.

468
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:29,360
He could have been killed.

469
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:30,940
I hope you're insured.

470
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:34,451
Does insurance cover
an employee's um...

471
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:37,083
negligence and stupidity?

472
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:39,122
You oughta check
with your carrier.

473
00:24:53,556 --> 00:24:56,011
Something tells me
you're covered.

474
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:01,813
There's no business

475
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:04,643
like grow business.

476
00:25:04,895 --> 00:25:06,653
There's no business

477
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:08,230
I know.
