1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,048
Previously on Weeds.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,084
The puppies are coming of, Nanc'.

3
00:00:04,177 --> 00:00:05,791
After reconstructive surgery,

4
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:07,640
you're gonna feel as good as new. Better!

5
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:11,400
So Blanca, take all of the clothes. Go ahead.

6
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:13,249
How are you set for furniture?

7
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:16,386
You protect your dong and you swing it like your life depended on it.

8
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:19,084
Nanc', you just have to make it look like you're running a bakery

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,266
to legitimize your dealing.

10
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:22,113
Who made me think I could run a bakery?

11
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:23,865
Don't look at me, I'm fucked up on cornbread.

12
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:26,343
I wrote a gangsta rap about killing Devon Rensler.

13
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:29,144
He's got the whole school calling me Strange Botwin.

14
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:34,141
You American dogs have 24 hours to leave our country or else...

15
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:38,303
What am I gonna do with him?

16
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,613
Hey, dude! What's you major?

17
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,073
Are you in the freshman face book?

18
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:56,973
What are you doing here?

19
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:59,151
I'm taking the "create your own small business" seminar.

20
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:00,861
That's alarming.

21
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:02,751
Why aren't you teaching it?

22
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:04,651
Are you kidding? Teachers make shit.

23
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:07,023
I'm here to expand my client base.

24
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,401
I stand at the back of the class and I say:

25
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:12,440
"as an accountant, shouldn't you blah blah blah..."

26
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:12,913
Stop it!

27
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:14,613
Confuses the hell out of everyone.

28
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,851
Finally, all the students, they just give up.

29
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:19,223
And that's when I give them my business cards.

30
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:22,452
Minimum 14 clients guaranteed.

31
00:02:22,507 --> 00:02:23,821
How genius is that?

32
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:24,942
What are you taking?

33
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:26,402
I'm taking a flyer.

34
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,200
Silas needs a tutor.

35
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,051
Should take ceramics.

36
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:31,611
Get your fingers in some clay.

37
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:34,233
That's very sensual, very Demi Moore.

38
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:37,222
I'm certainly not taking your seminar.

39
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:40,222
Smart move. All you gonna get in there is an earful of my bullshit.

40
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:42,660
But with ceramics, you know, you can make a bowl.

41
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,692
- I'll think about it.
- Cool.

42
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:47,161
See you at the kegger!

43
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:13,911
Hey!

44
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:15,933
Who's this?

45
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,110
This is Max.

46
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:19,342
I can stick 6 quarters up my nose.

47
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:20,472
Bullshit!

48
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:22,080
We'll see.

49
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:23,540
Connecticut.

50
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:25,380
Massachusetts.

51
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:27,381
And New Hampshire.

52
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,512
I can't let you stick New England up your nose.

53
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,362
You got lucky this time. What else you guys up to?

54
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:34,262
Mom said we could play as long as we did our homework first.

55
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:35,253
What homework?

56
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:36,910
- Science.
- Science!

57
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:38,281
They're still teaching science?

58
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:39,461
I can help you with that.

59
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:41,451
What do we got? What do we got...

60
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:46,082
Yeah, this is new science. Okay, we're gonna forget this.

61
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:47,502
I suck at science.

62
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:51,290
But I'm good at life so I'll tell you what we're gonna do:

63
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:52,661
we're gonna go online,

64
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:55,302
we're gonna order the teachers' edition of your book.

65
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:56,710
We can do that?

66
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:57,833
Of course!

67
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,871
Can we order sea monkeys too? I ate one once.

68
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:02,911
Bullshit! What did it taste like?

69
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,290
Lemonade.

70
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:07,340
Okay, I'll give you that.

71
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:18,660
Hi, mom.

72
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:21,983
Hello, sweetheart. Where's dad?

73
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:25,580
He's getting you a double double with extra cheese.

74
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:26,893
Good man!

75
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:30,502
Wanna flick some peas?

76
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,450
Don't be scared mommy's fine.

77
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:36,952
I'm not scared.

78
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:39,741
Well then come over here and give me a kiss.

79
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:49,031
You wanna watch some TV?

80
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:50,301
Sure.

81
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:54,841
And you know what?

82
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,841
Later, I'll give you some money and we can go down the end of the hall

83
00:04:57,937 --> 00:05:00,312
and raid the vending machines.

84
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:06,701
Okay, okay, okay. Listen up. Now...

85
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:09,833
if  you ever want to get laid, you gotta learn to cook at least one thing.

86
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,172
Shane, go grab me those carrots.

87
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:17,112
Okay, now, here is how you chop vegetables.

88
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:19,892
Oh my God! Oh my God! My finger!

89
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,232
Yeah, right?

90
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,742
You also gotta learn at least one good joke.

91
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:28,040
You guys try.

92
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:30,342
Butter knives! Butter knives.

93
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:34,231
Hi!

94
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:38,583
Hey!

95
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:41,371
I'm Max's mother, Eileen Dawn.

96
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:45,411
I'm Max's new best friend, Andy Botwin. Come on in.

97
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:46,963
- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:48,850
So you must be Shane favorite uncle.

99
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:50,551
Yep, that's me.

100
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:53,583
How did you get stuck playing daddy?

101
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:55,043
Nancy's out

102
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,641
and the maid went down to Tijuana to buy cheap synthetic hormones.

103
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:01,632
- My eye!
- Max! What is it?

104
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,723
What is it, honey?

105
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:04,470
What should I do with his eye?

106
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,161
You should eat it.

107
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:08,711
That  was no fun!

108
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:12,572
Well, no, it's only fun until someone loses an eye.

109
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,600
That's what you've been teaching them, huh?

110
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:17,071
No wonder Shane loves you.

111
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,012
Yeah, you know, teaching them how to cook.

112
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:24,561
- We were making osso bucco.
- Osso bucco? I love osso bucco.

113
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:26,752
Max and I were just gonna do drive-through.

114
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,400
There's plenty for everyone.

115
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:29,912
Can we stay for dinner?

116
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:32,042
Well, that's up to uncle Andy.

117
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:35,133
Uncle Andy says most definitely. Okay, great job, guys.

118
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,823
Eileen and I are gonna finish up here.

119
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:39,761
Okay, cool. Let's go to my room.

120
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,071
So good to see Max finally find a friend.

121
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:46,690
Yeah. So, you're a single mom, huh?

122
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,111
Yeah, sort of.

123
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:49,470
Sort of?

124
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:52,132
Yeah, just going through sort of a rough patch.

125
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,643
Trial  separation.

126
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:57,010
I'm really sorry to hear that.

127
00:06:57,157 --> 00:07:00,483
Must get pretty lonely around here. You know, all these

128
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:03,672
hermetically sealed houses,

129
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:05,901
chemically treated lawns.

130
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:11,512
Yeah, it's all about the kids.
My friends, they're...

131
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:15,882
You know what? The truth is...

132
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:18,930
I don't have any friends, they're just my neighbors.

133
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,861
I'm completely out of touch, you know.

134
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,903
I wake up to a blank slate.

135
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:25,922
I don't plan anything.

136
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:27,533
It just happens...

137
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:28,950
and I run with it.

138
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:36,932
We got an hour.

139
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:00,240
Oh no! You're gonna get it for that!

140
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:35,710
Isabel!

141
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:37,792
My little sweetheart!

142
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,033
Gram Pat!

143
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:43,720
Here I am! All the way from Florida.

144
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:46,035
It's much cleaner there.

145
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,633
So, how are you?

146
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:50,144
Oh, just...

147
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:51,843
What have you done with your hair?

148
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:53,262
Nothing, just...

149
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,003
wearing it loose.

150
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:56,802
Oh no, sweetheart. That's a mistake.

151
00:08:56,948 --> 00:09:00,032
If you had hair from my side of the family, it would be fine

152
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:03,033
but you have the Jew hair from your father's side.

153
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:09,942
So, wear it back until you're old enough to get it straightened.

154
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,442
Mother?

155
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:13,852
Yes, sweetheart. I'm here.

156
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:14,603
Mom.

157
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:17,212
I'm going to the vending machines.

158
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,972
What vending machines?

159
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:21,912
Neither of you need anything from a vending machine.

160
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:23,332
What are you doing here?

161
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:26,371
You're sick. You're my little girl.

162
00:09:26,895 --> 00:09:28,651
How would it look if I didn't come?

163
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:31,203
My whole church group is praying for you.

164
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:35,273
Even Mr. Daniels. The cripple.

165
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:38,123
Where's Dean? Have you seen Dean?

166
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:39,402
Has he left you?

167
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:41,953
Yes, he went to get me a cheeseburger.

168
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:47,143
A greasy cheeseburger? Now that is what I call passive aggressive behavior.

169
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:50,321
Spouses of cancer victims often act out

170
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,981
because they're not getting all the attention.

171
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:53,733
Mother...

172
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:55,471
Yes, dear.

173
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:04,352
It's thoughtful of you to come.

174
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:13,442
Okay. What percentage of 75 is 12?

175
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:18,393
8%? 12%? 16%? 18% or 20%?

176
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:19,481
I can't do this anymore.

177
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,721
My brain is like totally fried.

178
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:24,890
What?

179
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:29,582
What underwear was I wearing last Thursday?

180
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:30,803
Powerpuff Girls.

181
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,160
You got that right.

182
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:38,800
What?

183
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:39,893
What did he say?

184
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:41,501
How do you know how to do that?

185
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:42,721
Hey, guys.

186
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:44,090
Hi. Mrs. Botwin,

187
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:45,942
Silas and I are through for the hour.

188
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:47,170
How did it go?

189
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,520
He's gonna do great.

190
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:50,593
Thank you, Sanjay.

191
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:51,973
Let me get my wallet.

192
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:53,153
Thanks, Sanjay.

193
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,232
Oh huh...

194
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:56,481
Bye...

195
00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:00,321
Me... gan.

196
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:05,042
What is this?

197
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:06,370
Some kind of conspiracy?

198
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,753
I looked up a few things.

199
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:11,543
Mrs. Botwin,

200
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:13,001
if you know anyone else who needs a tutor

201
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:15,762
or has any work actually, I’d really appreciate it.

202
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:17,921
I'm paying my way through school.

203
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,213
What's a smart guy like you doing at Valley State?

204
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,862
I'm a highly intelligent underachiever with debt.

205
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:27,373
It's all about the Benjamins, Mrs. Botwin.

206
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:34,211
I'm very nervous.

207
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,571
I spit up some vomit and swallowed it.

208
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:37,701
Just breathe.

209
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:40,093
Think about the Benjamins.

210
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:44,742
I'm starting to feel better already.

211
00:11:45,026 --> 00:11:46,020
Here you go.

212
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,223
Whose the fuck mom are you?

213
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,141
Not yours.

214
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:04,323
Because if I were,

215
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:07,040
I would have taught you how to treat a stranger bearing gifts.

216
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,582
- Gifts?
- Gifts.

217
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,532
You want more where that came from,

218
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:32,091
find my man Sanjay.

219
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,202
Hi.

220
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,373
He's got the hook-up.

221
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:39,483
Have a nice day, kids.

222
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,082
Party on.

223
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:43,562
Remember to brush your teeth.

224
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,102
Do your homework.

225
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,152
Nice mom ass.

226
00:12:57,796 --> 00:13:00,420
- Oh God!
- I wanna bite you!

227
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,162
- Yeah?
- Everywhere?

228
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:04,330
Oh God!

229
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:07,803
Oh my God!

230
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:12,473
Okay, okay, okay. Excuse me!

231
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:13,590
Oh no!

232
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:20,943
Delivery for huh... Professor Shane Botwin.

233
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,942
He's grading papers right now.

234
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:26,352
I'll sign for him.

235
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:31,843
Can you guys ship a whole body?

236
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:33,213
We ship anything, kid.

237
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:36,473
Cool!

238
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:42,872
God!!!

239
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:50,173
Hey, Nanc'! You just missed the dynamic duo.

240
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:54,561
I'm so glad Shane and Max are playing together so well.

241
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:55,753
Hmm hmm.

242
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:58,532
Thanks for lending a hand.

243
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,983
Sister, I've lent you a hand, a neck,

244
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,803
some other parts I don't feel comfortable talking about.

245
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:07,110
What's that?

246
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:09,191
Let me put it this way.

247
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:14,590
If Eileen ever dies in a plane crash, I have her dental records.

248
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:20,052
- Andy...
- That woman is a werewolf.

249
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:22,810
My son finally gets a friend and you go

250
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:24,372
and fuck his mother.

251
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,220
Actually, she came onto me.

252
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,693
Let's guess how this is gonna turn out:

253
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:28,960
you're gonna get bored and dump her

254
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,021
and she's never gonna let her kid near this house again.

255
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:33,331
This will not happen. This cannot happen.

256
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,712
You are gonna continue to fuck the biter

257
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:37,993
until Shane and Max apply to separate colleges

258
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,360
or you run out of soft tissue, whichever happens first.

259
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:43,500
- But I...
- You made your bed now fuck in it.

260
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:47,640
I just feel so helpless.

261
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,302
Why do you do this to me?

262
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,381
You've never let anything go.

263
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:53,473
You're still blaming me for whatever it is

264
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:56,302
children make up to blame their parents for!

265
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:58,200
I don't blame you for anything!

266
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:01,040
But  your cancer comes from somewhere!

267
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:04,332
Yes, from an irregular cell on a mission.

268
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,352
In a weird way,

269
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:09,602
this cancer has almost been a blessing.

270
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:15,252
Hello?

271
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:18,203
Hello, pastor Williams.

272
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:20,990
No. No, she's not good.

273
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:23,512
She just called her cancer a blessing.

274
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,051
No, I won't be here that long.

275
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,880
Of course, I'll make the church cruise.

276
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,041
Bless you.

277
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:36,662
Well, I hope my strength helps her too.

278
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:47,050
I need an ounce of Electric Haze, Big Bud,

279
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:50,540
Grape Crush, White Russian, Blue Rhino,...

280
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:52,820
Wow! Slow down!

281
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:55,432
You're ordering enough for a Snoop Dogg pool party.

282
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:56,662
What's going on?

283
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm expanding.

284
00:15:58,006 --> 00:15:59,312
All new territory.

285
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:00,740
You can handle that?

286
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:02,522
I've got it under control.

287
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:06,080
Hey, Sanjay.

288
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,640
Calm down.

289
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:10,381
How many orders on your cell phone?

290
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:11,971
67!

291
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:16,051
No, we handle this, this is a good thing.

292
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:18,683
No, I'm at my dealer's house right now.

293
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,953
Shit!  No, you didn't!

294
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:21,953
Why did you do that for?

295
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:23,982
You compromize my business like that again,

296
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:25,730
I will fuck you up! You hear me?

297
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:28,012
No, don't fuck me up.

298
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:29,933
We're about to make a lot of money.

299
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:33,861
I'm cornering the college market at Valley State. Wee!

300
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:34,961
Lord, have mercy.

301
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:36,470
Sit your ass down.

302
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:37,890
Come on, sit down.

303
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:44,010
Now, if we're gonna stay in business together, you gotta learn some rules.

304
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:46,873
No talking on your cell phone in my house.

305
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,620
That shit will get us popped. You think that's smart?

306
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:51,800
- No.
- Damn right, it's not.

307
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,463
The whole world don't need to know you got the hook up.

308
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,031
Or you're gonna be talking to your kids through a cage. You feel me?

309
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:03,280
I feel you.

310
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:06,053
It's like a pyramid, baby.

311
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:07,962
You want to be at the top.

312
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:09,631
You got people beneath you,

313
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:11,493
and they got people beneath them.

314
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:12,392
Soldiers.

315
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:14,750
Those soldiers do not know you.

316
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:17,590
And they damn well better not know me.

317
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:22,511
And get yourself some disposable cell phones. You hear me?

318
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:23,631
I hear you.

319
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:28,040
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

320
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:29,271
I do.

321
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:34,813
Leave your order, come back later.

322
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:45,682
Every time I leave here, I feel like such an asshole.

323
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,310
Only deal with people you know.

324
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:51,710
Don't take...

325
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:54,860
...unnecessary risks.

326
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,333
Always get paid in cash.

327
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,343
No credit.

328
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:58,641
No "I owe you".

329
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,603
No "I'll pay you Tuesday".

330
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:03,200
They've got the cash, they get the stash.

331
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:05,701
Here are your cell phones.

332
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:07,043
Never dial out.

333
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:08,733
Only receive calls.

334
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:12,572
Mestab,  Anya, Chahid.

335
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,410
In two weeks, you dump them.

336
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:19,151
Everybody remember: be careful out there.

337
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,580
Slap my ass.

338
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:44,411
Slap my ass!

339
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:57,971
Come on!

340
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,101
Slap it!

341
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:15,013
Holy crap!

342
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:17,871
What the f... What is this?

343
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,042
Who would do this?

344
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:22,920
Pennies?

345
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,090
This is cold.

346
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:27,802
Cold? Try evil and fucked up.

347
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:31,071
It's a commuter college, there's a lot of displaced anger here.

348
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:33,920
Displaced on my car!

349
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:40,730
Fucking community college losers!

350
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:42,440
Hey! It's a state school.

351
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:44,151
Shut up!

352
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:59,472
Sweetheart, you don't need that.

353
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:03,752
It hurts me to think you won't be getting asked to your prom...

354
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:06,431
or wearing normal-sized clothes...

355
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:09,610
because your parents aren't watching out for you.

356
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:10,921
Look at this house!

357
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,903
You're growing up like a gipsy!

358
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:14,761
Your mother gives away furniture.

359
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,653
And your father isn't man enough to stop her.

360
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:18,983
Enough!

361
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:20,631
What did I do?

362
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:21,752
Stop picking on her.

363
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,173
Yeah, we're tired of you

364
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:26,162
working out your psychotic bullshit on the family.

365
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:27,040
Me?

366
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,590
Psychotic.

367
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:32,250
You used to open the back of the scale with a butter knife

368
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,910
and pull out the springs before I weighed you.

369
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:38,692
I went through two dozens scales before I figured it out.

370
00:20:38,886 --> 00:20:39,833
You did that?

371
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:41,623
Yeah, I used to drive your grandmother crazy

372
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,293
because she's cheap.

373
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:46,142
You've never appreciated my good nature.

374
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,763
Unlike Mr. Daniels.

375
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:48,571
The cripple.

376
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:49,932
How dare you?

377
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,283
Mr. Daniels adores and cherishes me

378
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:55,893
even with his unusually large head.

379
00:20:56,837 --> 00:20:58,352
I have nothing more to say.

380
00:20:58,437 --> 00:20:59,382
Finally.

381
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:03,822
I'm going for my power walk now.

382
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:07,301
I suppose none of you wants to join me in with this sensible,

383
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,553
healthy activity, huh?

384
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:21,112
Best friends for life!

385
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:23,320
Yeah! Best friends for life!

386
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:38,673
It's okay.

387
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:41,512
It'll be our little secret.

388
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,743
This has never happened to me before.

389
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:49,540
It's not okay.

390
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:52,850
It's probably for the best.

391
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:55,312
I was getting bored.

392
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:59,012
I mean...

393
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:02,373
It was fun and it was great.

394
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:06,043
I mean, gosh, thanks for everything, Andy.

395
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:07,801
It's not okay.

396
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:11,480
Oh and please promise me you won't say anything to Nancy.

397
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,802
I wouldn't want anything that happened between us to affect the boys' friendship.

398
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,853
Shane and Max really click.

399
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:25,350
It's not okay.

400
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:28,200
Who you pissed off?

401
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,132
What?

402
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,310
Nobody. It was just kids.

403
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:33,433
Somebody mad at you girl.

404
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:35,793
What you going on about, Conrad?

405
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,071
Somebody pennied that girl's ride.

406
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:39,132
Hell!

407
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:40,610
Here goes my collateral.

408
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:44,820
No. Nobody. It was just kids at Valley State playing a prank.

409
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,450
No, someone's hating.

410
00:22:46,526 --> 00:22:47,750
You better slow your roll.

411
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:50,652
You pissed off somebody. Probably another dealer.

412
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,503
No, no, everything's going really well.

413
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:55,621
I'm outsourcing to build my pyramid.

414
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:59,212
Took the Egyptians centuries to build theirs.

415
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:02,321
I appreciate your concern.

416
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,932
Everything's going fine.

417
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:09,771
That girl's got too much hubris.

418
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:26,671
This is so not okay.

419
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:31,701
Hey, sweety.

420
00:24:32,855 --> 00:24:33,601
Hi!

421
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,231
Look mom! I've got a 98 on my science test.

422
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:41,581
That's great, sweety. Did you show your uncle Andy?

423
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:42,490
No.

424
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:48,432
Good job!

425
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:51,623
I made two wrong just like you said.

426
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:53,201
Just to make it look real.

427
00:24:53,277 --> 00:24:55,801
Stick with me, kid, you'll be going to Berkeley.

428
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:07,123
I heard about your little problem.

429
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:12,512
Don't worry. I'm sure it was just a one-time thing.

430
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:16,441
Although...

431
00:25:17,045 --> 00:25:19,463
sometimes...

432
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:24,410
these little problems can last a long time.

433
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:30,672
Anyway, thanks for taking one for the team.

434
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:11,473
