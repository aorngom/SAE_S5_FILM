Previously on Weeds...

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,466
... call for evacuation
in lower Majestic.

3
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:07,886
All evacuees are welcome here
to the Summer Canyon recreation center.

4
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:10,764
Where there's fire,
people like to smoke.

5
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,892
Okay, we need to be leaving.
I smell smoke.

6
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:15,393
I'm opening up a club...

7
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:17,270
Heylia's compassionate care.

8
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:21,566
If it all burns down,
what are you gonna do?

9
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:24,110
I guess I'd have to go.

10
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:28,716
- Agrestic... shit! Majestic police!
- You really got to clear out now.

11
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:31,284
The fire's up the block
and it's moving fast.

12
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:33,411
That house belongs to Celia,

13
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,330
and she was my lover,

14
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:38,913
- and it was good.
- So, you buy her a house...

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,698
and I assume you're fucking her
in said house,

16
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:45,131
she of the magical house-earning pussy.

17
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,550
- Celia Hodes?
- Yeah?

18
00:00:49,857 --> 00:00:51,087
Nancy Botwin.

19
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:54,236
I just got a call from Guillermo.
And I need to go meet him.

20
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:57,450
You need to stop
hanging out with bad people.

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,532
- The man set a town on fire!
- I could use you.

22
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:03,316
I'm not selling for you.
I'm nobody's bitch anymore.

23
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:06,111
We take you off the sales floor.
That's for the little people.

24
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:07,445
Navigator.

25
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:09,447
I get stuck in traffic a lot.

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,852
Traffic?

27
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:13,660
Do you have some sort of a plan?

28
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,078
I'm working on it.

www.sub-way.fr

33
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:06,691
Am I under arrest?

34
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:09,209
How long is this gonna take?

35
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,302
Why don't I ask my questions,
and then we can get to yours?

36
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:15,029
Could you turn down
the air-conditioning?

37
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:16,618
I am in a sundress.

38
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:20,174
- Can I have a diet coke?
- Again with the questions.

39
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,562
I'm starting to see
what did it for Groff.

40
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,230
He never had to get on top.

41
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:27,710
- I beg your pardon.
- How tall are you? Like...

42
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:28,735
5'8"?

43
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:31,626
Shouldn't you be asking
questions about...

44
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:33,310
drug things?

45
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:36,075
Was sex like a drug to you?

46
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:39,640
Look, I don't know what he told you,

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,175
but Sullivan Groff
is a lying piece of shit.

48
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:45,502
So, you never had a sexual
relationship with him?

49
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:49,827
A sexual relationship that resulted
in his giving you a house...

50
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:51,940
A house which was later used

51
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,136
for the growing
and cultivation of marijuana?

52
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:57,931
That house was never in my name.

53
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,641
I was just living there.

54
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,111
Then my idiot ex-husband
had an accident,

55
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:06,973
and I saw an opportunity
to make some money

56
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:10,444
by renting it out to someone
I thought was a friend.

57
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:14,425
What she did with it
has nothing to do with me.

58
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,862
You should be questioning

59
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:19,034
Nancy Botwin.

60
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:24,293
Did a bird just crap on my head?

61
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:29,295
What is with all the birds?

62
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:33,049
You should use the bathroom
before we get back in the car.

63
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,968
Can I ride with uncle Andy?

64
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,422
Didn't you like listening
to the radio loud?

65
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:40,640
Best bathroom graffiti ever...
At least in the top 10.

66
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:42,524
"Here I sit,

67
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,004
"cheeks a-flexin'...

68
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:49,315
- "giving birth to a baby Texan."
- I think that's offensive to Texans.

69
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:50,650
Only the baby ones.

70
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:53,296
- Shane wants to ride with you.
- Sorry, buddy.

71
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,299
The plasma's riding shotgun.

72
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:57,859
Please tell me you washed your hands.

73
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,036
Mom's car smells like gas.

74
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,623
- It's giving me a headache.
- The car smells like gas?

75
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,355
I don't think it's the car.

76
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:10,708
No, it's your mother.
She smells like gas.

77
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:13,131
- I don't smell anything.
- You smell like gas.

78
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:15,550
I must have spilled it
when I was pumping.

79
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,623
We haven't stopped at a gas station.

80
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:22,120
Do we actually know where we're going
or are we just driving around randomly?

81
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,643
- We're on the run, aren't we?
- These are solid questions.

82
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,432
- We're going to Ren Mar.
- What... ho, what?

83
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:30,690
Ren Mar? Back up.

84
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,318
No, moving forward.
We're going to see Bubbie.

85
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:35,513
- Bubbie?
- Doesn't Bubbie hate you?

86
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,577
She just hates that I'm not Jewish.

87
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:39,090
It's not personal.

88
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:41,451
No, I think she hates you, too.

89
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:43,786
Well, she loves her great-grandchildren.

90
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:46,499
I've only met her twice,
and once was at Dad's funerals.

91
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,709
She kept calling me
"gooshey purim"... something.

92
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:52,754
"Goyishe punim..."
"You got face like a goy."

93
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,339
Look, she's family.

94
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:57,258
She lives by the beach, that's the plan.
Let's get back on the road.

95
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:00,929
Shane, you sure you don't need
to pee or birth a Texan before we go?

96
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:01,763


97
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,057
Can I go with you?
Mom's car smells like gas.

98
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:06,362
How am I not smelling it? Never mind.

99
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:08,873
I'll drive the van.
The three of you can take the Prius.

100
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,813
Will that make everyone happy?

101
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:15,800
Flying flu bag!

102
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,308
I hate birds.

103
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,992
Dad once told me
Bubbie killed the neighbor's dog.

104
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,827
No one could ever prove that.

105
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:26,325
What's she like?

106
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:30,156
She's great, actually, and a bitch,
but in a great, tough-cookie way.

107
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,950
- Old people creep me out.
- Okay, fine!

108
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:36,130
I spilled gas on myself
when I was pouring it on the furniture.

109
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:39,926
What?

110
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:41,242
Yes.

111
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,222
I set the house on fire.

112
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:47,558
Okay? It's done. It's gone.

113
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm sure the real fire
would have gotten to it, anyway.

114
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,688
I just wanted to make sure.

115
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,700
It's time to move on, so...

116
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,002
Let's move on.

117
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,890
Questions answered.

118
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:04,017
Mystery solved.

119
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,455
And there were growers...

120
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:11,666
Heylia and Conrad.

121
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:15,346
I don't know their last names,
but they were black.

122
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,257
And the gay Indian kid
and the Christian girl.

123
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,635
You seem to know a whole lot
about the operation for just a landlady.

124
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:26,158
I'm telling you, you want Nancy Botwin.

125
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:27,381
Not me.

126
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,268
How do you know what I want?
I'm full of surprises.

127
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:31,392
I...

128
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:35,356
have a parasitic twin
growing out of my stomach.

129
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:37,734
Seriously?

130
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:41,070
You'll have to get me naked
to know for sure.

131
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
Are you trying to flirt with me?

132
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,951
Is that what this is?

133
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,787
- That's pathetic.
- That is?

134
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:54,000
You're the "drugs are wrong" lady,
and you were running a grow house.

135
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,754
I got a picture here
of you with Sasquatch.

136
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,467
You like costume play?

137
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,723
- I want to go home.
- Which home?

138
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:08,104
The one with the pot plants or the one
with the injured idiot ex-husband?

139
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:10,280
Whichever one hasn't burned down.

140
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,186
Very good point.
You could be homeless for all we know.

141
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,773
Thank Goodness,
you have a place to sleep for the night.

142
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:19,901
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm gonna keep you for a while,

143
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,863
check out your story.

144
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,447
I'll have someone bring you
a diet pop and a sweater.

145
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,449
- Diet coke.
- No, princess.

146
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,034
Diet Shasta...

147
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:29,710
In a can...

148
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,149
Room temperature... No straw.

149
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:34,123
Say thank you.

150
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:38,127
- Fuck you. I haven't done anything.
- We'll see.

151
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:41,205
I want a lawyer!

152
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,640
Are you looking?
I'm about to do the spinny-spin.

153
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,790
Yeah, I'm looking. One second.

154
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,633
Wait, that wasn't it. Hold on.
It's gonna be really good.

155
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:58,324
What the hell happened to you?
I've been, like, sitting here.

156
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,532
I've been calling.

157
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:03,402
Sorry about that, my phone battery
conked out around Oceanside.

158
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:05,196
Mine was on mute.

159
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:07,924
My phone was fine,
but I've been ignoring your calls

160
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:11,278
because I'm mad at you for burning
our house down without thinking

161
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:14,600
that maybe some of us would have liked
to go get a few more things out.

162
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,126
Stuff, Shane... All replaceable.

163
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,609
We've got the computer.

164
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,047
- We've got the photo album.
- You got the photo album?

165
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:24,882
Of course I did. Think I forgot?

166
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,219
Well, did you get that box
of loose pictures from the garage?

167
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:31,013
I did. It's in the back of the van.

168
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,798
Well, then...

169
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:34,433
good.

170
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:36,853
I'll answer your call next time.

171
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:40,920
- This house looks cool.
- Well... good.

172
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,950
There's this amazing
German deli in Carlsbad.

173
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,971
I brought you
zwiebelbraten with spätzle.

174
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,697
You might want to heat it up.

175
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:50,158
- You're an asshole.
- Fine. I'll eat it.

176
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:52,096
So, no one's home?

177
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,662
I wouldn't say that.
Some giant killer dog is home.

178
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,238
I rang the bell,
and it barked like it was gonna

179
00:08:57,358 --> 00:08:59,389
lunge through the window
and bite my head off.

180
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,752
- Bubbie hates dogs.
- I think she's gotten over it.

181
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,629
Where are we gonna sleep tonight?

182
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:06,749
Maybe she's taking a walk.
Bubbie was always a big walker.

183
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,002
Why would you go walking
without your dog?

184
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,263
- I'm telling you, she hates dogs.
- She doesn't really have a dog.

185
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:15,391
That's Rad.

186
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:16,934
That's his name.

187
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:21,522
He's 10, and he's read
the whole "Narnia" series,

188
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:26,027
Now he's moved on to His dark materials,
and he likes it so far.

189
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:28,988
His parents are divorced,
and he wants to be an inventor

190
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,920
and a robot builder when he grows up.
His favorite color is green,

191
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,860
and his favorite animal
is the Komodo dragon,

192
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,286
which can eat up to 80%
of its own weight in a single sitting,

193
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:38,976
and he thinks dodgeball is gay.
That's how long I've been sitting here,

194
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:40,488
waiting for you guys.

195
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:42,668
And Bubbie definitely has a dog.

196
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,170
No, it's the doorbell.

197
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,340
- Her doorbell barks?
- Yeah.

198
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:48,716
Check it out.

199
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:07,151
- See? I do it all the time.
- I bet she loves that.

200
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,820
- You couldn't tell me this earlier?
- You didn't ask.

201
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,571
She's probably in there.
She never comes out.

202
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,066
My mom won't let me trick-or-treat
here on Halloween.

203
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:16,369
I know how to get in.

204
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:19,413
Used to do it all the time
when we were kids.

205
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,332
- How?
- None of your business.

206
00:10:21,492 --> 00:10:24,312
If Shane's too heavy to heave up
to the pergola, you might find out.

207
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:25,746
Shane, let's do it.

208
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,553
The ocean's like a block away.

209
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,778
It's nice, isn't it?

210
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:35,481
I think it could be good.

211
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,641
Whenever I swim in the ocean,
I get a really sick rash.

212
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:42,395
- Good to know.
- I'll buy you a wet suit.

213
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,730
All right, he's in.

214
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,272
We can't stay here.

215
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:58,411
Attention, evacuees...

216
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:05,084
Check it out. It's snowing in SoCal.

217
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:08,629
Except they're warm snowflakes.

218
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,525
Taste like...

219
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:16,899
loss...

220
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:19,098
And muffins.

221
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,674
- Mine tastes like a vinyl sofa.
- When FEMA gives us hotel vouchers,

222
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:26,522
do you want to combine them
and get like a ginormous suite?

223
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,067
- A sweet suite? A dude suite?
- A dude suite with Isabel.

224
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:33,066
Okay, she's almost a dude.

225
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:35,865
I'm not ready to make
that judgment until she's past puberty.

226
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,643
Either way, she's cool.
She could hang with us.

227
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:42,955
- Do you still poop yourself?
- You don't have to worry about it.

228
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:44,415
So you do poop yourself?

229
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:46,876
I can get myself onto a toilet
and evacuate my own bowels.

230
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:50,129
You used to poop yourself,
but now you don't. Okay, then.

231
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:54,708
Here.

232
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:58,429
Doug Wilson?
I'm Agent Shlatter with the D.E.A.

233
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,266
He's a cripple with a doctor's note.
I'm just keeping him company.

234
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,603
Maybe she's just taking a nap.

235
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,810
Hey, Bubbie.

236
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,270
It's me, Andy. You sleeping?

237
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,648
If you're sleeping,
I'm gonna go through your purse.

238
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:16,822
I'm gonna look at your driver's license,
find out your real age.

239
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,369
I'm also gonna take all your $5 bills.

240
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:28,000
She's not sleeping.
She's somewhere far, far away.

241
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,212
- This is totally creepy.
- Jesus, time is cruel.

242
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,160
- I should start taking fish oil.
- And green tea.

243
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,190
Yeah, 'cause that'll totally reverse
the effects of 90-plus years of life.

244
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,823
Get real. It's all downhill from 30 on.

245
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:42,360
- Shut up.
- Be quiet.

246
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,948
- What did they say?
- That the nurse was fired a month ago.

247
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,148
Said a family member called
and said he was taking over her care.

248
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Oh, shit... family member?
No, no, no. Forget this, I'm leaving.

249
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:58,333
No, wait. We don't know for sure.
Don't you have cousins?

250
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:00,199
Isn't he on a riverboat somewhere?

251
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:02,785
He probably sunk it.
It's him. I know it's him.

252
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,224
Look. Look around.
Paintings missing from the wall.

253
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:09,375
All right, here we go.
Tchotchkes missing.

254
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:12,683
Bubbie's watching the world poker tour?

255
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:14,592
Look.

256
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:17,698
- He's here.
- Who's here?

257
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:20,640
Who the fuck is here?

258
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,265
I've got a vicious dog.
He'll bite your thieving balls off.

259
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:25,891
You better start running.

260
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:27,964
Christ.

261
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,940
Hey, Dad, you can call off the doorbell.

262
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,065
It's your family.

263
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:50,291
Hello, Len.

264
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,802
Why do I smell gasoline?

265
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,040
- How stoned are you two?
- I'm...

266
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:04,972
We're baked out of our skulls.
But you shouldn't do drugs.

267
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,149
You've convinced me.

268
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:10,296
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

269
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,210
Shit. What do you think she told them?

270
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,690
- Everything.
- God.

271
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:16,975
I'm gonna go to jail,
and I'm gonna get raped,

272
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:19,803
- and it's gonna make me hate being gay.
- Hey, careful.

273
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:22,246
They could be "istening-lay."

274
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:25,326
- They could be what?
- "Othing-nay."

275
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:28,029
No one's going to jail.
You need to get your stories straight.

276
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,947
They'll want to know
who's running things.

277
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,614
- We could turn in Conrad and Heylia.
- They're long gone.

278
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:35,018
Of course they are.
The black guys never get arrested.

279
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:38,534
But here we sit, two milks
and a cappuccino, rousted by the man.

280
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:39,791
Mr. Wilson?

281
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:48,682
You know the name. Use it.

282
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:51,018
Celia... Celia Hodes.

283
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,603
H-O-D-E-S.

284
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:54,271
She ran the whole thing.

285
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:56,440
She won't know I said anything, right?

286
00:14:56,857 --> 00:14:59,026
'Cause she is super fierce.

287
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,195
Celia scares me.

288
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:04,657
- She's the boss.
- Nancy?

289
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:07,660
Never. She's got two children.

290
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:11,262
And wasn't she married to one
of your guys? How crazy would that be...

291
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:13,360
The drug dealer and the D.E.A. agent?

292
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:16,835
Nah. Makes no sense.

293
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:17,962
Nancy?

294
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:20,508
She and Celia were in PTA together,

295
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,413
and they were friends for a while,
but I think they kind of drifted.

296
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:26,220
Probably because my ex
was becoming a drug dealer.

297
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:27,638
Nancy who?

298
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:31,767
I do know one Nancy,
but her name used to be Vince.

299
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:35,771
Is that the same person
you're talking about?

300
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:37,945
Vince?

301
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:39,614


302
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,489
How could you just leave her like this?

303
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,075
- I had errands.
- You were at the track.

304
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:49,551
And the Rite Aid.

305
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,204
She was fine.

306
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:54,427
I changed all her bags, cleaned her up,
and turned on the television.

307
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:56,500
It's not like she has anywhere to go.

308
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,461
And I was back before dinner.
And, excuse me,

309
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,742
who the hell are you,
bursting in here like this

310
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,175
and telling me
how to take care of Grandma?

311
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,469
With not-Francie, no less.

312
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,466
- Who?
- It's your mother. Never mind.

313
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:12,750
- Her name is Nancy.
- He knows that.

314
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,144
- He just won't say it.
- Who's Francie?

315
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:17,354
The woman your father
should have married.

316
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:20,332
Francie's wonderful.
She's an eye doctor.

317
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,944
Beautiful, tiny hands
that bring sight to the blind.

318
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:27,300
She married a cantor, has four children,

319
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,743
and is still the number-one
Lasik surgeon

320
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,535
in the whole north county area.

321
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,419
Gave me a discount.
Now I can see perfect.

322
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:35,819
She's wonderful.

323
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,866
- What is that?
- Zwiebelbraten with...

324
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,047
spätzle.

325
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:45,924
- What?
- I don't know. It's German.

326
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,803
You're sitting in my mother's
living room eating German food

327
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:51,437
and smelling like gas.

328
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,726
She was at Auschwitz, for Christ's sake.
What kind of a monster are you?

329
00:16:56,374 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm a terrible shiksa monster
here to terrorize your clan.

330
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:03,654
What do you want from me, Len?

331
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:07,420
It's been 20 years.
Can you... get over it already?

332
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:09,573
Judah stopped talking to us.

333
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,618
Because you'd only call me not-Francie,

334
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,995
because you refused
to come to our wedding,

335
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,077
because the one time
we came down here after Silas was born,

336
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:21,919
you told us the baby had eczema because
Judah had watered down the gene pool.

337
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:24,014
Look who's keeping lists.

338
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,758
- Your skin looks much improved.
- Gee, thanks.

339
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,502
Len, your mother is dying.

340
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,972
You're not looking so hot yourself.
Isn't it time to make peace?

341
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:36,308
What do you mean
I'm not looking so hot myself?

342
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:38,004
I've got my hair,

343
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:41,146
and muscle tone,
and I have excellent posture.

344
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,066
Fine, Len, you're a god among men.

345
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:46,001
How could I have been so blind?

346
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:49,238
Must be a little distracted
'cause my house burned down.

347
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,367
What, did you leave a scarf over a lamp?

348
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:57,335
I know people do that sometimes
to help with the mood lighting.

349
00:17:57,604 --> 00:18:00,541
But, you know, before you know it,
everything's in flames.

350
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:03,711
- Do you not watch the news?
- I watch Sportscenter.

351
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:05,925
Okay.

352
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,175
See that?

353
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:08,775
Great big fire?

354
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:11,802
Our house, somewhere
in the middle of it. It's gone now.

355
00:18:11,962 --> 00:18:14,054
All he cares about is his sports book.

356
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:16,223
Like I'm gonna make money on a fire.

357
00:18:16,882 --> 00:18:19,393
Let's just go! We can stay at a motel.

358
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:22,297
No, Andy. We can't stay at a motel.

359
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:24,617
We've been driving all day.

360
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:27,651
- Apparently, I smell like gas.
- Apparently?

361
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:31,388
The kids are tired.
I'd rather not use a credit card

362
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:33,087
and leave a paper trail.

363
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,201
- What, are you on the run?
- Yes.

364
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:40,164
That, at least,
I can wrap my head around.

365
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:41,785
All right.

366
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:44,961
Here's what we'll do.

367
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:47,921
You and your brother Klaus
can stay in Judah's old room.

368
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:49,757
It was my room, too.

369
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,968
You can sleep in Judah
and not-Judah's old room.

370
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,928
There are sheets in the hall closet.

371
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:58,109
Not-Francie can sleep in Bubbie's room.

372
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,028
- Thank you.
- All right.

373
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:03,161
We'll see.

374
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,857
- So, what did he do?
- Why do you assume it's me?

375
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:08,817
Because it's always you.

376
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:11,021
Shower time.

377
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:18,293
Why are you always such a prick to me?

378
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:22,498
I'm just not sure you're mine,
so I keep an emotional distance.

379
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,107
If only that were true and I wasn't
looking at the ghost of Hanukkah future,

380
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:28,253
fighting the urge
to throw myself off a cliff.

381
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:30,205
Such drama.

382
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:34,510
I get laid all the time,
and I shit like a Swiss train.

383
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:36,386
You should be so lucky.

384
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,765
You can sleep on the couch.
You want to play poker tomorrow?

385
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:41,631
- No.
- Okay.

386
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:47,126
Rinse off the Nazi plate, will you?
And turn the TV back to my channel.

387
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:50,158
I'm gonna change Ma's diaper
and clean her feeding tubes

388
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,862
and give her a new nightgown.
You should go away, it's not pretty.

389
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,031
- I can take it.
- Great.

390
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,342
- I'll be in the kitchen.
- Good.

391
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,746
I'm hungry. Make me a sandwich.

392
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:04,957
Tomorrow we're gonna have
to have a discussion

393
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:08,466
about how long this heartwarming
family reunion's gonna last.

394
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:13,011
I like Shane,
despite his stupid cowboy name.

395
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,894
He looks like my side of the family.

396
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:18,149
The rest of you...

397
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:19,680
I don't know.

398
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:21,517
We shall see.

399
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:24,768
All right, get ready, Mom.
Rolling you left.

400
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:28,898
Ma.

401
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,513
They're lying! They're all lying!

402
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:35,779
Please help me.

403
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,812
I think you're very handsome.

404
00:20:53,222 --> 00:20:54,089
Come in.

405
00:20:58,397 --> 00:21:00,184
- The boys asleep?
- Yeah.

406
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:02,827
It's totally freaking me out.

407
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:05,583
Shane's sleeping
on my old Star Wars sheets.

408
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:09,371
Silas found one of Judah's Playboys
from 1979 under the mattress...

409
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:12,727
Candy Loving on the cover,
Dorothy Stratten centerfold.

410
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,977
It's beautiful.

411
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:17,157
I'm having jerk-off flashbacks.

412
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,314
My old stains...

413
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,366
are still on the wall.

414
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,822
My children are sleeping
next to their unborn cousins.

415
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:26,240
I'm thrilled.

416
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,377
This is where Judah and I

417
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,960
grew from boys to men.

418
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:35,257
- How often did you guys come here?
- Three, four times a night.

419
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,024
- You're an animal.
- Every year, every year.

420
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:41,208
Dad had custody in the summer,
so he'd park us with Bubbie

421
00:21:41,328 --> 00:21:42,811
and go to the track.

422
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:45,349
It was great, you know? We loved it.

423
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,851
Judah would bring it up
every once in a while, but then...

424
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,689
he'd remind himself that he was
angry at everyone, and he'd...

425
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:55,203
shut down.

426
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:58,706
Yeah, that was the past.
You were his future.

427
00:21:58,826 --> 00:22:01,490
I think he was happy with his choice.

428
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,469
Well, thank you.

429
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:06,890
He once showed me
naked pictures of you, you know?

430
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,581
- Bullshit.
- You hadn't been dating that long.

431
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:11,500
He wasn't taking you seriously yet.

432
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,118
You had this silver sequined bowler hat.

433
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:19,075
That asshole.

434
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:23,637
I can't believe...

435
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:25,646
He swore he'd destroy...

436
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:26,899
I can't...

437
00:22:27,232 --> 00:22:28,748
Fucking asshole.

438
00:22:28,868 --> 00:22:29,853
Sometimes.

439
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:33,247
Just 'cause he's dead
doesn't mean he was a saint.

440
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,102
It's weird seeing
all these old pictures around.

441
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:41,167
- Wait. What pictures? They're here?
- No. I mean, maybe. I don't know.

442
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:44,155
I'm gonna look for them tomorrow.
No, I was just...

443
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:48,078
talking about all the pictures
around the house.

444
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:51,036
Yeah. It is a little overkill, isn't it?

445
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:52,717
Judah, Judah, Judah, Judah.

446
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:56,202
And, of course, the fabulous Francie.

447
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:58,765
God.

448
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,155
Look how young and smiling and gorgeous.

449
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:08,095
You really think I made him happy?

450
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:12,769
This was before he chipped his tooth

451
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:15,156
and he got that fake one.

452
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:19,907
- Nancy, what are we doing here?
- We're starting a new life.

453
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,222
Fresh.

454
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:22,880
The beach.

455
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:26,291
Houses built before 1997.

456
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:28,618
Clean air.

457
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:31,038
I bet the schools are good.

458
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:34,476
I hadn't counted on the dying woman
in the living room, but...

459
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:37,312
You have a plan, don't you?
It's not about the clean air.

460
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:38,754
It's all part of a plan.

461
00:23:39,938 --> 00:23:41,919
I might have a plan.

462
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,040
Or the start of one.

463
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,428
A plan in the planning stages,
if you will.

464
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:50,425
- Should I be nervous about all this?
- Of course you should.

465
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:52,476
It's the drug business. It's dangerous.

466
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:57,152
But we're just gonna try and put
all that out of our minds for now.

467
00:23:57,272 --> 00:23:58,523
Think happy thoughts.

468
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:02,861
Wait. What is it?
You're not thinking happy thoughts.

469
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:06,990
I saw my grandmother's vagina.

470
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:13,909
You know they actually used

471
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:16,956
old landing strips from Vietnam
to build that fence.

472
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:19,669
From one fucking mistake to another.

473
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:21,963
You ever been?

474
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:25,733
Let me guess. Spring break, right?

475
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:29,659
Went down with some college friends
to drink some tequila,

476
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:32,432
get into something crazy
like a donkey show.

477
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:33,915


478
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:36,941
No Tijuana.
I always stayed at a resort in Cabo.

479
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,894
I got a sunburn, bought a tin mirror.

480
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,779
Again with the fucking birds.

481
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,613
I swear they're following me.

482
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:49,391
They just squawking
to let their Mexican buddies know

483
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:51,236
there's more scraps on this side.

484
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:52,963
Cleaner water.

485
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:56,248
Fly on over.
There's no water in the sky.

486
00:24:56,691 --> 00:24:58,742
Maybe you should strap
the drugs to the birds.

487
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:02,462
We tried it with pigeons.
They can't really carry too much weight.

488
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:06,428
What's with the numbers on the wall?

489
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:10,187
Over here is for border patrol,
so they can radio in

490
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:14,106
when one of the poor,
huddled masses yearns to be free.

491
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,518
Over there, it marks territory.

492
00:25:17,294 --> 00:25:19,543
Who controls what part of the wall.

493
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,982
Mexicate cartel. They got...

494
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:24,276
1 through 323.

495
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:28,655
MZO got 667 through 1,500.

496
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:31,575
And us, we got what's in front of you.

497
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,076
324 to 666.

498
00:25:35,342 --> 00:25:36,280
Tres seis.

499
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,781
You thought we worship the devil?
Shame on you.

500
00:25:39,901 --> 00:25:43,032
Listen, I'm still unclear.
What's my job here?

501
00:25:43,152 --> 00:25:46,044
Your job is to be
a pretty American lady.

502
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,342
Think you can handle it?

503
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,248
And there's big money in it
if you do it real good.

504
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:52,836
Big, big money?

505
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:56,808
Man, I'm two years
from retirement myself.

506
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,436
I won't bring heroin.

507
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:02,941
You got some arbitrary rules
you live by.

508
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,026
- But you're standing here, aren't you?
- I won't bring heroin.

509
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,050
All right, then you bring in
lots and lots of mota.

510
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:12,991
You're still gonna make
lots and lots of cash.

511
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:16,161
And retire, right?

512
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:20,899
What are you gonna do
with all your cash and free time?

513
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:24,900


514
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:26,927


515
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:30,342


516
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,266


517
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:33,877


518
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,174
We'll be in touch.

519
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:40,955
Welcome to the border.

520
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:48,848
Hasta luego.
