3
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:37,286
He's not here.

4
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:40,232
What do you want?

5
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:47,463
Coffee.

6
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:53,032
- Where's Esteban?
- He's busy.

7
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:55,805
- I'm here to keep you company.
- I don't need company.

8
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:57,348
He thinks you do.

9
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,780
Really?

10
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:10,243
I never really imagined
I'd be saying this in real life,

11
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:12,029
but call off your goon.

12
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,949
Call me. I need to talk to you.
We need to talk.

13
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,743
I have to know what's going on.

14
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:21,539
He hasn't made up his mind yet.

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,002
You look a little green.

16
00:01:29,594 --> 00:01:31,548
Ginger settles the stomach.

17
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,657
Ginger. I'll try that.

18
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:45,956
Like a cartoon.

19
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,107
That's not respectful.

20
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,043
- You're religious?
- Selectively.

21
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,821
The whole "thou shalt not kill" thing
probably not working out for you, huh?

22
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,740
And I support gay marriage.

23
00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:59,719
Your visit has been a sheer delight.

24
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:03,860
But I have errands... mani-pedi,
got to pick up some stretch-mark cream.

25
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:05,511
I'm gonna get dressed.

26
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:08,265
You're gonna keep me company.

27
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,266
I will keep you company.

28
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,230
Typical Nancy.

29
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:29,934
Typical Nancy.

30
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:34,277
As if I have no life and I couldn't
possibly be doing anything important.

31
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:36,487
- Ham or pepperoni?
- Ham.

32
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,382
As if I'm running a hotel here.

33
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:41,843
Girls, will you sit down
at the counter?

34
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:44,078
It's as if we're awake
all night like vampires.

35
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,051
- Catfish.
- What?

36
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:48,792
- Catfish are nocturnal.
- So are hedgehogs.

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,396
As if we're catfish or hedgehogs.

38
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:55,048
Careful.

39
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,970
Yum-yum.

40
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:02,264
Should we get up?

41
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,683
In a minute. Are they looking?

42
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,358
Why? Are you naked?

43
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:09,328
Just a little...

44
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:10,731
alert.

45
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,938
What? It happens.

46
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:15,954
Comfy couch...

47
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:17,988
happy dreams.

48
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:20,806
- They're awake.
- Oh, hi.

49
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:21,993
Morning.

50
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,830
How did you sleep?

51
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,454
Were you warm enough?

52
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,537
Andy was.

53
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,142
Okay. Here we go, girls.

54
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:33,003
Hey, Andy and...

55
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,381
- my nephew.
- Shane.

56
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,006
Yeah, Shane, right.

57
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:40,477
- Good to see you, Scott.
- Fantastic. Nancy here?

58
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:41,844
No, she couldn't make it.

59
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,366
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, in a sec.

60
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,905
Great. That's great.

61
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,854
Time, twins.
Lock and load. Let's go.

62
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,492
- I want all of this eaten.
- Listen, great seeing you guys.

63
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:54,391
Get yourselves some sun.
You're in California, for pete's sake.

64
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:57,611
They live in California, Scott.
We've been to their house.

65
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,162
We've moved,
but we're still in California.

66
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:02,783
I'll fill you in later.

67
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:05,809
All right, girls.
Let's go. Come on.

68
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:10,881
I didn't know,
'cause Nancy doesn't talk to me.

69
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,243
Would you like a hot pocket?

70
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,383
Can you go for a walk or something?

71
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,879
At least get out of the way.
Sit down.

72
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,540
No, no, just sitting.

73
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:45,534
Yeah, it's time.

74
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:47,536
- He needs the fish.
- The fish.

75
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:49,758
You need the fish.

76
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,541
Inside. Put inside, put inside.

77
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:54,709
Fishy eat dead skin.

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
$45.

79
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,052
What? Bikini wax.

80
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,936
You interested? It's my treat.

81
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,149
It hurts like hell,
but Esteban really likes it.

82
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:12,426
I know how you like
to please the boss.

83
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:15,611
Back in a few.

84
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:17,399
Hey, relax. Sit down.

85
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:25,282
You like the fishy?

86
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,666
- Not yet finish!
- $45!

87
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:46,087
So, Lisa Palmisano,
the little bitch with the shiny shoes

88
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,056
who was Christine's friend
who sat behind me in math...

89
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:50,858
She sees the cake and she says,

90
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,138
"that's what we should call you...
chunkball fairycake."

91
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,551
- Now, that's her prerogative...
- Wait.

92
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:58,077
Wait.

93
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,964
Is this it? Are we home?

94
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:03,992
Well, there's a creek right there,
irrigation.

95
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:07,276
And we've been walking for...
What grade are you up to?

96
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,401
Sixth.

97
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:12,332
We're far enough in.

98
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:13,457
This...

99
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,508
- This could be good.
- Oh, thanks God.

100
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:20,687
Look at that.

101
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,172
Hello, butterfly.

102
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:25,341
Silas, come check this out.
You're gonna miss it.

103
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Come here.

104
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,363
Alight upon me.
Alight upon me.

105
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,556
Fucker.

106
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,882
What are you doing?

107
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:39,689
You draining the main vein?

108
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,782
Get out of here.

109
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:05,048
<i>Lacey Laplante.</i>

110
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,009
<i>The name threw me off.</i>

111
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,327
<i>They check I.D. when you come in.</i>

112
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,263
<i>They make you fill out forms.</i>

113
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,237
<i>You always did know
how to keep your ass covered.</i>

114
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,435
<i>You bring me Krispy Kremes?</i>

115
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:22,482
<i>I'll send you a care package,
just like you sent me.</i>

116
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,984
Why no camera in Jesus

117
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:27,362
<i> this time?
I could've put on another show for you.</i>

118
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,822
<i>Why don't you just tell me a story?</i>

119
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:31,616
<i>A story about what?</i>

120
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,504
<i>A </i>gringa <i>princess who</i>

121
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,624
<i>calls her DEA buddy</i>

122
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,998
<i>and gets a magical tunnel shut down.</i>

123
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,866
<i>I don't know that story.</i>

124
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:45,505
<i>I know the one about the old woman
lived in a giant shoe.</i>

125
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,467
<i>Don't play cute, Blanca,</i>

126
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:49,926
<i>you steeped over the line this time.</i>

127
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:52,220
You wanna act like a big boy,

128
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,347
<i>you gonna get treated
like a big boy.</i>

129
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,475
<i>Yeah, I don't think I ever acted nor
desired to be treated like a big boy.</i>

130
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,894
<i>That's right.
You're all cunt, ain't ya?</i>

131
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,812
<i>Yeah, and titties.</i>

132
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,566
Speaking of which,

133
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:08,315
<i>is it true that in prison</i>

134
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,319
<i>sometimes the bottom guys
get tattoos of titties on their backs</i>

135
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:15,514
<i>so that the big daddies can imagine
they're looking at a woman</i>

136
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,078
<i>when they're raping them?</i>

137
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:20,915
<i>Do you know about that?</i>

138
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:23,313
<i>I know you're the rat.</i>

139
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:26,553
<i>And rats die.</i>

140
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:30,515
<i>You might not want
to cause me stress.</i>

141
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:32,718
<i>I'm in a very delicate state.</i>

142
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,929
<i>Can you see I'm glowing?</i>

143
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:43,646
<i>You got me.</i>

144
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,477
Here I was thinking you're smart.

145
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,485
<i>But you're a fool.</i>

146
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,823
Ain't no ring on that finger.
You're not the wife.

147
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:57,451
<i>You're the knocked-up
</i>puta <i>whore rat.</i>

148
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:00,491
She end up in a landfill.

149
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,417
Lady parts all chopped out,

150
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,003
<i>face all unrecognizable.</i>

151
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:15,052
<i>You were an interesting person
to know, Nancy Botwin.</i>

152
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,055
Get your affairs in order, <i>Blanca</i>.

153
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,558
<i>I'm not the one
you got to worry about.</i>

154
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,310
Fuck off.

155
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:40,077
- I fucking hate this place!
- This is about her, isn't it?

156
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,129
Oh, buck up, sourpuss.

157
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:45,541
You are so much better off
without Quinn.

158
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,376
You're a rebel leader.

159
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,295
Do you know
how many women are into that?

160
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:55,676
Why do you want to be with somebody
who treats you like shit?

161
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:57,094
Because I love her, okay?

162
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:00,783
Or...

163
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:04,477
are you just telling yourself
that you do?

164
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,897
'Cause that's what I used to do.

165
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,110
I mean, I gave birth to her,

166
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,067
I am supposed to love her.

167
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:14,320
But she always has
this expression like

168
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:17,782
she's smelling bad cheese.

169
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,787
- What is that?
- I don't know.

170
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:26,040
There are so many

171
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,919
non-cheese-sniffing girls
out there for you.

172
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,547
Why are you still here?
You remind me of her.

173
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,216
I am nothing like her.

174
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:38,385
How could you even compare me
to that little bitch?

175
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,891
I'm sorry. You know,
you just make women want to hit you.

176
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:46,185
Go.

177
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,104
You leave. You're worth nothing.

178
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:52,214
- Really? I can go?
- The sooner the better.

179
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:56,487
There is some stuff going on.

180
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:00,282
I can't get involved in her stuff.

181
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,312
I mean, if she's spent all her money
on shoes and dresses...

182
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:04,792
Get the other end, please.

183
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,464
If she totaled the car
and didn't have insurance

184
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:10,459
or had an affair with a married guy
and needs to recover at a spa...

185
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:13,253
She witnessed a Korean gang war
in a parking lot...

186
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:16,423
of a golf superstore.

187
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:19,998
It was mafia.
Choi brothers against the Sun Hoo clan.

188
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:22,680
Started with nunchucks,
escalated to glocks.

189
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:26,850
It's a very old rivalry,
still bitterly cantankerous.

190
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:29,395
Began over a girl: Mitzi Sun Hoo.

191
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,438
Name means "fragile flower."

192
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:34,358
She was engaged to a Choi
and then fell for a Sun Hoo.

193
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,985
The point is, there was a shootout,
Nancy saw it.

194
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:39,154
So she's got to lay low
until the trial,

195
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:43,284
if she decides to testify. You know,
she wants to, of course, but...

196
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:47,863
The price is high. So if you could
keep Shane, that would really help.

197
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,593
Keep him safe,
away from the Sun Hoos...

198
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,087
and the Chois.

199
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,206
Sure.

200
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:08,600
No problem.

201
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:11,644
- I'm gonna open a bottle of wine.
- Thanks.

202
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,177
I could be in Mexico right now,

203
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:18,846
surveying my crops

204
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:21,101
and drinking legally.

205
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:23,066
Not my fault.

206
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:25,669
Entirely your fault.

207
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,890
Look at this. Visitors.

208
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:32,624
What brings you boys
this far into the forest?

209
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,038
Naturalists.

210
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:36,378
- Just hiking.
- Come on.

211
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,714
You can do better than that.
What, bird watchers?

212
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,716
- Butterflies.
- Butterflies?

213
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:43,051
- Northern butterflies.
- Even better.

214
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,265
You guys got a little net in there?

215
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:47,806
Let's see.

216
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,770
I think I found

217
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,023
a beautiful butterfly right here.

218
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:58,609
Look, we're just looking
for a place to grow.

219
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,151
We didn't have any idea...

220
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,862
This is unusual.

221
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,370
Indica/sativa blends,
afghani origin, original strain... mine.

222
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:10,329
Went through six or seven variations
before I came up with that one.

223
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:11,702
You know,

224
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,745
usually in this situation...

225
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,168
What's your name?

226
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,844
I could shoot you right now
and dump you in the creek.

227
00:13:26,878 --> 00:13:29,091
- You and your dad.
- My dad's dead.

228
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:31,016
We're friends, family friends.

229
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:32,476
It's a whole story.

230
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:33,898
Not sexual.

231
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,437
My dad's dead, too.

232
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:40,817
Linstead, untie our compatriots.

233
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:44,863
Thank me.

234
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:47,209
Thank you.

235
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,328
All right, well,
these are mine now, Silas.

236
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:54,664
I'll treat them well, don't worry.
Your work is not in vain, okay?

237
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:58,651
Now both of you get the fuck out of here
before I have to shoot you in the head.

238
00:13:58,776 --> 00:13:59,711
Be free.

239
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:02,202
You're taking all of them?

240
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:06,571
Okay. Got it.

241
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:13,016
Who the fuck knows
what would make him happy?

242
00:14:13,642 --> 00:14:17,628
All I know is, no matter,
you know, how much I sacrifice or...

243
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,899
how hard I work...
Can you open that?

244
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:22,895
He never even sees it.

245
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,587
It's as if it all happens magically.

246
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:29,187
Little elves help the girls
with their homework

247
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:32,518
and drive them
to irish step-dancing class

248
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:34,287
and fill the fridge

249
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:35,830
and make the beds.

250
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:39,164
- When I think of what I gave up...
- With no "thank you," I'm sure, right?

251
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,465
No "I really, really
appreciate you, Andy."

252
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,829
No, "I'm so glad
that you're here for the kids, Jill."

253
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:46,921
No, of course not!

254
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:48,712
You know why?

255
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,762
They're takers.
Both of them, really.

256
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,650
They take, and they bike.
I had a life, okay?

257
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:54,765
I had a job.

258
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:55,892
I had friends.

259
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,811
But they're all gone, right?

260
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,938
And for what?
Really, why?

261
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:03,278
So we can be magical elves?
Am I talking too much?

262
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:05,485
They don't care
that we're the elves that we are.

263
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,642
- 'Cause they're so cute.
- We're cute, too.

264
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:10,152
And don't take this the wrong way,
because I do love her.

265
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,283
She's my sister.
But she's miserable.

266
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:15,286
Am I talking too much?
She's a miserable cunt, you know.

267
00:15:15,454 --> 00:15:18,790
And the thing is, she plays the victim,
but she has time to put mascara on.

268
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,482
I'm the real victim.

269
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,331
And you're... you're a victim, too,
because she doesn't appreciate you.

270
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,800
And your cute... ness.

271
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:31,579
You have...

272
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:33,342
an eyelash.

273
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,078
No, you know what?
It's just your skin.

274
00:15:39,145 --> 00:15:43,149
No, you deserve to be appreciated,
and me too, you know, because...

275
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:48,150
it's just been a long time
since I was appreciated.

276
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,371
I can appreciate that.

277
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:04,961
- Is there any food around here?
- The mall.

278
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:08,590
You can't miss it. Just go to the end
of the driveway, and you make a right.

279
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:11,905
Off you go.

280
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:20,510
Hi, I don't...

281
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:26,885
So, in there,
you'll find my life-insurance policy,

282
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,611
a list of most of the places
I've hidden money.

283
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:34,410
- Are you even listening to me?
- Insurance, hidden cash. I heard you.

284
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,825
What do you think?

285
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,287
I've been stashing these babies
in E.R. waiting rooms.

286
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:40,650
I expect big things.

287
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:42,790
Gave yourself
quite a healthy head of black hair.

288
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,908
I think it adds
a certain Atticus Finch quality.

289
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:49,172
I've also hidden money
on the upstairs landing,

290
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,507
in the jukebox,
back behind the records.

291
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,468
The photoshopped hair
is too much, isn't it?

292
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:55,377
Lovely, however,
I'd like you to focus

293
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:57,847
on the potential sudden
and unfortunate death of Nancy.

294
00:16:58,015 --> 00:16:59,557
- If you don't mind.
- Yes, right.

295
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:00,892
Of course.

296
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,103
- Do you want me to update the custody?
- Yes.

297
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,689
Silas becomes
Shane's legal guardian.

298
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:07,857
Got it.

299
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:10,971
Excuse me.

300
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:15,368
Dean Hodes' office.

301
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,450
- Please hold.
- If something happens to me,

302
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,911
you'll take care of this
for Silas and Shane, okay?

303
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:22,663
Something happens?
Where are you going, skydiving?

304
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:25,625
None of your business.
Just make sure it's all taken care of.

305
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:27,428
I'm counting on you.

306
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:34,383
Just out of curiosity
and poor self-image,

307
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:36,865
why me?

308
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:40,670
Because I trust you...

309
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:43,244
'Cause you're a parent...

310
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:46,229
'Cause you're the only person
I could find on such short notice.

311
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,780
I think the hair is too much.

312
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:54,786
No, no.

313
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:56,448
Chair up-a away-o.

314
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,865
Put these here.

315
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:59,221
Up here.

316
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:00,726
Why are you still here?

317
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:05,275
I was hoping to have all this done
before you got here,

318
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:07,333
but, well, here it is.

319
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:14,904
Good organization calms people.

320
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:18,094
It's a fact... order is soothing.

321
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:19,782
So...

322
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:22,473
<i>voilà</i>.

323
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,577
I have organized.

324
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:27,178
<i>Aqui</i>, bullets...

325
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:30,106
in descending order of caliber.

326
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,649
Down on this shelf,

327
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:34,902
empty magazines and grenade shells.

328
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,654
Down here, all handguns.

329
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:39,850
Then machetes and knives,

330
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:43,202
separated by blade length.

331
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:46,369
Some of the other stuff around here
I wasn't sure about,

332
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:48,124
like where do you put this?

333
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:49,292
You know?

334
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,125
What?

335
00:18:58,635 --> 00:18:59,983
Machetes up top?

336
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:01,971
Yeah, you are right.

337
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,570
Machetes up top.

338
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:06,976
Wait.

339
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,394
Wait, don't go.

340
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:10,312
Please let me stay.

341
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:12,614
Let you stay?

342
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:17,236
I don't have anywhere else to go.

343
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:19,530
Please.

344
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,793
I like it here.

345
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,746
My hair doesn't frizz.
I'm useful.

346
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,765
I will organize everything.

347
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,908
Do not make me go back there.

348
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,567
Everyone hates me.

349
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:36,408
I have no friends.

350
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:44,136
Selfish bitch!

351
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:45,622
Nancy's a bitch face.

352
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:48,011
- Always looking out for herself.
- Fucking bitch!

353
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,955
Oh, Nancy's a bitch face.

354
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,396
Fuckin' Nancy!

355
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,231
Fuckin' Nancy!

356
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:06,534
No smoke in here.

357
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:15,085
Tell me, what's the one thing
you wouldn't want a person

358
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:18,047
leaving this Earth
to not have tasted?

359
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,548
You have allergies?

360
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,508
You know, no, just bring it on.

361
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:23,441
<i>Omakase</i>?

362
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:24,887
Leave it to me.

363
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,764
Another?

364
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:29,599
Sure.

365
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,177
And you know what?
I'll have a whiskey, too.

366
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:33,771
And one for you.

367
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:35,215
<i>Arigato</i>!

368
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:47,326
When I was 10,
I jumped off the Morristown Bridge.

369
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:49,620
It was in the newspaper.

370
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:53,625
"Daredevil girl survives fall."

371
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:57,282
It wasn't a fall.

372
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,283
It was a leap.

373
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,010
Big difference.

374
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:13,684
<i>Kampai</i>.

375
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:14,994
<i>Kampai</i>.

376
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:32,037
What are you doing here?

377
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:39,962
Are you drunk?

378
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:45,332
- No, I'm not drunk.
- I can smell the liquor.

379
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:49,471
Is that why you slipped my goon?

380
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,040
So you do listen to your messages.

381
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:56,391
Yes, I've been drinking and smoking,

382
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:59,184
and I had raw fish.

383
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,233
Very high in mercury.

384
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:07,656
You should be taking better care
of my baby.

385
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:08,907
What's the point?

386
00:22:09,517 --> 00:22:12,892
I can't live with this level of stress.
It's killing my baby anyway.

387
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:15,928
I'm dead mom walking.

388
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,502
When am I gonna end up
in a landfill?

389
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:26,885
I haven't decided.

390
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:33,258
Decide.

391
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,684
Go ahead.

392
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:37,811
Do it.

393
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,870
Decide.

394
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:09,545
Oh, fuck.

395
00:23:11,095 --> 00:23:11,987
Oh, God.

396
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:26,276
Fuck. Fuck.

397
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:32,648
You don't dictate

398
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,585
the terms of this arrangement.

399
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,444
Time to go.
