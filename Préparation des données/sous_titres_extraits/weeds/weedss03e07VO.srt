<i>Previously, on Weeds<i/>

2
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:03,859
That was
a real nice brick dance.

3
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:07,942
- I left you a package in the garage.
- Heroin?

4
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:09,068
We need these votes.

5
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:10,630
I'm thinking
a golf membership.

6
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:11,897
I don't play golf.

7
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,537
What is it you do play, Celia?

8
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:15,507
I play house.

9
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:18,075
We're shooting a movie
in one of our empty houses.

10
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:20,486
Needs a caterer,
you'll thank me later.

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,341
Can you convince mom
that I'm stuck in a classroom

12
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,044
full of religious zealots,
two klicks away from jihad?

13
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:27,549
I like you, Nancy Botwin.

14
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:30,203
I bet you look good rolling
right out of bed in the morning.

15
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:32,345
You've been fucking him the whole time
you were married to me?

16
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:34,992
It's just business between us,
always has been.

17
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,986
Agent Fundis, D.E.A.

18
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,089
I'm here to talk
about Peter Scottson.

19
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:42,457
He hasn't come into work for a few days,
and we haven't heard from him.

20
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:45,286
Clinique here gon' take you
and fuck the gay out of you.

21
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:47,033
I can see your boner.

22
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:49,159
Don't be embarrassed.

23
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:51,378
That's what god's love
is all about.

24
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:54,349
I've been shot! Man, you
think it was the mexicans?

25
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:55,988
Cucaracha motherfuckers.

26
00:00:57,397 --> 00:00:58,419
Now, where's our crop?

27
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:03,556
You get your fuckin' crops, and
then we're done with your ass.

28
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:06,465
It's over
when I say it's over.

29
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:09,684
U-turn, oh, my god.

30
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:10,915
Call for help!

31
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:13,683
I've been waiting a long time
for this, motherfucker.

32
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:16,567
U- turn's dead! He's dead!

Michvanilly / [dx] / Macanto, San-A

36
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,383
Why exactly
is he in a hot tub?

37
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,447
The boat didn't fit.

38
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,433
Oh, of course not.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,730
Look at his grand-mama

40
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:38,083
crying over there
in her designer dress.

41
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:40,621
He sure was good to her.

42
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,550
She gonna miss
that gravy train.

43
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,944
Someone should go over there and poke
him. See if he flinch or something...

44
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:47,774
just to be sure.

45
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,067
He looks pretty dead to me.

46
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:53,427
'Sup, Two Strikes?

47
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:55,890
Hey, Clinique,
how you doing, baby?

48
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:57,646
Oh, I'm fuckin' pregnant again.

49
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,182
Some indian kid
I mercy-fucked for U-turn.

50
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,442
Oh, sorry.

51
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:04,758
Y'all know each other?

52
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:06,668
No, hi.

53
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:09,524
Two strikes, is it?
Nancy. Hello.

54
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:12,090
I ain't giving this one up.

55
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:14,637
Damn.

56
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,416
I remember
when he was just a wannabe,

57
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:19,906
when we busted our
carjacking cherries together.

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,367
He taught me how to drive-by.

59
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,160
Respect.

60
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:30,916
Thank you.

61
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,427
Don't think of this
as a loss of identity.

62
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:37,134
Think of this as an upgrade
to a better way of life...

63
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,521
Better services, better schools,
better tax base.

64
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:42,469
- This merger...
- Oh, enough.

65
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:44,745
Agrestic and Majestic
are never gonna merge.

66
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,069
I told them
about your deal with Celia.

67
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:49,425
Where are <I>our</I> houses?

68
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:52,165
I was more than generous
with all of you.

69
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,816
Let's get an idea of how the vote's
gonna go. I gotta get home for

70
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,286
"Are you smarter than a 5th grader?"

71
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,824
all in favor of a town merger
with Majestic, say, "aye."

72
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,312
- Aye.
- All those against?

73
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:02,547
NAY!

74
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,460
Oh, the nays have it.
Up your ass, Groff.

75
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,717
Friends,
this is a colossal mistake.

76
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:09,223
Think of the people
you represent.

77
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:12,522
The votes aren't there...
nothing more to say.

78
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:16,479
Find yourself another town to swallow.
Celia can help you. She's good at that.

79
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:19,165
All right, not so fast,
4th grader.

80
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:23,447
There is a way to bypass
a city council on this issue.

81
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:27,488
If it's put to a referendum,
the town can decide.

82
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,204
Referendum.

83
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:31,778
Hell of an idea,
councilwoman Hodes.

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,225
- Whore.
- Whore, whore.

85
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,191
Whore...

86
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,996
- You did that on purpose.
- Hey, guys, come on,

87
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,521
what's wrong with you people?

88
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,824
Miss Hodes knows that
this is good for Agrestic.

89
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,754
Whatever.
let's get out of here.

90
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:57,248
I want to thank you for that.

91
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,363
That's what <I>friends</I> do.

92
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:03,082
I don't want to be
your friend.

93
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:06,200
Come home with me.

94
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,399
What about lunch tomorrow?

95
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,769
I'm not hungry for food.

96
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,894
Well, maybe by then
you will be.

97
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,046
So, what does this mean
for our debt?

98
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:23,821
Are we off the hook?

99
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,476
Depends on who
makes new leader.

100
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:29,435
Well, how does that work?

101
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,722
- Is there an election?
- What, you ain't get the ballot?

102
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,548
There's Marvin, maybe
he can shed some light.

103
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,116
Hey, Marvin.

104
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:42,946
- How you doing?
- Okay.

105
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,449
I know this must be
really hard for you,

106
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:48,150
losing your friend, your cuz,

107
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:51,219
which could mean your cousin
or not...

108
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,342
I'm a little unclear...

109
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:55,830
But also your leader.

110
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:59,533
My dad and his moms
were second cousins.

111
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,096
Well, there you go.

112
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,086
So, I just also wanted to say

113
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,015
that it's been great
getting to know you,

114
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,611
- and maybe one day...
- Wait...

115
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:11,774
You think 'cause U-turn dead,
you off the hook?

116
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:14,726
- No?
- Who's in charge now?

117
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:15,997
Me.

118
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:19,412
I'm the nigga in charge
over here.

119
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,418
You owe <I>me</I> now.

120
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:24,639
You got a problem with that?

121
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:29,081
No... It's just... it's a big job
you're taking on, Marvin.

122
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:30,605
I'm a big boy.

123
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,225
How's your ass doing?

124
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:35,226
How'd you know about that?

125
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,409
- Nancy?
- I didn't say anything, I swear.

126
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:41,892
U- turn... he said something about it
the other day when he paid me a visit.

127
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,091
He said the mexicans
popped you?

128
00:06:44,582 --> 00:06:45,887
You gonna take that shit on?

129
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:48,017
I ain't afraid
of those taco bells.

130
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:51,144
- But I am gonna settle things right.
- Settle?

131
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:52,649
Call a meeting,

132
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,475
figure something out
before we all kill each other.

133
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:56,778
You're goin' face-to-face?

134
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:59,556
They gonna gun your big ass down
for real this time.

135
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,318
Not with her there,
they won't.

136
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:04,308
No one wants a dead white lady
on their hands.

137
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,246
Oh, I'm not sure I'm comfortable
going to a gang summit.

138
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:10,934
You ain't got no fucking choice.
We goin' tomorrow.

139
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,568
I thought you were
going to summer camp.

140
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,041
Too expensive
with the divorce.

141
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:19,285
Everything's a mess.

142
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:22,378
So, what's the deal here?

143
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,803
Watch.

144
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:26,713
This is a case of betrayal.

145
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:28,140
Judas did it.

146
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:36,916
This is the strange case
of the mad scientist.

147
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,836
Big bang's a lie, and dinosaurs
lived on earth the same time as man.

148
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:41,478
- Shane Botwin!
- What?

149
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,039
If you're gonna shove your
doctrine down our throats,

150
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:45,293
at least be clever about it.

151
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,859
I thought I was, but I guess
you're just too smart for me.

152
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:50,749
Perhaps you should take over,

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,640
present something to the class
that is mysterious to you.

154
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,418
- Okay.
- Okay! Stand up.

155
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,918
I'd like to solve the mystery

156
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:03,683
of the school that
receives federal funding...

157
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,287
yet promotes
a religious curriculum

158
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,390
in direct violation

159
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,163
of church-state separation
mandates.

160
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,404
Sit down, Shane Botwin.

161
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:16,295
Yes, sir.

162
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,323
Jesus Christ.

163
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:21,446
Exactly.

164
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:32,850
How're you doing?

165
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:35,425
You know, living the dream.

166
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:39,072
- You?
- How did you know Marvin got shot?

167
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:41,109
U- turn never said anything
about it that day.

168
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,436
You really think you deserve
to know the answer to that?

169
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,327
I think that's what you
wanted to talk to me about.

170
00:08:45,428 --> 00:08:47,097
Maybe I want to talk to you
about how you kiss.

171
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:48,968
Maybe that's a discussion
for another time.

172
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,178
Look, the mexicans
are real pissed at Marvin

173
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:55,548
for his part in the drive-by.

174
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,933
U- turn's really pissed
they shot Marvin in the ass.

175
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,779
Maybe they didn't shoot him
in the ass.

176
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:03,987
Maybe someone else did it to make it
look like the mexicans did it.

177
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:06,469
Maybe someone did it
to start a gang war

178
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:10,743
and let all them motherfuckers kill
each other so that <i>we</i> could all be free

179
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,576
Don't go to this meeting.

180
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:19,391
<i>now</i> he's concerned.

181
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,106
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

182
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:23,611
Something.

183
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:25,883
Maybe I was doing it.

184
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:28,631
{\}Yeah{\}.

185
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,908
Sorry I knocked over
your plant.

186
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,611
Wasn't my plant.

187
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:48,266
I'm telling you, mom,

188
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:50,419
I'm at
a very impressionable age.

189
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:53,191
And if you're not careful,
this pedagogy will take root,

190
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,621
and you'll end up with
a right-wing narc on your hands.

191
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,312
Hang tough, stick to your beliefs.

192
00:09:57,412 --> 00:09:59,641
Show a little character.
I know you have it in you.

193
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,035
They're fundamentalists.

194
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,194
You're not getting out
of summer school!

195
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:05,408
I don't have anywhere else
to put you.

196
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:07,655
You're not sitting at home all
day playing with my video games.

197
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:10,992
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Morning

198
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:12,730
Mom, this is Tara.

199
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,968
- Little early for a visitor, isn't it?
- She slept over.

200
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:24,020
- Silas...
- Mom...

201
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:26,419
... Not after megan and quinn.

202
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,892
I'm not going through this again.

203
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:31,311
You're not gonna make me
that mom.

204
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,133
Tara, it's lovely to meet you.

205
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,572
You seem like a nice girl.

206
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,916
But my son isn't allowed to have
sleepovers, and he knows this.

207
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,847
Oh, we're not having sex,
mrs. Botwin.

208
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:45,376
I'm a virgin.

209
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:49,435
- Oh, really?
- I honor god mith my abstinence...

210
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:52,338
Until the day I join
my husband in marriage.

211
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:54,996
- You don't say.
- They're everywhere.

212
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:57,884
It's true. we're abstaining.

213
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:03,513
Well, good for you.

214
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:06,981
I have a question.
Do you really think evolution is a lie?

215
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:08,861
Well, I believe

216
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,197
that I'm descended from
adam and eve and not a monkey.

217
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:16,632
So, natural selection,
darwinism, empirical data...

218
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,457
None of that factors in
for you?

219
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,767
Evolution is just a theory.

220
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,859
I mean, that's why they call it
the theory of evolution

221
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,714
and not the fact of evolution.

222
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:27,003
Oh, what about...

223
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,858
You've asked your question.
now shut the fuck up.

224
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:32,847
Silas, don't swear at your brother.
Shane, don't antagonize Tara.

225
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:34,771
Tara, keep saving it
for the lord.

226
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,275
Where the fuck's andy?

227
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,817
<i>Okay, everybody, that's lunch!</i>

228
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:43,999
Lexington steele?

229
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,361
Oh, pleasure to meet you, sir!

230
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:48,375
Andy botwin, huge fan!

231
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,260
Not huge the way you're huge...
admiration huge.

232
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,399
- Thanks, bud.
- Hey, I took you in the ass. Huh?

233
00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:57,693
Your dildo, the one they
had molded from your dick.

234
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,396
I was with a girl, israeli.
she strapped it on.

235
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:04,145
To be truthful,
for me, too big...

236
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:06,443
The dildo, not the girl.

237
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,665
Gave me a little oose-lay
oopy-pay, know what I mean?

238
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,935
- Look, what's good on the menu?
- Oh, what isn't good?

239
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,328
I present you
a mediterranean feast...

240
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:18,640
- Hummus, baba ghanoush, couscous...
- Got any beef?

241
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,429
Oh, yeah, kebabs right there.

242
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:23,343
So, does beef keep you hard?

243
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,510
I just like beef.

244
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:31,357
Oh, ladies, back away.
One stray pube in the tabbouleh,

245
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,598
the health department could
shut down the whole buffet.

246
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:37,911
Wait, look at you shaven mavens.
I take it all back.

247
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,244
Go ahead, step right up.

248
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:44,315
- You're funny.
- And cute... For a cook.

249
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:50,562
- What's up?
- Come in. Close the door.

250
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,584
Fine, but we're keeping
the shades open.

251
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:57,375
Listen, I just had a development
get shut down in phoenix

252
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:58,900
because
of some paperwork issues,

253
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,773
and I need for that
not to happen here.

254
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:05,073
Be a doll and legalize my construction
crew for me this afternoon.

255
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:09,514
Look, I know this is not the most
kosher thing in the world to do,

256
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:13,326
so if you can't do it, I'll just
fire you and hire someone who will.

257
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:18,170
You have no idea
how unkosher I can be.

258
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:20,074
Now I'm intrigued.
tell me more.

259
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,819
Can I do this tomorrow?
I have an appointment this afternoon.

260
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:24,761
- An appointment?
- It's a woman thing.

261
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,074
Oh, well,
it always is with you women.

262
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:29,446
Okay, tomorrow.

263
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,128
I got lunch.

264
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:35,800
I figured we'd eat

265
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:38,520
at one of those tables
in the courtyard and...

266
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:44,921
Nancy, I only have two sandwiches.
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:46,724
No problem, celia.

268
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,626
You know, Sullivan,
the fastest way

269
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:51,823
to get those
referendum signatures

270
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:55,470
may be
to have Nancy gather them.

271
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,638
She has scads
of sales experience.

272
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:00,665
That's a great idea, celia.

273
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:03,733
Yeah, you've got yourself
a good little worker here.

274
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:07,304
I'll be back later.

275
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:15,824
Dude, if you are fucking
with us, that is so not cool.

276
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:17,812
They're rolling.

277
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:21,413
These are my dishwashers.
Over there

278
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:23,729
Be cool.

279
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,502
This is the greatest thing
I've ever seen.

280
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:33,039
<i>why is the black guy
wearing a pirate's hat?</i>

281
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:37,040
It's called "peckers of the caribbean. "
He's captain Jack. Get it?

282
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:39,276
Not really.
shouldn't they be on a ship?

283
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:41,869
There's an anchor.

284
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,518
Pardon me.

285
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,147
Come on, still rolling here.
come on, keep going.

286
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:53,889
Still rolling.
we're still rolling.

287
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:54,993
Oh, god!

288
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:56,732
Actually, I need five minutes.

289
00:14:57,985 --> 00:14:58,988
Better make it 10.

290
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:01,049
Cut! Cut!

291
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:08,384
- How you doing?
- Sore.

292
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,254
Hi, I'm... I'm dean.

293
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,867
Are you staring at my tits?

294
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:15,682
Paul, get this fucking creep
out of here.

295
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,649
- I didn't do anything.
- Fucking pervert.

296
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:21,329
- Escort mr. Tits here off the property.
- I didn't do anything.

297
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,382
I didn't do any...
I didn't do anything!

298
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:26,865
Paul, I got to go home.
his food gave me the shits.

299
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,412
Well, I guess we're even.

300
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,745
God damn it! my lead's gone.

301
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:39,243
- This is not good... not good!
- Let's do all girls.

302
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:41,510
Honey, it's called
"peckers of the caribbean."

303
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,748
how are we gonna do a movie
about peckers without peckers?

304
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,239
I'll do it.

305
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:50,036
I, uh, recently measured myself,
and I'm quite large...

306
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:54,249
Not Lex large, but respectable,
and I'm practically a peg leg.

307
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:55,578
- Fuck you.
- Okay, fair enough.

308
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:57,350
Jenny, this one goes, too.

309
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,431
And you, listen to me.

310
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:01,427
From now on,
it's chicken and fucking rice.

311
00:16:01,538 --> 00:16:04,336
If I see anything ethnic
on this table, you are fired.

312
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:06,776
The only thing I want coming
out of my actors'asses

313
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:08,777
is a hard dick, got it?

314
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:11,259
Say you love jesus. say it.

315
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:14,057
If I say I love another man,
doesn't that make me gay?

316
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,910
Do you want to be damned
for all eternity?

317
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,500
No, I just want you
to go to hell.

318
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:21,154
We're trying to save you.

319
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,930
You guys, stop.

320
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:29,078
<i>"Blessed are the peacemakers."<i>
matthew 5:9.

321
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:32,592
Shane, don't you
want to be saved?

322
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,400
By you?

323
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:38,559
Well, only you can decide
to take jesus into your heart,

324
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:40,392
but I can help.

325
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:43,916
We can talk about him,
study his word.

326
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:47,925
Why don't we try it at lunch
today, see how it goes?

327
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,865
Okay.

328
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:51,949
Great.

329
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,006
What happened to you?

330
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,587
Amelia's going to save me.

331
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,046
Amelia.

332
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,458
I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

333
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:23,993
You second-guessing me, bitch?

334
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,886
No, not at all. Respect.

335
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,185
I'm just...
maybe you shouldn't mention

336
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:31,442
them having shot you
or the drive-by.

337
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:32,888
You know how gangsters can be

338
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:36,059
and their egos
and their guns and shivs.

339
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,778
Look, they ain't gonna shoot you
in public

340
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,535
so just shut the fuck up.

341
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:42,876
Hey, it's
the brick dance lady.

342
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,421
Yo.

343
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,421
Give me back
our fucking chiva.

344
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:48,127
Man, I don't got your chiva.

345
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,848
I'm just here to tell you
that if you let me have the weed trade,

346
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:54,190
you can take everything else...
all the hard shit's yours.

347
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:56,011
I ain't a greedy hard ass
like U-turn.

348
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,101
Where's our fucking chiva,
pendejo?

349
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:01,849
Yo, man, I ain't got it.

350
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:03,168
Son of a bitch.

351
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:07,815
Maybe we kill you anyway,
turn you on a spit.

352
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,691
We can feed
a whole fuckin'country.

353
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:13,926
Uh, what's... what's chiva?

354
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:17,744
- Tigre, goma, brea.
- No, no, no. No comprende.

355
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,379
Heroin, Chelita.

356
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:24,600
Now I think I know
what he's talking about.

357
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:27,582
- Maybe.
- You got my chapopote?

358
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:29,431
Aw, Jeez,
you have so many names for it.

359
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,813
Yeah, it's kind of like
eskimos and snow, right?

360
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,596
You better talk quick before
I pop gordito here, querida.

361
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:41,595
If I knew where it was...
your... Stuff

362
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,521
and you got it back,
would you leave us alone?

363
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,200
Piece-of-shit bastard.

364
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:49,186
Would you please take the gun
out of his mouth?

365
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,722
That motherfucker trusted you
and not me?

366
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:55,760
Okay, enough, Marvin.
he didn't appreciate you.

367
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:56,990
Now, listen...

368
00:18:57,623 --> 00:19:00,494
I want you to wipe out my debt,
all of it,

369
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:02,366
along with heylia's
and conrad's...

370
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:05,583
Gone, finished, over.

371
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,172
Bullshit. You mine, bitch.
you all mine.

372
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:11,412
Guillermo,

373
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:15,846
Marvin doesn't want me
to give you your chiva back.

374
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:18,513
I want to, but I'm his bitch,
so I can't.

375
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:21,472
Yo, fat albert...

376
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:24,258
You gonna give my brick-dancer
what she wants?

377
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,771
Or maybe you want to hang out
with U-Turn again.

378
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,984
I'm sure that he's lonely
en el infierno.

379
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,737
On your mother's life?

380
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,068
I swear. you off the hook.

381
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:41,494
And I'm growing impatient.

382
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:44,068
Okay, one sec, one sec,
one sec, one sec.

383
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:46,769
Hold on.

384
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:51,421
Tomorrow morning,
go to this address,

385
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:54,582
follow these instructions,
you'll get your trunk.

386
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:57,707
Hey, both of you...

387
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,176
These streets
belongs to méxico now.

388
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:03,542
You out of the drug business,
amigos.

389
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,226
Not even mota.

390
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,364
Oh, that's "weed" in english.

391
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:13,273
I don't ever want to see or hear
about you dealing anywhere in my city...

392
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:15,430
Nada.

393
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:17,460
Nothing.

394
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:29,133
Adiós.

395
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:42,137
Hey, Amelia!

396
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:44,504
I missed you at lunch today,
what happened?

397
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:48,007
I apologize, Shane.
I haven't forgotten about you.

398
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:51,867
The lord has sent me to someone who's
in greater need of prayer and counsel.

399
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,453
Yeah? But I'm
a blasphemous, liberal jew.

400
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,247
What could be worse than that?

401
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,697
Isabel thinks
she's a homosexual,

402
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,737
but she's just lost her way.

403
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:03,472
I've got to help her.

404
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:19,040
Hola.

405
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:20,954
¿Cómo está? Bien, gracias.

406
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:26,298
Su nombre es Martin Shackelman.

407
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,810
Hola, SeÑor Shackelman.

408
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:30,562
Mi nombre es Estefan Fenelón.

409
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:35,175
No, Estefan.
you are now Harold Strauss.

410
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,069
Sí, SeÑor, sí.

411
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:46,981

412

413
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:52,153

414
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,462
Sí. it's a beautiful thing.

415
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,009
Gracias. Por favor.

416
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,046
Got to learn Spanish.

417
00:23:06,077 --> 00:23:08,712
Your referendum, nonkosher.

418
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,172
I don't believe it. You couldn't
have had time to get them all.

419
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:13,751
I'm very resourceful.

420
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:18,415
There's a towel
in the bathroom

421
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:20,888
if you need to get out
of your wet clothes.

422
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:23,682
I don't need a towel.

423
00:23:26,894 --> 00:23:28,854
You're gonna help me
celebrate.

424
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:32,799
What are we celebrating?

425
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,015
My freedom.

426
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:36,889
Are you quitting?

427
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:40,487
At least not yet.

428
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,469
We're gonna see
how this goes first.

429
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,079
Any chance you speak spanish?

430
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:56,871
Never mind.

431
00:23:59,553 --> 00:24:01,286
Oh, I have to warn you.

432
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,150
My last two relationships...
both guys ended up dead.
