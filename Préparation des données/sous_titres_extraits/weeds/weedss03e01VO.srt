6
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,497
Our stash is worth about 300 G,

7
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:03,286
but the market is making a bull one so,

8
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:05,127
we sit on a half a million easy.

9
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:09,482
I'm having an affair with the dawg.

10
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:11,502
Doug Wilson? Wife fucker.

11
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:15,424
It's my kid's graduation,
I can't do this.

12
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:17,850
You have failed us all!

13
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,635
There's some fucking lowlife stole
two of them already.

14
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:23,068
- The cameras?
- And the "drug free zone" signs,

15
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:26,302
and the sasquatch costume.
Son of a bitch.

16
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:28,353
- Hi Kat.
- Hi.

17
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:31,544
Abum Chuck,
he's just this bounty hunter.

18
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,628
I did something illegal.

19
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:36,274
- It's now or never, come with me.
- I'm not coming with you.

20
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,314
- Thanks for keeping me company.
- Where are we going?

21
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:41,221
- Where do you wanna go?
- Pittsburgh!

22
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:44,917
- Step out Geronimo!
- You watch that shit man.

23
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,753
You've been ... fucking him
the whole time you were married to me?

24
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,183
It's just business between us.

25
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:50,453
It always has been.

26
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,260
Take your last harvest,

27
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,782
make a quick deal and then
handle all the cash over to me.

28
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:55,889
Why are you doing this?

29
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:57,749
Because I let everything
at line for you,

30
00:01:58,636 --> 00:01:59,679
and you fucked me.

31
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,235
I'm looking to sell about
30 pounds of sexy mom.

32
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:04,140
- Are you in?
- Yeah, I'll take it.

33
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:06,117
What the fuck?

34
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:08,097
Give us the drugs
and we'll let you live.

35
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,586
Kachichian says goodbye.

36
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:11,914
- Where's the money?
- Ain't no money fool!

37
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:14,111
- Wait ...
- Where is my money?

38
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:16,558
- I kill agent asshole, you pay us.
- He's dead?

39
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:18,854
Ain't no money cuz
they decided to jack us.

40
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,170
We kill each other then
nobody gets nothing!

41
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:22,831
- He's dead?
- YES!

42
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:27,828
Open the fucking safe!

43
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:31,020
Sorry there's a lot of...
data flying around.

44
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,651
Oh not today.

45
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,957
Hi Nancy!

46
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,463
Did you take something
that doesn't belong to you?

47
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:40,579
I want in.

48
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:43,702
- That's him.
- Shit ...

49
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:44,941
Bitch you're about to die.

50
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:11,913
Hey, I don't know about this, I mean...

51
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:14,226
God knows what they've done
with the inside,

52
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:17,134
it might upset you,
your mother kept that place so clean.

53
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:21,080
It's used to be all flowers,
and nice lawns...

54
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,926
- Can we go to CityWalk now?
- ... nice families...

55
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:26,876
- And now, look at this.
- I got to go pee.

56
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:30,320
- Oh, she's gotta go pee.
- I'm gonna pee in my pants.

57
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,007
You hold it! There it is.

58
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:34,311
Well, I'm gonna ask her
if she can pee in the house.

59
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,308
Hello?

60
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,268
- Can hold it!
- Ally.

61
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:40,530
Ally!

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,488
Oh look,
they haven't changed the wallpaper.

63
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:45,091
Hello?

64
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:47,750
I'm Dawn Tremigliosi.

65
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,887
I used to live here
where I was a little girl, hello?

66
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:54,296
We're visiting, from Scottsdale.

67
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,239
Mommy?!

68
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,943
I think she had an accident.

69
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:10,165
- Sorry about this, we were just, uh...
- You used to live here?

70
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:12,534
My wife did.

71
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:15,023
Dawn Tremigliosi, from Scottsdale.

72
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,708
Yeah, I got a cousin in Scottsdale.

73
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,769
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:21,866
You know a dude named Cold Blood?

75
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:24,201
About 6.5, 320,

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,957
big scar across his throat,

77
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,861
Maybe I can hook you up.

78
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,128
You can go get nachos together.

79
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:32,924
You know, hon', it's uh...

80
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:34,611
too bad.

81
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:37,713
No one was home
when we went to your old place

82
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:39,520
and we just had to...

83
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:42,350
drive away without going in at all.

84
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:44,165
What?

85
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,454
Oh, right, we...

86
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:50,914
- We went straight to CityWalk.
- They got bowling at CityWalk.

87
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:53,309
And that's what we're doing...
Right now.

88
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:55,389
We're bowling, okay?

89
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,159
I got kids here.

90
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:04,517
Y'all going to hit that reset button.

91
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:06,887
Let's go, let's go.

92
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:09,802
Go, go, go, go, go,
now, quick, move, c'mon!

93
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,882
- Bye!
- Bye.

94
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:17,439
Can we all talk
without the guns, please?

95
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,405
- My arms are getting tired.
- So, rest in, by all means.

96
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:22,247
Marvin, if you put that gun down,

97
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:24,581
I swear I shoot you myself, fat fuck.

98
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,206
Can I just make one more call,

99
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,201
in the service of finding our pot?

100
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,622
Our pot!

101
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:35,686
Fuck you!

102
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,889
Hold off!

103
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:38,491
Let's all just chill, alright?

104
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:41,236
If she doesn't find the pot,
ain't nobody gettin' shit!

105
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:42,685
Well, that's not true.

106
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:44,288
You'll be getting the bullets.

107
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:48,032
Nancy, make your call.

108
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,550
Shit.

109
00:05:58,062 --> 00:05:59,425
I can't get a signal.

110
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:04,915
That's the little fucker
who stole my cameras.

111
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,296
Arrest him!

112
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,693
I didn't do anything.

113
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:10,794
I have you on tape.

114
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:12,840
Like, I wouldn't make copies?

115
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,067
I didn't do shit!

116
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,859
- A lot of people look like me.
- What are you waiting for?

117
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,490
Search his car,
hit him with your flashlight.

118
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,847
- Do what you people do.
- I did it.

119
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,088
- See?
- I stole her cameras,

120
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:27,620
- they are at my house, let's just go.
- Let's take him in.

121
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,069
Ma'am, ma'am,

122
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:32,393
I can't give you a ride, with
a suspect in the back of the vehicle.

123
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,239
- It's policy.
- So, what am I supposed to do?

124
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,773
Hike home?

125
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,310
I'm in heels, here.

126
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,558
I'm sorry Ma'am,
I'm just doing what we do.

127
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,088
Cute, right.

128
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:45,117
Well, what's happening with his car?

129
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,600
Yeah, hey, can I...

130
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:49,850
Let me just lock it up really quick.
I'll have my mum come and get it later.

131
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:52,764
No, I'll have to call the impound.
This is a restricted parking area.

132
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:54,984
Okay, this is ridiculous.
Silas, give me your keys.

133
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:57,750
- I will drive your car home.
- Absolutely not, no way.

134
00:06:57,854 --> 00:07:00,451
It's over 400 bucks
to get your vehicle out of the impound.

135
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:01,845
Now, give her the keys.

136
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:03,413
It's my car.

137
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:07,044
- Hey, what the hell, you can't do that.
- Oh, yes he can.

138
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:09,698
Because, you... have no rights.

139
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,743
Teething little shit.

140
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:14,300
Son,

141
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:17,628
get in the back of my vehicle,
right now, let's go, come on.

142
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:20,167
Son, let's go. Come on.

143
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,131
I'm just trying to find
some power bars , okay?

144
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,193
Power bars, that can be right.

145
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:30,863
What do you call these?

146
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,653
Bars of reception?

147
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,021
On my phone,
I call this little pyramid.

148
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,692
Kinda like your dick.

149
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,752
Hey man, that's not cool.
We don't even know these people.

150
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:43,169
Oh, bars, bars, bars, got it.
Here we go. Please, don't shoot me.

151
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:54,870
Hi, Nancy.
<i>Surprise, it's me, Celia.</i>

152
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,223
Celia, I didn't... I didn't call you.

153
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,626
<i>No,</i>
you meant to call Silas,

154
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,672
but, you know, he's not here right now.

155
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,932
I had him arrested,

156
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,711
<i>and he admitted taking my cameras.</i>

157
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:10,734
You can probably reach him
at the Agrestic police station,

158
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:12,677
<i>if they're letting him take calls.</i>

159
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:16,581
And you know, Nanc',
you're gonna have to reimburse me

160
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:18,285
<i>for gasoline, because</i>

161
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:23,307
your irresponsible adolescent
has left me with an empty tank, hello?

162
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,910
- We gotta go.
- Like hell.

163
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:29,796
Hello, Nancy? Rude.

164
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:31,705
As usual.

165
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:35,729
Where is the fucking gas pop up thing?

166
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,440
Fuck it.

167
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,975
Where're we going?

168
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,311
I know where the pot is,

169
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:47,549
and if you let us go get it,
we'll bring it right back, I swear.

170
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,618
Guns on me.

171
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:53,566
- I'm staying.
- What?

172
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,596
Because you wouldn't know
that we're coming back, I got it.

173
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:10,627
- Okay, Bassa will go with you.
- Marvin, you're up.

174
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,110
Gone.

175
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,307
If you are not back
with the brackley by dark,

176
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:18,141
I'm shootin your boy here...
in the nuts.

177
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:21,039
And I will shoot him
in the kneecap and the elbow.

178
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,289
And so on, so you'd better get movin'.

179
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:33,310
I forgot my purse, sorry.

180
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:35,238
I'll be back soon,
oh no, no shooting, okay.

181
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,304
He's 12, brown hair, brown eyes,
he's weraing a beige suit, blue shirt.

182
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:47,849
If you find him,

183
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,696
could you just call me?
We had to sedate his mother.

184
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:53,697
Yes, yes, very upsetting.

185
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:57,481
You have my cell number?
Thank you, thank you, bye.

186
00:09:58,494 --> 00:09:59,519
I'm telling you, man!

187
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,016
After a lifetime of sardines
and blobber,

188
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:04,061
fast-food burrito,

189
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:05,612
ain't gonna be kind to you.

190
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,299
You call the fucking cops, do you?

191
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:11,554
He's my nephew,
I called in an AMBER alert.

192
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,232
If the police find him first,

193
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,766
and you fucked up my bounty,

194
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,776
I'm wiping my ass with you.

195
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:29,701
Hey this is the truck version of
set me drift on a nice flower?

196
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,002
Shane, this is Bear.

197
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:43,167
We met over there by the candy machine.

198
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:47,358
and he showed me that the lift
of mini mint paddies was loose, look.

199
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:52,722
That's yummy.

200
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,733
So, listen little guy.

201
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:59,846
I am going to hit the ride
to South America with Bear.

202
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:02,789
But, I'm gonna leave you the van,
so you can go...

203
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:06,113
home, or Pittsburgh,
or wherever you wanna go, okay?

204
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:08,653
- I'm 12
- I was driving at 8.

205
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:10,425
Don't make him feel bad, Bear.

206
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:12,795
Okay, after you finished your sandwich,

207
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:15,050
go to the big parking lot,
out back there.

208
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,914
And practice driving around
a little bit,

209
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:18,287
until you feel confortable,

210
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,533
I'm sure you'll get
that thing very quickly.

211
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:21,784
Can you show me how?

212
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:23,611
I'm sorry, kid,
I'm on a tight schedule.

213
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,987
Yeah, he's on
a really tight schedule, and...

214
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:28,697
you know, he's done me a favour, so...

215
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:30,274
when he says "go", I gotta go.

216
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:33,879
And I said "go" half an hour ago,
so chop-chop tempus fugees.

217
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,620
Oh my God, you speak greek,
how cute is that!

218
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:39,562
It's latin,
and the actual quotation is :

219
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:42,349
"Fugit irreparabile tempus",

220
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:45,740
which means irretrapable time is flying.

221
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,717
Fuck me with the dictionary, kid.

222
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,489
Get beat up much.

223
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:51,988
Okay, honey, honey.

224
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:53,978
Sit down.

225
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,249
I know this must be rough,

226
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:59,845
but I think that you can use this
as an opportunity

227
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:03,544
to explore, and to grow, and to learn,

228
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:07,569
you should always keep an up to date
passport on your person at all times.

229
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:10,567
So, here the keys of the thing,

230
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,414
here's about $13 in change

231
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:16,090
that I liberated from the tampon machine
in the ladies room.

232
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:19,771
I want you to have it,
have amazing adventure, Shane.

233
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,362
We'll meet again, I'll be older,

234
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:24,016
but I'll still be hot.

235
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:25,465
And you'll be older,

236
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:30,630
and you'll still be the same, smart,
wise, gentle soul you are now,

237
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,061
but you'll be taller.

238
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,718
And I think that you're gonna do

239
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:36,349
some really interesting things
with your facial hair.

240
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,420
I just see it.

241
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:42,136
Okay sweetie?
Heart hug, heart hug.

242
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,897
Okay? Be well.

243
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,976
I think you're amazing.

244
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,483
Bye.

245
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:54,880
This is a fucking police station!

246
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:57,768
I told you there's a guy in there
who knows where the pot is,

247
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,351
I'm just gonna go talk to him
and leave, okay?

248
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,768
And who is this guy?
He a cop or something?

249
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:06,384
No he's a criminal, just like us,
it's gonna be fine.

250
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,223
You put any shit up in there,

251
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:11,643
we kill you and we kill
your boy Conrad, dig?

252
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,833
Fully digging, completely dug.

253
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:17,270
Ok, you and Conrad are like
"together together" or just like what?

254
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,400
We are business partners,
can I go in now?

255
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,886
You ain't done nothing?

256
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:24,729
Come on, two fine looking people,
all hormones and shit,

257
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,406
working side by side.

258
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,802
Okay fine, we kissed once.

259
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:35,147
But I don't know we never really
talked about it, now it's kinda weird

260
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,860
there's this whole thing happening
with you guys, so it's not...

261
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,050
a great time for us
to price our feelings.

262
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:41,845
- So, no booty, huh?
- No, not really.

263
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:47,397
- What do you mean by "Hah"?
- As in I bet U-Turn and I win.

264
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:50,262
I know that pretty nigger
never got to be in your business.

265
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,347
- How do you know?
- You just told me.

266
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:55,679
I know that, how did you know before?

267
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:57,256
- I just knew.
- How?

268
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,868
- I just did.
- How?

269
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:04,729
I've gotta go.
This discussion is not over.

270
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:06,699
Yeah it is,
cuz I know this type of things,

271
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,573
I'm like a deep dicker psychic.

272
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:11,422
Leave the keys
so we can listen to the radio.

273
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:22,252
Jesus Christ,

274
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,244
what do you want from me now?

275
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:26,701
I can't believe you told Dana,
how could you tell Dana?

276
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:29,388
You fuck up my marriage,
I fuck up yours, even.

277
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,853
Even my ass, I love Dana.

278
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,922
Then, what were you doing
inside my wife?

279
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:34,163
Your wife's enticing snatch

280
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:36,703
has nothing to do with my deep
and abiding love for my wife.

281
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,334
So give me your car keys,
I'm going after my woman.

282
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:39,695
I drive a motorcycle.

283
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:42,479
I'm not giving you
a God damn thing you asshole.

284
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:45,784
I was married to Celia
for 17 fucking years,

285
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:49,187
and you walked in and
fucked everything up, litterally.

286
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:54,426
I only wish I'd fucked your wife
before I told her you cheated.

287
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:58,122
Dana would never fuck you.

288
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,580
Oh really, how do you know?

289
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:02,420
She won't fuck anyone,

290
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,838
something about a short cervix
and how she might be a lesbian.

291
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,020
You have four kids...

292
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,119
...whose name could have been
Tequila Shots,

293
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:14,354
Knocking Her While She Was Sleeping,
Doing It For a Lexus and Turkey Pasture.

294
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,455
But she gets me, she thinks I'm funny,

295
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:18,841
she buys my underwear,
she puts new blades on my razors,

296
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:21,632
she makes these amazing lamp shots
and you told.

297
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,626
The only thing that Dana hates
more than sex is public embarrassment,

298
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,110
she is never gonna forgive me.

299
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:27,918
Homebraking fuck!

300
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:32,216
My marriage is over.

301
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:34,365
Yeah? Well welcome to the club.

302
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:37,638
- Oh shit, I'm bleeding.
- Good.

303
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,155
Jesus...

304
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:43,842
...and Christ.

305
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:31,434
You know, I dropped you
on your head once.

306
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:36,140
You were about 15 months old,

307
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,176
we were playing this game
where you'd climb up my legs

308
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:42,747
and I'd flip you over and you'd land
back on your feet, but this one time,

309
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:45,601
you kept climbing up my body
and you wouldn't flip,

310
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,612
and I'm holding your hands
and your little feeters

311
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:50,633
feeling out my body
and under my shoulders

312
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,009
and I'm saying "Silas, stop".

313
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,045
But you were laughing,

314
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:58,269
you were completely upside down,

315
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:00,696
your hurtsome shoe goes "wham",

316
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:02,177
right into my eye,

317
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,108
I let go,

318
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,453
with you head first

319
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:09,960
into the hard wood.

320
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,100
If Celia hadn't shown up,
we'd be in business right now.

321
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,379
How did you even get into the safe?

322
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,110
The combination was your maiden name,
you think that was turkey?

323
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:23,376
You know what?

324
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,688
I can't do this right now.

325
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:31,902
I need to get my hands on what you took,

326
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:35,846
and give it back to some people who'd do
some very bad things if I don't.

327
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,313
Am I being clear?

328
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,944
- What bad things?
- Silas!

329
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:43,565
Where is the p...
where is the dry-cleaning?

330
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:48,416
I need every last bag of clothing
or my boss is going to kill me,

331
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:51,544
just shoot me dead.
You got that?

332
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,281
Dead!

333
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:58,098
Where is it?

334
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,860
It's all in the trunk of my car.

335
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:04,514
- Your car?
- Yes.

336
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:07,671
Would that be the car Celia's driving--

337
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:09,348
- That would be it.
- Jesus Christ.

338
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:11,183
The cop took my keys
and gave them to her,

339
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:12,524
I couldn't do anything.

340
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,504
Can't your husband help you out of this?

341
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:26,622
Mom?

342
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:29,411
Mom!

343
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,081
I gotta go.

344
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:36,998
- Are you taking me with you?
- What?

345
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:39,864
No, at least if you're here,
I know where you are.

346
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:54,910
- Hello Andy?
- Hey Nanc', how is it going?

347
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,918
Yeah, yeah, of course I got Shane,

348
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:00,387
I think we gonna stay outing
for a while, is that cool?

349
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,764
Yeah? Great!

350
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:06,476
Don't worry about thing,
and he's having a blast,

351
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:09,585
don't be such a motherhen,
okay, we'll see you later, okay, bye.

352
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,388
I've seen her, she stole mint paddies,
are you gonna pay for those?

353
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:17,589
The kid, was there a kid with her,
that height, beige suit?

354
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,020
Sure, the kid was here,

355
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,397
he had a girl cheese special
and paid all in quarters.

356
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:23,190
He left a decent tip, tough.

357
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:24,818
How long ago did the girl leave?

358
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,293
I don't know, about two hours,
she left with Bear.

359
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:30,370
- Huh? What does that mean?
- Bear, he's a trucker.

360
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:32,942
And the kid was with them,
with the girl and Bear?

361
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:35,896
They left and then
the kid drove a blue van

362
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:38,316
around the parking lot
for an hour before taking off.

363
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,133
He's a little young
to be driving if you ask me but...

364
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:45,078
all the preservatives people eat
nowadays make them look younger so...

365
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,780
- who knows?
- Oh man, common', we gotta jam.

366
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:50,035
What kinda ride does Bear drives?

367
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:52,419
Blue, like a cyrillian blue,

368
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:55,186
but with sparkle in it,
you sent me these same mud flaps.

369
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:58,158
I know it's a cliché but...
I think he's being ironic.

370
00:19:58,258 --> 00:20:01,456
Holy Ned, you're a giant redwood.
Move, redwood!

371
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:05,054
I'm not redwood.
I'm not Yeti man,

372
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:07,082
Master Mohawk, Chief Wiggum,

373
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:09,157
Eskimo Pie, Grapewine North

374
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:10,696
or Orchidean Redskin,

375
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:14,301
and I'm not your Snow Nigger,
your rude piece of shit,

376
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:16,191
I'm fucking through with you.

377
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,233
Common', I called you Snow Niggah,

378
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:26,831
with an "A", geew Nanouk,
you're so sensitive.

379
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,424
You don't even know
if the bitch's coming back,

380
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:40,868
I got a hundred G's cash out the door,

381
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:44,873
I'm offering you
a great deal here, take it.

382
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:46,655
That's not a great deal.

383
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:48,553
Shut your mouth , or I piss in it.

384
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,262
That's just bad hygiene.

385
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,574
- Where were you raised?
- Where were you raised?

386
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:56,359
Uni brow stink y'all pink suit
wearing motherfucker?

387
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:59,355
Fifty percents on the dollar,
final offer, take it.

388
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,584
What?

389
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:08,825
- Is that a "yes"?
- No.

390
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:13,025
Fine, fine, yes, I'll take it.

391
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:15,759
- Wise choice.
- Shit.

392
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:20,671
Celia, it's Nancy.
I'd really like to get silas' car back.

393
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:22,012
Please, call me.

394
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,282
It stinks in here.

395
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:27,293
I shouldn't have let him
smoke in my car.

396
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:30,054
No more smoking in this car.

397
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:33,678
No more "puf-puf"
with the tabacco stick.

398
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:37,637
You're rude, you know that?
You gonna have cancer.

399
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:42,396
I thought these things were supposed
to get great gas mileage and shit.

400
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:43,638
They do.

401
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:45,737
Just haven't filled the tank
for 2 weeks.

402
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,058
2 weeks is pretty good.

403
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,410
Armenian guy.

404
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:16,316
That was weird.

405
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:19,621
Get away from the car!
Get the fuck away from the car!

406
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:24,252
Marvin, what are we doing?

407
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,302
I was thinking that the car
was gonna blow up.

408
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:31,163
Those Armenians, they like
to blow the shit up, you know?

409
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,312
Really?

410
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,889
Actually, I don't,
he's the first one I met, but...

411
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,355
I see a real shift here.

412
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:45,407
Hello?

413
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:48,794
Okay, and he never tapped it.

414
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:50,938
You owe me a flat screen, motherfucker.

415
00:22:51,044 --> 00:22:52,176
Oh yes, you do!

416
00:22:53,646 --> 00:22:54,659
Okay.

417
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:56,880
Bye.

418
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,267
We can get back in the car, now.

419
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,971
Who was that?

420
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:04,021
U-Turn.

421
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:05,665
What'd he say?

422
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:08,033
You were traded.

423
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,606
I was what?

424
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,975
He said he bought
your deal off to Armenians.

425
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,813
Your ass and your grass is all his now.

426
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:16,575
And he said, as we don't come back
with the pot soon,

427
00:23:16,787 --> 00:23:18,007
I gotta shoot you in the head.

428
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,057
So let's really focus
on finding it, okay ?

429
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:21,966
You got a really nice hair.

430
00:23:28,378 --> 00:23:29,704
Thanks.

431
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,450
How much do I love the overmedicated.

432
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:35,712
I can feel my pores tightening.

433
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:38,805
- Check this out.
- Tylanol,

434
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:40,431
with codeine.

435
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:42,835
Me, me...

436
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:49,374
Hey man, look.

437
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,873
I'm so sorry I fucked your wife
with my giant cock.

438
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,179
I'm so not frightened by you.

439
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:59,572
I have to be hung like a beer can,
and I'm talking Guiness tap.

440
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,700
Please, you're like one of those
mini bottles of Crystal Geiser.

441
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:06,068
Fuck you, I've seen you in the steam,
I got you by a good inch.

442
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:08,419
You care to make it interesting?

443
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:09,537
How much?

444
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:12,024
Your share of the Boo-yah
when Nancy sells the crop.

445
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:15,241
- That's a lot of cash.
- Yeah? I've got a lot of dick.

446
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,495
You're wrong, bitch.

447
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:24,363
- You're a big talker
- Oh yeah?

448
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,903
Well I'll talk.

449
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,115
- Winner and still champion.
- Yeah, only in length.

450
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:30,296
That's what counts, moron,

451
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:32,872
circonference doesn't factor
in a size war.

452
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,564
Flesh doesn't count either,
I'm a grower, not a shower.

453
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:36,728
Wanna measure hard?

454
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,205
Yeah, you're not gonna have
my share without a fair fight.

455
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:40,636
- Fine.
- Alright.

456
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,189
Come on.

457
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:49,322
Occupied!

458
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:56,840
- We took too many drugs.
- Yes, yes, we did.

459
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:01,505
We're having a great time,
we're at the dump.

460
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,640
Yeah.

461
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:09,141
He wanted to see where the trash went.

462
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:17,094
Okay, bye.

463
00:25:19,303 --> 00:25:21,141
This is one nice fucking neighborhood.

464
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,969
- How long you live here?
- Too long, shh, it's ringing.

465
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:25,613
Looks like it's from a movie.

466
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:27,680
That with the plants and trees,

467
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:29,342
no chain-link,

468
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,657
this place's got alarms?

469
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,308
Celia, I'm outside your house.
Where's my son's car?

470
00:25:34,484 --> 00:25:36,428
<i>Why? It's in your driveway.</i>

471
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,233
<i>Nancy, I told you I'd drive it home</i>

472
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,777
<i>and I always try to be
a woman of my word.<i/>

473
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:43,665
<i>Oh, you owe $37,50 for gas.</i>

474
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:46,439
<i>Hello?</i>

475
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,092
<i>Hello, Nancy?</i>

476
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,282
Shit.

477
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:58,035
This ain't good.

478
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,830
<i>Silas' phone, Celia speaking.</i>

479
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:21,541
<i>Hey Nancy, I helped myself
to some of your vodka,</i>

480
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:23,238
I hope you don't mind.

481
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,055
<i>Oh, and I borrowed some garden shears,</i>

482
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:30,908
you know they were
really helpful, so thanks.

483
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:37,367
I did this... for your own good, Nancy.

484
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:56,100
He gonna be mad.
