1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,273
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:04,136
I need you to do something for me.

3
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:05,952
It's important.

4
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:07,123
Kendall!

5
00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:14,732
I'll come and pick up
your carcass in the morning.

6
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:17,369
- I'm Parker.
- Veronica.

7
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:18,996
She's a one-Woman red-Light district.

8
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,820
Parker's in there with some guy.

9
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,427
Don't mind me.

10
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:28,311
Someone raped me!

11
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:35,116
The last thing I remember...

12
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:40,043
I was at the Zeta Theta rush party.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,366
I don't even remember how I got here.

14
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:48,073
I just...

15
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:52,632
I woke up, and I was all,
like, out of it.

16
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:57,130
And I didn't have clothes on.

17
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:02,290
The thing about being
roofied and raped...

18
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:05,411
you may not remember
the who, when, where, why,

19
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,331
but you know the what.

20
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:12,122
I have "there's got to be a morning
after" stuck in my head.

21
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:15,681
If I start singing, kill me.

22
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:18,680
The rapist was there
when I came into the room.

23
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:20,410
I could have stopped it.

24
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:23,450
But you didn't because
I told you she was a floozy.

25
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,720
It's a proud, proud day for both of us.

26
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,633
Tell me I'm here because of you.

27
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,263
Not that I'm counting or anything,
but isn't this wolf cry number two?

28
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,472
She's in here, sheriff.

29
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:41,671
Same as the others... Head shaved.

30
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:43,871
She doesn't remember anything.

31
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:46,332
They always say that.

32
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,761
How you doing? Rough night, huh?

33
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:54,881
So, um, around what time
did you get back to the dorm?

34
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:57,373
9:00? 10:00? 11:00?

35
00:01:57,637 --> 00:01:59,782
Just give me a window.

36
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:02,672
I don't know.

37
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:07,110
It... the rape...

38
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:10,351
occurred at 11:45,
give or take a couple minutes.

39
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:12,400
We had these movie passes.

40
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:15,933
I... came in the room
to get them.

41
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:18,682
You were here? You saw her?

42
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:20,791
The light was off. I didn't see much.

43
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:23,993
Well, why the hell
didn't you turn them on?

44
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:26,600
Because I heard noises.

45
00:02:27,077 --> 00:02:27,952
Noises.

46
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,972
Like breathing... and buzzing.

47
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,503
Buzzing... Like an electric razor?

48
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:34,973
Yeah, I guess, but at the time,

49
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:37,262
I thought it was something else.

50
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:39,393
It turned off a second
after I came in the room.

51
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:41,173
What exactly did you think
the buzzing was?

52
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:45,211
Something else, okay?
Just... something else.

53
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,131
Oh, my god. You thought...

54
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:50,662
I thought it was just sex.

55
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:54,013
It... It didn't occur to me
that it was against your will.

56
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:55,171
Thanks, Veronica.

57
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:58,382
Thanks for thinking
I'm the slut of the world!

58
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,032
You let this happen!

59
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:04,993
Parker, I can't even... I'm s

60
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:08,442
So sorry.

00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:15,420

<i>Veronica Mars 3x02
My Big Fat Greek Rush Week</i>

71
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:24,942
As long as there has been war
and prisons and soldiers and orders,

72
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,822
there has been torture.

73
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:31,040
You don't think it was invented by a
handful of Rednecks on the fly in Iraq.

74
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:32,670
It's always been here.

75
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:35,892
I guarantee the great George Washington
and his continental army

76
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:38,980
indulged in this sort of behavior
with the british redcoats.

77
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:40,850
We just had to sit around
a couple hundred years

78
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,613
for someone to invent
the digital camera

79
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:44,651
to show us what
we're really capable of.

80
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,980
Show of hands...

81
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,440
who of you saw this photo
from Abu Ghraib and thought,

82
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:51,862
"I would never do that
to another human being"?

83
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,220
You think it's cruel
and awful and unconscionable.

84
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:57,502
But  guess what.

85
00:04:57,605 --> 00:04:59,760
Of all of you who have your hands up,

86
00:05:00,488 --> 00:05:04,112
only two, maybe three of you,
are right.

87
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,200
In other dreary news,

88
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:09,581
you have a 20-page research project due
at the end of the term

89
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:12,851
about the effects
of imprisonment and torture.

90
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:15,982
There's an alternative.

91
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:19,760
I'm conducting an intensive study
on the prisoner-guard relationship

92
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:22,371
in which volunteers
are assigned those roles.

93
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,901
If, during the 48-hour experiment,

94
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:27,621
the guards are able
to extract from the prisoners

95
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:30,953
some arbitrary piece of information,
they are exempt.

96
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:34,792
But if the prisoners manage to keep
their secret, they are exempt.

97
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,672
Fine. I'll sweeten the pot.

98
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:43,531
The losing team still must do
the paper... Only 10 pages.

99
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,400
Any takers?

100
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,932
Got your message.

101
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:02,342
What you up to?

102
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:05,810
Turning my unbearable guilt
into steely resolve.

103
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,490
I think it's working.

104
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:09,910
Well, you've had plenty of practice.

105
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:11,100
Yeah.

106
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:13,673
Good. Done.

107
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,162
I'm gonna catch the rapist,
see him crucified.

108
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:17,792
Don't think they do that anymore.

109
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:20,243
First things first... I have
an interview with the newspaper.

110
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:23,152
Word is, they actually pay
for photos in college.

111
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:26,580
New safety rules for the dorm.

112
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:29,043
You guys heard about
last night... the rape?

113
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:30,592
Yeah, we did.

114
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:32,132
I really thought things
were going to be better

115
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:33,911
after the last incident, you know?

116
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:36,980
Like how the safest time to fly
is the day after a plane crash?

117
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:39,723
There's a floor meeting tonight, FYI.

118
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,283
I'm not gonna be around. I'm doing
this experiment for sociology.

119
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,400
Dr. Kinny?

120
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:47,640
I did the experiment last year.
It's pretty intense.

121
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:51,201
It's, like, life-changing.

122
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:35,812
She's a great writer, but can you
see her blending in at a sorority?

123
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:38,622
Uh, they're not big on
Doc Martens and Unibrows.

124
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:41,092
Call me back.

125
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:43,901
These are great.

126
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:47,331
This  other freshman gave me 100
pictures of his grandmother sleeping.

127
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,331
- Was she hot?
- No.

128
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:51,403
I'd take any assignment.

129
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:54,250
If I don't get this job,
the fine people in financial aid

130
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:58,290
have a completely undesirable position
in the library all picked out for me.

131
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:02,163
Yeah, she's picking a wedgie.
And she ain't got no alibi.

132
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:03,871
Can I tell you how happy this makes me?

133
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:06,162
She T.P.'ed my house in the 10th grade.

134
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,023
Makes me happy, too.

135
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:17,690
Welcome to the home of Theta Beta.
What do you think?

136
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:22,222
I think it's the gateway to hell,

137
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:25,720
and I don't want
to keep looking directly at it.

138
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,912
Veronica, I have
the perfect assignment for you.

139
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,993
You've probably heard
about the rape spree on campus.

140
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,353
There was another last night...

141
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:34,523
A freshman girl.
Her name's Parker something.

142
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,592
She was at a sorority party
at the Theta Beta house.

143
00:08:37,906 --> 00:08:39,971
You think the sorority
had something to do with it?

144
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,686
You wouldn't believe the rumors
about what goes on in that house.

145
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,073
I've been trying to find someone

146
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,066
who could get inside
Theta Beta during rush week,

147
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,902
Do a "behind the greek curtain" exposé.

148
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:50,483
And you want me to take pictures?

149
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,080
I want you to do the story.

150
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,722
You are exactly the type
they would love to have.

151
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,572
You're intelligent, cute.

152
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:58,961
Uh, combative, independent-thinking,

153
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:01,723
smart-mouthed...
believe me, I'm not their type.

154
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:05,663
Perfect. Trust me, Veronica...
you'll blend right in.

155
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:13,151
"Tasteful floral dresses"?

156
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:16,111
all my florals are trampy.

157
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:18,261
Seriously, I don't have a thing
with a flower

158
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,262
that's not in the tube-top
or hot-pant family.

159
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:21,990
Couple things about Theta Beta...

160
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:25,493
Their parties are notorious... Nothing
but free-flowing booze and boys.

161
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:27,573
They're totally against school policy.

162
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:29,881
Alcohol at a sorority party?

163
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:32,031
Doesn't exactly sound like news.

164
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:34,910
According to reliable sources...
four of them...

165
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:37,391
the Theta Betas get pledges
all liquored up,

166
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:39,991
take them to a secret room,
and have them undress

167
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:41,621
while the guys
from their brother fraternity

168
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,302
watch the show through
a two-way mirror.

169
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:45,232
If this Parker girl was there...

170
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,980
You had me at
"secret room".

171
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,362
Looks like you'll have
a room all to yourself.

172
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,033
I will?

173
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:05,292
My parents are driving in
from Denver to take me home.

174
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:06,390
Oh.

175
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,330
They never wanted me
to go away to school.

176
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:10,523
Well, my mom didn't.

177
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:15,430
She said I was too immature
to be on my own.

178
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:18,621
Guess she was right, huh?

179
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:21,380
It might be best, you know...

180
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:23,983
to be with your family.

181
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,172
Yeah.

182
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:30,093
You're probably right.

183
00:10:31,635 --> 00:10:36,211
<i>Thank heaven for little girls</i>

184
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,350
What's really worse...

185
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:40,681
getting girls to undress in front
of a two-way mirror

186
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:44,292
or getting them to dress like
a '50s vacuum ad first?

187
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:53,050
N o.

188
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:56,113
<i>You with the sad eyes</i>

189
00:10:56,318 --> 00:11:00,202
<i>Don't be discouraged, though I realize</i>

190
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:04,471
<i>It's hard to take courage in a world...</i>

191
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:07,132
Welcome to Zeta Theta Beta.
I'm Haley. What's your name?

192
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:08,943
- Veronica.
- Oh, my god.

193
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:11,470
I used to have a little
shih tzu named Veronica.

194
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,621
Hey, there... Veronica.

195
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,810
Great dress. I just need
to take your purse.

196
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:20,442
- I'm sorry?
- Don't worry.

197
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:24,253
We're not gonna steal anything.
It's a house thing.

198
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,613
So you ready for your first
Theta Beta experience?

199
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:29,221
I'm trembling.

200
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,171
Yes, I'd like a boy, a bottle of hooch,

201
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,762
and you can fast-track me
to the dirty room

202
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:36,712
so I can get the frak out of here.

203
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:38,723
Lemonade?

204
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,661
Worst roman orgy ever.

205
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:43,550
<i>Theta Beta</i>

206
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:46,901
<i>Comin' for to carry me home</i>

207
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:49,380
I am so completely not even lying.

208
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:51,151
Theta Beta is the best house.

209
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:54,220
- It is. We have so much fun.
- So much fun.

210
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,043
It's really like we're all sisters.

211
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:58,922
Oh, and Becky's father
is a dermatologist,

212
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:00,243
and he totally hooks us up.

213
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:02,660
You  even think you're getting
a zit, and you swing by...

214
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,400
cortisone shot, and you are golden.

215
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:06,993
- And we have a tanning bed.
- Fill 'er up?

216
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:09,302
Yes.

217
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:11,943
Any chance this one's
got a little kick to it?

218
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:14,530
Sorry, no booze. Them's the rules.

219
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:16,691
But the farther you are
from the singing,

220
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:18,813
the less you'll crave intoxication.

221
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:26,423
Last week, they tried to change
the lyrics to "Macarena"

222
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,411
I almost impaled myself
on the banister.

223
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:30,501
- I'm Marjorie, by the way.
- Veronica.

224
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:32,230
Oh, with a "c".

225
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:36,263
Um, what's up with
the whole purse thing?

226
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:38,200
I think you'll find out soon enough.

227
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,291
Trust, sister. Trust.

228
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:42,583
And don't let her scare you away.

229
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,652
Love her to death,
but she kind of looks at rush week

230
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:47,751
as shopping for someone
to borrow things from.

231
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:50,591
Shania? She's harmless.

232
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,950
A one-track mind but a heart of gold.

233
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,421
Gold? Really?

234
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,050
All my girls are wonderful.

235
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,663
Karen's our den mother.
She gets paid to say that.

236
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:06,430
Truth is, we're all incredibly lame,
but we're like family.

237
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:09,191
The trade-off is you have to wear
a matching dress occasionally.

238
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:14,231
See what a little ingenuity and
an unused dorm wing can get you?

239
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,721
These are the rules of
the Neptune conventions.

240
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:20,082
My T.A. and I will be close by
to make sure you adhere to them.

241
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,710
You'll notice the cameras
throughout our prison.

242
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:24,640
You'll be monitored at all times.

243
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:27,220
We should have done the paper.

244
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:28,301
It's gonna be fine.

245
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,713
Everyone whose social security
number ends in an even number,

246
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:33,193
step forward, please.

247
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,301
You are the guards.

248
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:39,340
The rest of you are now the prisoners.

249
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:41,633
Let's go over the rules.

250
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:46,273
Sleep deprivation is okay. Any other
kind of physical abuse is not okay.

251
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:49,513
Prisoners are required to get a certain
number of calories per day.

252
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:51,362
And to ensure that
the food isn't inedible,

253
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,673
one guard must eat a sample meal

254
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:56,242
before the prisoners
are forced to eat theirs.

255
00:13:56,326 --> 00:14:01,783
Prisoners are not allowed to use
cellphones, computers, watches.

256
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:04,343
Well, I hope you enjoy
writing your paper.

257
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:05,351
We'll never crack.

258
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,681
That so? Side bet?

259
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,430
Loser streaks across campus?

260
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:11,070
I'm gonna enjoy watching you do it.

261
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:12,753
- You would.
- It's on.

262
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,983
Prisoners, come with me, please.

263
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:26,761
This is the information
the guards want from you.

264
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:30,393
If at any time you want the experiment
to end and to just go home,

265
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:33,800
All you have to do is tell one
of the guards this information.

266
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,432
Or click your heels three times.

267
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:42,480
Guards, a bomb will go off in 48 hours.

268
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:45,441
You must get the location
of the bomb from a prisoner

269
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,132
to ensure the safety
of innocent people.

270
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:52,891
In exactly 48 hours... 6:02 p.m.,
sunday... the experiment will be over.

271
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:06,930
Prisoners, in your cell.

272
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:11,451
In your cell!

273
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:17,462
Well, I hope you're cool with this...

274
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,293
I'm planning on calling you
"Nancy".

275
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:24,250
No beds. Take them apart.

276
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:26,541
Put the mattresses in the guards' room.

277
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:30,351
No books, either.

278
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:32,340
Chill out, man.
I've got a test on monday.

279
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:33,530
I've got to get some studying in.

280
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:34,801
Fine.

281
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:37,452
Tell us where the bomb is,
you can go study right now.

282
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:42,090
Take their books and their bags.

283
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:48,540
Hey, um, where's the bathroom
in this place?

284
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:51,101
You'll all be using
the bathroom together.

285
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:55,041
There will be three breaks a day,
eight hours apart.

286
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,262
But I have to go now.

287
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,423
What's your name?

288
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,882
Samuel Horshack.

289
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:02,903
No.

290
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,420
There's no way you're that short,

291
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,801
smell that bad,
and have the last name Horshack.

292
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,642
How did you not kill yourself
in high school?

293
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:14,580
You want to use the John?
Tell me the address.

294
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:17,380
Come  on. You're not serious.

295
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:22,093
You know, I'm looking around...

296
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,383
I'm thinking the jew or
the fat chick will crack first.

297
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,502
- Hey, man...
- What?

298
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:28,763
You'd rather be politically correct

299
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:30,841
than prevent hundreds
of people from dying?

300
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:33,132
Take it seriously, bro.

301
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,921
You're gonna need
to watch that... bro.

302
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,780
Sorry, man. Just playing
the part, you know?

303
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,311
Let's just do this thing,
get the hell out of here, right?

304
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,672
Cucumber sandwiches and lemonade...

305
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:07,672
I'm really gonna blow
the lid off sorority malfeasance.

306
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:17,853
"You  have been selected to attend
a special private party.

307
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:20,400
Tonight, 10:00 p.m.
Dress to impress.

308
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:24,212
Respectfully, your sisters
at Theta Beta"

309
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:35,273
Well, how's it hanging, my brother?

310
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:42,270
Ouch. Whew.
That looks painful.

311
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:46,693
But it doesn't hurt nearly as much
as being betrayed by your own brother.

312
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,940
- Liam
- Yeah, we had a deal.

313
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,382
I take care of your trashy girlfriend,

314
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,571
I get a cut of her cash.

315
00:17:57,268 --> 00:17:59,481
- Where's the money?
- I don't know!

316
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,362
Do you know now?

317
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:05,620
Look, Liam, I found some cash,
but most of it is missing.

318
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:07,172
I don't know what she did with it.

319
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:11,581
You know this is gonna be
the last time I ask you, right?

320
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:15,872
Dónde está my money?!

321
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:17,593
It wasn't there!

322
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:22,051
I don't get it. Mom always
liked you best.

323
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:34,743
I'm not exactly sure what
"dress to impress" means,

324
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:39,142
but if I'm going to spend my night
singing campfire songs and drinking cocoa,

325
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:40,682
I'm thinking this will work.

326
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:51,640
- I'm so excited you're here.
- Me, too.

327
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:55,030
I guess "dress to impress" meant
dress like your favorite pussycat girl.

328
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:03,360
- Boys, booze...
- Panty dropper?

329
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:05,203
...jackpot.

330
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:10,590
Aren't you having one?

331
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:12,641
Oh, I'm having more than one.

332
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:13,860
So, what do you think?

333
00:19:14,148 --> 00:19:15,412
Awesome.

334
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:16,860
What do I think?

335
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,341
I think I'd sooner drink
Mark McGrath's bathwater

336
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:20,611
than drink anything here.

337
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:24,460
- Brody.
- Panty dropper.

338
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,520
The Pi Sigs are our brother fraternity.

339
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,270
They bartend for our rush parties.

340
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:30,860
They're, like, the nicest guys.

341
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:32,610
Yeah, I hear they're supersweet.

342
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:36,422
I hope you don't have a boyfriend.
There are so many cuties here.

343
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,893
Like, newbie legacy behind you...
lost Wilson brother.

344
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,171
You look exactly like
this chick from high school.

345
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:51,151
Oh, my god! What are you doing here?

346
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:54,763
Fulfilling my destiny.
It's a sorority party.

347
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:56,312
It's why I left the womb.

348
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:57,861
What are you doing here?

349
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,521
Veronica's rushing, and we love her.

350
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:05,142
Somewhere in a parallel universe,
Bizarro Dick is being a total killjoy.

351
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:07,660
Oh, you are so cute!

352
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:09,850
Come on. Let's get you another drink.

353
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:15,052
This is why we take your purses...

354
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:16,953
so we can leave invitations
to the secret party

355
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,561
in the dorm rooms of the girls
we want to get to know better.

356
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:21,062
But we had to get creative with you.

357
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:22,383
Yeah, that's cool.

358
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:25,250
It means that anyone here
had access to Parker's room.

359
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:27,852
You should meet chip.
He's president of the Pi Sigs.

360
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,473
- Chip?
- Yeah?

361
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:33,872
This is Veronica. Tell her Theta Beta
is the best house on campus.

362
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:36,580
This girl accused me of rape last year.

363
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,111
Ha! Ho ho!

364
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:40,460
Oh, you.

365
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:43,723
God. Learn to take a joke.

366
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:48,551
Just put that jalopy in the backyard

367
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:50,052
so Mrs. Grimley
doesn't have to look at it

368
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:52,680
and I don't have to hear about it, and
then everybody's gonna be fine, okay?

369
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:57,631
You okay, there, sir?

370
00:20:57,986 --> 00:21:01,481
There's been a murder.
I can take you to the location.

371
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:05,381
Whoo!

372
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:07,651
So the question on the dance floor...

373
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:09,690
How long must a girl
play drunk and willing

374
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:12,353
before someone tries to get
her to take off her clothes?

375
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,352
The '70s had "the hustle".
The '80s, the moonwalk.

376
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:19,721
We have the faux-lesbian dance.

377
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:26,620
A surveillance camera
hanging over a blocked door...

378
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:27,810
Yeah, that's not weird.

379
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:29,860
Look, you guys, we're on TV!

380
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:34,953
If none of the guys in the room
are gonna take the bait,

381
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:37,642
maybe whoever's watching
through this camera will.

382
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:46,810
You didn't tell me there was a camera!

383
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:48,030
Come on. Come up here.

384
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:51,153
Why don't you come down?
I want to show you something.

385
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:54,763
<i>Boo!Boo! Boo!Boo!</i>

386
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:57,872
Here it comes...
Scary, dimly lit stairway.

387
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,942
They think I'm drunk... or worse.

388
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,080
One false move, and someone's
getting a taste of Mr. Sparky.

389
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:06,443
What are you showing me?
Did you get a puppy?

390
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:12,041
You wanted to show me a driveway?

391
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:15,261
I think maybe it's time
to call it a night, Veronica.

392
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:17,220
You're on the verge
of losing points with the sisters,

393
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,540
and you're my fave, so...

394
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:21,801
there's a safe-ride-home cart
coming for you.

395
00:22:22,027 --> 00:22:23,791
Chip will wait with you, keep you safe.

396
00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:29,512
Hey, this is not how I wanted
my night to end, either.

397
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:34,672
I hope you're all hungry.

398
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:39,230
One of you has to eat it first.

399
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:41,730
That would be me.

400
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:50,003
Mmm. Mmm!

401
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:52,160
These are some tasty fishes.

402
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,523
I can't eat this.

403
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:54,811
Sure, you can.

404
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:59,782
Maybe it's magic corn and you can
grow to be the size of a real boy.

405
00:23:05,938 --> 00:23:08,363
The best way to keep a guy
at least 10 feet away...

406
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:11,202
Dry heave.
Vomit is the new mace.

407
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,651
Your chariot.

408
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:20,191
Bye sailor!

409
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,602
You have to take her
to her friend's dorm.

410
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:28,112
She's a commuter.

411
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:35,211
I don't know why I do it.

412
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:37,172
You girls get all tarted up,

413
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,750
parade right into
the belly of the beast,

414
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,190
and drink until you can't say no.

415
00:23:40,276 --> 00:23:41,882
You're lucky you didn't end up
with a shaved head.

416
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:43,822
You should know better.
The greeks are evil.

417
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:46,802
Okay, so here's the thing...
I'm not really drunk.

418
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:49,123
So if you could just take me
to the parking lot...

419
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:51,690
Yeah, like I don't get that speech
from everyone who sits in that seat.

420
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:53,812
No, for real. I'm totally sober.

421
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:56,392
I was pretending for a story.

422
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,890
I'm on your side.
Look.

423
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:01,722
Hey...

424
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:04,773
you pick up any Theta Beta
rushes last night?

425
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:06,011
I didn't.

426
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,903
But there are a couple of carts
out each night.

427
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:11,562
Backwards alphabet?

428
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:14,270
Z-Y-X-W-V-U-T...

429
00:24:14,557 --> 00:24:17,751
S-R-Q-P-O-N-M-L...

430
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:19,411
do you want me to juggle?

431
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:20,422
Back handspring?

432
00:24:20,498 --> 00:24:22,173
A vagina monologue, perhaps?

433
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:27,093
Get out.

434
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,292
Thanks, sunshine. Keep on keepin' on!

435
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:41,990
Hurry up! No measuring contests.

436
00:24:42,225 --> 00:24:45,032
Just do your business
like the dogs you are.

437
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:49,141
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

438
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:51,833
I don't hear anything, Horshack.

439
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,431
You all dried up?

440
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:56,861
It's kind of hard with you yelling.

441
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,560
"I can't pee 'cause
there's other boys around!"

442
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:02,440
Wait a minute...

443
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:04,093
Are you a homo, Horshack?

444
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:07,140
Time's up!

445
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:14,351
No blood, no body. Place tore up.

446
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:16,240
Looks like a robbery, not a murder.

447
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:18,552
They tore the place up looking
for the victim's money.

448
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:21,153
Well, if it was here, they found it.

449
00:25:23,307 --> 00:25:25,351
So tell me again what you were doing
out there in the desert.

450
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:26,591
Hey, sheriff.

451
00:25:30,786 --> 00:25:32,793
I think I found some blood.

452
00:25:34,427 --> 00:25:36,483
Bag it. Let's get it back to the lab.

453
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:55,252
<i>If you like piña coladas</i>

454
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:58,341
<i>And gettin' caught in the rain</i>

455
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,941
<i>If you're not into yoga
- Okay, okay.</i>

456
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,611
...I'll tell you what you want to know.

457
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:08,581
Come here.

458
00:26:11,496 --> 00:26:13,700
Yes, I like piña coladas...

459
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:15,590
and getting caught in the rain.

460
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,623
Get up.

461
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:24,081
Get up!

462
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:40,572
Mother of everything that is holy!
Hebe-O wet his pants.

463
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:43,312
I have sweat pants in my bag, rafe.

464
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,182
Sit down, prisoner.

465
00:27:01,547 --> 00:27:02,953
What are you doing?

466
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:05,860
You nearly scared me to death.

467
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:07,003
I'm sorry.

468
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:08,752
Why are you sitting there in the dark?

469
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:11,130
And while we're at it,
why didn't you call and tell me

470
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:12,460
you were going to be home a day late?

471
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:14,182
Backup was worried sick.

472
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,181
Come on. You can tell me.

473
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:20,480
You've got a girl stashed
somewhere, don't you?

474
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:24,392
Hey.

475
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:26,292
What's wrong?

476
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:31,212
I screwed up, Veronica.

477
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:34,811
I screwed up, and someone got hurt.

478
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,510
I know exactly how you feel.

479
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:55,701
Ahh. Pigs' knuckles.

480
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,202
Yum.

481
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:59,372
I can't eat that. It's pork.

482
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:01,652
And your mother was a pig?

483
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:03,242
I keep kosher.

484
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:04,733
I don't get that.

485
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:06,862
I mean, why won't your kind eat pork?

486
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:08,840
It's not like it's expensive.

487
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:14,623
Where did you get those?

488
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:18,381
I'm not asking you again.

489
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:19,431
I'm not telling you.

490
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:21,340
Well, then, you're going to solitary.

491
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,473
You can sit in there
all curled up in the dark

492
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:25,342
and pretend you're hiding
from the germans.

493
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,392
No, I think the first one was better.

494
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,113
It wasn't, honey.

495
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:32,932
Mom! I just...
I think it's more me.

496
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:36,273
You should have something simple
that doesn't draw attention to you.

497
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:38,551
Everyone is gonna know
it's a wig, anyway.

498
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:42,622
What do you think, mac?

499
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:44,252
Uh...

500
00:28:44,387 --> 00:28:46,582
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

501
00:28:47,178 --> 00:28:49,101
You can't make a decision for yourself.

502
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:52,191
This is why you never
should have gone away to college.

503
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,050
You're too immature.

504
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:57,682
Once your father gets his pound
of flesh at the dean's office,

505
00:28:57,806 --> 00:28:59,212
we're taking you home.

506
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:02,282
Listen, it all sounds suspicious
to me Veronica,

507
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:04,430
but you've gotta find out
what's behind the door with the camera.

508
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:05,921
Marjorie, the cool one...

509
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,503
Trust me, Veronica,
none of them are cool.

510
00:29:08,735 --> 00:29:10,913
She left me a voice mail
checking in on me,

511
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:13,010
suggesting I curtail my drinking.

512
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:16,031
It just doesn't exactly sound like
the advice she'd give

513
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:18,600
if they were trying to get me
to strip in front of the pi sigs.

514
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:22,810
Four sources, Veronica... Something bad
is going on in that basement.

515
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:25,220
Marjorie also said they were
voting tonight at 7:00.

516
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:26,940
- That's when I'll make my move.
- Great.

517
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:30,570
They sent me home in
a safe-ride-home cart.

518
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:34,442
If they sent Parker home the same way,
maybe the driver knows something.

519
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:37,303
Or maybe the driver took advantage
of the situation.

520
00:29:37,895 --> 00:29:40,881
I have a friend who volunteers
at take back the night.

521
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,120
Hey, it's Nish.

522
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:47,883
Question... Do you guys keep records
of who you take home?

523
00:29:49,197 --> 00:29:51,830
Want to know the day
you're the least safe at Hearst?

524
00:29:51,886 --> 00:29:52,760
Today.

525
00:29:52,818 --> 00:29:55,893
Why didn't you tell us you drove Parker
home the night she was raped?

526
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:03,203
If I understand correctly,
you drove Parker home.

527
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:04,992
She must have been totally out of it.

528
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,743
She was. She was hammered.

529
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:08,752
And you come in Wallace's
room the next day,

530
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,973
dropping off new rape-safety rules,

531
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:13,383
and you don't mention you were
the one who put her to bed?

532
00:30:13,428 --> 00:30:15,510
I didn't know Parker
was the girl who got raped.

533
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:17,900
If I knew, I would have gone
to the police or something.

534
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:20,090
Biscotti?

535
00:30:20,426 --> 00:30:21,293
No.

536
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:23,871
And what exactly
would you have told the police?

537
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,272
Whatever they asked.

538
00:30:25,816 --> 00:30:27,862
I didn't do anything wrong, Veronica.

539
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:29,621
She was fine when we left.

540
00:30:29,835 --> 00:30:30,922
"We"?

541
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:32,782
There was another girl in the cart.

542
00:30:32,986 --> 00:30:34,283
She wasn't drunk or anything.

543
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,113
She just took the cart
so she didn't have to walk alone.

544
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:40,361
Parker was so out of it.
She helped me take her upstairs.

545
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:41,563
What was her name?

546
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,543
Guten Morgen.

547
00:30:56,335 --> 00:30:57,660
Hats off, man.

548
00:30:57,988 --> 00:30:58,923
What?

549
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,591
I would have cracked.

550
00:31:01,188 --> 00:31:02,562
I almost did already, but...

551
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:04,803
would you believe,
I forgot the damn address.

552
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:08,933
It's the corner of 116th street
and Jameson Boulevard.

553
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:11,241
It's 114th and Jamestown.

554
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,252
No, it's 116th.

555
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,421
And it's Jameson, like the liquor.

556
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:19,842
He's right. It's 114th and Jamestown.

557
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:22,052
Maybe you could say it
a little bit louder next time.

558
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:24,051
I was agreeing with you, jerk.

559
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,002
Moe's alibi checked out.

560
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,633
Teri Wells, a sophomore R.A.
in clark hall,

561
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:34,542
confirmed that she and Moe
dropped Parker off at her room

562
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:36,792
and that by the time she left Moe,
it was midnight.

563
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,480
So it's back to Theta Beta...

564
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:40,810
figuring out what the deal
is with the mystery room

565
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:43,770
and hoping it'll give me some clue
to what happened to Parker.

566
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:46,172
- Here you go, Veronica.
- Thanks.

567
00:31:47,758 --> 00:31:49,683
I'm just so embarrassed.

568
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:52,351
I'm really not usually like that.

569
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:54,380
We all have our moments, Veronica.

570
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:56,373
Lord knows I have.

571
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:59,512
I just know they're not gonna
vote for me now.

572
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,483
They may surprise you.

573
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:04,411
My girls are excellent
judges of character.

574
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:08,512
I really like it here, and Marjorie...

575
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:12,082
You know, you can't talk
to the girls before the vote,

576
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:14,521
but I can.

577
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:34,633
So... the surveillance-camera monitor
is in the den mother's room?

578
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:36,881
What exactly is going on here?

579
00:32:40,956 --> 00:32:42,061
Veronica?

580
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:44,800
Just looking for the trash.

581
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,623
Well, you can relax now.

582
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:48,830
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

583
00:32:54,175 --> 00:32:55,222
Psst!

584
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:24,263
I do declare,

585
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:27,562
That was the finest frito pie
I believe I've ever tasted.

586
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:31,543
Oh, finally... My conjugal visit.

587
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:34,211
Mmm, let me guess...
You're out on good behavior?

588
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:36,781
You all know my girl, Veronica.

589
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:38,493
I have your picture hung in my cell.

590
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:40,861
Gets me through the long,
lonely nights.

591
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:43,410
I lend it to my buddy Horshack
sometimes... Hope you don't mind.

592
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,660
- It's good to share.
- Yep.

593
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:47,372
Well, have a seat.

594
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,760
We're waxing nostalgic
over our time on the inside.

595
00:33:50,005 --> 00:33:50,812
Mmm, I can't.

596
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:52,791
You're breaking out. I'm breaking in.

597
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:55,561
Star-Crossed.

598
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,772
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

599
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:03,511
Mmm... getting a jump-start
on the freshman 15?

600
00:34:05,037 --> 00:34:07,472
You can't hear six people
jump out of a window?

601
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,953
We're gonna lose this now,
and it's on you two.

602
00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:17,563
Now, with the Zeta Theta sisters
all off somewhere voting,

603
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:20,083
time to see what's in the mystery room.

604
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:44,602
Holy smokes.

605
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:51,501
Un-freaking-believable.

606
00:34:51,575 --> 00:34:53,931
- This is awesome, Veronica.
- Thanks.

607
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:55,911
And the secret parties
with the booze and dudes?

608
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,963
We're talking one greek house down,

609
00:34:58,606 --> 00:35:00,122
nine to go.

610
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,873
Yeah, you know, they weren't all bad.

611
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,850
You're gonna be a real asset
to us here, Veronica.

612
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:05,972
You're one of us now.

613
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:09,550
How are you not peeing?!

614
00:35:10,396 --> 00:35:13,140
You downed an entire big gulp
at the food court,

615
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,032
and now you can't go?!

616
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,022
What is wrong with you?!

617
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:21,720
It's 114th and Jamestown.

618
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,632
- Dude!
- Only 10 hours to go, and you caved!

619
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:25,860
Leave him alone.

620
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:32,493
We need to talk.

621
00:35:33,557 --> 00:35:34,792
About what?

622
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:36,671
Karen has cancer.

623
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:40,500
She saw you go into her private room.
There's a second camera inside.

624
00:35:41,418 --> 00:35:43,052
What were you looking for?

625
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:45,242
The truth?

626
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:46,891
If it's not too much to ask.

627
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:50,790
A friend... someone I know...

628
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:53,993
was raped after she left
a Theta Beta party.

629
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,401
I thought there might be
a clue behind that door.

630
00:35:57,678 --> 00:35:58,760
What's behind that door

631
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:01,083
has nothing to do with
the rape of Parker Lee.

632
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:03,383
So the pot farm...

633
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,861
Karen was so sick from the chemo,

634
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:07,552
she just spent the day laying
on the floor in front of the toilet.

635
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:10,680
We got her a dog bed so at least
she could lay on something soft.

636
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:13,732
This botany-professor friend
of hers gave her some seeds.

637
00:36:13,978 --> 00:36:16,120
He said it would help with
the pain and the nausea,

638
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:17,303
and it did.

639
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:20,331
She won't just lose her job
over this, Veronica.

640
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:21,690
She'll lose her insurance.

641
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:25,140
Please don't say anything
about what you saw.

642
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:32,130
I held out as long as I could, guys...
really.

643
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,383
Come on. Give the guy a break.

644
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:36,040
You rang?

645
00:36:36,255 --> 00:36:39,530
We have the address...
114th and Jamestown.

646
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:41,050
Congratulations.

647
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:43,522
You managed to get false information.

648
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:46,873
Call me again when
you get accurate intel.

649
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:49,983
D'oh!

650
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:53,443
Solitary... Now!

651
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:59,111
I don't know how you did this,
but I know this was you.

652
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:02,532
Nish, it's Veronica. Listen to me...

653
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:05,203
You can't print that story.
I made a huge mistake.

654
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:06,463
What mistake?

655
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:08,340
Their den mother has cancer.

656
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:11,160
She's growing marijuana
for medical reasons.

657
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:14,250
She got the seeds from a botany
professor who was trying to help her.

658
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:15,872
And the party?

659
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:16,862
The underage drinking?

660
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,452
Look, can you just give me a day

661
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:20,101
so I can verify some facts?

662
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,611
As far as I'm concerned,
the facts are here.

663
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:25,041
The article's being published,
Veronica.

664
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:27,161
You should be proud.

665
00:37:33,438 --> 00:37:36,642
Karen, I'm so sorry.

666
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:43,281
There's going to be an article
In the school newspaper tomorrow.

667
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:46,893
You need to get rid of the
marijuana before it comes out.

668
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,123
You want to know
the definition of "ironic"?

669
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:57,840
You got voted in, Veronica.

670
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:00,702
We wanted you to be one of us.

671
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,251
I left you a card

672
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,963
with, like, my numbers and stuff,

673
00:38:14,145 --> 00:38:15,333
if you want.

674
00:38:18,116 --> 00:38:20,602
I thought we were gonna have
a blast together.

675
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,612
Now everything's ruined.

676
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:24,772
Don't go.

677
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:29,022
Nothing's ruined.

678
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:33,250
But I think if you go
with your parents, it will be.

679
00:38:33,425 --> 00:38:34,461
Stay here.

680
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:36,760
I'll have your back from now on.

681
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:40,693
Thank you, Mac.

682
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:00,523
Yes!

683
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:06,142
Omar, now that it's over,

684
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:08,692
-You got to tell us what that address was.
-No.

685
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:11,393
It's 116th street
and Jameson Boulevard.

686
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:13,503
Stick that in your trophy case, baby.

687
00:39:13,595 --> 00:39:16,351
Congratulations, guards. You've won.

688
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:18,322
What are you talking about? It's 6:03.

689
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:19,930
It's 5:45.

690
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:23,330
The two guards who fell asleep
on duty were just pretending.

691
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:25,753
They waited for the prisoners to escape

692
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:27,541
and then moved the clock forward.

693
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:29,183
See you in class.

694
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:35,070
And you didn't tell me?

695
00:39:35,136 --> 00:39:37,240
We were counting on you
to act like a jerk.

696
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:39,493
Way to sell it.

697
00:39:43,158 --> 00:39:44,290
'Sup?

698
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,311
I'm not acknowledging that.

699
00:39:48,315 --> 00:39:50,621
Look at my dedicated college student.

700
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,002
Knowledge is power.

701
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:54,121
- Nietzsche?
- Mnh... "Schoolhouse rock".

702
00:39:54,206 --> 00:39:57,610
Here's the knowledge I've accumulated
my first week at Hearst...

703
00:39:57,826 --> 00:40:00,600
Chip Diller seems to be around
when the rapes occur,

704
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:03,712
the safety of the safe ride
home is questionable,

705
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:05,432
and someone in the theta betas

706
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:08,053
had the keys to Parker's room
the night of her rape.

707
00:40:08,145 --> 00:40:09,360
It's a start.

708
00:40:12,716 --> 00:40:14,210
Van Gogh's "Two Lovers".

709
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,623
Do you have any idea
how much this is worth?

710
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:18,213
Millions.

711
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,492
I need you to do something for me.

712
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,453
Sorry, Mrs. Casablancas,
but I'm meeting my daughter in an hour.

713
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:26,803
I think you'll change your mind.

714
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:29,571
Oh.

715
00:40:30,717 --> 00:40:32,033
Papers are in order.

716
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:35,653
Proceeds from the sale to go
to the south Neptune food bank.

717
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:36,951
Are you sure?

718
00:40:37,655 --> 00:40:39,222
Yeah, I'm sure.

719
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:48,542
Hey, Horshack.

720
00:40:48,686 --> 00:40:49,683
Morning, Wallace.

721
00:40:49,785 --> 00:40:52,482
Good news... Looks like Rafe
isn't showing up today.

722
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:55,510
Yeah, he's feeling a cold coming on.
He asked me to take notes for him.

723
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,831
- And you're doing it?
- Yeah.

724
00:40:57,907 --> 00:41:00,240
I mean, all that stuff this weekend
was just a game.

725
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:01,970
He's a cool guy. He just likes to win.

726
00:41:02,046 --> 00:41:03,132
If you say so.

727
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:04,903
Hey, where's Logan?

728
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:06,923
Oh, we'll be seeing him real soon.

729
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:08,150
So...

730
00:41:08,227 --> 00:41:11,620
what did we learn from
our little experiment this weekend?

731
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:14,783
Let me hear from one
of the participants?

732
00:41:19,538 --> 00:41:20,730
Oh, my god.

733
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:27,171
That happens to me all the time.

734
00:41:29,505 --> 00:41:32,990
So it looks like my work-study
job will be in the library,

735
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:36,311
my journalistic career over
before it even really began.

736
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,672
Well done, sister.

737
00:41:56,006 --> 00:41:59,932
