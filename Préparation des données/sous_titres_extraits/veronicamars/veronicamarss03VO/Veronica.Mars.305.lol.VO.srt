1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,072
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,320
how many women like me have to be raped,

3
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:06,865
have to end up like this,
their heads shaved,

4
00:00:06,936 --> 00:00:09,440
before this administration
listens to our demands?

5
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:12,439
Shut down the fraternity houses!

6
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:16,112
I will find out who raped you,
Parker. That's job one.

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:20,139
They raped Claire.
"The blonde in the middle"

8
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:22,019
That girl, Claire, gets raped
after one of our parties,

9
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:23,859
and suddenly school's all in a bunch.

10
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:26,820
We need you to do your Veronica thing
And prove it's a pack o' lies.

11
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:29,221
This photo was taken of Claire
the night she was raped.

12
00:00:29,277 --> 00:00:31,063
Who's that dude? It's not one of us.

13
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:35,262
Precisely. You Pi Sigs have exactly
one asian member, and that's not him.

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,283
Claire, hi.

15
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:44,701
Can I talk to you for a minute?

16
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:48,101
You're that girl... The girl
who made a scene in the quad.

17
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:49,552
You cleared the Pi Sigs.

18
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:51,183
Yeah, that's me.

19
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:53,883
So, what's this to you, anyway?

20
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:56,570
Crimes against women... It's a hobby.

21
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:59,883
Plus, a friend of mine was
one of the other victims.

22
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:04,633
Listen, I have the
ATM photo from that night.

23
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:06,161
Of the guy who did this to me?

24
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:07,591
Too soon?

25
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:09,661
Probably.

26
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:11,213
What the hell, right?

27
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,640
I mean, if it saves someone else.

28
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:23,752
I have no idea of who this is.
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:25,463
You don't have to apologize.

30
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:26,540
This guy...

31
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,500
I guess he made me pull my daily max
off my ATM card.

32
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:31,721
I got raped, and I paid for the privilege.

33
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:36,033
There's a logo or something on
the guy's t-Shirt. Can you read that?

34
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,850
I'm just completely useless today.

35
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:43,690
That's okay.

36
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:48,060
Morning, all.

37
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:52,772
Dr. Landry has been called
as an expert witness

38
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,091
in the State vs. Wolpert case
that I'm sure you're all tracking.

39
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,691
He's asked me to take the class today.

40
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:03,001
We'll continue with our oral presentations.

41
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,510
Now, let's see.
Who do I want to hear from?

42
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:10,110
Veronica Mars,

43
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,252
why don't you come down here
and blow us all away?

44
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:17,273
- Actually, I'm not...
- Very well.

45
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:21,351
Moving on...

46
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:23,491
Never mind. I'm ready.

47
00:02:27,498 --> 00:02:30,213
Eli navarro has been in
and out of juvenile detention

48
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,011
since he was 13 years old.

49
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:33,932
By the time he turned 16,

50
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:37,282
He was the leader of the
Pacific Coast Highway bike club.

51
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:42,303
By his count, he's spent more than 700
days in juvenile-detention facilities.

52
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:43,701
He's currently on parole

53
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:47,203
after assaulting the P.C.H. Gang leader
who replaced him.

54
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:51,141
Veronica, this was an oral presentation,
not show-and-tell.

55
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:54,561
Dr. Landry said we were
allowed audiovisual aids.

56
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:55,813
He's both.

57
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:58,020
- Audio.
- Yo.

58
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,213
And visual.

59
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:05,301
Fine, I'll let it slide.

60
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:10,243
Today I'll talk about
the socioeconomic conditions

61
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,731
that lead preteens into a life of crime.

62
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:16,122
Then I'll open it up to questions
to both myself and mr. Navarro.

63
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:21,211
Eli Navarro stole his first bicycle
when he was 6 years old.

64
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:24,731
We were at it pretty late, you know...

65
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:27,481
A little too much juice,
a little too much smoke.

66
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:30,122
So, it's like 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning.

67
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:33,160
One of my boys, Hector,
comes in, wakes me up.

68
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:35,610
He's like, "yo, yo, yo,
somebody keyed my bike".

69
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:38,660
So we find this guy's truck
parked on the street,

70
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,002
Hot-Wire it, take it to my cousin's shop

71
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:44,783
'Cause, well, that's
where the car crusher is.

72
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:49,923
We end up leaving the cube...

73
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:52,023
The one that used to be his f-250...

74
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:54,620
In his driveway with
the license plates on top.

75
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:59,803
Found out later we had
the wrong guy's truck.

76
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:04,733
Questions?

77
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:07,793
Do you think you can ever
really leave gang life behind?

78
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:09,923
I mean, once you've been in it that long...

79
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:12,071
Promise  you won't tell my parole officer?

80
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:15,593
- Promise.
- I'm trying. I really am.

81
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,302
But truth... Yeah, I miss it.

82
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:21,162
I miss having cash in my pocket.

83
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:22,990
I miss the thrill.

84
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:29,062
That's a nice necklace.

85
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:30,821
It's Lilly's, right?

86
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:33,122
I've been thinking about her a lot lately.

87
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,330
So, any big halloween plans?

88
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:41,592
Oh, you know, the usual...
Slapping on my sexy nurse duds

89
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:43,722
And rolling tweeners for their chocolate.

90
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:47,331
Meeting the boyfriend at the benetian

91
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:49,010
After he gets out of his night class.

92
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:50,571
The benetian?

93
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:53,400
It's room 332, Bennis Hall.

94
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,722
Some guy runs a casino out of his room.

95
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:59,310
That's right.
You're a card shark.

96
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:00,740
It's not for me.

97
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:03,970
I agreed to do something
he likes... Gambling...

98
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,343
In exchange for something I like...

99
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:08,102
Dressing up and passing out
candy to trick-Or-Treaters.

100
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:11,562
And I'm not buying that as a costume,
so don't come knocking.

101
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,860
You might want to consider
switching shampoos.

102
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,813
It's drywall dust, okay?

103
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,891
We're renovating the student union upstairs,

104
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,220
And i, uh, I got this stuff

105
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:23,251
In crevices and cracks I didn't even know...

106
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:25,561
Hey, word to the wise.
You got a boyfriend?

107
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,690
Use the short leash.

108
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:29,363
As hard as this may be to believe,

109
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:30,491
The women of Hearst

110
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:33,612
Aren't close to the top
of my worries about Logan.

111
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,971
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

112
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:37,592
You're dating Logan again?

113
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:40,642
- After the way he treated Lilly?
- This is news?

114
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:44,463
Man, the prison grapevine blows.

115
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:59,641
How best to describe
the results of your retest?

116
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:01,813
Disheartening would be a start.

117
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:06,280
An indictment of the U.S. public-school
system might get closer to the point.

118
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:26,172
Hey, dad.

119
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:28,142
Back from Shangri-La.

120
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:30,780
Hey, look out your window
and check out the Porsche.

121
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:33,462
It's four inches into the fire zone.

122
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,562
Let's call the city and get it clamped,

123
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,302
You know, just for funsies.

124
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,091
You get the lawn chairs.

125
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:40,872
I'll put some popcorn in the microwave.

126
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:42,211
Veronica.

127
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:45,031
Seriously,  you blow 100 grand on a car,

128
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:47,693
I guess you think you can
just park wherever you want.

129
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,073
I wonder if the sense
of entitlement came standard.

130
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:52,820
It did.

131
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:54,393
And  while we're on the subject
of entitlement,

132
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,673
Maybe someday you can parlay

133
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,710
your complimentary
$100,000 college education

134
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:01,083
into a lucrative career of your very own.

135
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,613
It's my wife's car, by the way.

136
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,383
Veronica, have you met my wife?

137
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:06,901
No.

138
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,140
Has your wife met the hot chick?

139
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,590
I believe there's a compliment
in there somewhere.

140
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:13,360
Hello, Veronica.

141
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,201
Veronica, why don't you go...

142
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:16,763
Matriculate myself?

143
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:18,840
Okay.

144
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:25,421
You were about to tell me
about your ex-husband.

145
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:27,363
Excuse me.

146
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,382
Listen, I think I might have dug myself

147
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:31,253
too big a hole in this class.

148
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:33,963
Mind telling me what
I need to do to drop it?

149
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:35,863
Build a time machine.

150
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,733
Sorry, man.
add/drops ended last week.

151
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:04,723
Camp Waterloo.

152
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:21,251
Good afternoon, ma'am,
and how are you today?

153
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,280
I'll tell you what... I'll be sugar
and sunshine if you could help me.

154
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:28,300
I am trying to organize a camp reunion,

155
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,141
And I was hoping you could send me a roster

156
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:32,053
Of the campers for the last five years.

157
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:35,300
Yes, ma'am, I sure do miss it.

158
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:38,973
My backside still smarts
from all that horseback riding.

159
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:41,563
Well, aren't you sweet?

160
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:46,051
Just the names, addresses, and phone
numbers, if that's not too much trouble.

161
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:48,581
How long do you think it'll take?

162
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:52,261
That long, huh?

163
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,663
Can you e-mail that to me?

164
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:57,573
It's veronica.mars, m-a-r-s...

165
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,443
I will track him down.

166
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:01,181
We appreciate it, mr. Mars.

167
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:03,520
We don't have to tell you
that it needs to happen soon.

168
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:13,681
Do you see why he's the college dean

169
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,753
most frequently burned in effigy?

170
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,343
You might want to take it easy on him.

171
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:19,862
His stepson is dying.

172
00:09:21,197 --> 00:09:23,713
They want me to track down
the kid's deadbeat dad.

173
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:26,722
The boy's dying wish is
to meet his real father.

174
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:40,432
As long as I'm in
supportive-girlfriend mode,

175
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,263
someone point out the sucker table.

176
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:45,513
Baby needs a new pair of...

177
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:47,143
How you like that, eh?

178
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:51,562
There's a bad guy coming through,
better get out of his way.

179
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:54,902
Okay, everybody,
you just take it easy, okay?

180
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:56,833
Now, what you're gonna do,

181
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,462
is you're gonna give me everything you got.

182
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:03,270
I want the watches, the jewelry,
the wallets... Everything.

183
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:07,633
And I want you to put it all
in Tricky Dick's bag right over here.

184
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:08,771
Move!

185
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,731
You! Give me the cashbox.

186
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:17,112
It's in the drawer behind you.

187
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:19,013
Now!

188
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:24,733
The combination!

189
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,921
You seem highly intelligent and motivated.

190
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:28,862
Figure it out.

191
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:31,320
The combination, or you're gonna
have to find

192
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:34,511
someone new to deal the blackjack, man.

193
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:54,983
Sorry, Tricky. That stays with me.

194
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:00,661
What?

195
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:03,042
You think we're playing with you?

196
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:11,473
You're gonna regret that.

197
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:19,541
Say good night to the bad guy.

198
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:31,132
<i>A long time ago,</i>

199
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:33,911
<i>We used to be friends, but I</i>

200
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:37,733
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

201
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:40,933
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

202
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:43,482
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

203
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:47,160
<i>Just remember me when</i>

204
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:49,290
<i>We used to be friends</i>

205
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:51,650
<i>A long time ago</i>

206
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:54,201
<i>We used to be friends</i>

207
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,962
<i>Veronica Mars 3x05
President Evil</i>

208
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:04,141
Hey,  where are you going?

209
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:05,782
I've wasted too much time already.

210
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,120
We still have to get statements
from everyone. Sit down.

211
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:09,003
Why?

212
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:12,302
So a make-Believe cop can
make-believe he'll get my stuff back?

213
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:16,553
Thank you.

214
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:21,562
There's probably 10 grand
in the lockbox, give or take.

215
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:23,173
And you expect us to help?

216
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:25,622
We told you to shut this place down twice.

217
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:28,131
Trust me, I don't expect you to help.

218
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:30,251
You asked a question. I answered it.

219
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:34,393
- Wha happen?
- Where were you?

220
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:37,450
I was in class, like we talked about.

221
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:39,160
Less gambling, more learning.

222
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:41,750
That was right after you said
"jump" and I asked "how high?"

223
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,641
Two guys pulled guns, held up the casino.

224
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:47,622
They took the necklace Lilly gave me.

225
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:49,731
Hey, come here.

226
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:56,500
Well, well, what do we have here?

227
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,140
An illegal gambling establishment.

228
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,400
Underage drinking.

229
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,512
Public displays of affection.

230
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:06,911
It's like sodom and gomorrah in here.

231
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,201
Barker, start collecting I.D.s
from everyone in the room.

232
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,802
Uh, we had our wallets stolen.

233
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:15,090
The casino's run by this student here.

234
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:17,581
Now, we've asked him
to shut it down, but he says...

235
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,770
Good work, J.V. Varsity's
taking the field now.

236
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:21,310
We've got it from here.

237
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:25,092
With Scotland Yard on the case,

238
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:28,640
you're sure to have
that necklace back in no time.

239
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:31,382
Yeah, well, I don't think
I'm gonna need their help.

240
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:33,941
I'm pretty sure I know who did it.

241
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,820
You posing for the brochure?

242
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:46,232
"The dedicated students
are the very picture of diligence

243
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:49,533
as they strive to meet Hearst's
rigorous academic standards"

244
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:52,480
You're enjoying yourself.
That's great.

245
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,502
- I'm happy for you.
- What's your problem?

246
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:57,160
Nothing...

247
00:13:57,926 --> 00:14:00,222
Just that I'm officially
failing mechanical engineering,

248
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:03,530
Which wouldn't be a problem except
I want to be a mechanical engineer.

249
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:05,881
I've always wanted
to be a mechanical engineer,

250
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,983
And I've never failed anything.

251
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:09,531
You need to chill.

252
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:10,790
I do?

253
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:12,392
Thanks.

254
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:13,580
Good to know.

255
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:16,463
Wasn't it en vogue
who taught us all to free our minds,

256
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:18,023
as the rest would follow?

257
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:20,060
And that means what?

258
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,400
It means we're going out tonight.

259
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:29,030
Mr. O'Dell, it's Keith Mars.
I've got good news.

260
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:31,401
I've located your wife's ex-Husband,

261
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,663
And he's right here
in sunny southern California.

262
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:35,143
How'd you find him?

263
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:36,842
He left a trail of ex-Wives.

264
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:38,030
It led you straight to the corner

265
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:40,510
where he was passing out
flyers dressed as a cellphone?

266
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,473
The manager of his rathole
apartment let me in his place...

267
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:44,483
One bedroom,

268
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:47,833
lots of back stagewests
with auditions circled.

269
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:51,181
Apparently he's scratching out a living
working as a voice-Over actor.

270
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:53,960
I think I've got a plan to arrange a meeting

271
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,162
between you, your wife, and mr. Batando.

272
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:21,080
Hope you don't mind.

273
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:22,952
One  of the cockroaches let me in.

274
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:26,072
So, where'd you stash my necklace?

275
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:34,050
You can let him go. Backup and me...
We're old friends.

276
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:36,410
Where's Lilly's necklace?

277
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:39,210
Someone left a bracelet in my bed last week.

278
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:41,662
Oh, wait, was it a hoop earring?

279
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm not playing with you.

280
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:45,392
Don't you get it? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

281
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:47,921
Oh, you don't, huh? Let me spell it out.

282
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:50,483
I tell you about a working on-Campus casino.

283
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:53,701
Six hours later, it's held up by
a guy your size wearing a mask,

284
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:56,932
who happens to be covered
in a thin film of drywall dust

285
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:58,893
and the stench of drakkar cologne.

286
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,570
My cologne stinks?

287
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:05,252
So, all this play I've been getting
is from pure sex appeal?

288
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:07,170
You just told my classmates

289
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:09,242
that your old life of crime was calling.

290
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:11,430
You just asked me about Lilly's necklace.

291
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:14,792
I can't believe you think
I'd do that... to you...

292
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:16,691
after all we've been through.

293
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:19,940
After all we've been through,
can you really blame me?

294
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,252
Hey, backup, you can stay.

295
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:28,210
Your girl's got to go.

296
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:34,973
It's a wonder you don't have more friends.

297
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,492
I'm here.
Whew!

298
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:43,301
Sorry I'm late. Hi, Cliff.

299
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:44,671
You remember the job?

300
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,361
Pretend to be your receptionist.

301
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:49,271
I just wish I had some
life experience to draw from.

302
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:52,210
Clifford, you ready?

303
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:53,643
Race fans, hot-Rodders,

304
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:57,432
The monster trucks are coming
to Neptune, Neptune, Neptune!

305
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:58,900
That's great, Cliff, but just remember...

306
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:01,261
Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!

307
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:12,250
Certain restrictions may apply.

308
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:13,362
"No video, flash photography,

309
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,702
or other recording devices allowed

310
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:16,060
without the expressed written permission

311
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,092
of the monster truck
association of america.

312
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:19,680
Please drink responsibly"

313
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:25,710
Hi, I'm here for the audition.
Steve Batando.

314
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,033
Great. I'll take your résumé.

315
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:29,163
Sign in. They'll be right with you.

316
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,542
So, Mickey, you book that olive garden gig?

317
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:33,390
Waiting to hear.

318
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:38,213
Yeah.

319
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:41,041
Mickey, they're ready for you.

320
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:44,102
Someone want to take my turn?
I'm still dialing it in.

321
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:46,691
- Go ahead if you want.
- You sure?

322
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:48,382
Great.

323
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:50,201
Over there?

324
00:17:58,325 --> 00:17:59,431
Steve.

325
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:00,771
Welcome.

326
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:03,533
What the...

327
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:06,330
No, no, no, we're not doing this.

328
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:09,831
You can leave in a minute.
First you're gonna listen.

329
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:12,522
Mindy, what the hell
is this about... Alimony?

330
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,631
I mean, is this what you've stooped to?

331
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:16,481
This isn't about money, Steve.

332
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,730
I just needed to talk to you,
and I didn't know any other way.

333
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:20,711
No other way?

334
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:26,912
Jason is dying.

335
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,430
He has bone cancer,

336
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,333
And he needs a bone-marrow transplant.

337
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:36,402
He needs you, Steve.

338
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:37,750
How do you know I'm a match?

339
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,333
From the paternity test.

340
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:41,891
You are a match, thank god.

341
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:43,171
He needs you.

342
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:47,403
Can you do this?
This is your chance, Steve.

343
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,583
You can be his dad again.

344
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:51,623
Do this.

345
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,771
Please.

346
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:58,600
You know something? There was a time
when I could have been around.

347
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,502
I could have been there for Jason,

348
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:02,150
but you kept me away from him.

349
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:04,402
You turned him against me.

350
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:05,700
I did no such thing.

351
00:19:05,785 --> 00:19:08,060
You left me because
I wasn't making enough money.

352
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:10,093
I left you because you were lazy,

353
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:12,152
'cause you wanted everything to come easy.

354
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:14,651
Be careful. Don't forget,
you're asking me a favor.

355
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:15,670
A favor?

356
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,271
Yes, please, Steve, do us a favor

357
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,043
And see if you can act like an actual
human being for three seconds

358
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,890
Out of your otherwise
completely worthless life.

359
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,282
You're going to do this.

360
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:25,922
I don't care if I have to break you in half

361
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:28,152
And suck the marrow
out of your bones myself.

362
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:29,920
You're going to do this for your son.

363
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:32,632
He's not my son.
He's your son.

364
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,643
She made that perfectly clear.

365
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:40,091
No.

366
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:05,083
Hey!
It's Joe College!

367
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:06,421
José Lunchpail...

368
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,740
The living, breathing embodiment
of the american dream.

369
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,592
Punch any clocks lately?

370
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:14,690
Are you lining up your next girlfriend?

371
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:23,343
I'm guessing this lowrider's yours?

372
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,170
Any reason why everyone suspects me

373
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,232
for a crime I don't even
know anything about?

374
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:32,412
Got 'em.

375
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:35,570
They match the robbery description.

376
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:38,471
Yikes.

377
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:42,641
Hey, what do you say we do your
miranda rights in harmony this time?

378
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:43,733
I'll take lead.

379
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:45,182
You take tenor?

380
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,793
Is it so-called déjà vu when
something happens more than twice,

381
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,081
or is that something different?

382
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:51,783
I'll have to look that up.

383
00:20:57,637 --> 00:21:01,172
Ask for cell "B". It has the best light.

384
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,892
Hey, good-looking,
we'll be back to pick you up later.

385
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:23,482
Sacks tells me you're here to see Weevil.

386
00:21:23,737 --> 00:21:25,691
Planning on helping him beat another rap?

387
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,953
Actually, I'm here to get my necklace back.

388
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:33,401
I don't understand. You actually
believe that the bad guy did it?

389
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:38,693
Does not compute.

390
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,583
Does not compute.

391
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:44,290
You must have been fun in the '80s.

392
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:46,900
So,  you get a tip about
the watches in Weevil's car?

393
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:48,842
Better. He used a stolen credit card

394
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:51,060
from one of the wallets lifted
in the casino holdup.

395
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:53,853
Charged a pizza from Mama Mia Pizza.

396
00:21:54,885 --> 00:21:57,843
Criminal mastermind had it
delivered to his own apartment.

397
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:04,793
Be it ever so humble.

398
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:06,253
Yeah.

399
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:08,931
I'm thinking of some curtains over here,

400
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:11,343
Maybe a koi pond in the corner.

401
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:12,731
Where's my necklace?

402
00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:14,122
I don't have it.

403
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:15,970
It was a frame job, "V".

404
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:20,012
Look, a prepaid pizza
was delivered to my apartment.

405
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:21,223
I didn't order it.

406
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:24,641
Come on, what's a working man
gonna do in that situation?

407
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:28,161
So, when I look into this...
And I will look into this...

408
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,351
I'm gonna find out
you didn't order that pizza?

409
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,091
Or you could just save yourself the trouble

410
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:33,742
and take my word for it.

411
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:38,642
Okay.

412
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:41,182
That was good.
Well done.

413
00:22:57,018 --> 00:22:58,470
Surprise.

414
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:01,092
Redenbacher and "The Hills Have Eyes".

415
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:03,452
You remember Chloe
and Jessica from last night.

416
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:04,831
Instant party.

417
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:06,051
You guys, I'm studying.

418
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:08,601
- Study later. Let's have fun.
- Yeah, Wallace.

419
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,932
I can't, y'all.

420
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:12,640
I thought you might say that,
And that's why I brought you this.

421
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:15,572
Call this number.
It's a tutor.

422
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:17,521
- Is he good?
- Miracle worker.

423
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:19,720
Got me through a course last year...
And a hard one.

424
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:20,853
You're a P.E. Major.

425
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:23,390
Please.
Kinesiology.

426
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:26,452
Feeling better already, aren't you?

427
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:31,692
Take the complex map.

428
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,613
Hi, I'm looking for the manager.
He or she around?

429
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:41,911
You're Veronica Mars.

430
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:45,311
And you're... Danny.

431
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,820
Rossow.
Yeah, I am.

432
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:49,722
Cool.

433
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:52,873
You went to my school last year.
I go to Neptune High.

434
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:54,302
Lucky you.

435
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:57,111
You remember when those bikers
taped that guy to the flagpole

436
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:58,820
and you just walked up there
and cut him down?

437
00:23:58,886 --> 00:23:59,982
Yeah.

438
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,820
Remember when you stopped
those guys from blowing up the school?

439
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:05,103
No one was gonna blow up the school.

440
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:06,971
- So, what I was going to...
- On the last day of school,

441
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,531
I really wanted you to sign my yearbook.

442
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:10,883
Danny, I'm working on a case now.

443
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:13,191
That is so awesome.

444
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:17,120
Yeah, it is. It's so awesome,
and I need your help.

445
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:20,432
An order went out last night
to 1172 Navasota.

446
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,511
Do you guys have caller I.D.?

447
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,231
Well, we're totally computerized.

448
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:27,121
The order comes in.
It logs the phone number.

449
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:29,050
That way, we can answer the phone like,

450
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,600
"Mr. Smith, thanks for calling again.

451
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:32,491
Another pepperoni lovers
for you and the missus."

452
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:45,020
1172 Navasota?

453
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,740
It wasn't a call-in.
It was an internet order.

454
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,033
Really?

455
00:24:50,325 --> 00:24:52,760
Any way of knowing where
the order came in from?

456
00:24:52,877 --> 00:24:54,113
Only our manager, mr. Wolfcastle,

457
00:24:54,197 --> 00:24:57,191
Can make those requests from
our internet service provider, and

458
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,033
and he's not here.

459
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:02,643
Any way we can make like he is?

460
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:10,011
Hello, this is Walter Wolfcastle.

461
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:12,051
With who am I speaking?

462
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:16,392
Listen, I need a favor
'cause my hands are full.

463
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:18,730
I need you to track an internet order.

464
00:25:21,468 --> 00:25:22,720
Of course I want it now.

465
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:24,690
What? Should I wait till tuesday?

466
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,551
Thanks to my one-man fan club,

467
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:33,213
I now know precisely which computer
the pizza order was placed from...

468
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:35,330
A public Hearst college computer hub

469
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:38,140
just 40 feet away from
where Weevil was drywalling,

470
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:40,191
so he stays in the mix.

471
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:43,961
Then again, so do hundreds of people
who pass through here every day.

472
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:47,193
Hello, square one.
Nice to see you again.

473
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:54,922
Oh.

474
00:25:56,536 --> 00:25:57,640
Lovely.

475
00:26:05,508 --> 00:26:06,341
Hi.

476
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:11,621
Any idea how this gum got
from your mouth to that chair?

477
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:15,771
I thought this was supposed
to be a good school.

478
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:19,303
Shouldn't you be, like, smart?

479
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,422
So, speaking of down and dirty,

480
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:33,772
You wouldn't believe
the divorce case I've got.

481
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:36,513
Lady stole from her husband repeatedly,

482
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:39,630
stole from his children,
had his dog put to sleep.

483
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,683
And let the record show the dog
was quite surprised by this decision.

484
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,920
The woman slept with... everyone.

485
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:48,573
And let me guess... She's your client.

486
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:54,581
Gentlemen.

487
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:56,570
Is this the one?

488
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:58,152
No, there's your guy.

489
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,731
Can I help you fellas with something?

490
00:26:59,797 --> 00:27:02,401
This is detective Sanchez with the LAPD.

491
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:06,010
Sir, is this your card?

492
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:08,060
Yeah.

493
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,582
You presented yourself as an Adrian Monk,

494
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:12,292
Los Angeles county building inspector?

495
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,442
And I believe that's
your cellphone number written on it?

496
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:15,590
And?

497
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:18,113
Sir, the apartment complex manager
that you handed that to

498
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:19,840
says you ordered him
to let you into the apartment

499
00:27:19,926 --> 00:27:21,290
of Steven Batando.

500
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,913
Ordered? Asked politely maybe.

501
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:30,811
Congratulations, boys. You got me.

502
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:32,321
That's a good one, mr. Mars.

503
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,791
But I'm afraid that impersonating
a county employee

504
00:27:34,877 --> 00:27:36,530
is the least of your problems.

505
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,853
Batando's been missing for 52 hours.

506
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:39,911
Guess what, Keith...

507
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:42,431
You're the leading suspect
in his disappearance.

508
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:55,953
So, mr. Mars, you mind telling us

509
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:57,813
what you were looking for
in mr. Batando's apartment?

510
00:27:57,907 --> 00:27:59,671
The man's girlfriend was worried sick.

511
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:01,601
You should have seen her crying, Keith.

512
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,850
It was heartbreaking.

513
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:06,700
Excuse me, officers,
but if I don't bring up the law,

514
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:08,810
Then this won't be considered
a billable hour.

515
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:10,930
Do you plan on charging my client?

516
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:13,343
Great.

517
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:14,730
If you'd like to talk with him further,

518
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,721
call my office. I'll set an appointment.

519
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:18,891
- My card.
- I know your number.

520
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:20,352
It's all over the bus benches.

521
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,223
"Call Cliff and get off"

522
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:23,702
Plus, it's a radio jingle.

523
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:26,172
Call 555... Wanted?

524
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:27,800
Well, you know the rest.

525
00:28:29,737 --> 00:28:31,590
We'll be keeping an eye on you, mr. Mars.

526
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,813
Nice work, Cliff.

527
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:44,522
When you're here, you're family.

528
00:28:44,945 --> 00:28:46,791
Okay, thank you.

529
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:51,393
Jason O'Dell was discharged yesterday.

530
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:53,580
You think the dean and his wife
kidnapped Batando?

531
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:54,770
It looks that way.

532
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:58,482
They asked him for his bone marrow.
Batando said no.

533
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,642
These things tend to end badly, Keith.

534
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:04,452
There's not much motivation
to keep the unwilling donor alive.

535
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,213
They tend to expire on the operating table.

536
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:09,643
It's tough to press charges
when you're six feet under.

537
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:11,480
I'm gonna track down the O'Dells,

538
00:29:11,756 --> 00:29:13,423
scare the dean if I can find him.

539
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,712
I'm gonna need some help.

540
00:29:14,978 --> 00:29:17,242
You still got your researcher
working for you?

541
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:18,870
Yep. Whatever you need.

542
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:23,920
Oh, you still in town?
You haven't skipped yet?

543
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:26,331
Where's your wife's ex-husband?

544
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:27,801
Where's your stepson?

545
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:29,593
Mexico.

546
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,820
Just got off the phone with my wife.

547
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:33,350
She took Jason to Rosarito.

548
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:34,712
She won't tell me which hospital,

549
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:36,142
but they're moving forward.

550
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:37,461
Mindy's brother is helping her.

551
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:40,640
I'm gonna lose them both, Keith...
My stepson, my wife...

552
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:43,312
All because of that selfish son of a bitch.

553
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:46,102
I'll track them down.

554
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:47,380
I'm going with you.

555
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:48,981
You're gonna need to trace her call, right?

556
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:50,193
Probably, yeah.

557
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:52,060
How do you plan on keeping her on the line?

558
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:53,470
I can say half a sentence

559
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:55,670
and get her to yell at me for three hours.

560
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:04,061
You rang?

561
00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:05,751
If there was anybody else...

562
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:08,780
one of the other maintenance guys
found the masks

563
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:11,060
Used in the holdup
in a dumpster behind Bennis Hall.

564
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:12,613
He found the guns, too.

565
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,152
He came to me instead of going to Lamb

566
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:16,022
'cause he wasn't sure
if it'd hurt me or help me.

567
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,472
I'm not really sure either.

568
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:19,410
I can track the ownership history
of the guns

569
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:20,623
To see where it leads.

570
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:23,832
Yeah, uh, I doubt that's gonna work.

571
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:26,941
The guns aren't real.

572
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:28,401
They're fakes.

573
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,401
Uh, excuse me?

574
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,662
Yeah.

575
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,812
Can someone point me
to the props department?

576
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:44,043
Jenny's props.

577
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:45,073
Where could I find...

578
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,920
I'm jenny. What do you need?

579
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:48,272
Um...

580
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:51,152
someone held up an on-campus casino

581
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:52,702
using a couple of prop guns.

582
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:55,780
We're the theater department.
We don't do guns.

583
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:57,113
We do Molière.

584
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:59,651
You want a poor man's Tarantino,

585
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,473
that would be the film department.

586
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,531
If you see them,

587
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,212
tell them we just loved their
little opening-night present.

588
00:31:05,517 --> 00:31:06,573
Which is?

589
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:08,621
Our stage is covered in pam.

590
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:10,093
Who's pam?

591
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,802
Pam is a cooking spray.

592
00:31:12,227 --> 00:31:15,040
We can't walk out there
without falling on our asses.

593
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,802
We had the temerity
to schedule our opening night

594
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:20,512
on the same weekend
as their short-film festival.

595
00:31:20,636 --> 00:31:23,183
Maybe this is their way
of saying, "break a leg"

596
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:28,040
Thank you! Good night!

597
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,491
Here all week. Try the veal.

598
00:31:29,566 --> 00:31:31,292
And scene.

599
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:43,950
Yeah?

600
00:31:44,177 --> 00:31:46,131
One of the guys
on the team said I should...

601
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,211
Instructor and class.

602
00:31:48,295 --> 00:31:50,130
Winkler. Engineering.

603
00:31:50,495 --> 00:31:52,210
Come in. Close the door.

604
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:59,133
Winkler's used the same exams
for the past three years.

605
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:05,163
This file does not contain the exams.

606
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:06,952
It's a study guide.

607
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,563
If you want the study guide, it's $100.

608
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,283
If you want the answers
to the study guide, it's another $100.

609
00:32:12,595 --> 00:32:14,212
It's a study guide, huh?

610
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:16,922
Yeah, it's $200 for the set.

611
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:19,243
I'll take the guide.

612
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:21,702
You keep the answers.

613
00:32:34,026 --> 00:32:35,220
Find us seats.

614
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:37,852
I'm gonna get us some popcorn
and grill me some film geeks.

615
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:40,552
- Uh, Veronica?
- Yeah?

616
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:43,480
You know that whole
"life imitates art" thing?

617
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:47,421
- You ready to screw 'em, Dick?
- Yeah, cover me, Jimmy.

618
00:32:47,547 --> 00:32:49,320
All right, hands in the air, buddy.

619
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:51,790
Stick 'em up.
Give me the money.

620
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,142
Right now, you see. Right now.

621
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:57,141
And don't forget to vote.

622
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:01,453
Loved your movie.
8 millimeter... Bold choice.

623
00:33:01,637 --> 00:33:02,370
Yeah.

624
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:05,293
So, in other news,
an armed robbery was committed

625
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:07,803
With the masks and guns
used in your little film.

626
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,970
I was hoping you could tell me
where I might find those.

627
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:11,890
You're Logan echolls, right?

628
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,250
I heard you were going here.

629
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:14,882
Did you ever think of investing in...

630
00:33:14,937 --> 00:33:16,152
No.

631
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:18,432
Hey, buddy, right here.

632
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,523
You can schmooze later.

633
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,731
Yeah. The guns and the masks were stolen.

634
00:33:22,136 --> 00:33:23,892
Our whole equipment truck
disappeared a week ago.

635
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:24,743
Did you report it?

636
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:27,372
Yeah, the campus police
actually tracked it down.

637
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:29,261
Can you believe it? Rent-A-Cops.

638
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:31,212
We got all our equipment back.

639
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,371
Only thing missing were
the guns and the masks.

640
00:33:57,887 --> 00:33:58,760
Call her again.

641
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:01,171
It's not gonna work.

642
00:34:01,317 --> 00:34:03,271
Mindy's not gonna pick up the phone.

643
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:04,600
And I'm no expert,

644
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:06,961
but I'm pretty sure
you can't trace a phone call

645
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:10,293
if the person on the other end
won't pick up the phone.

646
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:13,481
Cliff?

647
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:21,633
Thanks, Cliff.

648
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:26,872
You've got him at
Sisters of Mercy in San Diego.

649
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:29,022
Mindy's uncle's an oncologist there.

650
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:33,193
Do you expect me to apologize,
Keith? He's my son.

651
00:34:33,468 --> 00:34:35,852
How'd you get Batando admitted?
You bring him in unconscious?

652
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,681
What choice did he leave us?

653
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:24,983
Who are you?

654
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,582
Come on, you remember me.

655
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:29,493
I'm the girl whose necklace you stole.

656
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,241
It's got sentimental value. I want it back.

657
00:35:32,327 --> 00:35:33,121
I see.

658
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:36,002
I'll take two boxes of the thin mints

659
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:37,322
and some lemon coolers.

660
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:40,892
You can keep all the gambling money,
everything else. I don't care.

661
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:44,063
Just give me my necklace back,
and we'll be cool.

662
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:46,401
Wow, that's some hardcore salesmanship.

663
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,702
You're good. Uh...

664
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:51,440
Tell you what...
Throw in a box of the shortbread.

665
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:53,270
You and your partner robbed the casino.

666
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:55,932
You did all the talking
because of Sasaki's accent.

667
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,851
As security officers,

668
00:35:57,936 --> 00:36:00,851
The criminal records
of all new employees cross your desk.

669
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:04,773
You decide to pin your crime on
the new ex-con maintenance guy

670
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:06,973
you see every day just outside your office.

671
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:09,593
This also explains why
you were covered in drywall dust.

672
00:36:10,397 --> 00:36:11,921
You knew about the casino.

673
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:13,782
You even tried to shut it down
a couple times,

674
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:16,990
but those spoiled college boys
didn't listen to you.

675
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:19,680
I'm guessing you got the idea
when you found the masks

676
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:22,121
and prop guns in the film-department van.

677
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:24,791
Do you think I missed anything?

678
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:28,021
Well, one thing... Proof.

679
00:36:28,298 --> 00:36:32,653
Not quite true.
Look what I have.

680
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:34,020
Prints?

681
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:36,701
The witnesses said
the holdup men wore gloves.

682
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:41,071
Yeah, but you wouldn't believe how much hair
Is inside these masks.

683
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:42,641
It's kind of gross, actually.

684
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:44,443
It's like a sack of dna.

685
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:47,771
So, I'll trade you...
This bag for my necklace.

686
00:36:56,058 --> 00:36:58,953
I'll need a day to get your necklace back.

687
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:01,341
Yeah, that's not gonna do it.

688
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:06,373
What did you do?

689
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:11,841
Say hello to my little friend.

690
00:37:18,577 --> 00:37:19,950
Keith, please, I'm begging you.

691
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:22,431
Keith, for god's sake, just hear me out.

692
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:23,901
I've been hearing you out since Mexico.

693
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,910
I'm done, Cyrus. This game is over.

694
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,993
It's not a game. You need me to get
on my knees, I'll get on my knees.

695
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:31,343
You stop that operation, that's it.

696
00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:33,152
My son's dead. He's 9 years old.

697
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:34,660
You go up there, he dies.

698
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:37,552
If I stay down here, I'm partly responsible
for another dead man.

699
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:40,843
The only way you and your wife
get away with this is if Batando dies.

700
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:44,571
We're not gonna let Batando die.

701
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:46,340
That's not the plan, I swear.

702
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:49,001
Then you, your wife, and your wife's
family members who helped

703
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:50,680
are going to prison for a very long time.

704
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:52,613
And Jason will live.

705
00:37:52,697 --> 00:37:54,743
Small price to pay, don't you think?

706
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:58,683
What would you do if it were Veronica?

707
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,063
Find my necklace?

708
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,051
Nope.

709
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:08,892
But we found a dozen other items...

710
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:11,603
Couple rolexes, dozens of credit cards.

711
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:13,242
These are the guys.

712
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:15,083
Maybe the other one has your necklace.

713
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:16,901
We have a car on the way
over there right now.

714
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:19,181
Oh, look.

715
00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:21,670
Someone tipped off the local news.

716
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,253
That's my cue.

717
00:38:24,105 --> 00:38:27,803
Do you see how well this works
when you play by the rules, Veronica?

718
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:39,001
<i>[Johnny Clash - Busted]
My bills are all due</i>

719
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:41,242
<i>And the babies need shoes</i>

720
00:38:41,315 --> 00:38:42,581
<i>But I'm busted</i>

721
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:48,000
<i>Cotton is down</i>

722
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:50,053
<i>To a quarter a pound</i>

723
00:38:50,157 --> 00:38:51,690
<i>And I'm busted</i>

724
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:56,700
<i>I got a cow that went dry</i>

725
00:38:56,845 --> 00:38:58,992
<i>And a hen that won't lay</i>

726
00:38:59,118 --> 00:39:01,000
<i>A big stack of bills...</i>

727
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,141
you think you're such
a big deal, but you're so not.

728
00:39:03,297 --> 00:39:05,441
You did this. You set up my daddy,
you stupid cow.

729
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:07,040
Go back to Hearst where you belong.

730
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:09,500
You come into this town
and treat everyone like dirt.

731
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:19,090
<i>The food that we canned</i>

732
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:21,171
<i>Last summer is gone</i>

733
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:22,793
<i>And I'm busted</i>

734
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:28,023
<i>The fields are all bare</i>

735
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:30,101
<i>And the cotton won't grow</i>

736
00:39:30,865 --> 00:39:32,633
<i>Me and my family</i>

737
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:34,403
<i>Got to pack up and go</i>

738
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,733
<i>Where I'll make a living</i>

739
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:38,943
<i>The Lord only know</i>

740
00:39:39,186 --> 00:39:40,700
<i>But I'm busted</i>

741
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:46,540
Don?

742
00:39:46,966 --> 00:39:49,832
Meet Steve Batando.
I believe you were looking for him.

743
00:39:51,616 --> 00:39:52,903
You're Steven Batando?

744
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:56,372
And I want to apologize
for causing so much trouble.

745
00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:58,630
I mean, I had no idea people
were looking for me.

746
00:39:58,747 --> 00:40:02,802
I just went, you know, camping for
a week and didn't tell anybody,

747
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:04,013
left my cellphone.

748
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,993
I mean, I can't believe
I caused all this fuss.

749
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:11,073
It would be funny if it wasn't so almost,
I mean, you know...

750
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:13,312
Ridiculous?

751
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:15,041
Yeah.

752
00:40:20,746 --> 00:40:23,271
You tell my ex-Wife I own her now.

753
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:26,902
No more talk of alimony,
no more child support.

754
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,240
We're beyond even.

755
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:32,773
It's been made very clear
in the documents you signed.

756
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:34,662
Nice ride, huh?

757
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:36,652
Think of it as a father's day gift.

758
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,241
What makes you think this is the guy?

759
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:13,371
The fifth victim, Claire,

760
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:15,900
Was caught in an ATM photo
the night she was raped,

761
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:18,960
Clearly already roofied,
but still with her hair.

762
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:20,611
She was with an asian guy.

763
00:41:21,928 --> 00:41:24,821
So we're knocking on the doors
of every asian guy in san diego?

764
00:41:25,097 --> 00:41:26,960
This guy was wearing a camp waterloo shirt.

765
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,483
I got a list of everyone who went
to the camp in the past five years.

766
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:32,101
There's only one asian male
in southern california.

767
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:33,841
This is his house.

768
00:41:34,755 --> 00:41:35,640
Look tough.

769
00:41:35,735 --> 00:41:36,990
Always.

770
00:41:38,756 --> 00:41:40,543
Hi, is Wang Yi here?

771
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:41,991
Sorry, he's at class now.

772
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:43,191
When will he be back?

773
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:44,620
Why?

774
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:48,350
Because he raped this girl.

775
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:49,473
Claire?

776
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:50,512
I doubt it.

777
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:51,611
You know her?

778
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:53,433
Yeah, she's Wang's girlfriend.

779
00:42:00,075 --> 00:42:02,570
