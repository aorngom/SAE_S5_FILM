1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,616
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:02,962
Dean O'Dell's wife...

3
00:00:02,963 --> 00:00:06,065
is cheating on him with Dr. Landry,
my criminology professor.

4
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:07,252
Are you gonna tell him?

5
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,304
You know the rules, honey. I have to.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,449
Shrink asked if a lifetime without
a libido was such a bad thing.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,955
I think she's given up on me.

8
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:18,141
You just need more time.

9
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:21,469
And I think we can take a tough
but survivable amount of pain now...

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,797
Or stay together and deal
with unbearable pain later.

11
00:00:24,798 --> 00:00:26,552
So, I vote for the pain now.

12
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:34,329
You should hire
someone to do this.

13
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,522
Hey, you're lucky I'm not a farmer.

14
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:38,385
You'd be out ploughing a field.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,436
What is manila anyway?

16
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:41,437
I don't know.

17
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:44,676
Is it a substance, a colour maybe?

18
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,016
"In the kitchen,
we'll do a nice manila."

19
00:00:47,337 --> 00:00:50,580
I'd say more like,
"by the time we dug him up,

20
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,065
he turned manila."

21
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,564
Don't you have to get to class?

22
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:55,855
On my way.

23
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:59,723
Oh, and Wikipedia says:
"Not a what, but a where,

24
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:02,772
called 'manila' after hemp
from the Philippines."

25
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,042
Oh.

26
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,268
Good Morning.

27
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:10,971
Guess that would explain why
this filing was giving me a killer buzz.

28
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:13,329
Oh.

29
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,183
Can I help you, Mrs. O'Dell?

30
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:18,137
I hope so, Mr. Mars.

31
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,865
Please, come in.

32
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:28,860
My husband didn't kill himself.

33
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:30,950
What makes you think that?

34
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:33,178
Because I know my husband.

35
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:35,290
Mrs. O'Dell, I saw him that night.

36
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,397
He had just learned of your infidelity.
He was drinking heavily.

37
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,431
Well, it was in him to sulk,

38
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:42,274
to divorce me, even, but...

39
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:45,707
he would never in a million
years kill himself over me.

40
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,804
The sheriff ruled it a
suicide six weeks ago.

41
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:48,805
Why come to me now?

42
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,025
Honestly? Money.

43
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:53,524
As his death was ruled a suicide,

44
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:56,384
his life insurance is denying benefits.

45
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm a widow with two
children to take care of.

46
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:02,791
You told Mr. O'Dell you were at a junior
league meeting the night he died.

47
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,624
Are you asking for my alibi?

48
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,292
If it is a murder, you'll be
asked for it repeatedly.

49
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,988
Your husband implied that...

50
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,337
your junior league nights were
a cover for your affair with...

51
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:13,647
Professor Landry.

52
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:15,634
I was with Hank...

53
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,227
all night.

54
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:19,680
Look, I didn't kill Cyrus, Keith.

55
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,553
Niether did Hank Landry.

56
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,414
But someone did.

57
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:27,361
Well, let me dig around.
If I find anything, I'll take the case.

58
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:28,841
Thank you.

59
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:41,398
Wow, this is one trashed lab.

60
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:44,216
All that's missing is a big hole
in the wall shaped like the Hulk

61
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:47,932
Somebody called tech support?

62
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,057
I did.

63
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,481
We had a break-in.

64
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:54,410
Our computer was sabotaged,
and it's dead.

65
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:57,658
There's a year's worth of
research on that hard drive.

66
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,432
Our professor will have med
students practicing autopsies on us.

67
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:04,412
Professor McGregor has to
understand it's not our fault.

68
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:07,682
I locked up, Pauline.

69
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:09,260
Do you have a backup?

70
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,097
Yeah. He's gone, too.

71
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:13,303
Your backup's a he?

72
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:15,741
Twenty-five, our research monkey.

73
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:18,549
He is the research.

74
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,835
Even if you save the hard drive, without
Twenty-five, the whole project is dead.

75
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:24,880
And we'll be dead, too,
if McGregor finds out we lost him.

76
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:29,475
Who do you go to, to find a stolen
monkey and twenty control-group rats?

77
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:34,914
Logan Echolls, don't you get it?

78
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,928
Ex-boyfriend.
That's your new title.

79
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:40,125
It comes with certain restrictions.

80
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:41,918
This is my Food Court time.

81
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,652
You're not a breakfast person.
You're not even an early-lunch kind of guy.

82
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:48,550
Can't we just agree
this is Veronica time?

83
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:49,478
- Veronica!
- Mac!

84
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:52,484
And the people coming
to take me away.

85
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:56,275
Veronica Mars, Pauline Elliott
and Gil Thomas Pardy.

86
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:58,317
They're missing a monkey.

87
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,745
And twenty rats.

88
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:03,398
- We're talking "monkey" as in...
- "Touch my..."

89
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,103
It's not just any monkey.

90
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:07,039
Please tell me he plays piano.

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,643
Twenty-five is a genetically
altered capuchin monkey.

92
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:11,665
Its uptake-inhibitor proteins
have been coded...

93
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,520
to allow us to monitor cholesterol
breakdown at a cellular level.

94
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:17,973
And he can play "Chopsticks."

95
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,286
Excellent.

96
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,844
Any idea who would want to nab...

97
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:26,582
Um, what's his name again?

98
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,711
It's not a pet.

99
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:31,214
We don't name them or wrap
squeaky toys up for Christmas.

100
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:33,260
His research ID number is twenty-five.

101
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:35,183
Yes, I know exactly who stole him.

102
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:36,721
It was those damn fat kids.

103
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:38,891
Because, I take it,
monkeys are delicious?

104
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:40,071
And, dude...

105
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,865
"girth-challenged" is the
preferred nomenclature.

106
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,488
P-H-A-T: People for
Humane Animal Treatment.

107
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:47,900
They've done this kind of crap before.

108
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,555
They liberated him...

109
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,822
and took a year's worth
of research in the process.

110
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:55,667
Please, this is our future.

111
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:58,351
We need that monkey back.

112
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:03,438
Veronica Mars

113
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,439
3X10 "Show me the monkey"

114
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Transcript: Inigo [vmtranscripts.com]
Synchro: Camilla [veronicamars.it]

115
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:24,344
Vieni a trovarci!

116
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:28,345
veronicamars.it

117
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,313
I just can't wait for that moment
when you're in a tree, going...

118
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:36,317
"here, monkey, monkey,"
and holding out a banana,

119
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:39,037
and then the branch breaks
and hilarity ensues.

120
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,362
Ah, if there's hilarity, I charge extra.

121
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:43,983
Think you can salvage
anything off their hard drive?

122
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:46,418
Iffy. Looks like someone
poured something on it.

123
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:47,319
Aha!

124
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,497
You've solved the case.

125
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,173
PHAT is having a
recruitment meeting tonight.

126
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:53,233
Square one.

127
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:54,986
Want some company?

128
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:56,749
What?

129
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,267
This soft spot here...

130
00:05:58,268 --> 00:05:59,444
It's for all creatures,
great and small.

131
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,288
Okay, the more, the merrier.

132
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,243
All we need is one more angel,
and we've got a show.

133
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:06,298
I'll come by your room.
Dress cruelty-free.

134
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,455
We want to blend.

135
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,311
Got it. Off to class.

136
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:17,140
- Hi!
- Hi.

137
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,938
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

138
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,154
I need to find Weevil.

139
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:21,683
You two palling around now?

140
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:23,375
I need to ask him some questions.

141
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:26,214
Mindy O'Dell doesn't think
her husband killed himself,

142
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:27,615
and Weevil found the body, so...

143
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,480
You think Dean O'Dell was murdered?

144
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:30,953
Uh-uh. Not really.

145
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:34,061
I think he had his heart
broken and shot himself.

146
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:36,800
I suspect his wife feels a
tremendous amount of guilt.

147
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:37,888
So why take the case?

148
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,419
I haven't yet. I'm checking it out.

149
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:42,091
Physical plant after 6:00.

150
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,495
How did you find me?
My cell phone is not on.

151
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:47,006
Maybe I'll tell you someday.

152
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:51,356
According to the PHAT website...

153
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:54,144
we should stay away from fur, obviously,

154
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,519
down, leather...

155
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,078
The one day I feel like
wearing a leather miniskirt.

156
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:02,562
If it ever had a face or parents,
you can't wear it.

157
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:04,389
So my mollusc shoes are cool?

158
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,511
Oh, does this say "cruelty-free"?

159
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:09,270
It says...

160
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:10,923
"I've given up.

161
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,154
Don't look at me."

162
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,246
Hey!

163
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,774
You guys haven't
picked a country yet.

164
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:19,662
For the around-the-world party.

165
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:22,958
Every dorm room dresses itself
up like a different country.

166
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,739
Party, fun?

167
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:26,718
No?

168
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,333
I prefer most of the people on the floor,

169
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,369
you know, not in my room.

170
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,370
Okay.

171
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:34,474
well, if you change your mind,
let me know soon.

172
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,494
Most of Western Europe goes down fast.

173
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,331
Single.

174
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:43,585
Single and on the rebound.

175
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:45,210
Just so you know,

176
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,931
we're approaching critical,
pathetic mass...

177
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:50,753
if the girl who most wants
to host gentlemen callers...

178
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:53,535
is the most recent victim
of a sexual assault.

179
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,482
We should be out there!

180
00:07:57,004 --> 00:08:00,304
Or, at the very least, not barring
them from coming to us.

181
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:06,975
Okay.

182
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:09,220
I get cruelty-free,
but I'm an animal, too,

183
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,289
and the clove cigarettes and
no-bathing thing is cruelty to me.

184
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,257
Oh. No. Not you.

185
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:17,181
You're... fine!

186
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:20,095
You guys ever been to one
of these things before?

187
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:23,962
Me? No. I come from a
meat-and-potatoes kind of family,

188
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,207
minus the potatoes.

189
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,979
My first pacifier was made of jerky.

190
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,202
Well, it, uh, it could be fun.

191
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:33,856
Or it could be a lot of speechmaking
by politicos-in-training.

192
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:36,141
Or that.

193
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:40,661
My name is Bronson Pope.

194
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,565
I'm the chapter president
of PHAT here at Hearst.

195
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:48,163
I'd like to thank everyone
for coming out.

196
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,261
From food industries to clothing
to medical research,

197
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:57,541
corporate America employs
horrible cruelty to animals,

198
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,911
simply to maximize profit.

199
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:03,921
It's a tragic state of affairs
that we fight with education.

200
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:06,539
People who disagree aren't the enemy.

201
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,704
They're the goal.

202
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:10,554
Yeah?

203
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:14,093
This is in addition to some
of the more active stuff?

204
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:16,126
There was a rumour that someone...

205
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:17,758
liberated some research animals.

206
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,836
I was just wondering if...

207
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:21,917
we'd be doing anything like that.

208
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:23,906
What? I raised my hand.

209
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:26,103
That's really not our thing,

210
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:28,007
but if you're eager for action...

211
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,832
how about joining us tomorrow night
to launch our letter-writing campaign?

212
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,317
Sure. That sounds almost as good.

213
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:37,086
You know, Bronson, that psycho
bow-hunting rocker guy Ed Argent...

214
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:39,000
is playing downtown tomorrow night.

215
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:41,124
We should consider picketing the show.

216
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,065
You ever meet an Argent fan, Darla?

217
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,888
Uh, they'd pay double
to spit on our picket line.

218
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:50,805
So, I came in at around seven.

219
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,414
First, I thought he just...

220
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:54,504
had a bender and fell asleep at his desk,

221
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:57,225
but then I saw blood...
and the note.

222
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,767
A note?

223
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,111
Yeah, on the computer.

224
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:02,189
He had a memo on the screen, saying...

225
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,598
"Goodbye, cruel world zzzz."

226
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,599
I guess his head fell on the Z.

227
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,798
It's a shame, man.

228
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,116
He was pretty cool...

229
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:14,031
for a weird...

230
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:15,149
old

231
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,372
white dude.

232
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,913
So, uh, what?

233
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:22,350
You just wanted to
see if he left any booze?

234
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,676
I think I told you, the management
asked if you'd stop doing that.

235
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,135
That's exactly what's been
wrong with you lately.

236
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:49,196
Since when do you
side with management?

237
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,805
Ooh, best-case scenario:

238
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:54,052
old lady.

239
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:58,479
What's with you?
That is awesome!

240
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,210
How about a little life?

241
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,302
So what, you're just going to
mope around like that guy in...

242
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:03,962
what's that book where
the guy's mom dies...

243
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,676
and he comes back to Jersey?

244
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,651
He's got that motorcycle sidecar.

245
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:09,495
Garden State was never a book.

246
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:11,962
It wasn't? Oops.

247
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,763
So much for that paper.

248
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:15,885
But if this were a book...

249
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:18,128
the theme of my essay would be...

250
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,204
the symbolism of how your character...

251
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,677
had his man parts ripped off by
the Veronica Mars character.

252
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,418
My man parts are intact.

253
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,516
Show me.

254
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:28,021
Well, you'll have to take my word for it.

255
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,579
I mean, symbolically.

256
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,199
We're young, single men
in our sexual prime...

257
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,715
and the only reason why we're
not out there going hog-wild...

258
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:36,340
is because of your feelings?

259
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:38,816
What, are we on "The View"?
Am I Rosie O'Donnell?

260
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,779
Here's something I read.

261
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,326
"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life."

262
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:47,184
Think about that.

263
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:49,863
Really, think about it.

264
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:52,346
Yeah, well, as a statement,
it seems, you know,

265
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:54,377
obvious and pointless.

266
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:57,006
Which means...
that's what your life is.

267
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,798
You need help. I'm offering, okay?

268
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,296
Nothing too major, just baby steps.

269
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:05,371
Just, please, let me help you.

270
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:13,947
Hey!

271
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:15,939
Thanks for coming.

272
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,262
Um, lick or stuff?

273
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:19,764
Letters are there,

274
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:21,108
envelopes there.

275
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,898
You know, this is what it's all about.

276
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,749
Yeah, if people knew that
every research animal...

277
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,609
on campus is caged, tested, and killed,

278
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:30,002
you know, they might not
be here in the first place.

279
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:32,180
Every research animal?

280
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:34,850
Yeah, that's why this is so important.

281
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:37,279
Well, I'd like to stuff.

282
00:12:38,147 --> 00:12:39,475
Okay, come on.

283
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:42,985
Darla, hi.

284
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:44,343
I'm Veronica.

285
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:47,954
I think your idea to
protest Argent was great.

286
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:49,764
If you go through with it, I'm in.

287
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:51,548
I do a wicked picket.

288
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:55,825
Look, I know letter
writing isn't all you do.

289
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:57,998
You got to be careful with
new members. I get it.

290
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,445
But, just so you know, I'm ready.

291
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,252
Good to know.

292
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:08,691
Your friend seems pretty gung ho.

293
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,091
Veronica?

294
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:11,666
She played pee wee soccer;

295
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,732
she made her own penalty cards so
she could red-card players she didn't like.

296
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,762
I'm glad you guys came.

297
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,564
I don't usually have much fun at these.

298
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:23,369
The letter stuff seems fun.

299
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:26,946
Do me a favour.

300
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,689
Casually look over there.

301
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:35,798
What?

302
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,045
How's it going?

303
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,089
Great!

304
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,119
Maybe we should throw in some
low-interest credit-card apps,

305
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,814
really grab their attention.

306
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:47,556
Yeah...

307
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:50,231
letter writing's good, but...

308
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,759
uh, some of us aren't so patient.

309
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,973
Some of us want to get the
message out a little more...

310
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:56,009
actively.

311
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,323
If you're interested, maybe
you can prove yourself.

312
00:13:58,324 --> 00:14:00,154
What do you have in mind?

313
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:02,969
Just something that gets our attention.

314
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,691
Surprise us.

315
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:15,594
You look sad.

316
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:20,505
You and your friend Weevil
have a fight or something?

317
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,522
Just thinking, if I was going to
get drunk and shoot myself,

318
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:25,831
I'd probably drink the good stuff first.

319
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:27,642
Sheesh.

320
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:30,112
Good thing we don't
have any good stuff.

321
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,486
Dean O'Dell did,

322
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:33,994
a bottle of forty-year-old single malt.

323
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:36,656
Said he lived in
anticipation of drinking it.

324
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:38,694
So why, if he's going
to commit suicide...

325
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:41,853
does he drink the
cheap stuff instead?

326
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:45,688
You had a few run-ins
with the dean, right?

327
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:47,148
What were your impressions of the man?

328
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:50,040
I... admired him.

329
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,047
He had character...

330
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:55,050
or was one, or something.

331
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,051
I don't know, just...

332
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,404
How 'bout his rhetorical style?

333
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:00,294
Businesslike and bland?

334
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:03,907
More... Old Testament sarcastic.

335
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:05,251
Sarcastic?

336
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:08,673
Like he might leave a dumb
cliché as a note, as a joke?

337
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,697
What did the note say?

338
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:12,759
"Goodbye, cruel world,"
typed as a memo.

339
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,385
Like on the computer screen?

340
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:16,558
Yeah, why?

341
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,665
Just...

342
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,568
We had to do these
papers for Landry's class,

343
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,606
like plan the perfect murder.

344
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:24,640
I got an A, just in case
you were wondering.

345
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:25,546
And what does this-

346
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:27,103
Mine was a fake suicide,

347
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:31,341
where you leave a note on the computer,
so you can't check the handwriting,

348
00:15:31,342 --> 00:15:34,814
and write something clichéd so
you don't study the message.

349
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:37,376
My example was:

350
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,815
"Goodbye, cruel world."

351
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,209
Hey Piz!

352
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,695
Ed Argent is in town.

353
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:54,331
Think you can pull some of that...

354
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:59,291
Oregon-mountain-man, kill-what-you-eat,
gun-rack charm and book him on your show?

355
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:02,289
Everything north of San Francisco...

356
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,383
is just Thunderdome to you, isn't it?

357
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:05,517
It's for a case...

358
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:07,933
involving... a missing monkey.

359
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,391
The case of the missing monkey?

360
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:12,703
Mm-hmm. You'd be helping science and me,

361
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:14,400
and you might help...

362
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:16,833
classic rocker and conservative
wild man Ed Argent...

363
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,312
connect with a whole new audience.

364
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:19,573
So everybody wins,

365
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:21,065
which is nice.

366
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:22,210
That is nice.

367
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:25,144
So, how is Ed Argent connected
to the missing monkey again?

368
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,523
I didn't say, and I can't.
Client privilege.

369
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:30,189
You'd be doing me a favour
I'd really appreciate.

370
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:32,591
Look.

371
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,731
Twenty-five's food is gone.

372
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:36,295
It was here after the break-in,
and now it's gone.

373
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:39,525
Obviously, those PHAT fanatics
are trying to take care of him.

374
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:41,522
What did you find out?

375
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:43,297
There might be a splinter cell.

376
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:45,402
I'm setting something
up to get inside.

377
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:50,057
So, what happens to Twenty-five...

378
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:51,875
after you complete your research?

379
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:55,309
The only way to conclusively prove
test results is through an autopsy.

380
00:16:55,952 --> 00:17:00,085
So... that monkey good life includes...

381
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,855
a blindfold and a last smoke?

382
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,284
You sound like one of them.

383
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:05,731
It's just a question.

384
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:08,260
Ah, a question like, how
do we cure cancer...

385
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,883
or discover new vaccines?

386
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:14,187
You've got the A/C on full.

387
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:16,273
If you want to see my nipples, just ask.

388
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,023
How many times do I have to say,

389
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:21,016
"temperature affects rates
of carbon assimilation"?

390
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,351
I don't know, Emmy, a billion?

391
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:28,081
Friend of yours?

392
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:32,380
I was in my lab until around nine,

393
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:35,577
locked up. Didn't see anything
suspicious and went home.

394
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:37,702
I already talked to campus police.

395
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:41,253
I'm sure you did all you could
to help your pal Pauline.

396
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:43,705
They have twice the space I have.

397
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:44,637
For what?

398
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:47,769
To find a pill so fat guys in the suburbs
can keep eating cheeseburgers.

399
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,035
It's ridiculous.

400
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:53,637
Look, I may not love
Pauline and Gil Thomas,

401
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,165
but I'm a scientist.

402
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,196
I'd never vandalise a lab.

403
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:58,297
Ever.

404
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:02,790
Hey, that was awesome, man. Thanks a lot.

405
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,908
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

406
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:08,334
I am your biggest... super biggest fan.

407
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:10,570
I joined the NRA...

408
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:12,553
after they covered
you in Guns Magazine.

409
00:18:12,554 --> 00:18:14,761
Oh, I loved that article.

410
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,692
Totally.

411
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:19,288
The second amendment is, like...

412
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:20,457
my favourite.

413
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,193
We were so hoping...

414
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,682
to get a picture of you
in our sweatshirt...

415
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:26,424
for our celebrity wall.

416
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:27,919
Anything for a fan.

417
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,502
Awesome.

418
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:39,802
Maybe, after the show,
I could stop by the sorority.

419
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:43,668
Ooh, I think the Theta Betas
would really enjoy that.

420
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:47,033
Okay, say "meat!"

421
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:48,478
Meat!

422
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:50,805
Meat is Murder

423
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:54,679
Hey! Look at this.

424
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,972
"Argent tells KRFF listeners:
rock hard, eat what you kill"

425
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:58,919
Tell your friend you guys are in.

426
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,207
Three o'clock, that room.

427
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,608
Great, you're here. Come in.

428
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:11,801
I've never been initiated before.
Think I'll get a code name?

429
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:15,848
We really loved what you did, and we want
you to join our anti-fur campaign.

430
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,073
Congratulations.

431
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,452
You're one of us.

432
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:21,950
NO FUR

433
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:24,475
We have a lot of work to do,
so just go ahead and take 'em off.

434
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:27,427
Uh, take what off?

435
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:28,736
Your clothes...

436
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:29,861
for the calendar.

437
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:32,411
You are committed, right?

438
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,019
It's an ongoing question
in the private-eye game:

439
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,542
"how naked are you willing
to get for a case?"

440
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:50,753
This campaign epitomises what we're about.

441
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,470
Oh, yeah, totally, but-

442
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:55,436
We know you guys believe in the cause...

443
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:58,025
that fur is the unnecessary
killing of animals...

444
00:19:58,026 --> 00:19:59,985
for nothing more than human vanity.

445
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:01,812
So, you want to pose together?

446
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:08,875
Oh yes!

447
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:11,670
Sorry.

448
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:13,553
We do this to all the
real gung-ho recruits.

449
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,016
But we totally love you guys.

450
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:16,687
That Ed Argent thing was genius.

451
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:19,459
So...

452
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,826
Some of us are going to grab a bite,

453
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:22,882
if you want to come along.

454
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:25,043
I'm good. I had some mints.

455
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:28,825
So...

456
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,352
you have any plans this weekend?

457
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:33,085
We have that around-the-world
party tonight, remember?

458
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,190
You should come.

459
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,495
Every room is a country.

460
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:37,527
Very educational.

461
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,859
Yeah, great.

462
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,041
Uh, what country are you guys?

463
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:44,061
Bella! Bella!

464
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:46,018
Ciao.

465
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:50,299
I love your enthusiasm. Love it.

466
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:58,200
Ooh, caliente!

467
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,917
So, you're participating now?

468
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:10,800
What about this is Canada?

469
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:14,476
Uh, our accents. Eh?

470
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:18,680
And I almost forgot aboot...

471
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:20,790
[One Week - The Barenaked Ladies]

472
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,040
It's been one week
since you looked at me...

473
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,099
cocked your head to the
side and said I'm angry.

474
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:24,913
There you go.

475
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:25,914
Five days since you laughed at me...

476
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:27,023
It's ok.

477
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,303
saying get that together
come back and see me.

478
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:30,719
I'm confused.

479
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,853
I thought you were against
the whole party idea.

480
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:35,289
We were. And then...

481
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,496
"The guy" happened.

482
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,284
- Ooh!
- No.

483
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:42,787
In a way. I don't know.

484
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:45,635
Somebody was doe-eyed,

485
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:48,857
tongue-tied, and, dare
I say, twitterpated?

486
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:51,314
Hey, there's enough guys for everyone.

487
00:21:51,615 --> 00:21:53,222
Maybe Piz will show up.

488
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:55,636
Ugh. God, I'm so over that.

489
00:21:55,637 --> 00:21:57,382
I don't know what his problem is.

490
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,674
I think he has a girlfriend back home.

491
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:00,989
It's a new day.

492
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,439
No more games, no more waiting around.

493
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,795
I'm ready to be wooed!

494
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:06,161
Amen, sister!

495
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:10,573
That was supporting, not joining.
I do not want to be wooed.

496
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:12,644
Don't you want to hear all
about how great you are?

497
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,280
I mean, don't you want to see...

498
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:17,569
the look on some cute guy's face...

499
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,397
when he realizes that
you're not only smokin'-hot...

500
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:22,298
but funny and smart?

501
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,787
Why, you're the catch of
the century, Veronica Mars...

502
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:26,544
And so are you.

503
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,463
Are you saying we ought to...

504
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:31,061
Mingle?

505
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:34,386
I'm saying there's a saddle, Veronica,

506
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,686
and we should be back in it.

507
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,752
It's just hard when you know
you've tried your best.

508
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:47,645
You know?

509
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:48,646
I do.

510
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:50,573
It's a bitch.

511
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:52,926
I really wanted that
relationship to work.

512
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:54,769
I was committed,

513
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,770
which is hard for me.

514
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:58,554
Think I should call her?

515
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,994
Can you excuse me for just one sec?

516
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,422
So, how's it going?

517
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:10,475
I'm trying to keep an open mind.

518
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:11,435
And you?

519
00:23:11,436 --> 00:23:15,386
I think I've been around the world,
and I want my room back.

520
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:17,419
This just isn't my scene.

521
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:21,856
Can you manage Ultimate
Boy Quest 2007 solo?

522
00:23:21,857 --> 00:23:23,374
He didn't show.

523
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,614
Okay, everybody,

524
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,193
Canada is closing! Sorry.

525
00:23:30,194 --> 00:23:31,890
Border-control issues.

526
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,891
Sorry.

527
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:40,700
So, what do you do,

528
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:42,256
like, for fun?

529
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,131
Um... I don't really know.

530
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:48,241
You play any sports or anything?

531
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:49,433
Nope.

532
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:51,556
So you just, like, hang out?

533
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:53,218
Not really. I...

534
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:55,238
my hobby is...

535
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,327
more like a job...

536
00:23:57,328 --> 00:24:00,315
Which is kind of like a compulsion.

537
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,084
But it's fun sometimes.

538
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:04,826
It doesn't really leave time
for what most people consider...

539
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:16,428
Mac? There's someone here to see you.

540
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:19,660
Oh.

541
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:21,439
Hey.

542
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,422
Hey.

543
00:24:22,423 --> 00:24:24,296
I checked his ID at the border,

544
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,762
and all seems on the up-and-up.

545
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,648
So, how's it going?

546
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:39,722
I'd say it's boys zero, me zero!

547
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:40,851
Think I'm calling it.

548
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:42,882
Well, we can't go back to Canada.

549
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,835
"The guy" showed up an hour ago.

550
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,112
Sorry I've got to go so soon, but...

551
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:53,671
That's why I wasn't
doing much activism.

552
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,388
Cuts into my partying.

553
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:58,492
You should have seen me
before I quit Greenpeace...

554
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:00,034
and the Sierra Club.

555
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:02,796
Jeez, why are you so down
on people raping the planet?

556
00:25:02,797 --> 00:25:03,785
I mean, really.

557
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:04,786
Yeah.

558
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:06,946
Well, thanks for showing me Canada.

559
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:07,922
Sure.

560
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:11,186
Sorry.

561
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:12,933
- Um, I...
- No, it's...

562
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,102
Yeah, well,
I guess I should go.

563
00:25:27,017 --> 00:25:28,732
Okay, baby steps.

564
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:32,286
Just some dudes, some tasty waves,
and some tasty brews.

565
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:33,649
It's all we need.

566
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,574
Where the hell you been?!

567
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,457
What? You think I just roll out
of bed looking like this?

568
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,822
It takes time.

569
00:25:39,823 --> 00:25:42,285
Low maintenance.
You should try it.

570
00:25:42,286 --> 00:25:44,572
What? Getting chewed by
an angry mob of lesbians...

571
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:46,438
who stick eggs up people's butts?

572
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,414
No, thanks.

573
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:51,290
I'm just saying, it does simplify
one's personal grooming.

574
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,882
Are we here to surf or
swap hairdo secrets?

575
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,658
Dude, wait. Check it out.

576
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:06,697
I thought all I needed was some dudes,
some tasty waves, and some tasty brews.

577
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:09,348
Well, we didn't bring enough
beer to make them hot anyway.

578
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:13,826
This is dumb.

579
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:15,674
I blew it. It's over.

580
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:18,233
It's not dumb.
Just keep it simple.

581
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:21,150
"Hi, my insane friend stole
your driver's license."

582
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:22,794
It wasn't stealing.

583
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:25,247
It was making an excuse
to see him again.

584
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:27,699
So you say, "Hi, you forgot
your ID at the party.

585
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,668
We're going out, thought
we'd drop it off,

586
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:31,313
and, hey, you want to come along?"

587
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:33,504
You want me to say that?

588
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:35,405
Mac, he tried to kiss you.

589
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:37,211
And my libido didn't kicked in.

590
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:40,855
Mac, he understands. He seems
like a really great guy.

591
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:45,603
Just a regular vegan JFK
looking for his Mackie O.

592
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:52,943
Hey, there!

593
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,121
Hi!

594
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:58,705
You left your ID.

595
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:00,925
Here it is.

596
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,491
Good seeing you.

597
00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:06,420
Well, hey, um, come in.

598
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:07,962
I want to show you some results.

599
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:10,098
Oh, and this is Amy, everyone.

600
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:21,308
Letters from Bellissima Cosmetics.

601
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:24,446
They quit animal testing, thanks
to the letter campaign,

602
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:26,833
because they make all their
money off of college kids.

603
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,351
You're pretty dressed up.

604
00:27:30,352 --> 00:27:31,723
Where you guys off to?

605
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:34,094
Uhm...

606
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:39,272
Club...Club. It's new.

607
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,679
Mind if I get a glass of water?

608
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,417
Yeah, kitchen's in the back. Let me-

609
00:27:45,418 --> 00:27:46,858
No, it's okay, I'll find it.

610
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:50,388
That's really cool.

611
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,290
See, you did it.

612
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:01,766
Did what?

613
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,148
You lived.

614
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,618
I told you, chicks are
just a distraction.

615
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,436
You're better off without that broad.

616
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:10,344
Yeah, well I'll admit,
this has its charms.

617
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,258
Hey!

618
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,567
You got any more beers?

619
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:20,161
Okay, new category: hot enough.

620
00:28:20,162 --> 00:28:21,417
Yeah, sure!

621
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:23,848
How about "chicks are
a distraction," huh?

622
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:25,923
I didn't say a bad distraction.

623
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:31,303
What have you got?

624
00:28:35,238 --> 00:28:38,136
Apparently, we're into
the cheap stuff.

625
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:40,840
Yeah.

626
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,198
If you guys get bored of Club Club,

627
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:45,770
you should come by Goldfinger's.
I tend bar there.

628
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:48,778
Do you hang out there a lot?

629
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:51,370
Not really my scene. We have
slightly different ideas on...

630
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:52,928
Might want to grab a drink.
His bedroom.

631
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:56,512
Um, okay if I grab a
quick H-2-O, as well?

632
00:28:56,513 --> 00:28:57,904
It's important to hydrate.

633
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,411
Yeah.

634
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:17,553
Rats.

635
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,523
Why didn't you say anything?

636
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,569
I saw them, the test
rats you liberated.

637
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,836
Where's the monkey?

638
00:29:26,837 --> 00:29:28,514
Um, I don't have the monkey,

639
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:30,738
and I didn't free the rats.
They just showed up.

640
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:32,857
Like, in a tiny van...

641
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,989
with a sob story about
needing a place to crash?

642
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,409
Like, in a box on my doorstep.

643
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,452
Yeah, people know
I'm the animals guy.

644
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:40,550
It happens.

645
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:42,260
Can I see the box?

646
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:47,578
So...

647
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:49,898
Amy seems nice.

648
00:29:50,862 --> 00:29:52,326
How long have you
been together?

649
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:54,074
Uh, nineteen years.

650
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,433
She's my sister.

651
00:29:56,434 --> 00:29:57,434
Oh.

652
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:06,747
So, uh...

653
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:10,231
are you going to tell Pauline
and Gil Thomas about the rats?

654
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:14,443
They're clients.
I kinda have to.

655
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:25,025
Boy, oh, boy.

656
00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:26,590
You are bad.

657
00:30:27,448 --> 00:30:28,482
Man,

658
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:32,616
I can't believe I just did
that with Aaron Echolls' son.

659
00:30:39,188 --> 00:30:42,131
They were in a rat habitat
in Bronson Pope's bedroom.

660
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,855
He said someone dropped them off.

661
00:30:43,856 --> 00:30:45,874
Dropped off? Funny.

662
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,142
What about Twenty-five?

663
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:48,398
He says he didn't get the monkey,

664
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,938
but you have the rat photos, so it-

665
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:52,947
Can we get the sheriff's department
to get a search warrant?

666
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:56,141
Excuse me.

667
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:58,286
Hello.

668
00:30:58,287 --> 00:30:59,694
Veronica, hey.

669
00:30:59,695 --> 00:31:01,965
I found something interesting
in this hard drive.

670
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:07,373
We got a report about
some stolen rats.

671
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:09,764
Got a warrant.

672
00:31:15,432 --> 00:31:16,959
Hey!

673
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,382
So, you know, I figured
some sort of liquid

674
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:21,889
was poured over the computer
with all the research on it.

675
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,051
I had to remove the ram
card to let it dry out, but-

676
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:25,775
You told Bronson?

677
00:31:27,615 --> 00:31:30,691
The cops raided the place,
and the rats were gone.

678
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:33,264
I didn't want him to get into trouble.

679
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:36,296
I believe him. I'm sorry.

680
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:41,617
I found these on the motherboard.

681
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,183
Looks like little leaves.

682
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:48,816
Do you think it means anything?

683
00:31:51,048 --> 00:31:52,503
Oh, good. You.

684
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:56,418
We found these in Pauline
and Gil Thomas' hard drive,

685
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:57,706
some sort of leaves.

686
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,653
Any idea where they
might have come from?

687
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:08,932
Congratulations...

688
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:12,427
You just narrowed down the suspects
to anyone who had access to green tea.

689
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:14,389
Green teeth?

690
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:24,122
I stole it off Twenty-five's
cage a few weeks ago.

691
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,820
The sound was driving
me nuts on the weekends.

692
00:32:46,706 --> 00:32:49,731
In the movies, when they piece
back together shredded magazines,

693
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:51,865
they always find an address sticker.

694
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,954
All I've found are near-naked ladies.

695
00:32:57,483 --> 00:32:58,862
Did you name him?

696
00:32:58,863 --> 00:33:00,536
Is that what happened?

697
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:02,737
Named who?

698
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:04,831
Twenty-five.

699
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,514
I heard him behind the door.

700
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,788
Sounds like he misses you.

701
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:25,113
There were tea leaves
in the hard drive.

702
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:29,448
You just grabbed the handiest thing
around and poured it in the drive?

703
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:32,327
Pauline's the one who drinks tea.

704
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:35,903
But I'm guessing she
doesn't subscribe to...

705
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:37,961
lad magazines.

706
00:33:38,162 --> 00:33:41,184
When reassembled, the shredded
pages from the rat box...

707
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,846
were mostly almost-naked babes...

708
00:33:44,847 --> 00:33:47,156
making almost-naughty quotes.

709
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,578
You knew you could pin
the break-in on PHAT,

710
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:52,879
and you knew Bronson would
take care of your lab rats.

711
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:02,956
I started coming in on the
weekends to catch up on work.

712
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,952
I bought him a few toys,

713
00:34:04,953 --> 00:34:07,582
let him play with them while
Pauline wasn't around.

714
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:10,734
His favourite, by the way.

715
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:13,529
Always had to take
it back before I left.

716
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,641
One day...

717
00:34:14,642 --> 00:34:17,380
I'm halfway out the door,
when I turn around...

718
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:20,580
and he's holding it out
through the bars for me.

719
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:22,590
He knew I was leaving.

720
00:34:22,591 --> 00:34:25,101
You know why we don't name them?

721
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,311
Because,

722
00:34:28,312 --> 00:34:29,704
to do the work,

723
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:32,530
we have to turn our compassion off,

724
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:37,567
because things are harder to
kill when they've got a name.

725
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:43,369

727
00:34:55,498 --> 00:34:58,680
Oh, Veronica, this is, uh,
Professor McGregor.

728
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,029
You said you had news.

729
00:35:05,944 --> 00:35:08,104
Here's your cheque back. I...

730
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,486
wasn't able to find him, I'm afraid.

731
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:12,548
Oh, those idiots at PHAT!

732
00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:14,757
They're paving the road to hell.

733
00:35:14,758 --> 00:35:18,784
Well, the good news is, Mac was able
to recover most of your hard drive.

734
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:21,712
Oh, for crying out loud, I thought
you said you were getting him back.

735
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:23,500
I said I thought we were.

736
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:24,712
Well...

737
00:35:24,713 --> 00:35:27,087
the data could still be
useful as a comparison.

738
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:29,212
If we can rush-order
another one, we might-

739
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:30,394
Another one?

740
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,780
Yeah. We should have
another monkey in another...

741
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:34,388
six days.

742
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:37,223
Science marches on.

743
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,579

745
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,719
Hi!

746
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,912
Hi, Bronson!

747
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:03,148
I was just...

748
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:06,622
wasn't just in the neighbourhood.
I was more actually coming by...

749
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,893
because I was wondering...

750
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:09,542
What I'm trying to say...

751
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,868
or ask, is...

752
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:11,988
I guess...

753
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:14,330
Do you like movies?

754
00:36:14,331 --> 00:36:16,500
Uh. Yeah.

755
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:19,970
Because they're doing 2001 in
70-millimeter tomorrow night and-

756
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:22,188
Yeah. Let's go.

757
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:24,518
Um, okay.

758
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,541
Great.

759
00:36:28,871 --> 00:36:30,672
Bye, then.

760
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:56,229
It's kind of lame, but a really hot girl
band is playing at the Roxy.

761
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,706
So they all went out to
try and score, which is...

762
00:36:58,707 --> 00:37:00,746
both never going to
happen and ridiculous,

763
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:02,797
so I just took a shift to get out of it.

764
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:05,503
I know how you feel.

765
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,477
I mean, different team, sure, but...

766
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,640
the whole chasing,
hooking-up, people-go-round.

767
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:14,238
Parker has been going nuts,

768
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,395
like I'm some sort of freak because I'm
not grabbing anything within ten feet.

769
00:37:18,396 --> 00:37:20,595
- It's exhausting.
- Totally.

770
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,744
I mean, it's like music.

771
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:22,785
You know, I love music,

772
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:25,592
but it doesn't mean I have to listen to
it at all times and anything will do.

773
00:37:25,627 --> 00:37:27,989
I'm not going to throw
in a Hasselhoff CD...

774
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,530
just because I left my
Nico Case in the car.

775
00:37:29,565 --> 00:37:32,430
Like, why bother with
something that's not...

776
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:33,663
good?

777
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:35,388
- Because if it's not good...
- It's bad.

778
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:36,430
Exactly.

779
00:37:36,902 --> 00:37:40,181
But these guys were all like,
"as long as she's got a pair of..."

780
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:43,318
You know, it was indelicate.

781
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,277
What's indelicate about shoes?

782
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:48,189
I figure...

783
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,262
you know, I mean,
I know what I like.

784
00:37:50,263 --> 00:37:51,616
Why waste my time?

785
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:53,706
Like, why bother with
something not good...

786
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:54,707
just because it's something?

787
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,755
Especially when you
know the difference,

788
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:58,464
which not many people do.

789
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:00,580
I mean, do you?

790
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,338
I...

791
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,128
I think I do.

792
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:07,379
You see, I think that's like
ninety percent of life,

793
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,716
just knowing the difference.

00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:55,060
- What'll you have?
- Scotch, please.

797
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:58,202
And I think I'm gonna love you...

798

for a long, long time...

799
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:04,687
It's a hell of a song.

800
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:07,672
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

801
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:10,414
Wish someone felt
that way about me.

802
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:13,664
You married?

803
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:14,687
Nope.

804
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:16,815
Involved?

805
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,061
Somewhat.

806
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:22,553
To women!

807
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:24,292

00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:30,670
What are they all like?

810
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:31,593
Crazy.

811
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:33,750
Or we are. I haven't figured it out yet.

812
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:35,290
Probably us.

813
00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:41,756
What's the craziest thing
you ever did for a woman?

814
00:39:44,204 --> 00:39:46,349
I knew this girl once,

815
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:49,587
best-looking woman the
world had ever produced,

816
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:50,495
as far as I could tell.

817
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,662
She tells me her
ex-boyfriend's bothering her...

818
00:39:52,663 --> 00:39:56,264
always showing up at the same parking
lot she hangs out in with her friends.

819
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:58,378
So one night, I went and I filled...

820
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:01,285
a jelly jar with gasoline,
stuck a rag in it,

821
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:05,007
figuring, Molotov cocktail.
I'll light the guy's car on fire.

822
00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:08,137
No more bother in the parking lot.
She'll be impressed.

823
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:09,467
You torched a guy's car?

824
00:40:09,468 --> 00:40:12,243
You ever light a rag soaked
in straight gasoline?

825
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:15,663
Thing exploded in my hands.
I torched my car.

826
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:19,397
Must have been a hell of a girl.

827
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:21,199
What the hell was I thinking?

828
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:24,822
Have you ever done
anything like that?

829
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,927
That why you put this song on, Keith?

830
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,403
I read your book, all the way
to your picture in the back.

831
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:35,672
So, no...

832
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:38,510
I've never done anything like that,

833
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:40,658
like for instance...

834
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:43,379
kill Cyrus O'Dell for a woman.

835
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,635
I wrote a book, too,

00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:47,371
about profiling,

00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,707
reading people.

00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:53,423
Maybe you should check it out.

839
00:41:01,673 --> 00:41:03,620
I've thought it over, Mrs. O'Dell.

840
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:05,161
I'll take the case.

841
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:06,435
Good.

00:41:06,436 --> 00:41:07,705
Thank you.

843
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:10,689

you got dinner last night, maybe
I could spring for breakfast.

- As ordered.
