1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,186
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,187 --> 00:00:05,512
Man had good taste. Let's honour him
by putting his killer behind bars.

3
00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:06,749
You're off the case, Mr. Mars.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,344
You can fire me, Mrs. O'Dell, but I'm
afraid you can't take me off the case.

5
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:13,141
Coach Barry was found murdered
last night beside the PCH.

6
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:14,274
Sheriff suspects Josh...

7
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,630
It's Mason. Why else
would he lie? It makes sense.

8
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:19,853
You really think that I would kill my
coach because he wasn't starting me?

9
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:23,036
Here you go, sheriff-approved
reading material.

10
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:26,541
Miss Mars. You are under arrest

11
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:30,184
for the aiding and abetting
of the escape of Josh Barry.

12
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:33,089
Where is he, Veronica?

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,013
Where's Josh?

14
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:36,751
Think back, Sheriff.
Where did you have him last?

15
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:39,107
Josh's cellmate says you snuck
him a peanut-butter cookie.

16
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:42,599
And he bribed one of your
deputies with said cookie?

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,771
He was allergic, but you know that.

18
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:47,746
After the paramedic revived him
with an epinephrine shot,

19
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,509
Josh overpowered him and escaped
out of the back of the ambulance.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,193
You didn't have a deputy with him?

21
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:54,966
He was riding up front.

22
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:58,106
As his accomplice, I would think you would
want to get yourself out of hot water

23
00:00:58,107 --> 00:00:59,507
and tell us where he is.

24
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:04,062
Don't I get a phone call?

25
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:11,936
Please Keith,

26
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:13,632
find my son.

27
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,743
It's likely he'll try to contact you.

28
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:18,925
When he does, you've got to
convince him to turn himself into me.

29
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:22,376
It will be safer than turning
himself in directly to the sheriff.

30
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:27,974
I'll just take it in here.

31
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:33,853
Yeah?

32
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:36,452
Keith Mars? Please hold for Veronica Mars.

33
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,488
Yeah, honey, it's me.

34
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:52,910
You're where?!

35
00:01:57,074 --> 00:02:00,374
Please, tell me you didn't help an
accused murdered to escape jail.

36
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,264
Yo, pops, check it out.

37
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:05,470
This girl ain't gonna be nobody's bitch.
You better recognise.

38
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:06,813
What's that on your arm?

39
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:09,235
I've had some free time.

40
00:02:09,236 --> 00:02:12,103
And, no, I didn't help Josh escape.

41
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:15,816
Not intentionally.

42
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:17,967
It turns out he's allergic to peanuts.

43
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:20,942
His plan was to take
advantage of my kindness.

44
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:23,205
That's got to be the first time
that's worked for anybody.

45
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,816
Cliffod!

46
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:28,336
Something wrong?

47
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:31,978
I just remembered I need to return
Caged Heat to the video store.

48
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,629
You folks want to hear the good
news or the bad news first?

49
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,180
I'm gonna say the good news.

50
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:39,979
Josh's cellmate and key witness to
the cookie incident ate the evidence

51
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,645
and, icing on the cake,

52
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:44,165
blew a point two-one on the
breathalyzer when they booked him.

53
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,358
No way Lamb can get a
conviction and he knows it.

54
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,807
Well, that sounds like great news.

55
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:48,872
But...

56
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:52,274
he's gonna hold Veronica
as long as he possibly can.

57
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:54,483
Can I get you anything, honey?

58
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:57,514
Oh, a couple cartons of smokes.

59
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,040
What, dad? It's currency on the inside.

60
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:04,183
Any guess where I might find Josh?

61
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,184
Mexico?

62
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,856
So you think he did it?

63
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:10,312
I don't know. If he didn't,
he sure panicked quickly.

64
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,611
That was my thought, too.

65
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:13,421
Anyone want to know what I think?

66
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:17,429
Fine, I'll keep it to myself.

67
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,187
I'm just saing...

68
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:22,865
my entire workday is spent sorting
through my various clients' lies.

69
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,331
This kid?

70
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:25,791
I think he's on the up-and-up.

71
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,802
Okay.

72
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:35,812
I've got an appointment with
Dean O'Dell's old assistant.

73
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:37,965
I can't just put his murder case on hold.

74
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:41,249
What?

75
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,256
Just...

76
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,770
I thought this sight would be
more traumatic for me, but...

77
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:52,832
Vincent!

78
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,666
You bringing in a fugitive
or picking up your dad?

79
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,393
Old-timer, fraud warrant.

80
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:03,877
Turns out, his uncle
isn't Nigerian royalty.

81
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,561
Hey, uh, question.

82
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,726
I saw what looked like an invoice from you
at the home of Coach Barry's widow.

83
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,508
Any chance we're working the same case?

84
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,551
Negatory.

85
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:18,930
Mrs. Barry hired me about a month ago,
wanted to know if her husband was cheating.

86
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:19,939
What'd you learn?

87
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,530
Keith, I am bound by the exact
same ethical codes you are.

88
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,182
Yeah, well-

89
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,488
I was pulling your leg. I had you, though.

90
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:30,801
No. Never got a money shot,

91
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:33,567
but I did catch him getting
friendly in a parking lot

92
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:35,495
with a very attractive married lady.

93
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:37,874
Any chance I could get
a copy of that picture?

94
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,920
Yeah, what the hell? It'll be good
having you owe me one.

95
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,526
I guess you're tracking that kid?

96
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,143
I was thinking of diving into that.

97
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:45,736
Well, I'm... looking for the coach's killer.

98
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:46,942
Didn't you hear?

99
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,164
It's the kid.

100
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:52,366
I spoke to the Sheriff two
month ago, is there anything...

101
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:55,142
Just routine follow-up on
some insurance matters.

102
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:59,271
If you could just tell me anything you
can recall about the day the dean died.

103
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:02,104
Just the usual stuff, meetings.

104
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,406
There was one strange thing.

105
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:08,368
Mel Stoltz showed up, no appointment.
I didn't know who he was until he left.

106
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,962
He seemed to agitate Cyrus.

107
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:11,828
Really? Mel Stoltz?

108
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:12,786
Oh...

109
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:17,147
and, um, he was out of Xanax.
I had to call in the prescription.

110
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,798
Did he pick it up, do you know?

111
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:22,621
Mmm, he was stuck here all day,
and the pharmacy closes at 7:00, so...

112
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,245
A prescription refill called
in on December 10th.

113
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,823
Do you have a record of who picked it up?

114
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,021
Bye.

115
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:37,572
- Dr. Landry, what brings you-
- Question, Keith.

116
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:39,389
I found this bug in my cell phone.

117
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,538
Did you put it here?

118
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:46,163
- No, Hank.
- Did Veronica do it?

119
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:48,041
I'm sure she had nothing to do with it.

120
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,877
You're sure, sure?

121
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:51,368
She's got a lot of initiative.

122
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,278
You know, the other day,

123
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,624
she asked me something about the movie
that I watched in the hotel that night,

124
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:59,679
and then I realised
she was probing my alibi.

125
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,452
She does have a lot of initiative.

126
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,780
She also has got a lot of promise,

127
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,755
and she doesn't need to be slumming it

128
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,885
in a P.I. office the rest of her life.

129
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,907
And, uh, just for the record,

130
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:12,593
that night I checked into the Grand at 7:30.

131
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:14,504
I watched the Clipper game in my room

132
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,828
until Mindy showed up, about 8:15.

133
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:20,404
The rest of the evening was occupied
by the usual business of an affair,

134
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,931
followed by a pay-per-view
movie, then sleep.

135
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,193
There's no more to say.

136
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,509
And there's no more for you
or your daughter to find.

137
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,615
So please stop trying.
It's starting to piss me off.

138
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:35,892
I need to see the Sheriff.

139
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,519
I don't know, Keith. He looks kind of busy.

140
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,912
Well, that's something I got to see.

141
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:46,426
So, if I'm hearing you right,
you're calling me a dumbass.

142
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:50,303
All I said was the dean's death
was a murder, not a suicide.

143
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:53,053
I wanted to bring you what
I had as a concerned citizen.

144
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:54,325
You remember from the toxicology report

145
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,664
he had traces of Xanax
in there with the booze.

146
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:59,174
And he had a prescription for
the stuff which proves zilch.

147
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:01,108
But according to his secretary,
he had run out.

148
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,957
She'd just called in a new prescription,

149
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,265
which was picked up that night,
I learned, by Mindy O'Dell.

150
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,757
Sacks.

151
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:13,302
Call over to Hearst.

152
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:14,858
See if they stored any of the dean's stuff.

153
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,959
Computer, phone or whatever.
We can dust for prints.

154
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:17,618
Sure Sheriff.

155
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:20,464
And bring Mindy O'Dell in.
I'd like to ask her a few questions.

156
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Veronica Mars

161
00:07:59,394 --> 00:08:00,914
You bring my harmonica?

162
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,839
I've got the blues, pa,

163
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,417
the sittin'-in-my-jail-cell blues.

164
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:08,139
Did you bug Hank Landry's phone?

165
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,199
Wait, what?

166
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,469
He just came storming into the office,

167
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,168
saying he found a bug in his cell phone,

168
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,674
asking me if I planted it.
I didn't. Did you?

169
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:16,755
No.

170
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:18,709
Really.

171
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:21,700
Come on dad, this is the face of truth.

172
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,876
Yeah, that played better
in a different context.

173
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:25,909
But, okay, I'm a sucker. I believe you.

174
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:29,630
Word of advice: you might want
to start looking for a new mentor.

175
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,047
Wait. He suspected me?

176
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,069
Vigorously.

177
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,528
Though he emphasised that
it was my bad influence.

178
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,528
that you're a sharp kid,
just a bit misguided.

179
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:38,995
The movie.

180
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:42,722
He knew why I asked
about Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

181
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,008
You want to pick at his alibi,

182
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:46,119
you should have asked him about
the Clippers game that night.

183
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,797
Men routinely accept the idea
that women don't know sports.

184
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:50,990
That's just a...

185
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:53,862
That's just a... mentoring sample,
for if you're interested.

186
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:56,573
- You didn't bug him?
- No.

187
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,613
- Mr. Mars.
- Logan.

188
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,579
Down the hall, on the right.

189
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,242
Logan?

190
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,347
No holiday decorations, huh?

191
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,558
Actually, that's just why I'm in jail,

192
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,378
to avoid Valentine's day.

193
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:28,625
Glad to see you.

194
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:30,728
We're both adults now, right?

195
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:32,495
We can be civil.

196
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:34,824
Do you need anything?

197
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:38,755
There is one thing you could do for me,
if you're heading back to campus.

198
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:42,139
Get my wireless card back from the deputy.

199
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,735
I was taking it to Mac when I got arrested.

200
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:47,950
She said she needed it for a thing tonight.

201
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,007
Sure.

202
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:51,497
Thanks.

203
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:54,671
You've nearly warmed this
cold, cold heart of mine.

204
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,637
Well, this definitely warms mine.

205
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:03,311
You don't remember the movie?

206
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,694
Hank must have ordered it
after I fell asleep.

207
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,083
That's pretty late for a movie.

208
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:11,204
Don't you think he'd have been pretty
tired after all your... activities?

209
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:13,829
I guess that some people have stamina.

210
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,690
- You didn't leave the room?
- No.

211
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:20,029
Lying to me is a crime, you know.

212
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,709
You might be thinking of perjury.

213
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,961
I am thinking of perjury.

214
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,541
Well, then you might be
confused about what perjury is.

215
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,215
Me lying to you here is not perjury.

216
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:30,835
But I am not lying

217
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:33,558
You're aware the dean had traces
of Xanax in his system?

218
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,987
Yes, and alcohol. They told me.

219
00:10:35,988 --> 00:10:37,890
Any idea where he got those pills?

220
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:39,158
He had a prescription.

221
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,094
Which had run out.

222
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:41,972
Well, he must have had some left.

223
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:45,601
Mrs. O'Dell, did you sign for a prescription
for Cyrus the night he was killed?

224
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:46,439
Yes.

225
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,477
But you didn't see him after that.

226
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:49,650
That's right.

227
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:52,849
So if I found that bottle,
there wouldn't be any missing pills?

228
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,155
There are several missing.

229
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,207
Where did they go?

230
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,507
I took them.

231
00:10:57,777 --> 00:11:01,549
My husband's suicide left me with
a certain amount of anxiety.

232
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:15,017
One-three-zero-zero-four-seven-nine.
The former computer of Cyrus O'Dell.

233
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:18,539
She's all yours.
Knock yourself out, Magnum.

234
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,693
- Logan!
- Hey.

235
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:26,469
- Is Mac around?
- Yeah, come in.

236
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:28,541
- Hey.
- Hi.

237
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:31,693
Veronica ask me to bring you this.

238
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,626
Performing a favor from a jail cell?

239
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,448
The girl has serious friendship skills.

240
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,183
Jason can't do it, either.
He's out of town.

241
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:41,777
Oh..

242
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,906
Logan, can we,

243
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,764
like, borrow you?

244
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:50,441
Will I be returned in my
current pristine condition?

245
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:51,198
Yes.

246
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,724
Go on.

247
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,326
So, big news today.

248
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,732
Mason didn't show at practice and
no one's seen or heard from him.

249
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:01,221
Any chance Mason is lying about
seeing Josh with his dad?

250
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,404
Man, I don't know.

251
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,340
Who wants out of jail?

252
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:06,109
I do! I do!

253
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,778
I know you from somewhere.

254
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:18,015
Yeah, you told me to go see the
Wizard and ask him for some guts.

255
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:19,202
Well, did you?

256
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:20,113
Yeah.

257
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,111
He said to let you know you're
the only sheriff in America

258
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:24,081
who he considers a true friend of Dorothy.

259
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,805
- Thanks Cliff
- Goodnight, V.

260
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,979
Hey. It's me.

261
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:42,794
Just keep walking.
I need to show you something.

262
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:48,179
Oh, Josh.

263
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,309
He did it, Veronica.
I know he did. He killed my dad.

264
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,323
You gotta believe me.

265
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,681
It's the gun I told you about. He had it.

266
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:58,162
He killed my dad, Veronica,
and this proves it.

267
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:00,113
I know how this looks,

268
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:01,287
but I didn't have a choice.

269
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:02,617
Let me see the gun.

270
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:05,392
Can I see it?

271
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:12,421
This is a .22-calibre pistol.

272
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:14,742
Your dad was shot with a .45.

273
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,688
- Josh.
- Why are you lying about me?!

274
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,629
- I wasn't with him!
- Josh! Let him go.

275
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:21,336
Let him go.

276
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,954
You have to turn yourself in.

277
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:28,281
If you run, you'll look guilty.

278
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:29,517
I already look guilty.

279
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,298
I'm gonna get out of the country,
but I need cash.

280
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:35,287
I-I have ten grand in rare coins my
grandfather left me in a safe deposit box.

281
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:38,723
I need an ID that says I'm twenty-one to
pull them out without a parent's signature.

282
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:42,087
Can you help me with that? Wallace
showed me the fake ID you made him.

283
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,322
Buy a disposable cell phone
and call me in twenty-four hours.

284
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:49,250
Go!

285
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,743
Are you okay?

286
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,954
I was jumped and thrown
in the back of my own car

287
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:02,486
by some psycho who thinks
that I killed his father!

288
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:04,980
So, no! I've had better days.

289
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:11,639
Thank you for believing me.

290
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:14,704
You lied about having a gun.

291
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:16,551
But I wasn't lying about what I saw.

292
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:18,331
He seems convinced otherwise.

293
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:21,028
Oh, really? I-I must have missed that.

294
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:36,469
Will this require math?

295
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,736
I hope not

296
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:39,151
'Cause I'm bad at math.

297
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:42,177
I'll do the math.
You just be male and drive.

298
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:45,292
Okay, so, here's how it works.

299
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:48,792
You've just been given a clue that
will lead you to a set of instructions.

300
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:52,368
You must take a cell phone photo
of your team performing the task,

301
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:56,219
as instructed. Send it to me,
and I'll send you the next clue.

302
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,156
The first team to finish wins backstage
passes to all tomorrow's parties.

303
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,012
So, okay, couples! Are we ready for
the Valentine's Day scavenger hunt?

304
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:10,540
Then open your clues.

305
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,097
"Clue #1: Demonstrate 127 of HQ470.S3V3."

306
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:18,515
You do the math. I'll drive.

307
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:21,621
Honey?

308
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:25,089
why is there a pistol in the freezer?

309
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,956
Because there's this guy, see,

310
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:29,098
and I want to put him on ice.

311
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:32,943
Because revenge is a dish best served cold.

312
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,225
Because I want to commit
murder in the 28th degree?

313
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:36,838
Stop.

314
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,983
Josh paid me a surprise
visit when I got home.

315
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:41,714
I'm fine.

316
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,120
He had Mason shoved in his trunk.

317
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:46,417
The gun was Mason's.

318
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:48,857
- It's a .22.
- Yeah, I pointed that out.

319
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,540
It's weird.

320
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:55,927
If Josh is guilty, what's he
doing going after Mason?

321
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,841
That's what an innocent man does.

322
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:00,654
Yeah, I'm forming a new theory about that.

323
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:04,414
Mrs. Barry thought her husband
was having an affair.

324
00:16:04,515 --> 00:16:07,539
Before he was murdered,
she hired Vinnie to tail him.

325
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,976
Vinnie snapped these.

326
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,966
You think Mrs. Barry hired
someone to kill her husband?

327
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,339
That's one possibility,

328
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,901
but it would be odd for
her to hire us after that.

329
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:22,405
I'm not gonna provide a drum roll.

330
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,881
I was able to ID our mystery
woman from her plates.

331
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:27,676
Her husband is a captain.

332
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:29,569
Official side arm of the navy?

333
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,073
Colt .45.

334
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,139
I wonder if the captain
found out about the affair.

335
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:37,030
I'm gonna pay a visit tomorrow.

336
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:38,975
Be careful.

337
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:41,403
And where did you leave things with Josh?

338
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:43,938
I told him to turn himself in.

339
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:44,710
Good

340
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:47,540
And I called the sheriff's department
and told them he made contact.

341
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,454
- Good.
- And I might also...

342
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:51,330
promised to help him
sell his coin collection

343
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:52,522
so that he could skip the country.

344
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:53,787
Veronica...

345
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:55,718
I'm not really gonna do it.

346
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,347
But it will help us bring him in.

347
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:00,385

on the night of December 10th,

524
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:54,404
- approximately-
- Hold on.

525
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:58,328
It says here Mr. Batando was picked up
at the laundromat on El Camino.

526
00:26:58,329 --> 00:26:59,392
So?

527
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:00,726
Just pointing out that

528
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:05,688
my client was taken into custody a hundred
yards inside Santa Rita County.

529
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:08,002
You don't have jurisdiction there.

530
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:12,037
Any information you gather
today will be inadmissible.

531
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:13,649
I'm sure you know that.

532
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,096
Do go on.

533
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:31,833
Mrs. Andriotti!

534
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,902
Keith Mars.

535
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:38,576
Sorry to bother you.

536
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:41,570
I'm a private investigator looking
into the death of Tom Barry.

537
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:46,651
A few weeks before his death,
his wife hired another P.I. to follow him.

538
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:49,862
She suspected he was having an affair.

539
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:53,386
Mrs. Andriotti, if you know something...

540
00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:57,409
It's Dr. Andriotti. I'm a neurologist.

541
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:59,568
Mr. Barry was a patient.

542
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,099
He was sick?

543
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,283
Have you heard of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

544
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:05,443
He was terminal.

545
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:08,291
And what he was about to go through...

546
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:10,191
All I konw is...

547
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:11,271
is whoever killed him

548
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,899
probably spared that
poor man a lot of suffering.

549
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,931
You're alive.

550
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:22,035
I'm always happy to come home and find

551
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:24,872
my dad hasn't been shot by a naval officer.

552
00:28:24,873 --> 00:28:28,075
Some interesting twists
in the Coach Barry case.

553
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,222
It turns out the coach's wife took out an
additional life-insurance policy on her husband

554
00:28:33,223 --> 00:28:37,105
a couple of days after Vinnie showed her the
pictures of her husband with another woman.

555
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,055
Oh, my.

556
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:40,380
And that's not all.

557
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:43,422
The new policy had a
double-indemnity clause.

558
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:46,210
If his death is ruled an accident-

559
00:28:46,211 --> 00:28:49,768
say, a carjacking/murder, for instance -

560
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,451
it paid out double.

561
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:55,464
As it stands, the family will be sitting
pretty with a five million dollar payout.

562
00:28:56,472 --> 00:29:00,661
Mrs. Barry was at home with the younger son
and the babysitter at the time of the murder.

563
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:02,188
You think she hired somebody?

564
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:04,378
That was my first thought, but with what?

565
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:08,116
They took out a second mortgage to pay
for their younger son's medical expenses.

566
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:10,875
It's not like they'd find ten
grand in the couch cushions.

567
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:13,684
And it's not like hit men work on spec.

568
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:16,418
Veronica?

569
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:18,109
Nothing.

570
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,535
Wait till you hear the kicker.

571
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:21,103
The coach wasn't having an affair.

572
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:23,431
The woman he was seeing is a neurologist.

573
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:27,331
The coach was dying of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

574
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,943
It promised a grim, prolonged,
and expensive death.

575
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:33,956
She may have actually done him a favour.

576
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,346
Keith.

577
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:54,281
Number Unavailable - Unknown.

578
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,648
Josh?

579
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,887
Here.

580
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,274
Your new ID.

581
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:07,064
Thanks, Veronica.

582
00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:08,149
Good luck.

583
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,429
You think you're nervous now?

584
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,663
What if you knew that there's a
chance those coins will be gone,

585
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:21,555
and if they're gone, it means your
mother had your father killed?

586
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:25,140
Mr. Mars, it sounds to me like you're asking

587
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:28,836
if I had my son kill my husband
for insurance money.

588
00:30:28,837 --> 00:30:30,170
Not exactly.

589
00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:34,077
Wait here. I want to show you something.

590
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:43,041
I need to get into my
safe deposit box, please.

591
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,441
Can I see some ID?

592
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,342
Here you go, Mr. Barry.
I'll give you your privacy.

593
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:25,273
Mr. Mars?

594
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:40,073
That's a colt .45.

595
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:43,351
Something you want to tell me, Mrs. Barry?

596
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:05,818
Mr. Mars, I was not planning to shoot you.

597
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:09,467
That is so ridiculous.
I don't even know how to use a gun.

598
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:10,736
You pull the trigger.

599
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:13,795
Listen to me. I got the
gun to show it to you.

600
00:32:15,152 --> 00:32:19,123
When Josh told me that my husband was
killed and the police showed up,

601
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:20,546
I hid it.

602
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:21,797
Because he did it?

603
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:24,260
Because I thought it would
make him look guilty.

604
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:28,950
But then I read on the internet that
they can test them, can't they?

605
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:31,099
That's why I wanted you to have it,

606
00:32:31,756 --> 00:32:34,010
to prove that my son is innocent.

607
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:40,928
It was Tom's old gun from his army days.

608
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,634
He coached there, you know.

609
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:55,164
So?

610
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,958
Relieved?

611
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:03,501
This was in there, too.

612
00:33:03,502 --> 00:33:05,181
It's my dad's handwriting.

613
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:07,265
Do you have any idea what it is?

614
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:08,954
None.

615
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:14,104
Hey, Keith.

616
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:15,055
What's that?

617
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:17,692
Something Mrs. Barry neglected to turn over.

618
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:19,857
She wants it tested for powder residue.

619
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:21,963
She thinks it'll help prove
her son didn't do it.

620
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:25,041
Let's move, Sacks.

621
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:26,094
Give me that address again.

622
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:27,924
112 Delmar Circle.

623
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:29,529
Something happen at the O'Dell's'?

624
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,388
Yeah, another breaking-and-entering call.

625
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:32,582
It's Batando.

626
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,801
That's what I'm hoping.

627
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:35,405
You want me to come along?

628
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:39,745
It's just I've dealt with him before.
The guy's a little unhinged.

629
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:41,004
I think I can handle it, Keith,

630
00:33:41,005 --> 00:33:43,919
but I'll tell you what.
I'll give you a call if I need any backup.

631
00:33:57,409 --> 00:33:59,128
Make sure he doesn't slip out.

632
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:14,424
You better hide, you crazy bitch!

633
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:57,402
You like that?! Huh?!

634
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:07,606
Sheriff?

635
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:10,151
I...

636
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:13,050
I s-smell bread.

637
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,298
Sacks!

638
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:22,412
Sacks.

639
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:27,232
I need for you to go call
for an ambulance now.

640
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:48,491
Son, if you're watching this,

641
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:50,192
you're twenty-one years old,

642
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:51,890
I'm long gone,

643
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:55,835
and the statute of limitations has
run out on our insurance claim.

644
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:57,522
It's time you know.

645
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:00,591
I was responsible for my own death.

646
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:04,376
Joshua, as I make this tape,

647
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:06,884
I'm dying of a disease

648
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:09,855
that will sap me of my mind and

649
00:36:09,905 --> 00:36:11,905
our financial resources.

650
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:15,137
I had my first attack today.

651
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:19,211
And I won't allow myself to have another.

652
00:36:19,212 --> 00:36:21,587
I didn't want to go out like that,

653
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:24,949
but I won't leave our
family destitute, either.

654
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,181
The person I asked to
help me wasn't a killer.

655
00:36:29,182 --> 00:36:33,427
He was a dear friend who knew everything.

656
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:35,923
Son, please know that I am proud of you.

657
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,580
I know I was tough on you,

658
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:41,603
but I was preparing you
to be man of the house.

659
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:45,543
I leave this earth with no doubt

660
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,548
you've taken good care of your mother
and brother the past couple of years.

661
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:52,139
That's simply the kind of man you are.

662
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:07,775
Josh,

663
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,215
there's someone else in the room.

664
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:14,773
It looks like you.

665
00:37:16,478 --> 00:37:17,978
That's,

666
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,526
uh, that's Coach Yeager.

667
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:22,704
He was my dad's assistant coach.
He played for him at army.

668
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:24,421
That's who Mason saw.

669
00:37:36,126 --> 00:37:39,480
They said on the radio that Sheriff
Lamb is still in intensive care.

670
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:42,550
My buddy in customs found

671
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,139
footage of Josh crossing
the border on a fake ID.

672
00:37:45,174 --> 00:37:46,789
Please tell me it's just a coincidence.

673
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,125
- Dad-
- You want to give me plausible deniability?

674
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:53,536
I suggest you remember to unplug
the laminator next time.

675
00:37:55,426 --> 00:37:56,734
Why, Veronica?

676
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,468
You know Josh didn't do it.

677
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:00,971
Only guilty people flee the country, honey.

678
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:02,815
Here's something you need to see.

679
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,464
Mars Investigations.

680
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,108
The same thing happens every year.

681
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:18,874
"Heat's not working."

682
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:21,152
"The furnace smells bad."

683
00:38:21,153 --> 00:38:23,390
Wah, wah, wah.

684
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,394
Hell, the thing's as old as
the damn university.

685
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:33,313
Trustees might as well put it
on the historical registry.

686
00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:37,271
Look at that. Rusted clear through.

687
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,316
Hey, Weevil,

688
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,865
why don't you clean the flue,
long as we're down here, huh?

689
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:43,741
Sure.

690
00:39:08,424 --> 00:39:09,632
Whoa.

691
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:10,772
Boss,

692
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:13,076
I think you should see this.

693
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,684
That's simply the kind of man you are.

694
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,706
It's the County Commissioner's office.

695
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:30,434
So, Josh is planning to stay gone

696
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,677
until his family's insurance money is safe?

697
00:39:32,712 --> 00:39:33,745
That's his plan.

698
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,780
He said he'd try to get
in touch with his mom,

699
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:38,485
tell her what really happened,

700
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:43,862
but that it was more important for her and
his little brother to be taken care of.

701
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:45,991
He said it was...

702
00:39:45,992 --> 00:39:48,626
time for him to be a man.

703
00:39:50,326 --> 00:39:51,239
Dad,

704
00:39:51,582 --> 00:39:53,064
the County Commissioner.

705
00:39:55,713 --> 00:39:57,236
This is Keith Mars.

706
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:00,122
Sure, Commissioner.

707
00:40:00,946 --> 00:40:02,198
No.

708
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:04,909
What?

709
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,058
I'm very sorry to hear that.

710
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:13,759
Of course.

711
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:17,195
First thing in the morning, fine.

712
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,141
Okay. Goodbye.

713
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,764
He, uh...

714
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:35,056
He says Sheriff Lamb's dead.

715
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:44,787
I can't believe Josh did it and

716
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:45,875
just disappeared.

717
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:49,306
How awful for that guy's family.

718
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:11,992
I really don't understand why
you had to drag me down here-

719
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:16,569
I know. I'm a tough man
to shake, Mrs. O'Dell.

720
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:20,227
What do you want, Keith?

721
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,944
Sheriff Mars.

722
00:41:24,062 --> 00:41:27,254
Two maintenance workers found a
bag of bloody clothes on campus.

723
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,866
The shirt belongs to your
boyfriend, Hank Landry.

724
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,719
So, here's the deal.

725
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,772
Either you're covering for him,
or he's covering for you,

726
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:44,076
and you're gonna
tell me which it is right now.

727
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:48,497
