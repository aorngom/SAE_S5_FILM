1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,306
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,307 --> 00:00:03,291
Hi, I'm Mercer.

3
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:04,592
Oh, that guy, Mercer...

4
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:06,655
His cologne. It's burned into my brain.

5
00:00:07,973 --> 00:00:09,724
I'm here about
the rapes at Hearst.

6
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:10,506
Mercer Hayes.

7
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:12,489
We found two vials of GHB.

8
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,490
It's Mercer. Lamb just arrested
him for the rapes on campus.

9
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:17,614
He didn't do it. I was with him
the night of the rape this summer.

10
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:19,053
It's completely innocent.
We're just friends.

11
00:00:19,054 --> 00:00:23,207
Unless your friend is a...
Unhappily married woman.

12
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:39,085
Where are you stain' these days?

13
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:42,524
If I can be so bold.

14
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,850
You didn't come home last night.

15
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:47,011
I called Logan's room at the Grand.

16
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:48,852
He said he didn't know where you were.

17
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:50,773
Thing is, I think he was telling the truth.

18
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:52,087
I didn't come home last night,

19
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:55,261
you didn't come home the night before that.

20
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,429
That's what this is about?

21
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:01,564
Don't you think we should talk?

22
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,790
Do you?

23
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,967
Wallace is letting me stay
in his dorm room until

24
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:07,872
he and his roommate get
back from their weekend.

25
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:12,892
cramming Paper Chase-style at some
motel out in Twentynine Palms.

26
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:15,975
Come on, Dad. I thought you'd be happy.

27
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:16,948
Happy?!

28
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:19,613
Now you can have your new...

29
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,619
Married girlfriend over and you two can...

30
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,970
I don't know, go crazy.

31
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:26,427
Don't make a joke out of this.

32
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:30,161
It's my life, Veronica. It's my choice.

33
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,809
And this is mine.

34
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:43,968
What does a girl do when it seems
every male in her life has let her down?

35
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,411
She seeks sanctuary,

36
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:48,226
a place where no one can
find her. A place where-

37
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:49,482
- Ehm!
- Oh!

38
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,230
How long have you been
standing there, Piz?

39
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:55,937
I might expect a tip.

40
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:57,305
Just like two seconds.

41
00:01:57,757 --> 00:01:58,584
What are you doing here?

42
00:01:57,757 --> 00:02:01,488
Oh, that, yeah.

43
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,207
Uh, I live here.

44
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:04,242
This is my room.
That's my bed.

45
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:06,776
You remember my guitar.

46
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,970
That's where it gently weeps.

47
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,337
You're supposed to be cramming in
a motel, like in The Paper Chase?

48
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:16,640
You mean The Shining?

49
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:19,163
All work and no play
makes Wallace psychotic.

50
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:20,350
I cough, like, once; he told
me to take it outside.

51
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:22,416
I asked him if he wanted a pizza and he was all

52
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,882
like "Did we come here to eat or study?"

53
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,415
Better question: what are you doing here?

54
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:33,960
Wallace said I could crash here
while you boys were out of town.

55
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,894
Yeah, but why?

56
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:42,998
Um, you know what?
I'm gonna get out of your way.

57
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,000
You're welcome to stay.

58
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:59,629
Uh, can I help you?

59
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:01,374
Yeah, this is my boyfriend's room.

60
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:04,297
He's supposed to be here, but...

61
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:07,621
Could I get you some tea, while you wait?

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,382
Ehi.

63
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:29,038
Moe, what's up?

64
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:34,523
Not what it looks like.

65
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:36,308
Not one to judge.

66
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,484
You haven't seen your next door
neighbour around, have you?

67
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:40,775
Sully or Glen?

68
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:41,479
Sully.

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,838
This is his girlfriend.

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,778
Hi.

71
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:45,373
He knew you were coming, right Meryl?

72
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:46,438
Yeah.

73
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,132
I mean, I flew down from Sacramento.

74
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,241
Sully said he would pick
me up at the airport.

75
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:54,093
It's not like him to flake.

76
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:56,768
He's in trouble; something's
happened to him, I'm positive.

77
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,114
Fine. I'll see what I can do.

78
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:09,637
Veronica Mars

79
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:12,638
3x07 "Of Vice And Men"

80
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,639
Synchro: Camilla [veronicamars.it]

81
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Vieni a trovarci!

82
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:32,641
veronicamars.it

83
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,355
Keys to all our rooms?

84
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:48,286
All R.A.s do.

85
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:51,320
For just such occasions.

86
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:52,422
Well,

87
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,471
I guess you never have to
wonder if your boyfriend is straight.

88
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:58,425
Those aren't Sully's. His roommate
must have put them up.

89
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:01,220
So...

90
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:04,098
you do this, like, a lot?

91
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:05,792
Find people?

92
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:08,499
People, stuff.

93
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:10,004
Really?

94
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:10,985
That's interesting.

95
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:12,785
Hey, check this out.

96
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,606
Toothbrush is here.
Razor's here.

97
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,505
He's really not supposed to have beer.

98
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,968
Do you know who
Scarlett Reyes is?

99
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:25,153
No.

100
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,205
Why?

101
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:30,364
Any idea why Sully might be circling
hotties in the Freshman Facebook?

102
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,065
That's not Sully's circle.

103
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,812
His circles are more perfect.

104
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:35,582
He's had all these drafting classes.

105
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,258
Listen. I appreciate the help, you guys,

106
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,298
but I think I'm just gonna
wait here until Sully shows.

107
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:44,589
Well, I've got class right now.
I'll check back with you after.

108
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:53,300
A year of finishing school.
What are you gonna do?

109
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,343
A credit-card receipt.

110
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,689
I'll check to see if he's
out spending money.

111
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,757
And one final item of business...

112
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,097
Your end-of-term research paper.

113
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:10,898
Oh, no.

114
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,399
Oh, yes. Your assignment:

115
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,364
to plan the perfect murder.

116
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:17,525
From the guy who could'nt plan
an affair with the Dean's wife.

117
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:19,423
Yes, Miss Starr?

118
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,985
Does it matter who the victim is?

119
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:24,012
That is entirely at the killer's discretion.

120
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:25,511
Though I may say, in years past,

121
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,393
I've made a popular target.

122
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,696
The man who would be
my mentor, Mister Popular.

123
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:34,191
Just another on the list
of men who disappoint.

124
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:35,446
Good luck.

125
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:36,346
See you all Tuesday.

126
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:39,142
And Miss Mars, you mind sticking around?

127
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:40,143
I need to speak to you.

128
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:53,794
We don't have to do this.
It really doesn't matter to me.

129
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,875
Veronica, I am recommending you
for a summer internship at the FBI.

130
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,758
Fifteen hundred words on why
I'll benefit from the program?

131
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,487
Yeah. They take it seriously.

132
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:06,766
Fill that out, and I'll accept that in lieu

133
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,194
of your "plan a perfect murder" paper.

134
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:10,373
We both know that you can
do that in your sleep, right?

135
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,348
The guy who runs the
intern program in Quantico,

136
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:16,197
is an old undergrad buddy.

137
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:18,772
I'll see that your application
makes it into the small pile,

138
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,079
If you know what I mean.

139
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:23,475
Got it. Thanks.

140
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:25,009
No term paper.

141
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,746
A dream internship

142
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,533
And all I have to do is
keep my mouth shut.

143
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,163
I'm on the case, okay?
Don't worry.

144
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:38,917
The sheriff won't let me see
Mercer until tomorrow morning.

145
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,583
Look, I'm not here
to talk about Mercer.

146
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:46,294
Okay? I just...

147
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:50,187
I don't know. I want to make
things right between us.

148
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:55,314
You tell me your friend
couldn't have raped a girl

149
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:57,025
because he was with you this summer.

150
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:59,034
Then you won't tell me
what you were doing

151
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:01,139
or why you can't come
forward to provide an alibi,

152
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:04,920
so how exactly do you propose
to make things right?

153
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,015
Are you gonna hypnotise me?

154
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:10,284
I don't know. I was hoping your
desire to find the real rapist

155
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,792
might outweigh your need
to drag me over the coals.

156
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:16,692
- Who says I can't do both?
- Hey, Veronica, trust me.

157
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,303
It is better for everyone if this
secret stays that way, okay?

158
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:24,028
Please, have a little faith.

159
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,439
How bad does
your alibi have to be

160
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,424
if Mercer would rather
stay in jail than divulge it?

161
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,877
Eh?

162
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:37,084
Maybe I don't want to
know what you were up to.

163
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,692
When have you ever not
wanted to know anything?

164
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:45,490
Your dad called me last night.

165
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:47,985
He woke me up wanting
to know where you were.

166
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:49,075
Is that so?

167
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:52,323
So, where are you
staying these days?

168
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:56,932
It's better for everyone if
that secret stays that way.

169
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:01,030
Is that how it works?

170
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:03,340
Did I get the inflection right?

171
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,752
Still no word, huh?

172
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:19,583
I think we should go to the police.

173
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,367
Not yet. It hasn't been forty-eight hours.

174
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:25,842
College boy isn't around when his
high school girlfriend shows up?

175
00:09:25,843 --> 00:09:27,557
The sheriff would laugh you out of there.

176
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:29,473
I don't get it. Why would he laugh?

177
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:31,139
Because the sheriff is a moron.

178
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:34,265
No activity on Sully's credit card,

179
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,170
but I had an idea walking over here.

180
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:39,055
Any chance you know
his cell phone pin number?

181
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:44,199
Welcome to voicemail.
You have 12 new messages.

182
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:45,678
Put it on speaker phone.

183
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:50,442
Sully, I'm here at the gate.
Are we meeting at bag-

184
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:52,874
Sully, I'm at baggage.

185
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,121
Hey, there, Sully. It's Scarlett.

186
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:56,440
Are we still on for tomorrow night?

187
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:57,831
Food Court at eight?

188
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:59,757
You told your girlfriend, right?

189
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,002
Weird.

190
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:04,328
What do you make of that?

191
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:21,074
Nobody willing to spoon you?

192
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,530
Uh, no one volunteered.

193
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,167
Well, you know what
they say in the big house:

194
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:29,274
if you can't find a partner,
use a wooden chair.

195
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,996
Let's rock.

196
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:37,355
What are you doing here, Veronica?

197
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:41,974
You. Logan says he's got
an alibi for the two of you,

198
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,382
the night of the third
rape. August 13th?

199
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:45,964
I suppose he does.

200
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:46,846
So, you do remember.

201
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,877
That night? Yeah.
It's... memorable.

202
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:52,574
The night of the other three rapes, I...

203
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:56,877
Care to share what you two
free-spirited lads were up to?

204
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:59,096
I'll give you a hint.
It was squalid.

205
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:02,701
Logan has good reason
to keep that to himself.

206
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,767
But you shouldn't worry.
He's a solid guy.

207
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,985
I mean, I'd want him to be my
boyfriend if I swung that way.

208
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:09,207
Give it time.
You just got here.

209
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:14,592
So, if there's anything you can
tell me that could help clear you.

210
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:19,229
The sheriff seemed awfully
interested in my cologne.

211
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,149
Uh, GQ had a sample of it
in the back-to-school issue,

212
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,720
so I hardly think that's some huge clue.

213
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:26,141
Now, do you think I'm
the only guy at Hearst

214
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:29,468
who owns clippers and subscribes
to Gentleman's Quarterly?

215
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:32,880
And keeps a stockpile of GHB handy,

216
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:34,047
from what I hear.

217
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:35,500
That wasn't mine.

218
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:38,982
I think someone's setting
me up. Okay, there...

219
00:11:38,983 --> 00:11:42,353
There are a couple guys who owe me big.

220
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:44,416
I'll bite. Who?

221
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,530
Pi Sig president Chip Diller.

222
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,226
Not that shocked.

223
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,476
Dean Cyrus O'Dell.

224
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:50,477
You're lying.

225
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:52,838
Big boxing fan, the dean.

226
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:54,508
Unfortunately, he can't pick them.

227
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,113
And he has a student aide,
uh, place the bets for him,

228
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:59,686
but it's the dean's money.

229
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:00,982
He'd like to see me gone.

230
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,571
I'll look into it.

231
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:03,724
Thanks, Veronica.

232
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:08,045
Ah, Logan's, uh, bragged
you up. I appreciate the help.

233
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:11,409
Hey, Meryl, any luck?

234
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,410
No. none.

235
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:15,321
I called all the hospitals.
I talked to his professors,

236
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:17,623
and nobody has seen or heard from him.

237
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:21,880
Look, I was just thinking.

238
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:25,945
Sully told me that in his physics class,
they're working with lasers.

239
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:31,572
So, what if Sully accidentally discovered
some new technology, you know,

240
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,836
like some kind of laser cannon,

241
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,187
that could assassinate people
from space or something?

242
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:39,893
He could be running from,

243
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:40,842
I don't know,

244
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,374
sinister forces!

245
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:49,145
Have you ever heard of
Occam's razor, Meryl?

246
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:52,656
Is that a space laser?
Has it already been invented?

247
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,660
No, it's a theory.

248
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:57,955
Basically, the theory states that

249
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:00,531
when given a set of possible explanations,

250
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,306
for a phenomenon,

251
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,822
we should embrace
the least complicated.

252
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,410
And so...

253
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:09,620
I guess I'm saying that if on the one hand,

254
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:12,420
you have Sully inventing a space laser,

255
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:13,668
and on the other,

256
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,672
maybe he wants to break up

257
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:18,997
but is taking the coward's way out...

258
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,723
You're saying maybe
he's breaking up with me?

259
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:24,582
I hope that's all it is.

260
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:27,721
At least then I'd know he's okay.

261
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,324
Oh. Hey!

262
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:41,688
I didn't see the sock,

263
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,663
so I figured there was
nothing nasty going down.

264
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:44,788
Are you Glen?

265
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,496
The man, the myth, the legend.

266
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,152
Which one of you is Meryl?

267
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:49,374
That's me.

268
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,830
For real?

269
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,792
And that makes you the hot friend.

270
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:54,573
So, where's Sully at?

271
00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:56,855
Uh, we were hoping you might know.

272
00:13:57,498 --> 00:14:00,846
Me? Man, he asked me to clear out for
the weekend 'cause you were coming down.

273
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,239
When's the last time you saw him?

274
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,290
Yesterday morning.

275
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,291
He was going surfing.

276
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:07,370
Sully doesn't surf.
He's from Sacramento.

277
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:08,402
That's where he said he was heading.

278
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:09,769
Why are you back early?

279
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:13,020
'Cause my stepmom confiscated my Xbox.

280
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,402
The bitch is taking her life in her own
hands, you know what I'm saying?

281
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,575
Plus, I figured maybe
Sully didn't need the room

282
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:22,573
after the knock-down, drag-out you
two had on the phone Thursday night.

283
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:27,439
Wait.

284
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:30,690
You two had a fight?

285
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:36,032
Hey.

286
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:41,625
I just came by to make sure
your phone was working okay.

287
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:42,813
It's fine.

288
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:46,674
I know because I've
picked it up a dozen times

289
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:49,217
and listened to the dial tone...

290
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:50,481
wanting to call.

291
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:52,924
It's just, um...

292
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:55,477
Don't beat yourself up.
What happened happened.

293
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,901
Yeah, but...

294
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,306
It doesn't make it right.

295
00:15:01,906 --> 00:15:03,513
Keith, would it help you to know...

296
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,381
that my husband and I haven't
had sex for eight months?

297
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:10,046
We're just two people
who share the same house.

298
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:11,963
And a child.

299
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:16,192
Yes, and a child.

300
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,917
I'm going to leave him, Keith,

301
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,725
as soon as he gets back to town.

302
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:23,153
That's crazy.

303
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,808
No, it's sensible.

304
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:27,767
Sticking out a loveless
marriage, that's crazy.

305
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:29,154
I want to know...

306
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,621
This thing I'm feeling,
do you feel it, too?

307
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,912
Yes. Absolutely.

308
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:40,803
- But it's not that s-
- Simple. I know.

309
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:42,307
It's complicated,

310
00:15:42,696 --> 00:15:45,094
and we're not gonna
figure it out in a day.

311
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,324
Let's just do one thing.

312
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,781
You, me, Palm Springs, this weekend.

313
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:00,574
Take some time away from Neptune.

314
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:04,295
Just see?

315
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:06,738
Just say you'll go away with me.

316
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,095
Oh. Excuse me.

317
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:20,816
No rush, Mrs. Chase.

318
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:28,047
Nice-looking lady.

319
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:28,690
Vinnie.

320
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:31,923
To what do I owe... this?

321
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:36,587
You know that show Let's Make
a Deal, where they make...

322
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:38,318
deals?

323
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:42,708
Well, the Fitzpatrick boys
have me on retainer.

324
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,518
I practically have an office down there,

325
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,145
and they got this crazy idea...

326
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:50,261
that little Miss Kendall Casablancas
owes them money and that you...

327
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:52,112
Know where the money's hidden.

328
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:55,615
Now, a word of advice, Keith:
don't owe the Fitzpatricks money.

329
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,055
So, what if...

330
00:16:57,468 --> 00:17:00,515
instead of me expending a
lot of energy tracking it down,

331
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:02,864
we split the retainer?

332
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,414
It's as easy as you whispering
an address in my ear.

333
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,954
I don't know where
Kendall is. Sorry, Vinnie.

334
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,708
No biggie. That's cool.

335
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,905
Let's peek behind door number two.

336
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:18,425
Now, this is not a value judgment,
Keith, 'cause, believe me...

337
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,107
I have been there.

338
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,119
I mean, there was
this one married lady,

339
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,235
smokin' hot blonde.

340
00:17:24,499 --> 00:17:28,041
Cried all day and ashed
Pall Malls all over my couch,

341
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:29,937
but, man, could she lay the lumber.

342
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:31,666
Now, this one you got, though,

343
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:35,586
I mean, a lady in the streets
and a freak in the sheets.

344
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:39,176
What do you want?

345
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:42,944
Well, first...

346
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:45,465
you could acknowledge the artistry here.

347
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,220
I mean, you remember how dark it was.

348
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:49,635
Open aperture, full zoom
from across the street.

349
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,949
Steadiest hands in the biz.

350
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,235
Why are you here, Vinnie? Money?

351
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:56,398
The girl at the Fotomat used
to call me the human tripod.

352
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,764
Wait. That's something else.

353
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:00,851
How much?

354
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:03,570
Hmm?

355
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:05,784
Mmm.

356
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:12,304
Well, Mr. Chase is paying me two grand
to prove that his wife is having an affair.

357
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,134
So, I figure...

358
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:18,218
you double that, and we
can all walk away winners,

359
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:20,426
except for Mr. Chase, of course.

360
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:23,696
Sound like a deal, Keith?

361
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:39,405
Over here.

362
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,481
You know, you really should have told
me about the fight you and Sully had.

363
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:53,170
It wasn't that big a deal.

364
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:54,979
It was just the long-distance
thing getting to us.

365
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,216
You have a fight, and then
he's not around when you fly in.

366
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,279
That doesn't make you
the least bit suspicious?

367
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:01,923
No.

368
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,370
There. Scarlett
from the Facebook.

369
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:11,976
Wait! Wait!

370
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,037
Aren't we talking to her?

371
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:15,896
Not yet. You might spook him.

372
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:16,581
Spook who?

373
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:19,639
If Sully sees us waiting for
him, he might, you know...

374
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:21,187
try to slip away.

375
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,946
Veronica, you just don't get it.

376
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:24,933
Sully is in trouble.

377
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:27,385
And if this Scarlett girl
could help us find him...

378
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:40,083
Hi. I'm Meryl.
I'm Sully's girlfriend.

379
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,184
Oh. Hi!

380
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,487
And this is my friend Veronica.

381
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:48,706
So, you're supposed to meet
Sully here, aren't you?

382
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:50,336
Right. To study.

383
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:53,254
When was the last time you saw him?

384
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:56,865
In physics lab, on Thursday.

385
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:00,776
Wait. He's not around?

386
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:02,362
Is he all right?

387
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:03,286
Actually...

388
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,090
Dig the outfit.

389
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:07,035
Is that from Dolce and Gabbana's
study-buddy collection?

390
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:08,065
Veronica.

391
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:11,027
It's Friday. I'm going to a club after.

392
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:12,965
Scarlett, did you happen to notice whether

393
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:15,598
Sully invented a space laser of some sort?

394
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,950
You don't have to be mean.

395
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,176
I'm sorry, Meryl,

396
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:20,553
but Scarlett here has either
stolen your boyfriend,

397
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:21,608
or she wants to.

398
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:22,609
That's just the way it is.

399
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,338
You can choose to be a patsy,
or you can choose not to be.

400
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,906
And if you'll excuse me, I need to make
this point elsewhere in the food court.

401
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,350
Talk amongst yourselves.

402
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,737
Dr. Landry?

403
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,776
Veronica. Have a
seat. Share a rib.

404
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:44,059
I don't like to get my hands dirty.

405
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:46,227
How's your application?

406
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:47,909
Well, here's the thing, I thought about it,

407
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:51,326
and I'm gonna pass on the FBI thing.

408
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:56,293
So, you'll get my "plan a perfect murder"
paper along with everyone else's.

409
00:20:56,294 --> 00:20:59,779
I don't quite understand. Why?

410
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,853
Why? Because...

411
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,552
Because I'm not sure I'll get much
out of a special summer program,

412
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:08,449
if I feel I've been bought off.

413
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,985
Why would you feel bought off?

414
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:14,096
I was never gonna
tell anyone about your...

415
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:16,870
situation with the dean's wife.

416
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,800
I guess I don't think any
less of you as a professor.

417
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,724
I just don't feel right about taking this.

418
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:25,906
The internship feels like hush money.

419
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,127
Take the internship.

420
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:30,406
There's no quid pro quo here.

421
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:33,285
I'm not worried about what you might
say about what you saw at the grand.

422
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:35,661
This is about nothing more or less,

423
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,316
than the fact that you are,
by far, my strongest student.

424
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:39,981
Forget me, Veronica.
Think about you.

425
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:41,839
Think about how this
would look on your résumé.

426
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:43,155
My résumé?

427
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:46,538
Three more years, and that's all that's
gonna matter about what happened here.

428
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:48,621
Think it over.

429
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:51,311
Okay.

430
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:53,750
Consider my mind blown...

431
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:59,808
And then put back together and blown again.

432
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,739
Yo, room dog. What up?

433
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,943
Big plans this Friday night?

434
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:09,944
Work.

435
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,751
You? Study night?

436
00:22:11,752 --> 00:22:13,162
Planning the perfect murder.

437
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:15,442
Uh, oh.

438
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,163
There's a girl in my bed.

439
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:20,757
Yeah, buddy.

440
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:24,682
It took a double shot of night-time
cold medicine to get her down.

441
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,583
It also stopped her sniffling.

442
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,870
She's pretty worked up
about her boyfriend.

443
00:22:28,952 --> 00:22:32,785
Understandable, but, um,
where am I sleeping?

444
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:36,154
Play your cards right...the floor.

445
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:39,354
Keith Richards wouldn't sleep on the floor.

446
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:40,884
Probably true.

447
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:44,752
They still make vinyl records?

448
00:22:44,753 --> 00:22:46,782
PIZ: Uh, dance music still comes in vinyl.

449
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,220
I'm covering Mercer's slot.

450
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:49,724
His slot? What slot?

451
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:51,774
Club Flush. Club and house music.

452
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:53,987
Hold on.

453
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:55,527
I'm coming with you.

454
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:06,276
Here it is.

455
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:09,468
Every show, every D.J. shift
is logged on this computer.

456
00:23:14,731 --> 00:23:16,000
What happened on September 30th?

457
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:19,137
Parker was raped.

458
00:23:33,665 --> 00:23:35,715
Mercer couldn't have raped Stacy, either.

459
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:41,942
Wait. Unless he pre-recorded his show
so he knew he'd have an alibi.

460
00:23:41,943 --> 00:23:43,077
I seriously doubt it.

461
00:23:43,078 --> 00:23:43,978
Why's that?

462
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:45,075
It's a call-in request show.

463
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:01,673
Something tells me this isn't a booty call.

464
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,938
I got what you need to
get Mercer out of jail.

465
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:08,025
It's yours, Logan.

466
00:24:08,175 --> 00:24:10,058
No one has to know where
you were that night...

467
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,320
No one except me.

468
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:17,865
Can you leave it alone?
Can you trust me?

469
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:25,699
No, I can't.

470
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:27,398
I'm not built that way.

471
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,105
Who gets blackmailed by his girlfriend?

472
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:34,057
Oh, I guess I do.

473
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:40,029
We were in Tijuana.

474
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:45,165
You know, we partied all night.
I mean, it was no big deal.

475
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,652
When we got back to our rooms, he
started making these drinks, flaming DPs.

476
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:55,038
You know, you set a shot glass of rum and
amaretto on fire, and you drop it in a beer.

477
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,499
Hold on. Let me get a pen.
I want to jot down this recipe.

478
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,203
He set the room on fire.

479
00:25:00,147 --> 00:25:03,633
He did? And where
were you for all this fun?

480
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:04,815
Asleep in my room.

481
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,372
- Alone?
- Yeah, alone.

482
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,962
Well, then, you're not really
much of an alibi, are you?

483
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:12,963
We were in Mexico, Veronica.

484
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:16,081
We had adjoining rooms. I...

485
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:19,086
I mean, the door between the
rooms was open. I could hear them.

486
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:20,663
Them?

487
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:22,305
There were girls in his room.

488
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:23,866
Is that what you want to know?

489
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:27,833
I am your boyfriend, Veronica, and
you're treating me like a criminal.

490
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:29,426
You could have told all this to Lamb.

491
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,601
By the time we got out of the
room, the fire was spreading.

492
00:25:32,048 --> 00:25:34,223
The whole motel was going up in flames.

493
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:35,442
Okay, w-

494
00:25:36,154 --> 00:25:38,124
I don't know. We had
to get out of there.

495
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,316
You didn't stick around to try to help?

496
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,397
You didn't see if everyone was okay?

497
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:48,511
You know, it's because of the look on your
face right now that I didn't want to tell you.

498
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,831
I did what nine out of ten guys
in my situation would have done.

499
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:52,856
I ran.

500
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:55,694
You know, so, either
Mercer sits in jail here,

501
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:59,019
or he gives his alibi and sits
on his ass in some Mexican jail.

502
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:01,330
At least here he's innocent.

503
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:06,200
Tell Lamb to check the log
at the campus radio station.

504
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,747
That should get your friend released.

505
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:16,944
Veronica!

506
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,207
Veronica! Hey! Hey!

507
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,024
You've got to listen to this.

508
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:24,059
At first I didn't recognise the
voice 'cause it's kind of noisy.

509
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,381
But now I'm sure it's Sully.

510
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:29,271
First saved message.

511
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:31,753
I'm so sorry I missed you.

512
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:33,877
I can't wait to see you.

513
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:35,540
I'll talk to you later.

514
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:39,323
The number Sully called you from,
you check your Caller ID?

515
00:26:39,324 --> 00:26:40,835
Yeah. He used his cell.

516
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:44,221
I tried calling him back but it just rings
and rings, and it goes to voicemail.

517
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:45,618
That's great.

518
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:48,148
As long as he's got it turned
on, we can track him.

519
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:51,321
I've just got to grab a
gizmo from my dad's office.

520
00:26:55,422 --> 00:26:59,169
Can you bring back an egg
sandwich of some sort,

521
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,921
if it won't slow you down?

522
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,723
Egg sandwich?

523
00:27:03,577 --> 00:27:06,216
Egg sandwich. Orange whip?

524
00:27:21,243 --> 00:27:23,187
- You're up early.
- Yeah, you too.

525
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:26,764
You don't have to go through
all this trouble avoiding me.

526
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:28,808
I know you're disappointed.

527
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,453
But at least give me
the opportunity to explain.

528
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:33,711
What's to explain?

529
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,015
That's the way the world works.

530
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:36,573
You're an adult. I'm an adult.

531
00:27:37,215 --> 00:27:38,533
What's her name's an adult.

532
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:39,534
But I want you to understand...

533
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:42,224
that this is not just some fling.

534
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,981
Veronica...

535
00:27:46,518 --> 00:27:47,665
This is something special.

536
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:50,304
"This is something special."

537
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:51,505
Where have we heard that before?

538
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:55,293
Oh, yeah, from every john we've
ever caught with his pants down.

539
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:55,908
Veronica!

540
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,296
So if Jake Kane thought he and
mom had something special,

541
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:00,593
would that have been okay?

542
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:03,255
Harmony is leaving her husband.

543
00:28:03,256 --> 00:28:04,864
Listen to yourself.

544
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:07,469
Does her husband know this yet?

545
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:10,845
Yeah.

546
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:14,769
Look, Dad...

547
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,366
do what you got to do, okay?

548
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,717
I've seen too much working here
to ever be surprised again.

549
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:24,184
I know you, Veronica.
You're not that jaded.

550
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:25,802
I didn't used to be.

551
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,116
I had this one shining example,

552
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:30,808
that gave me some faith.

553
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:45,069
I ran Sully's cards again.

554
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,647
There were a bunch of charges from
last night, all in this neighbourhood.

555
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:49,972
Charges from where?

556
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,694
Circus of Liquors, Crazy
Girls, World of Cigarettes.

557
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,709
At least he's okay, right?

558
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:04,806
I guess we can rule out kidnapping...

559
00:29:06,531 --> 00:29:09,090
unless he was abducted
by the Insane Clown Posse.

560
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:25,626
This is it.

561
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,548
Of all the gin joints in all
the cities in all the world.

562
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:37,619
Meryl. We can't go in there.

563
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,716
Let me call someone for help.

564
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:39,817
Last time I went in there,

565
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:42,413
my boyfriend pulled a gun
on the owner of the place.

566
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,505
That's Sully's cell phone,
that blinking dot, right?

567
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:47,644
We'll get help.
We'll call the sheriff.

568
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:48,872
You mean the moron?

569
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:51,054
He's a well-armed moron.

570
00:29:52,846 --> 00:29:54,093
Fine.

571
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:02,346
Oh, crap.

572
00:30:08,977 --> 00:30:10,617
The name's Billy Sullivan, huh?

573
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:13,444
About this tall, blond hair?

574
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:15,262
Huh. Let's see.

575
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,609
Hey. Uh, Irish lad, medium build, lost?

576
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,105
No, we don't get many of those in here.

577
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,214
- No?
- No.

578
00:30:25,215 --> 00:30:26,565
Meryl, we need to go.

579
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:28,292
You said Sully's here somewhere.

580
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,393
I know you.

581
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,645
You're Keith Mars' little girl.

582
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:37,186
It's, um... Veronica.

583
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:42,937
So, you're always dropping
by here looking for people.

584
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:48,289
And what gives you the idea
young Billy Sullivan stopped here?

585
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:51,102
You're sitting on it, Potsie.

586
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:52,793
What? This?

587
00:30:52,794 --> 00:30:55,952
It just fell off a truck we were
lucky enough to happen by.

588
00:30:57,585 --> 00:30:58,872
You mind getting this?

589
00:30:58,873 --> 00:30:59,973
What?

590
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,823
Sully's cell phone.

591
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:05,891
Maybe he was in here
last night, tending bar.

592
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,282
Uh, mind if we take you to him?

593
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:10,611
Let me down.

594
00:31:10,712 --> 00:31:12,851
Are you here to lecture us on stealing now?

595
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:16,241
It's not enough your
dad put half my family in jail.

596
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:19,402
Not that I hold a grudge. No!

597
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:21,698
Fair play, Sheriff Mars.

598
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:22,925
Let go of her!

599
00:31:22,926 --> 00:31:25,661
Patience, sister.
You'll get your turn.

600
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:32,982
And a-roving, a-roving, a-roving
I'll go for a pair of brown eyes.

601
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:36,646
You see, now I got a real problem,

602
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:41,075
'cause private investigator Mars
sticks his nose into my business,

603
00:31:41,076 --> 00:31:44,708
and he helps that Casablancas
bitch check out of Neptune,

604
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:47,742
with millions in my cash. Huh?

605
00:31:47,743 --> 00:31:49,020
I can't breathe.

606
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,459
Say "cheese"! Click!

607
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:00,764
Got it and send.

608
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:04,186
Hey, Keith Mars is gonna
love this one, Liam!

609
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:06,581
Think of his face when
he opens up this e-mail.

610
00:32:06,582 --> 00:32:07,651
Up high!

611
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:09,100
All right.

612
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:11,832
Ooh, better yet, how about
one of you licking her face?

613
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:14,532
Easy, big guy.

614
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:19,588
O-yay.

615
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:36,654
Hey!

616
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:39,375
What, are you just gonna cut out of there...

617
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:41,249
without so much as a "gracias, señor"?

618
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:46,702
Ooh, sweet new ride. Hybrid, right?

619
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:48,081
I'm waiting for the hybrid Camaro.

620
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:51,647
You sobered up pretty quick.

621
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:52,932
What the hell are you thinking, Veronica?

622
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:55,790
You got no business being in
a place like that. You've got me?

623
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,482
It was... unintentional.

624
00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:03,128
Hey, you didn't really send that
picture message to my dad, did you?

625
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:04,859
If I did, it was a miracle.

626
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,302
The phone didn't have a camera.

627
00:33:06,303 --> 00:33:07,734
Hey, that kid you were looking for?

628
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:08,601
I saw him come in last night,

629
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:11,258
like he just came back
from the beach, only wasted.

630
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,259
Couldn't remember his name.

631
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,815
Danny got his wallet, said he'd
help him get back home,

632
00:33:14,816 --> 00:33:16,879
then took him on some
kind of wild shopping spree.

633
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,033
After that, the Fitzpatricks
got bored and kicked him out.

634
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:21,672
Any idea where he might be now?

635
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:23,696
Best guess. The drunk tank?

636
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:29,813
Yeah, we got him.

637
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:33,072
Picked him up last night, staggering
around, wearing a wet suit.

638
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:37,066
Looked like just another dumbass on
his way back from tearing up Mexico.

639
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:40,549
No ID, too drunk to even give us his name.

640
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:44,306
Then this morning, we find
he still can't remember his name.

641
00:33:44,307 --> 00:33:47,039
Then we notice a big knot
on the back of his head.

642
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,124
Oh, God.

643
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:49,790
Figured he bumped his head surfing.

644
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,636
I'm gonna have Sacks take him to the hospital,

645
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:54,040
as soon as he gets back with my bear claw.

646
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,322
Can I see him?

647
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:00,577
You got ten bucks?

648
00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:05,038
Whew! Kidding.

649
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:07,595
I'll have someone let you back there in a minute.

650
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,754
- Meryl?
- Yeah?

651
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,327
I'm so sorry that I, you know...

652
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:18,012
jumped to the wrong conclusions.

653
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:19,572
It's okay, Veronica.

654
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:22,340
I never would have
found him without you.

655
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:24,514
And I know what it looked like.

656
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:28,171
If I hadn't been in love before,
I wouldn't have believed it, either.

657
00:34:34,812 --> 00:34:36,183
Sully!

658
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:37,537
Sully!

659
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:49,063
Meryl?

660
00:34:55,364 --> 00:34:57,072
I was looking for you.

661
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:04,562
Hey!

662
00:35:05,082 --> 00:35:06,133
No touching!

663
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,100
We're gonna take your
boyfriend to the hospital now,

664
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:10,978
so, you want to tag along.

665
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:19,521
Bye, Veronica. I'll see you
next time I'm in town, okay?

666
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:32,442
Hey, what are you still doing here?

667
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:33,074
Didn't Logan-

668
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:36,438
He came by and talked to the sheriff last night.

669
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,439
Thanks, by the way.

670
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,870
Why are you still here?

671
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:42,828
Oh, there's something about my
attitude the sheriff has found lacking.

672
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:47,099
He's decided to keep me here
as long as he's allowed under law.

673
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:50,100
Uh, Logan's picking me up for breakfast
tomorrow, if you want to come with.

674
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:51,088
Doubtful.

675
00:35:56,832 --> 00:35:58,805
All gassed up and ready to go!

676
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:03,294
Where's your bag?

677
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:05,010
Harmony.

678
00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:09,103
We're not going, are we?

679
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:10,747
No.

680
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:14,168
I'm sorry, Keith.

681
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:16,148
I've fallen for you.

682
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:18,712
And I'm packed.

683
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:21,158
And I'm standing here.

684
00:36:23,153 --> 00:36:25,681
And I'm asking you
to come away with me.

685
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:30,712
Harmony...

686
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,075
I can't.

687
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:42,921
Hello.

688
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:43,906
Hey, Mr. Mars.

689
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:45,251
Logan, everything okay?

690
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:47,777
Yeah. Uh, I'm looking for Veronica.

691
00:36:47,778 --> 00:36:49,468
I think she's trying to hide from me, actually.

692
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:52,782
Yeah, she's been keeping
me out of the loop, too.

693
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,457
You might try Wallace's. She said
she was staying with him.

694
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,407
Okay. Thanks.

695
00:36:59,437 --> 00:37:00,464
Bye.

696
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:04,123
This is KRFF, Hearst college radio.

697
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:06,076
And I'm your host, D.J. Hellfish.

698
00:37:06,077 --> 00:37:07,403
Please don't touch that dial.

699
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:11,265
And for those of you in the food court, you're
listening to me whether you like it or not.

700
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:12,586
You might as well enjoy it.

701
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,600
Excuse me.

702
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:21,490
I ordered the capellini, and I'm pretty
sure that hair doesn't belong to an angel.

703
00:37:41,808 --> 00:37:44,594
Hey, Veronica. It's me. Give me a buzz.

704
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:50,867
Veronica, is everything all right? Call me.

705
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:55,021
Hey, Veronica, where
are you? Give me a call.

706
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,806
Veronica, it's me. I want you to come home.

707
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:04,000
I ended things with Harmony, and...

708
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:09,092
I'd-I'd just like to see you, okay?

709
00:38:46,946 --> 00:38:47,732
Logan.

710
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:51,078
Hey, I'm looking for Veronica.

711
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,952
She was around earlier, but I haven't-

712
00:38:52,953 --> 00:38:54,217
Is she with Wallace?

713
00:38:54,218 --> 00:38:56,984
He's out of town a-at a motel...

714
00:38:57,591 --> 00:38:58,773
studying.

715
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:01,306
Yeah, 'cause Veronica's dad thought that...

716
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:10,268
Well, if you see her,
a-ask her to call me?

717
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:26,176
I know this feeling.

718
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,395
I can't believe this is
happening to me... again.

719
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,345
It's him.

720
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:23,576
Veronica.

721
00:40:31,766 --> 00:40:33,490
Hey, come here.

722
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:38,179
Take me home.

723
00:40:49,496 --> 00:40:50,457
Oh, my God.

724
00:40:56,812 --> 00:40:57,801
Hey.

725
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,693
Open up, honey.

726
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:11,489
Doctor said we should
get more of this in you.

727
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:18,920
Oh, that's nasty.

728
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:22,718
Cowboy up, Mars.

729
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:30,090
So, what would Stan Marsh
say in a situation like this?

730
00:41:30,747 --> 00:41:33,756
I think we all learned a
valuable lesson about faith.

731
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,822
You give it to the people you love.

732
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:42,217
But the people who really deserve it...

733
00:41:42,218 --> 00:41:45,648
are the ones who come through even
when you don't love them enough.
