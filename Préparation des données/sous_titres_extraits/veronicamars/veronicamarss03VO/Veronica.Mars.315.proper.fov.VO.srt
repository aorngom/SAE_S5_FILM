1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,381
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:03,132 --> 00:00:05,174
I didn't kill Cyrus, Keith.

3
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:07,803
I found this bug in my cell phone.
Did you put it there?

4
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:09,244
No, Hank.

5
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:13,521
You like that?! Huh?!

6
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:16,015
He says Sheriff Lamb's dead.

7
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:21,091
Two maintenance workers found a
bag of bloody clothes on campus.

8
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:23,769
The shirt belongs to your
boyfriend, Hank Landry.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,159
Either you're covering for him,
or he's covering for you.

10
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:31,501
So, here's something the freshman
guidebook failed to address:

11
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:32,786
your dad is acting sheriff,

12
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:35,932
he thinks your favourite professor may
have murdered your favourite dean.

13
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,804
So where do you sit in class?

14
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,350
Up front now seems awkward.

15
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:42,993
But isn't a seat in the back like
hanging an "I think you're guilty" sign?

16
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:44,753
I hope you're not relocating.

17
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:47,302
Oh, Professor.

18
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:48,920
No, I was just...

19
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,293
I know, Veronica,

20
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:52,764
It's kind of a weird situation,

21
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:55,397
but I-I don't want you to
think that this disagreement

22
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:59,124
that your father and I are having
will in any way affect things between us.

23
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:03,274
A student like you comes along
once, maybe twice, in a career.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,692
I'm glad that I get to be
the one to mentor you,

25
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:10,542
and I really hope that you don't
forget that amid all this...

26
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:13,350
I won't. Thanks, Dr. Landry.

27
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,390
This doesn't make sense, Keith.

28
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:23,013
Sheriff Mars, actually. I am
acting sheriff now. So, sorry...

29
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,293
Okay.

30
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:25,736
Sheriff.

31
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:28,866
Why am I still here being questioned
by you in that tone of voice?

32
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:29,826
You said

33
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:33,933
that you found my ex-husband's fingerprints
all over Cyrus' computer keyboard.

34
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,665
Steve was clearly unstable.

35
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,828
You found his prints on the keyboard.

36
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:41,647
Isn't that what you people
call a smoking gun?

37
00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:46,176
"Goodbye, cruel world."
That sentiment uses eleven letters.

38
00:01:46,177 --> 00:01:51,355
Unstable ex-husband Steve's prints
are on every key on the keyboard.

39
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:53,985
And, of course, there's the matter of
the gloves found in the incinerator.

40
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:57,297
Did the killer bother to wear
gloves for the murder,

41
00:01:57,298 --> 00:02:00,548
only to take them off and leave
prints all over the computer?

42
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:03,680
So, no, that's not what
we call a smoking gun.

43
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:06,563
I didn't kill Cyrus, Keith.

44
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:08,094
Sheriff Mars.

45
00:02:08,936 --> 00:02:12,057
You said you and Hank Landry
were alone at the Neptune Grand

46
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:13,978
on the evening of your husband's death,

47
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:17,695
but a witness heard two men
fighting in your room at midnight.

48
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,270
You say you never left the hotel,

49
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:24,514
but at 1:30, your car is checked out of
valet and checked back in an hour later.

50
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:28,940
In that time, a phone call is made
between your cell and Landry's.

51
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:33,430
You claim you never left the hotel
and this call concerned toothpaste.

52
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:36,234
Roughly thirty minutes after
your car is checked back in,

53
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:39,187
a student passing near your husband's
window heard the gunshot.

54
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:43,703
Toxicology reports show that your husband
had a large dose of Xanax in his system.

55
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:46,115
The dean's assistant said he was out,

56
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:50,223
but records show you picked up a refill
prescription for him earlier in the evening.

57
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:57,026
It just doesn't add up, Mindy.

58
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:06,284
I believe Hank Landry killed
your husband, Mrs. O'Dell.

59
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:09,824
I believe I can prove it.
My question to you is this:

60
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:11,860
are you gonna take the fall with him?

61
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:20,590
The man who came to the hotel room.

62
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:23,707
That was Cyrus.

63
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,951
He was furious.

64
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:28,487
He had a gun.

65
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,623
Put the gun down, Cyrus.
Let's talk about this.

66
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:33,956
Oh, "Cyrus"? Oh, we're on
a first-name basis now?

67
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:35,771
- I can see how you might be confused...
- Cyrus.

68
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:38,806
...about our relationship, what with
you sleeping with my wife and all.

69
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:41,098
But let me remind you, I'm your boss.

70
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,174
Please, put the gun down

71
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:43,693
- and then we'll talk.
- Cyrus, please!

72
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:45,310
- Please!
- There's nothing to talk about.

73
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,811
You're done, Hank,

74
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:49,201
and I don't mean just at Hearst.
I mean everywhere.

75
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:53,026
No tenure, no more happy days in academia
bedding impressionable students

76
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,924
- and easily charmed wives.
- Cyrus, please.

77
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:56,560
He threatened to end his career?

78
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,642
Well, Hank's career means everything to him.

79
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:03,414
Cyrus could kill him at every
reputable college in the country.

80
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:06,629
Cyrus stormed out, and Hank freaked.

81
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,503
I said that I would go and
try and talk him down.

82
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:13,685
I went to the house, but his car wasn't
there, so I went by his office.

83
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,396
And the phone call?

84
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:17,118
Hank wanted to know how it went.

85
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,506
How did it go?

86
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:21,137
Well, his office window had just been egged,

87
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:23,323
so he wasn't in a good mood.

88
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:25,172
What are you doing here?

89
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:28,548
I'm here to ask you one more time, Cyrus,

90
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,078
to please be merciful.

91
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,578
That's when you gave him the Xanax?

92
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:35,118
I thought it would do him some good.

93
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,548
Three pills

94
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,277
practically left him helpless.

95
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:42,369
I just gave him the bottle.
He handled the dosage.

96
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,347
Look, I was there for five minutes.

97
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:48,054
He yelled, I left, end of story.

98
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,848
What did you tell Landry?

99
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:00,916
Nothing.

100
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,550
When I got back, he wasn't there.

101
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,746
You came to me to prove your
husband was murdered.

102
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:09,223
It didn't occur to you that your
lover might have done it?

103
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:11,795
I knew that Cyrus didn't kill himself.

104
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:14,694
I wanted to know who did,
even if it was Hank.

105
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:16,214
You provided his alibi.

106
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,140
Until you told me about
Hank's bloody clothes,

107
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:20,093
I believed someone else was responsible.

108
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,141
Cyrus had plenty of enemies.

109
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:26,023
You'll testify Hank was worked up?

110
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,090
That he panicked at the
thought of losing his career?

111
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:31,347
Yes.

112
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:37,459
I've known three men in your life,
Mrs. O'Dell. Two are dead.

113
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,949
The great state of California
may see to the third.

114
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,313
How am I supposed to react to that?

115
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:45,315
Reflexively.

116
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:51,366
Don't leave town.

117
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,893
Many agencies requesting
criminal profiles are unified

118
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:59,949
by the misperception that
the profiling process can somehow

119
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,970
circumvent the work of analyzing physical
evidence on a particular case...

120
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:08,040
Uh...

121
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,828
Review conducted by Horvath and Meesig

122
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:17,884
determined that physical evidence is
used less than 25% in the cases-

123
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,841
All right, then. May I ask
what this is all about?

124
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:29,614
I'm going to arrest you, Dr. Landry.
You should feel free to dismiss your class.

125
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:33,258
There's no reason for the students
to see you led out of here in cuffs.

126
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,911
Class, the acting sheriff has some
questions he'd like to ask about a case,

127
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,970
so I'm gonna let you go early.

128
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,479
Uh, read chapter six by next class.

129
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,780
Veronica Mars

130
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,815
3×15 "Papa's cabin"

Transcript: Inigo [vmtranscripts.com]
Synchro: Camilla, Michele [veronicamars.it]

132
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Vieni a trovarci!

veronicamars.it

134
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:26,422
Say it again, please, into the microphone.

135
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:32,314
I'm happy to answer questions
without a lawyer present.

136
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,230
Mindy flipped on you.

137
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:37,114
I don't believe you.

138
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:40,215
She says she went back to
the dean's office that night.

139
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:43,156
She talked to her husband,
gave him his Xanax.

140
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:45,317
When she got back, you were gone.

141
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:49,366
The dean was murdered at three a.m.

142
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,517
You sure you don't want a lawyer?

143
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,997
Mindy said the dean visited your hotel room.

144
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:00,906
She says he threatened
to destroy your career,

145
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:03,848
and she went back to his office
to try and plead for you.

146
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,924
That's what she said?

147
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:09,860
That's all she said about his visit?

148
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:11,407
Well...

149
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:14,283
the dean did more than threaten me.

150
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:18,786
No more happy days of academia bedding
down impressionable students

151
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:21,146
- and easily charmed wives.
- Stop it. If you just put the gun away-

152
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:21,907
And you!

153
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:25,556
You will find your things on the
lawn tomorrow morning, okay?

154
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:28,274
I'm so sorry I didn't take my friends'
advice about marrying you,

155
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,488
but thank god I took their
advice about a pre-nup.

156
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:34,247
We are done, and you get nothing,
you hear me?! Nothing!

157
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,586
She didn't go back to save me, Keith.

158
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:38,618
She went back to save herself.

159
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,292
She was back at the hotel room
by the time the dean was dead.

160
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,943
The ex-husband, Batando.

161
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:44,742
It's not looking like Batando.

162
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,567
A maintenance worker found
something interesting

163
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,668
while cleaning out the
incinerator at Hearst.

164
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,040
You want to fill me in?

165
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,224
A bag...

166
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:59,113
containing a dress shirt
and gloves... yours...

167
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:02,609
covered in O'Dell's blood.

168
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:10,594
Mindy.

169
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:14,206
She set me up.

170
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,191
She can get to my clothes.

171
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,423
I don't know how she got her
car back to the hotel, but-

172
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:20,852
Her alibi checks out.

173
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,982
How about you finally tell me

174
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:26,174
where you were at three a.m.
the night of December 10th?

175
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:29,423
I left the hotel and drove home alone.

176
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,923
I stopped at a convenience
store for cigarettes.

177
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:35,128
You charge them?

178
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:36,745
No.

179
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:40,675
And the clerk didn't even
look up from his little TV set.

180
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,089
Wait.

181
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,874
Can I bum one of those?

182
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:51,551
Here.

183
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:53,949
Take two. I don't really smoke.

184
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,291
So, this mystery woman, anything
you can tell me about her?

185
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,078
Uh, late thirties, early forties.

186
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:00,969
Brunette.

187
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,532
I don't suppose you can tell me

188
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,672
how your clothes ended up
covered in the dean's blood?

189
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:09,849
I suggest you find a lawyer,
a very good one.

190
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,400
You're a smart man.
You got to see I have a case.

191
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:22,404
Professor Landry.

192
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,061
Tim.

193
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:28,208
Of course. It's always Tim.

194
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,057
What's going on?

195
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:32,300
They think you killed the dean.

196
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:33,542
I didn't.

197
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:38,409
Their case is...

198
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,569
Just...

199
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,297
There are two things you can do, though.

200
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,428
- I found a bug in my phone.
- A bug?

201
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:51,330
I need to find out who put it there
and how long it's been there.

202
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:52,384
Okay.

203
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:54,999
What else?

204
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,988
I need you to find a needle in a haystack.

205
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:33,239
What the hell are you doing?

206
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:36,035
I'm...

207
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,003
I'm...

208
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:40,523
Formulating a lie, realising it's futile,
begrudgingly telling the truth?

209
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:43,768
I'm trying to help Landry, okay?

210
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:48,127
He gave-he gave your father the bug
that someone planted in his phone.

211
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:49,757
I'm hoping it will-it will lead to Mindy.

212
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:51,914
How is it gonna lead to Mindy?

213
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:53,098
I don't know.

214
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:54,906
Uhm, serial numbers?

215
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:57,320
- They don't have serial numbers.
- Well, I didn't know!

216
00:11:58,154 --> 00:11:59,455
There's got to be a way.

217
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,282
How would you do it?

218
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:02,377
Well, first

219
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:04,972
I'd break into someone's office,
act really weaselly,

220
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:06,142
and then ask their advice.

221
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:08,810
Pardon my manners, Veronica,
but I'm a little desperate.

222
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,223
Landry... he didn't kill the dean.
Mindy's framing him.

223
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:17,060
He's a great man. I'm gonna do
everything I can to help him.

224
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:21,036
He has an alibi. He was at a convenience
store at the time of the murder.

225
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:23,552
And he's got the credit-card
receipt to prove it?

226
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:24,207
No,

227
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,101
but he-but he talked to a woman.
He gave her a cigarette.

228
00:12:26,102 --> 00:12:29,360
I- I know it means nothing, but
your dad doesn't believe him.

229
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:32,113
He's not looking for the witness.
I'm his only hope...

230
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,595
Unless you help me.

231
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:38,051
You want my help?

232
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:40,939
Well, I... I need it.

233
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,876
I'm not... I'm not good in the field.

234
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:46,079
I am more of a thinker.

235
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,950
I have to find this woman, talk to her.

236
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:53,779
You might be an asset.

237
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,751
I don't konw. Maybe...

238
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:02,892
I don't know. Lots of
people come through here.

239
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:07,113
I don't, like, memorise their
faces or anything. Sorry.

240
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:09,178
How long do you keep the surveillance tapes?

241
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,523
Um, like, no long.

242
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,395
It's not hooked up. It's just for show.

243
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:15,859
You usually work the night shift?

244
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,916
Yes.

245
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,524
You gonna buy anything?

246
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:24,712
This is ridiculous.

247
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:27,373
- Welcome to "in the field."
- Well, it just seems hopeless.

248
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,432
We have no idea who this woman is.

249
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,407
She could've just been driving through town,

250
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,620
or she could live next door and
gone on vacation for a year.

251
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:37,659
Or...

252
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,782
she could have been a down-on
her-luck catholic schoolgirl

253
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:42,943
smuggling cantaloupes in her shirt.

254
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:47,912
So, are they, like, shooting a
Mötley Crüe video here or-

255
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:51,283
Strip City's just across the street.
Three o'clock's the shift change.

256
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:57,095
It's not like Buckcherry wrote
it for Tory. I have seniority.

257
00:13:57,096 --> 00:14:00,476
Excuse me. Hi. Um, have you seen this guy?

258
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:04,805
It would have been here, eight weeks
and two days ago to be exact.

259
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:07,133
What are you,

260
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:09,018
some kind of little detective
team or something?

261
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,199
- Well, as a matter of fact, we happen to be-
- We're just...

262
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,766
trying to find my dad.

263
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,172
He left home again without paying the rent.

264
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,193
I'm sure there's a valid reason,

265
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:20,724
- but if we could just find-
- Yeah, there's a valid reason.

266
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:21,887
Men are scum.

267
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:23,825
Mystery solved.

268
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:25,634
Except for you, Randy.

269
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:29,084
Let me see.

270
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:31,597
No. I'd remember that one.

271
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:32,812
Two months ago?

272
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:36,104
Any of you maybe bum a cigarette off him?

273
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:37,646
Do we look like we smoke?

274
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:38,917
Yes.

275
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:41,109
It's bad for your skin.

276
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,998
Sorry, we didn't see him, but try tomorrow.

277
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,947
Tory's on, and she smokes
like a big, old slutty chimney.

278
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:54,470
Hey!

279
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,547
Hey.

280
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:57,130
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

281
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,879
How was Econ?

282
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,505
Uh, Econ?

283
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:05,153
Tuesdays and Thursdays Econ?
That class about economics.

284
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,565
Oh, yeah. I flaked.

285
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:09,451
But we agreed no lectures on
college responsibility.

286
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:10,181
Nope.

287
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:12,519
I just- I thought that was
your only class today.

288
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:14,346
Yeah.

289
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,233
And at the bottom,

290
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:29,019
and we're done.

291
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:38,636
Regency Life Insurance is very
sorry for your loss, Mrs. O'Dell.

292
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:46,165
Well, that means a lot.

293
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,380
Good afternoon, ma'am.

294
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,871
You maybe interested in buying a boat?

295
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,182
Yes.

296
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:57,002
I want that one.

297
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:03,230
All right. So, I'm a guy, and I don't
know or care about this stuff...

298
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,727
but I feel like I'm supposed
to tell you this.

299
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:07,077
I'm starting to get a moustache?

300
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,249
No.

301
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,798
Then why are you staring at my lip?

302
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,946
- Because you just made me.
- Stop!

303
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,544
I saw Logan and Parker having lunch.

304
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:16,730
Here?

305
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:17,852
Yeah.

306
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,430
In the cafeteria?

307
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:20,923
At lunchtime?

308
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:23,796
God, why doesn't he just
run me over with a truck?

309
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:28,204
Man, I'm just telling you this because
it looked like it was something,

310
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:29,856
like they were...

311
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:32,079
connecting, you know?

312
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:34,595
What?

313
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:36,953
I'm just trying to figure out
which Gilmore Girl you are.

314
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:41,133
I know he says he doesn't eat them,

315
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,398
but leave a jelly if you know
what's good for you.

316
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:46,133
The last time you said that,
you didn't actually get any jellies.

317
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:48,257
I almost had a heart attack.

318
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:08,662
Are you in trouble?

319
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:12,862
Has anyone told you you look very
convincing behind that desk?

320
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:14,563
So, is that a no on the trouble?

321
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,854
I'm just saying I like it better
when we're not civilians.

322
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:21,799
Speaking of, if I'm gonna be able
to run red lights with impunity,

323
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,108
I think a siren would be helpful.

324
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,881
Care to tell me where you
got Landry's case file?

325
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:30,632
The filing cabinet?

326
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,301
I'm hoping his testimony
might help us find his alibi.

327
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,193
Veronica...

328
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:40,376
Between his bloody clothes
and Mindy's testimony,

329
00:17:40,377 --> 00:17:42,496
things are not looking too
great for Professor Landry.

330
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,744
Well, they'll look better
when we find this alibi,

331
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:46,348
which we will.

332
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,711
Keith, DA's on line two.

333
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:50,775
Okay.

334
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:55,757
But you might also get used to the fact
that he might have done it, sweetie. Just...

335
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,276
consider it.

336
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,308
This is Keith Mars.

337
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:03,941
Mindy O'Dell?

338
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:05,675
Wasn't her deposition-

339
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,121
What do you mean, missing?

340
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,782
Isn't that all the proof they need?

341
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:16,037
I mean, why would Mindy leave
if she weren't guilty?

342
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:18,288
She's still got an alibi for
the time of the murder,

343
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:21,553
although we know she gave him the Xanax.
Maybe she set him up for the killer.

344
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:23,167
What, like maybe Batando?

345
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,840
He is a guy who can be bought.

346
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:26,397
Or it could be anyone.

347
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,343
Everyone hated the dean.

348
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:30,694
Not everyone.

349
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:34,522
Strippers ahoy.

350
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:44,097
The one with the cigarette.
I'll bet that's Tory.

351
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:46,248
Ooh, you are a thinker.

352
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:47,987
Let's see how you do in the field.

353
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,948
If you're wondering where I am,

354
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:04,362
I'm hanging out outside a convenience store

355
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:06,509
eating corn nuts and watching strippers.

356
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,012
Are you doing drugs?

357
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,390
- No
- Good.

358
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,542
So, Mindy definitely split town.

359
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:14,450
She shipped her kids to her
parents in Surrey, England.

360
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:17,518
Which shouldn't be a problem
since you know Landry did it.

361
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,290
No comment.

362
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:21,922
Now... It's three a.m. Can I expect
you home anytime soon?

363
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:25,915
Got to go.

364
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,419
Out of corn nuts. Bye.

365
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:32,426
Excuse me. Can I ask you a quick question?

366
00:19:32,427 --> 00:19:33,925
Have you ever seen this guy?

367
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:38,613
A few months ago.
He gave me a cigarette. Why?

368
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:46,794
So, you say you saw Hank Landry
the night of December 10th?

369
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:48,828
I bummed a cigarette from him.

370
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,839
You remember some guy you met
in a parking lot two months ago?

371
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,077
He actually looked kind of like
the guy I just broke up with,

372
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:56,548
and it kind of freaked me out.

373
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,734
I mean, what kind of loser breaks up with
a girl two weeks before Christmas?

374
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:03,656
And you're sure you saw Landry
at exactly 3:30 that morning?

375
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:04,611
Around there, yeah.

376
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:06,297
Were you wearing a watch, Miss...?

377
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,661
I stop there sometimes when my shift ends.

378
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,408
Hey, you know, I just came in here because

379
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:15,748
they said the guy was in trouble.
I don't care if you believe me or not.

380
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:20,911
Thanks, you guys.

381
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,740
I wish there were a grade higher than an A.

382
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:26,406
Mindy's disappeared.

383
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:28,767
She got her insurance money and vanished.

384
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:31,503
We think there's a chance she's
working with Steve Batando.

385
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:34,946
- If you want, we can keep-
- No.

386
00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:37,050
No, you've done too much already.

387
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:39,996
Thanks again. Terrific work.

388
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:45,840
If I had to bet, I'd bet my dad
isn't gonna leave it at that.

389
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,652
We have to find those tapes.

390
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:50,486
If Mindy was working with Batando,

391
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:53,482
I bet Steve was the one planting
the bug in Landry's phone,

392
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,678
an insurance policy in case things went bad.

393
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,960
Batando's keys are still in evidence.

394
00:20:57,961 --> 00:21:00,200
- Is there any way we get ahold-
- "Is there any way?"

395
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:13,978
There's nothing here.

396
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,310
What?

397
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:18,627
Nice gloves.

398
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:20,748
You headed to the parlour to strangle
Colonel Mustard after this?

399
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:23,490
We're breaking and entering.
I can't leave prints.

400
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,816
Use your sleeve. It's less creepy.

401
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:27,453
So...

402
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,258
where else would you hide illicit...

403
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,955
recordings?

404
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:38,523
I didn't know Night Ranger
had this many albums.

405
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:41,738
Well...

406
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:44,839
So, there's these dvds.

407
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,998
Does he have A Bug's Life?

408
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,187
Nope.

409
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,749
But he does have Taps.

410
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:07,076
Um... December 10th, 1:30 a.m.

411
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,678
The night of the murder.

412
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:09,980
Hello

413
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:11,275
Mindy, for God's sake, come back.

414
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:13,384
Hank, I-I have to go.

415
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:16,284
Mindy, don't be stupid. He's not
exactly in control of himself,

416
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:17,557
- and he's got a gun.
- I won't let this happen.

417
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:19,812
I won't let him take everything.
I just won't.

418
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:21,520
- Damn it, I'll take care of this.
- How?

419
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:24,180
Just... I will, Mindy.

420
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:25,587
- Don't worry.
- No.

421
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:27,458
No, Hank, I can't risk it.

422
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:32,402
Anything else from that night?

423
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,873
What's that one?

424
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:37,976
It's, uh, it's that day.

425
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:40,015
Probably just another...

426
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:41,619
Hello.

427
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,916
Hey, Hank, Bob Reid at Pepperdine.

428
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:47,798
I'm calling about a job application we got
from your teaching assistant, Tim Foyle.

429
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,450
He put you as a reference,
so I'm calling for your thoughts.

430
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:51,184
Yeah.

431
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:55,861
Well, um, Tim is loyal and hardworking.

432
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:58,436
A good TA, kind of a kiss-ass.

433
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:01,435
Very linear thinker. No imagination.

434
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:04,587
You could do worse, but,
honestly, Bob, at Pepperdine,

435
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:06,184
I'm sure you could do better.

436
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,383
Tim...

437
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:13,413
No, it's fine.

438
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,881
It- it doesn't matter.

439
00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:20,569
No, sir.

440
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,746
I'm just saying if your judge had given
me the warrant to tap his phone,

441
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:25,413
we wouldn't be having this problem.

442
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:28,943
And I asked for an ankle tracker. Bye.

443
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,494
Did you talk to the airports?

444
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,889
L.A.X., yeah, but I'm still waiting
to hear from John Wayne.

445
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:37,555
And you're not gonna, pilgrim,

446
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,138
'cause what I am is dead.

447
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:41,771
What are you doing here, Veronica?

448
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:43,180
I'm bringing you this.

449
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:47,535
It's a recording of Mindy and Landry's
phone call from the night of the murder.

450
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:49,660
It really sounds like she did it, Dad.

451
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,179
I really think Professor Landry is innocent.

452
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,767
Well, I'm glad you do, honey, but right now
I'm more concerned with finding him.

453
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:58,445
- Wait. Finding Landry?
- Yeah. He disappeared, too.

454
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:32,456
So, you finally got that boat
that you always wanted.

455
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,490
Hi. My name's Carrie and I read one
of your books. I really enjoyed it...

456
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:41,750
I'm into hour three of listening to the
recordings off Landry's cell phone,

457
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:43,070
trying to find one that will connect Mindy

458
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:48,222
and what I'm now afraid is her partner,
Professor Landry, to the dean's murder,

459
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:50,013
or, just as importantly,

460
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:51,643
discover where they might have gone.

461
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:55,142
Oh, all this sneaking around
is driving me crazy.

462
00:24:55,143 --> 00:24:56,051
I wish we could just...

463
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:58,189
- take a time-out.
- Yeah,

464
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,390
tell me about it.

465
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:00,690
A week at Papa's cabin?

466
00:25:00,691 --> 00:25:03,729
Oh, God, baby, that would be so great.

467
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:09,924
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

468
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:14,159
Do you know if Landry's father
or his grandfather has a cabin?

469
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,498
A cabin? I don't know, why?

470
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:20,314
They mention it on the tapes,
"Papa's cabin", like a getaway spot.

471
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:22,645
Well, I've never heard of a cabin,
but we can poke around.

472
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,213
Uh, meet me at his house.
I've still got his key.

473
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:26,214
Bye.

474
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:30,409
- Hey.
- Hey.

475
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,824
Long time, no see.

476
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:34,178
Yeah. What's up?

477
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:35,553
Nothing.

478
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:38,146
No, it's just, uh, it's...
it's kind of weird.

479
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:40,027
Um, I don't know if you know,

480
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:43,859
but, um, Logan and I... we're sort of,

481
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,184
I don't know, hanging out...

482
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:50,390
Actually, Parker, I'm just running out.
Is it okay if we catch up later?

483
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:51,854
Yeah. Okay.

484
00:25:56,862 --> 00:25:58,974
So, guess who went to a class today?

485
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,825
Me. And guess what? I learned.

486
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:06,466
You don't seem your
very usual ebullient self.

487
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:07,928
Actually, Logan,

488
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:10,656
I've to, um...

489
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,188
I don't know.

490
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:14,342
What?

491
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:17,405
Having a friend like Veronica...
that's important to me.

492
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:21,149
I'm just worried, you know?

493
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,653
Yeah.

494
00:26:24,738 --> 00:26:26,155
I know.

495
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:32,832
Okay.

496
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,470
So, I guess it's true.

497
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:41,094
Little future murderers play with
dinosaurs like everyone else

498
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:43,407
and have cuddly, old grandpas.

499
00:26:44,346 --> 00:26:45,695
Hey, Tim!

500
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:47,622
I may have something.

501
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:48,702
Me too.

502
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:53,913
This was on the fridge.

503
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:57,137
Looks more like a bar.
Do you think they remodelled?

504
00:26:57,692 --> 00:26:59,241
You think this is the same place?

505
00:27:00,598 --> 00:27:01,934
What's that?

506
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:04,352
Oh, it was in the office... trash.

507
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,098
What's he doing with a
disposable cell phone?

508
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,586
Get a pen and paper.

509
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:12,926
- Wait. What are you do-
- Redial.

510
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:15,451
Hello?

511
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,276
Hi! This is K-RAC fm.

512
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:21,748
Congratulations! You may
have just won a new iPod.

513
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:23,915
To claim your prize, press "pound."

514
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:30,834
Please hold.

515
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:31,835
Oh, oh, oh!

516
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,934
So you get the phone number,
then we look it up,

517
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:36,287
and then you track down the address, right?

518
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:37,964
That's one way to do it.

519
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:40,764
Hi, it's Anna from K-RAC. How are you?

520
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:42,414
Good. Is this real?

521
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:44,866
If you can tell me our call number.

522
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:47,309
Yeah. 103.1 fm.

523
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,669
And you win!

524
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,227
I just need you to confirm
your name and address,

525
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:54,731
and the K-RACing good-time van
will show up with your iPod.

526
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:58,620
Sure. J.D. Sansone. 18 Emberwood, Number 8.

527
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:08,568
J.D. Sansone?

528
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:10,772
Yeah. Are you the radio people?

529
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,313
My name is Miss Crockett.
This is my partner,

530
00:28:13,314 --> 00:28:14,621
Mr. Tubbs.

531
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:16,932
We're here conducting an investigation.

532
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,400
An official investigation.

533
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:20,319
For what?

534
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,785
How do you know Hank Landry?

535
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:24,186
From, like, the juvie board.

536
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:25,092
Can you explain?

537
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:28,582
Just me and my buddies got nabbed stealing
cough syrup from a drugstore.

538
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,481
J.D.! Homework!

539
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:31,824
Now!

540
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:33,501
Who is it?

541
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:36,367
Mom, this is Crockett and,

542
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:38,184
uh, Tubbs, yeah.

543
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:40,586
They're doing an investigation.

544
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:47,145
So, it was blackmail?

545
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:49,481
Hank was on the juvie board
overseeing her son.

546
00:28:49,482 --> 00:28:52,075
The kid was one strike
away from foster care.

547
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,390
She says she was on her
lunch break the other day

548
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:56,463
and Hank called and threatened
to take the kid off probation

549
00:28:56,498 --> 00:28:58,789
unless she showed up at
that convenience store

550
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,989
and said she saw Landry
the night of the murder.

551
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:02,508
And Landry?

552
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:06,171
Still gone. No leads.
We're kind of busy, so if you two...

553
00:29:06,206 --> 00:29:08,183
That's why we wanted to bring you these.

554
00:29:10,393 --> 00:29:13,960
On the tapes Batando had,
Landry referred to "Papa's cabin."

555
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,175
Like it was a getaway or hideout.

556
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:18,028
So, we searched his house for
ideas where that might be.

557
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:20,212
No property records, but we found these.

558
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:22,390
We're not sure if this is
the same place or not.

559
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:23,902
Do we know anything about Landry's dad?

560
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:25,247
Grandfather. He called him "Papa."

561
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:27,100
Brewer Landry lives in Florida.

562
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:28,729
This doesn't look like Florida.

563
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:32,027
It looks like the mountains.
Those are aspen trees.

564
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:34,942
Quaking aspens, so western mountains.

565
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:38,237
And on this one, you can actually
make out the license plate on this truck:

566
00:29:38,238 --> 00:29:39,543
navy letters on white.

567
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:41,935
The most common pattern,
so it could be anywhere:

568
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:44,415
Virginia, Alabama, Illinois, Kansas.

569
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,666
Quaking aspens, Western U.S.

570
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:47,592
Okay. So, uh,

571
00:29:47,593 --> 00:29:50,668
Oregon, Washington,
Wisconsin, Utah, or California.

572
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:52,529
California has red state letters.
So does Washington.

573
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,195
Not on the endangered
animals specialised plates.

574
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:56,908
That could be a whale.

575
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:00,417
Or a lake... As in crater lake,
a specialised Oregon plate.

576
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:02,830
Or "Papa" could be Ernest Hemingway.

577
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,453
Papa's Cabin.

578
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:18,551
"Papa's Cabin, Cabo San Lucas.

579
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:21,992
Unwind at the hideaway once
beloved by Ernest Hemingway."

580
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:52,147
Anything?

581
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:54,044
A pretty positive ID from the manager.

582
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:57,036
The guy didn't rent the room.
Just paid to moor boat.

583
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:46,804
Hello?

584
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:56,070
I didn't kill him, Keith.

585
00:31:56,071 --> 00:31:58,025
You must know this little trip to Mexico

586
00:31:58,026 --> 00:32:01,306
might lead me to take that
statement with a grain of salt.

587
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:03,110
It was her.

588
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,740
Mindy?

589
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:06,079
She did it, Keith.

590
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,652
All I did for her and she set me up.

591
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:11,611
- What did you-
- I tried to cover for her,

592
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:13,316
put it on Batando.

593
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:15,512
The keyboard?

594
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:17,848
Yeah, I just switched it with the dean's.

595
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:18,921
It might have worked, too.

596
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,904
But then you took over as sheriff.

597
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:26,450
Where is she, Hank? Where's Mindy?

598
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,932
There was an accident.

599
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:31,933
I just wanted to talk,

600
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:36,122
find out how she could turn on me like that.

601
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:38,347
She must have thought I was gonna kill her.

602
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,854
We fought...

603
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:43,954
and I hit her,

604
00:32:43,955 --> 00:32:45,809
and she fell...

605
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:49,257
Over.

606
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:53,247
It was dark.

607
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,401
I looked, but...

608
00:32:57,552 --> 00:32:58,802
But what?

609
00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:02,007
Where is she, Hank?

610
00:33:02,008 --> 00:33:04,710
I swear.

611
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:08,259
I swear, Keith, it was an accident.

612
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:27,539
Mars.

613
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:30,006
We're on a last-name basis now?

614
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:32,382
We skipped right over androgynous nicknames?

615
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:34,821
I tried calling you "Chuckles,"
but it didn't stick.

616
00:33:35,822 --> 00:33:37,834
You know, some people are afraid of you.

617
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:41,000
Huh. So, what's up, Echolls?

618
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:42,671
Nothing. Just, uh...

619
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:47,051
I wanted to...

620
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:49,903
ask you about something.
You know, it's kind of weird, but...

621
00:33:52,228 --> 00:33:53,831
you know, I was thinking
of asking Parker out,

622
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,539
and I wanted to make sure
it was cool with you.

623
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:57,439
Veronica!

624
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,645
Are you coming in?

625
00:33:58,646 --> 00:34:00,507
Yeah, uh, one second.

626
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,222
Of course!

627
00:34:03,223 --> 00:34:05,182
Thank you for asking.

628
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:06,846
Sure. I know we're friends.

629
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:08,526
Yeah.

630
00:34:10,806 --> 00:34:12,358
See ya.

631
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,935
And good luck.

632
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,469
Oh, uh, thanks for coming in.

633
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,225
Yeah.

634
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:29,574
So since Landry's been,
you know, arrested...

635
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:34,355
Well, it's kind of caught
everyone, uh, by surprise,

636
00:34:34,356 --> 00:34:36,205
including me, as you know.

637
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:39,942
Yeah. It kind of caught
everyone by surprise.

638
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:43,358
Anyway, I've been asked to take over his
classes until they can find a replacement,

639
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,947
and, uh, it's kind of a big job,
and as you are kind of a...

640
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:51,097
Star pupil, I was hoping you might,

641
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:53,501
uh, be my TA...

642
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,589
While I try to get a handle on all this.

643
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,925
'Cause I could really use the help.

644
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:01,639
Of course.

645
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,727
Great.

646
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:07,728
Can you pick up my dry cleaning?

647
00:35:12,546 --> 00:35:14,989
So, as you probably know,

648
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,107
uh, Professor Landry is no longer with us.

649
00:35:19,108 --> 00:35:22,256
I will be your instructor
for the time being.

650
00:35:22,257 --> 00:35:25,107
So if you'll take your handouts
from the Webber text-

651
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:26,202
Yes.

652
00:35:26,403 --> 00:35:28,261
What happened?

653
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:29,276
What do you mean?

654
00:35:29,277 --> 00:35:31,874
I mean, our professor murdered the dean.

655
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,364
Can't we discuss that?

656
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:37,328
I mean, this is criminology, right?

657
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,658
Well, it's a little awkward for me...

658
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:45,090
But okay.

659
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:47,305
This is criminology.

660
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:49,101
So...

661
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:52,187
Landry kills O'Dell.

662
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:54,613
A crime of passion?

663
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:56,622
Opportunity?

664
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:59,563
Premeditation? What do we know?

665
00:35:59,564 --> 00:36:01,734
Well, passion clearly was a factor.

666
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:06,028
Dean O'Dell's wife, Mindy, and
Landry were engaged in an affair.

667
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:09,854
The dean caught them, threatened to
ruin them, destroy Landry's career.

668
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:11,952
So motives pretty much a classic-

669
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:15,158
Is it true he got the idea from one
of our perfect-murder papers?

670
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:17,908
Possibly.

671
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,177
Again, opportunity.

672
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,217
The idea in this paper probably
suited the situation.

673
00:36:23,218 --> 00:36:25,738
He knew he had a limited window to act.

674
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:28,753
He knew the dean was drunk and upset,

675
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,292
and he had a gun.

676
00:36:33,088 --> 00:36:37,113
So a fake suicide suited the circumstances.

677
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:41,190
Any chance the dean's wife helped
set him up? He was drugged, right?

678
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:44,230
An anti-anxiety drug, yes,
but he had a prescription.

679
00:36:44,231 --> 00:36:48,408
Now, is it possible they colluded? Yes.

680
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:50,392
Will we ever know?

681
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:54,102
Well, with Mindy dead and Landry
not speaking, probably not.

682
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:57,440
Landry was a smart man, but

683
00:36:57,441 --> 00:37:00,502
the bloody clothes he thought he
incinerated got stuck in a chute,

684
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,767
and once they were found,
everything unravelled.

685
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:06,632
Another interesting thing about this case is

686
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:09,615
once a perpetrator starts improvising,

687
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:11,938
the sloppier his work becomes.

688
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:14,378
They find the bloody clothes,

689
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:18,568
so Landry first tries to frame
Mrs. O'Dell's ex-husband,

690
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,188
and then, when he was
arrested, in this room,

691
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:26,353
as you all remember, he fakes an alibi.

692
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,756
How?

693
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:31,164
He called a woman whose son he oversaw
in the juvenile probation board.

694
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,961
It might have worked, actually,

695
00:37:33,347 --> 00:37:36,418
if the phone he had called them
with hadn't been found.

696
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:39,628
Again, chance.

697
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:43,019
If you remember from reading Holst,

698
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:46,627
80% of-

699
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:50,120
- Veronica!
- When?

700
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:51,793
Uh, when what?

701
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:53,233
When did he call her?

702
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:57,302
L- Landry was arrested here and taken
straight to the sheriff's department.

703
00:37:58,138 --> 00:38:01,950
When did he have the time to make
the blackmail call to fake his alibi?

704
00:38:01,951 --> 00:38:06,441
Well, uh, s-someone mentioned the
possibility that he and Mindy colluded.

705
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:08,091
She could have called while-

706
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:09,528
It was a male voice on the phone.

707
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:12,951
Well, then it's possible he called
earlier, anticipating his arrest.

708
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:16,728
Remember. This is a man who, at this point,
knew his crime had been exposed.

709
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:19,466
He knew Mindy was under investigation

710
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:21,719
and had sent her children
to relatives in England.

711
00:38:23,162 --> 00:38:25,588
He could easily have assumed
that she had turned against him.

712
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:26,478
Anyway,

713
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:29,832
in 80% of cases...

714
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:34,190
The breakthrough evidence was-

715
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:37,075
Was obtained outside the
usual police protocols.

716
00:38:40,773 --> 00:38:43,948
An interesting point of-of Holst,
I think, he makes here, is that...

717
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,070
Veronica

718
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:53,922
How did you know she
sent her kids to England?

719
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,225
I'm actually not sure, but-

720
00:38:57,226 --> 00:38:59,370
So whoever bugged Landry's phone

721
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,532
knew that the dean caught
Mindy and Landry together

722
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:04,345
and that the dean was drunk in his office?

723
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:07,429
Well, if you're suggesting Batando
killed them, it's possible.

724
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,922
If you follow the thread through-

725
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:11,720
So this person would also be
aware that Professor Landry

726
00:39:11,755 --> 00:39:14,896
shot down your chances for
a teaching job at Pepperdine.

727
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:17,100
- Oh, my God.
- Did you hear what she just said?

728
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:19,534
- Yes, if they listened-
- To all the tapes...

729
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,775
Which it sounds like you did.

730
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:25,034
I... I'm

731
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,792
- I'm not sure I understand.
- I do.

732
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:32,247
When my dad called to tell me

733
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:34,588
that Mindy had sent her kids
to relatives in England,

734
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:35,877
you couldn't have heard.

735
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,583
You were in a convenience
store talking to a stripper.

736
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,521
You bugged my phone.

737
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:44,993
You bugged Landry's phone.

738
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:47,812
You knew he shot down your job application.

739
00:39:47,813 --> 00:39:49,236
You knew the dean threatened him.

740
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:53,194
You knew the dean was zonked out
on Xanax and scotch in his office,

741
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:55,599
and you had access to Landry's clothes.

742
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,569
You murdered Dean O'Dell to
destroy Professor Landry...

743
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:03,124
because he used you, then betrayed you.

744
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:05,721
And when he said he
had an alibi, you faked it,

745
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:07,586
so you'd be sure he'd go down...

746
00:40:09,752 --> 00:40:12,719
Bet he'll change his mind about
you not being that smart.

747
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:26,546
And in a shocking development
in a local murder investigation...

748
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:31,422
Timothy Foyle, the teaching assistant
of accused killer Hank Landry,

749
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:34,533
has confessed to the
murder of Cyrus O'Dell...

750
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:36,587
The one big downside of justice:

751
00:40:36,588 --> 00:40:39,368
it feels good, but it
doesn't change anything.

752
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,006
A killer's in jail, but
the dean is still dead,

753
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,767
which remains fundamentally unfair.

754
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,291
You got a confession?

755
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:51,055
I am that good.

756
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:52,663
So it's true what they say.

757
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:54,070
There's a new sheriff in town?

758
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:56,276
Until the special election, anyway.

759
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:00,448
- What you making?
- Meat and potatoes.

760
00:41:00,813 --> 00:41:03,017
I read somewhere that's what real men eat.

761
00:41:03,018 --> 00:41:04,877
Ah, is there a real man coming over?

762
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:07,724
So, what's gonna happen to Landry?

763
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:09,637
He's gonna be tried for manslaughter.

764
00:41:09,638 --> 00:41:11,906
He killed Mindy O'Dell. He confessed, too.

765
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:14,599
Man. You get everyone to confess.

766
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,121
I think it's the uniform.

767
00:41:16,122 --> 00:41:18,312
Do you have anything to confess?

768
00:41:18,513 --> 00:41:20,815
Yes. You embarrass me.

769
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:23,724
Give me my meat, woman.

770
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,055
And in other news, a San Diego businessman

771
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:29,104
was found dead in his Laguna Beach house.

772
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:30,800
Turn that off, will you?

773
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:32,295
The discovery was made by his
private secretary who told

774
00:41:32,296 --> 00:41:34,350
police she discovered the man's body on...

775
00:41:34,351 --> 00:41:36,593
You know I don't like you exposed
to all this crime and violence.

776
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,211
It's gonna warp your mind.

777
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,712
Who am I kidding?

778
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:51,285
Police have yet to make
a ruling on the case.

779
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,488
