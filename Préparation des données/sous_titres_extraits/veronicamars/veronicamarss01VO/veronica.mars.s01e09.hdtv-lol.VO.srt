1
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:02,435
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:06,418
All this time, I've been thinking Mom bolted 'cause she couldn't handle losing everything.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,010
Maybe she just couldn't handle losing me. 

4
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:11,410
Did you know that your dad and my mom were king and queen of the prom?

5
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:12,107
Mr Kane.

6
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,499
Veronica, we meet again.

7
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:14,580
What are the odds?

8
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:17,181
It's been a year since my best friend Lilly Kane was murdered.

9
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:19,173
And I know you're still investigating Lilly's murder.

10
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:21,210
Solve the case and your mom comes home.

11
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:22,762
So let's do it, let's solve the case.

12
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,214
It's the footage of Abel Koontz's arrest.

13
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:27,862
I know who you are Veronica Mars.

14
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:29,756
My dad tried to save your life.

15
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,077
Look in a mirror.

16
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,767
Are you the product of a schluppy sheriff or the king and queen of the prom?

17
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:48,111
So Jake Kane is your father.

18
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:49,719
Deal with it, Veronica.

19
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:52,531
Does Dad know?

20
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:56,196
Did he go after Jake Kane so obsessively because of the affair?

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,432
Oh god, does this mean-

22
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,418
Is Duncan my-

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,326
Those photos that were sent to Mom,

24
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:13,486
the ones with me framed in a gun sight,

25
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:16,333
was that how Jake finally stuck it to Dad,

26
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,439
his old rival.

27
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:20,792
If so, I'm taking this bastard down.

28
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:21,617
Hard.

29
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,588
I don't care whose father he is.

30
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:29,737
This one was taken last year. downtown.

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,032
My sole reason for being in that part of town

32
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:35,123
was that Mom insisted I see a counsellor after Lilly died.

33
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,892
Every Thursday for six weeks, Dr Dave and I stared across an ottoman at each other.

34
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,380
But which Thursday?

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,008
Book week?

36
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,712
Miss Murphy, when was book week?

37
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:53,096
Wow, now there's an attitude I like to see in our post-literate age.

38
00:01:53,223 --> 00:01:55,267
Don't worry, Veronica. It's still months away.

39
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:56,756
Last year's book week?

40
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:59,025
It's always the first week in February.

41
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,799
OK. Now I know which Thursday.

42
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,916
In the picture, I'm standing in this exact spot.

43
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,082
Whoever took those photos had to be sitting at this exact table.

44
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,213
It's the only one where the angle matches.

45
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:16,873
Dated and time-stamped. Gotcha.

46
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:19,035
Can you tell me if you keep all your receipts.

47
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:24,047
Is it possible for you to pull just the ones from February 4th between 4:45 and 5:30?

48
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,551
Someone's been stalking me.

49
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:27,693
My god.

50
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:31,121
I'm positive whoever took these shots was sitting at that table over there.

51
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,459
Clarence Wiedman.

52
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,071
Big mistake paying with a credit card.

53
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:40,512
And there he is.

54
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:43,140
The man who took surveillance photos of me.

55
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:56,067
Well, wouldn't you know?

56
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:05,683
Kane Software? Main number please.

57
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:10,388
The number you requested is 555-0125.

58
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:12,846
Kane Software. How may I direct your call?

59
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,638
Give me Clarence Wiedman, please.

60
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:19,067
You've reached Clarence Wiedman, Head of Security, Kane Software. Please leave a message.

61
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:25,093
And there it is. I know who's responsible for scaring Mom away.

62
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:28,094
So if Jake Kane is my biological father

63
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:31,084
that information is gonna be worth millions.

64
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:33,787
And after what that family has done to mine.

65
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,830
I intend to collect.

66
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:12,412
What happened to you?

67
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:13,304
It's nothing.

68
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:17,267
A little collision at home. Now, cover your eyes and give me your hand.

69
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:21,444
A collision at home? Did you fall in the garbage disposal?

70
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,211
No, no, home plate.

71
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,362
Safe!

72
00:04:24,993 --> 00:04:26,072
Did you see a doctor?

73
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,317
Honey, it's fine.

74
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:30,782
Chicks dig scars, now come on. Ya gotta see this.

75
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:34,408
What is your deal? You're jacked up like some hillbilly kid

76
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:36,390
who just stumbled into Daddy's meth lab.

77
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:37,869
Hey, come on.

78
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:44,346
Sit!

79
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:47,848
It's a water bed.

80
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:49,040
All right.

81
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,706
Come on, you've wanted one of these things since you were, like, five years old.

82
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:57,505
I also wanted to marry Vanilla Ice and build the world's largest collection of Z-bots.

83
00:04:57,572 --> 00:05:01,861
You asked me, no you begged me for a water bed like four years in a row.

84
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:03,664
It was your obsession.

85
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:06,449
It's all coming back to me now.

86
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:10,208
The way you explained it, Santa was cool with the basic concept,

87
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:12,610
but had grave doubts about second floor deployment.

88
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:16,039
That well known, bed-rock pragmatism of elvish culture.

89
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:18,896
But I gotta tell ya. If it had been my call, I would've-

90
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:24,293
You're so full of it but it is incredibly sweet of you.

91
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:26,674
Yard sale, right. Ten bucks maybe.

92
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:27,457
No.

93
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,260
It's okay.

94
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:31,523
You forgot to remove the masking tape price tag sticker.

95
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,917
Besides, our money situation being what it is,

96
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,030
I'm glad you didn't blow your wad on a whim gift for me.

97
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:40,078
Well, you'll be even gladder to know that I got us

98
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,524
a throw in with some old Gordon Lightfoot LPs.

99
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,190
I love you.

100
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:51,471
Yeah, you too.

101
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:56,206
Well, anyway,

102
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,293
sorry it took so long to get Santa's old dead ass in gear.

103
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:02,514
Night, sweetie.

104
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:03,252
Night.

105
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,283
He was as well adjusted a kid as you could ever want to meet.

106
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,682
Ah, secure, extroverted, lots of friends and school activities.

107
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:22,047
Super popular, super focused.

108
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:24,336
Girlfriends, top grades,

109
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,611
not into the drug scene as far as we could tell.

110
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:28,114
Definitely not a druggie.

111
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:32,917
Casey is just not the kind of kid who just up and joins a cult.

112
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:36,485
Well, it's actually the ones who seem to have everything that so often go off-

113
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:40,469
I know what you're thinking. Spoiled rich boy raised in a soulless lap of luxury,

114
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:44,462
no material whim denied, no spiritual need met.

115
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:50,017
Six weeks ago, Casey kisses me goodbye and drives to school, same as always.

116
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,501
But he never comes home.

117
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:56,429
He says he's gone off to live at some place called the Moon Calf Collective

118
00:06:56,504 --> 00:07:00,581
and basically, thanks for all you've done guys but I can take it from here.

119
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:02,219
The Porsche.

120
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:04,978
That's right, the Porsche. He sold his Boxster

121
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:07,155
and gave all the money over to the cult.

122
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,898
Look, Mr Mars, here's what we need

123
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,123
and what we're prepared to pay handsomely for you to do.

124
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,508
- Thank you, Mr Mars. 
- Thank you, you're welcome.

125
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:17,815
- Thank you very much. 
- Thank you.

126
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:24,522
Now what?

127
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,122
I'm trying to draw a blood sample.

128
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:32,361
Our health teacher said she'll give extra credit for anyone taking a self-administered HIV test.

129
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:34,623
I ordered this thing online but...

130
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:38,054
I am seriously punking on this fingerstick.

131
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,918
This is so endearing.

132
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:45,790
My badass, action figure daughter is afraid to draw a teensy little drop of blood.

133
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:50,752
You know, if you really were a good father,

134
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,881
you'd let me draw some of your blood for the test.

135
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,631
Nobody'll know the difference.

136
00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:58,499
Besides, you've been sexually active, I haven't.

137
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:01,719
Oh for crying out loud, you're serious about this, aren't you?

138
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,797
Let me have that.

139
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:06,086
You wuss.

140
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,829
So those are the parents of Casey Gant, you know him?

141
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:11,983
Unfortunately, yeah.

142
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:18,211
He's just another slice off the loaf of shallow vapid pain-in-the-ass 09erdom.

143
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:21,349
Hmm, well, despite your assessment his parents are still a little irked

144
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,950
about his decision to run off and join a cult.

145
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:25,569
He joined a cult?

146
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:27,888
What do they worship?

147
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,818
Wedgies, keggers,

148
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,958
their parents' platinum cards?

149
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,038
It doesn't matter.

150
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:35,835
He's 18 so there's little the law can do.

151
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:38,896
If we get him back, the Gants are offering a five grand bonus

152
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,406
so it's time to focus like the proverbial laser.

153
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:45,542
Target acquired and locked on.

154
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,798
What they'd be paying us for is proof of any unlawful activity out there

155
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:52,244
like firearms, drugs, kidnapping, anything'll work.

156
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:56,002
All we need is a sound legal basis for the Sheriff's Department to shut 'em down.

157
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,322
I'm still with ya.

158
00:08:57,405 --> 00:09:01,773
This boy is a classmate of yours. Maybe you can find something that'll shed some light.

159
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:04,567
You know, his parents say he's still showing up at school.

160
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:08,961
For a five thousand dollar bonus, I'll get you his genetic code.

161
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:11,895
Veronica, do not, under pain of slow,

162
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:15,649
agonising death even think about going to the compound yourself.

163
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,833
I'll run the title search, do the background check,

164
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,203
take the recon shots, all of that,

165
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,799
nous comprenons nous?

166
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:24,925
Mais oui.

167
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,620
Gotcha Frenchie.

168
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:37,126
Okay. So there's no health class extra credit.

169
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:41,299
There is, however, an online company that does paternity testing.

170
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:43,961
I need to know, without a doubt,

171
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,462
who my father is.

172
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:53,305
- Hey.
- I am not ready to face Duncan.

173
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:56,838
Too many sweet memories have become chilling what ifs.

174
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,246
Hacky Sack?

175
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,209
The final arena of unquestioned white domination.

176
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:11,533
New crush?

177
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:12,869
Hardly.

178
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:14,440
That's Casey Gant.

179
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:18,062
He sold his Porsche, joined a cult and took up Hacky Sack.

180
00:10:19,074 --> 00:10:20,294
He looks normal enough.

181
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,997
Not if you knew him before.

182
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:28,117
The prisoners pray when they're on death row.

183
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:30,100
Hear the angels sing.

184
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:33,346
The junkie cries for love but it's all run out.

185
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:36,852
Go on, Eli.

186
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:40,666
When the angels sing, the sins of the world

187
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,796
And it's cold on the streets and you're all alone

188
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,511
And the tears, they start to fall

189
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:48,645
When it all comes down, hear the angels sing.

190
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:53,595
Casey Gant! You can learn good manners or go see Mr Clemmons.

191
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,451
Eli, it's amazing work.

192
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:57,706
You're doing great.

193
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,924
Miss, that's not original poetry.

194
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:01,699
That's a Social Distortion song.

195
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,352
Is that true Eli?

196
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:13,982
I know who'll give me all the dirt I want.

197
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,072
Who?

198
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,326
His ex-girlfriend.

199
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:19,404
I'm as clueless as anyone about this trip he's on.

200
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:24,202
I mean one day, he's totally cool, the next he's like alien lobotomy boy.

201
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,192
Any explanation?

202
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,457
Nothing that made a bit of sense.

203
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:31,984
He started babbling about renouncing the toxic death style

204
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:37,207
of late-stage capitalist society and un-remembering the consumer siren song.

205
00:11:37,883 --> 00:11:40,658
I think compost even came up too, once.

206
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:44,837
It was just so bizarre. I mean, I had to cut him loose.

207
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:50,084
Did he talk about any new friends he'd made, before he started weirding out, I mean?

208
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:52,992
No, but...

209
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:54,824
you know what?

210
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:59,648
I think he's got something going on with Miss Mills.

211
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,639
You mean, like, sexually?

212
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:03,718
Yeah.

213
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,657
It got to where they were doing everything together.

214
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:09,311
He even started working for the literary magazine.

215
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:11,798
I mean, this is the same guy who's been downloading

216
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:14,436
every writing assignment since the seventh grade.

217
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:17,461
He used to think Cliff Notes were for the intellectual posers.

218
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,550
There's no way they're not getting it on. 

219
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,590
Ah, how to get in tight with the lit-mag crowd.

220
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,796
I've got it. Become one of them.

221
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:28,761
The attributes and style of crap teen poetry:

222
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,179
must be written in a funky colour of ink,

223
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,125
must include dominant themes of alienation, sexual ambivalence,

224
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,439
self-loathing, death, etcetera.

225
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,592
Dad!

226
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,314
You're an ex-cop. You know gangland enforcer types.

227
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:49,221
Can't you find someone to intimidate the maintenance supe into fixing the hot water problem?

228
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:51,815
Honey, he swears he's putting all new copper pipes,

229
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,715
new five thousand gallon tank, the works.

230
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:58,483
That nimrod has been feeding us the same line for five months.

231
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,013
Just try to tough it out.

232
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:06,234
Hey, if we get that five grand bonus, maybe we can go look for a new place.

233
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:11,995
Ten-o-five, ladies and gents, time to get cracking.

234
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:16,039
Hope y'all have those editorial content analyses I signed last week. Everybody good?

235
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:19,753
Okay then, let's break into groups of four and start comparing notes.

236
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:33,128
Can you feel the luv?

237
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:39,219
Hey, Veronica!

238
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,492
Miss Mills, what's up?

239
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:45,301
I, um, read the poem you submitted for the literary journal,

240
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:46,550
"I Cut Because I Can".

241
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:47,846
Oh, yeah.

242
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:51,976
Um, there are a bunch I thought about submitting but that one seemed more...

243
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:55,238
I don't know, relevant to where I am now.

244
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,588
So, are you going to publish it?

245
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:00,794
Well, you have a very unique outlook, Veronica.

246
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,273
You know, if you ever feel like sharing, there's a place where you're always welcome to do so.

247
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,040
We're kind of like family.

248
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:12,063
Yeah, I have some friends who work on your literary magazine and they say it's really cool.

249
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:15,407
Actually, I'm, uh, I'm talking about the folks out at the Moon Calf Collective.

250
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:16,866
That's where I live.

251
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:19,789
Something tells me you'd really enjoy visiting.

252
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:23,045
If you'd like I could even take you out there today.

253
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,078
How's that sound?

254
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:28,427
So Miss Mills lures kids out to cult headquarters?

255
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:29,927
That sounds...

256
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:31,743
great.

257
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:35,206
I'm ready to go whenever you are.

258
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:37,843
Wait, what did Dad say about going out there?

259
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:46,173
Come on over.

260
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:50,623
This is all so amazing.

261
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:53,065
I feel like I'm on a movie set or something.

262
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,146
Thank you so much for inviting me Miss Mills.

263
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:57,709
Ah, around here I'm just Holly.

264
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,623
And as far as you can see is all ours.

265
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:03,576
You should take some time later, wander around and get a feel for the place.

266
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,061
Just stay out of the barn;

267
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:07,242
you do not want to go in there, trust me.

268
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:10,040
Hey, way to throw me off your trail, Holly.

269
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:13,150
"Wander freely, don't go in the barn, whatever you do"?

270
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:17,154
Maybe I should play this needy, despondent waif card more often.

271
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:18,240
Come meet my man.

272
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,365
Well, really he kind of owns all of us.

273
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:28,885
Hey.

274
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,730
Forbidden barn? Check.

275
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:40,773
Implied polygamy? Check.

276
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,159
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a cult.

277
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:46,487
Veronica, this is Josh.

278
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,573
Hey there.

279
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:49,089
Hi.

280
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,538
Help.

281
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:56,498
I knew I should have included a few discreet lesbian overtones in that poem.

282
00:15:58,264 --> 00:15:59,759
Hey, Veronica.

283
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:03,378
I heard you were coming but I had to see to believe.

284
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:08,365
Yeah, I don't blame you. This is...off my beaten path a bit.

285
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,269
But now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense that you'd wind up here sooner or later.

286
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:13,982
Yeah.

287
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:17,049
Cool, well I'm sure I'll be seeing a lot more of you

288
00:16:17,162 --> 00:16:18,780
and I'll catch up with you later, okay?

289
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,590
Veronica, it's only a few hours 'til dinner time.

290
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:26,489
Why don't you stay and join us.

291
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:29,664
As you can see, the gardens have really blessed us this year.

292
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:34,406
Sure, that would be great. I'm starving. All I had today was...

293
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:38,016
Beef Mexi-Melt and some Cinnamon Crispas.

294
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:40,955
Those Crispas are awesome, aren't they?

295
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:45,214
Frankly, I'd give my body to anybody for one of those Chocolate Taco Ice Cream deserts.

296
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:49,117
Believe it or not, I think we can raise the culinary bar a bit higher.

297
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:52,306
As you can see, we get a lot done through team work.

298
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:56,402
In fact, if you want to jump in, you're more than welcome, if you're interested.

299
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:58,707
Ah, sure. Fair warning though.

300
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:04,241
My idea of gourmet cooking is sprinkling on some three year old Bacos to my microwave soup.

301
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:09,155
Yeah, same here actually. But most of us are just grunt workers anyways.

302
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:13,171
We find our satisfaction in realizing the visions of chef Django here.

303
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:16,129
The secret ingredient's love.

304
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,166
I'm Rain. Glad to meet you.

305
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:23,978
Veronica. Likewise.

306
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:29,047
So, this thing you're doing seems easy enough, even I can do it. Where do I start?

307
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,689
Actually, I've just about done here but

308
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,058
I'll hook you up with a job that's a little more fun.

309
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,517
That's a good girl, Isis.

310
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:42,783
See Veronica?

311
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:45,395
It's pretty easy once you get the rhythm down.

312
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,764
Easy for you but I'm not getting a freaking drop.

313
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,301
She may be a little nervous.

314
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:58,897
Are you nervous, sweetie?

315
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:03,751
Okay, got the youngest moonie away from the herd. Time to dig up dirt.

316
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:06,696
So I guess you can tell I learned all I know about country life

317
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:08,937
from "Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman" reruns.

318
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:09,839
What do you mean?

319
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:13,811
Well, for example, I was under the assumption that

320
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:17,252
milking takes place in, you know, a barn.

321
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:20,340
Well, sometimes, I guess.

322
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:23,643
But I don't think there's any hard, fast rule though.

323
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:27,759
So Josh is cool, huh?

324
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,448
He's kind of sexy.

325
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:31,322
Really?

326
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:36,258
I hadn't really noticed, but, you're right, he's a great guy.

327
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:38,275
You're really gonna enjoy getting to know him.

328
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:39,643
I'll bet.

329
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:43,160
Holly says it's looking like a kick-ass harvest this year.

330
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,607
I don't think I asked what you guys were growing.

331
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,878
I guess you could say it's the ultimate cash crop.

332
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:50,533
Yahtzee.

333
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:51,905
And what's that?

334
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:53,702
I can't even begin to describe it.

335
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:56,518
But it'll blow your mind.

336
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:06,580
Enough, already with this mellow incense and peppermints vibe.

337
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:08,822
Let's break out the mushrooms and dance naked!

338
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:11,977
Strap on the goat skull headgear, sacrifice a few infants.

339
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:15,328
Come on, people, you're cultists. Start acting like it.

340
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:16,469
Veronica, over here.

341
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:18,597
Hey, Mars!

342
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,344
Why don't you come on over here?

343
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,450
I feel like I gave you the hit and run treatment earlier.

344
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,881
Wow. It's Bizarro world.

345
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,580
Out here I'm Miss Popular.

346
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:31,253
I'm serious.

347
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:35,246
Look, we've been going to classes together for, what, three years?

348
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:38,983
And... I don't think we actually ever really talked.

349
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,721
Lately, I feel like I've been missing out on a lot.

350
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:46,562
Okay.

351
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,941
So how was everybody's day? What's up?

352
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:53,878
I woke up scared.

353
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:02,030
I felt like I was in a dream of peace and happiness...

354
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:04,885
Do not roll your eyes, Veronica. You're undercover.

355
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,059
It's strange, isn't it?

356
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,892
How we believe more in the reality of...

357
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:09,858
Pain.

358
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,811
...suddenly I realised I was conscious only of my own voice and delivery.

359
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,523
I was like directing myself in a play...

360
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:19,919
I have to watch that all the time myself.

361
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:21,076
This is scary.

362
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,633
I'm 32 years old and I feel like I'll never have a better moment than this.

363
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:26,780
Veronica Mars.

364
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:29,544
Hey, how 'bout a big Moon Calf welcome for the honoured guest.

365
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,353
Veronica's a writer, a poet.

366
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:42,365
She has a unique voice I think you'd all appreciate.

367
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:47,156
Would you honour us with the one you showed me earlier?

368
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:51,802
I was just reading in last month's "Koreshian Bride" that four out of five cult leaders

369
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:56,116
like their handmaidens nubile, flighty, and teetering on the edge of a breakdown.

370
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:58,463
Go for it, Veronica.

371
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:01,647
I'm sorry, I have to go.

372
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,792
There. That performance should have them asking me back.

373
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:31,916
Veronica! Are you all right?

374
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:35,147
Oh, god, I'm so sorry everybody.

375
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,570
I was freaked out and just wanted someplace to sit

376
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:39,504
and pull myself together before driving.

377
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:40,944
Oh, it's my fault, Veronica.

378
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:44,215
I shouldn't have teased you earlier with all that stuff about the forbidden barn.

379
00:21:45,075 --> 00:21:46,714
This is a little project we're undertaking.

380
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:48,926
One of our neighbours was going to put down Hildegard here.

381
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:50,732
We're nursing her back.

382
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:52,996
Slowly but surely.

383
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:05,191
You're covered in mud.

384
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,608
See? That's why you make the big bucks.

385
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:10,557
So what'd you find out about my boy, Casey?

386
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,532
His ex-girlfriend confirms what his parents said.

387
00:22:13,742 --> 00:22:15,442
He's a full blooded cultist.

388
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:20,778
I can't get it out of my mind.

389
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:25,779
Somewhere in Pennsylvania, a lab tech is determining if I'm heir to a billion dollar fortune.

390
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:29,179
It's not about the money, it's about making Jake Kane pay.

391
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:30,556
But if I am an heiress,

392
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:34,633
as God is my witness I'll never take cold showers again.

393
00:22:37,502 --> 00:22:38,353
Casey!

394
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:40,381
Hey. Wait up.

395
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:42,413
I'm so ashamed of myself...

396
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:44,389
for my meltdown last night.

397
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,765
I was a rampaging jackass.

398
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,724
Have you forgotten who you're talking to?

399
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:52,318
I'm Casey Gant, okay?

400
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:56,889
I wrote the jackass Bible, the jackass Koran, the jackass Talmud.

401
00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:01,128
Why don't you come back out? It'd mean a lot to me.

402
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:04,410
Of course, if I'm not an heiress, Dad and I could really use this five grand

403
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:08,342
and if it means me having to save this homely boy from cultists, so be it.

404
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:12,867
Veronica. I can't tell you how happy I am to see you again.

405
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:17,486
I guess, uh, you can see everyone else feels the same way?

406
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,163
Get your game face on, Mars.

407
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:23,155
I'm floored.

408
00:23:23,523 --> 00:23:25,838
Hey, listen, would you like to join me for a walk?

409
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:32,626
I knew it. This is when the cult leader claims me as his new bride.

410
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:39,672
I'm not judging you, I'm just, I'm saying what you already know.

411
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,633
That fake fur was a poor choice to infiltrate utopia?

412
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:44,823
You've built this fortress around yourself.

413
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:47,326
Now, it does offer a limited amount of protection but

414
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:51,259
it also keeps other people and all they have to offer at bay, starving your soul.

415
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,081
Now, you might want to consider...

416
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:56,861
opening yourself up. Letting other people inside.

417
00:23:56,942 --> 00:24:00,724
Let other people inside? Got anyone particular in mind?

418
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:03,162
Maybe if I discreetly flash Mr Taser...

419
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:07,192
So, has anyone told you what we grow here?

420
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,480
I heard it was the ultimate cash crop.

421
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:11,560
That it is.

422
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:15,542
Impressive, isn't it?

423
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,320
Aren't these poinsettias?

424
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,397
And Christmas is right around the corner.

425
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:23,919
See, we never would have been able to finish off the greenhouse if Casey hadn't given us that money.

426
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:29,126
I wish I wasn't so broke right now, otherwise, I'd try to chip in too.

427
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:32,193
Oh, well our goal isn't to be a charity case.

428
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:35,342
I mean, it's not that we have anything against money, it's just,

429
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:37,523
it's kind of like water, you know?

430
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,889
Lots of symbolic power but really just a lifeless substance when you get right down to it

431
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,349
but the paradox is that life as we know it would be impossible without it,

432
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:46,632
if you see what I'm saying.

433
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,063
You're saying you don't want my money, you don't want my body,

434
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:52,889
you don't want me working in your ganja fields, you just want me to be happy.

435
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:53,891
Strange.

436
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:17,715
Hey, listen up everybody. This is important.

437
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:21,202
We've got South of the County Water Department who's out here to check for lead in the pipes

438
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:23,614
so try not to use the water for the next fifteen to minutes, all right?

439
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:44,754
That's it. I'm dead.

440
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:58,566
There ya are. What the hell were you thinking Veronica?

441
00:25:58,763 --> 00:26:03,390
That's got to be the worst decision I've ever seen by someone who wasn't literally brain damaged.

442
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:07,457
Since when do you reserve the right to totally blow of my instructions?

443
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:11,439
Does my judgement, my concern for your safety carry that little weight with you?

444
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:12,316
I'm sorry.

445
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:16,268
Dad, I screwed up, big time, I know.

446
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:17,871
Trust me.

447
00:26:18,514 --> 00:26:21,060
I'll be following your game plan the rest of the way.

448
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,660
They just seem so harmless.

449
00:26:24,804 --> 00:26:26,938
What is your basis for that call?

450
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,892
The absence of swastikas engraved on their foreheads?

451
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:33,108
Please, reassure me that you aren't that dense.

452
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,859
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:37,015
Really.

454
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,607
So did you plant any bugs when you were out there?

455
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:45,856
Yes.

456
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:46,963
You've been listening in?

457
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:50,423
Heard anything incriminating yet?

458
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:54,545
Nope. It's like listening to "The Brady Bunch" with a reggae soundtrack.

459
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,973
What about your background check on Josh? Anything shady, out of line?

460
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:04,417
Up until four years ago, he was a manager of a downloadable ring development team at E-Tones.

461
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:08,155
One day without warning he quit his job, cashed out his stock

462
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:10,680
and used it to buy the land for the collective.

463
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:12,523
Holly's totally clean as well.

464
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:13,925
So what's our next step?


465
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:16,080
There's no "our" about it.

466
00:27:16,506 --> 00:27:19,629
You are officially off this case. I'll take it home from here.

467
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:22,976
What? That makes... no sense whatsoever!

468
00:27:23,054 --> 00:27:24,882
Aren't you even interested in what I've learned?

469
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:28,000
What's the point, Veronica? I'm prepared to admit that these Moon Calves

470
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:32,239
probably don't merit the full ATF fire-bombing treatment.

471
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:36,504
I mean, my guess is they're just a bunch of tie-dyed Oliver Twists

472
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:38,926
who scam naïve kids to pay the bills.

473
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:41,881
Mr Gant.

474
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:45,316
I'm sure you have a lot to report but first there's something you need to know.

475
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:49,796
Mr Mars, my mother, Casey's grandmother, is dying.

476
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:54,624
She had a severe stroke on Tuesday night, she's effectively brain dead

477
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:58,034
and not expected to make it more than a couple of days.

478
00:27:58,367 --> 00:27:59,406
My condolences.

479
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:04,485
Thanks. This has been a tough disorienting time for us.

480
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:08,627
Even more so because of something else we've just learned from her attorney.

481
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:09,463
What's that?

482
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,251
If she dies, the bulk of her fortune,

483
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,429
about eighty million dollars, goes to Casey.

484
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:24,204
Well we're afraid he's simply gonna hand it all over to that cult.

485
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:26,338
I appreciate that information.

486
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:31,975
And, um, I wish I could say that I found something that we could nail them on but that's not the case.

487
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:33,275
I mean, not yet anyway.

488
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:37,531
At least you should know that I've seen no evidence that Casey's in danger.

489
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:39,855
I'm sorry to contradict you, Mr Mars.

490
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:43,183
But I have substantial experience with these groups.

491
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:45,646
The sooner we get him off that farm, the better.

492
00:28:45,887 --> 00:28:48,924
If you're current strategies aren't working,

493
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:52,096
perhaps you should try something new.

494
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,202
Any relevant experience you can share, I'll be happy to consider it.

495
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,998
What's your background, anyway, if you don't mind my asking?

496
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:04,892
Technically, my field is SMSPI.

497
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:08,830
Systematic Manipulation of Social and Psychological Influence.

498
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:12,720
One vulgar term is deprogramming.

499
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,006
No kidding.

500
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:16,080
I've heard of that.

501
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,719
How does that work, anyway?

502
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:29,473
In simple terms,

503
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:35,263
I control the elements of a subject's social and psychological environment

504
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:37,860
to eradicate undesirable modes of behaviour.

505
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:43,574
I'm then able to instil or re-instil desirable ones.

506
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,551
I'm quite good at my work.

507
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:48,490
Yeah, I bet.

508
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:52,059
We just want Casey back home again.

509
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,372
Soon.

510
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:59,452
This is a sensitive situation and we ask that you proceed accordingly.

511
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,223
Of course.

512
00:30:12,836 --> 00:30:17,551
Not to sweat you, V, but when will we see the FBI-Swarms-Coke-Compound headline?

513
00:30:17,777 --> 00:30:19,322
The case is dead in the water.

514
00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:24,459
We found diddly squat on the Moon Calves and I seriously doubt that there's anything to find.

515
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,984
Plus, my dad caught me out at the farm so now it's seriously off limits.

516
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:29,916
Dang.

517
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:31,482
As if that weren't enough,

518
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:34,646
I'm starting to doubt the whole rationale for what we're doing.

519
00:30:34,774 --> 00:30:39,486
Casey, noxious, overbearing 09er butthead Casey

520
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:42,664
has become a really sweet guy and

521
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,691
I think this so-called cult deserves most of the credit.

522
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:48,548
Sounds to me, Veronica, like you've been drinking the Kool-Aid.

523
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:49,678
I have not.

524
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:51,384
You better recognize.

525
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,532
Thank you for being my own personal "Springer" audience.

526
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,117
Should I check myself before I wreck myself?

527
00:30:57,266 --> 00:31:01,046
All I'm saying is, is you may be getting a little soft.

528
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:03,463
- Right and I'm... 
- Hey, Veronica.

529
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:07,763
Listen, I've got to go visit my grandma in the hospital after school.

530
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:09,432
Do you want to come with me?

531
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:12,633
Yeah, sure Casey, I'd love to.

532
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:13,580
Good.

533
00:31:17,803 --> 00:31:19,862
Soft, soft.

534
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,224
It's so hard to see her this way.


535
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,123
Wanna hear something sad?

536
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,229
Sure.

537
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:31,613
My parents' fortune.

538
00:31:33,103 --> 00:31:36,462
Every last nickel of it comes from Grandma's publishing company.

539
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,710
Mom and Dad had nothing to do with it.

540
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:40,864
Grandma provided for everything.

541
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:43,834
Then, a couple of years ago when she started having strokes,

542
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:45,873
started forgetting stuff,

543
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:51,249
my parents, who call her Grandmonster behind her back,

544
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:53,757
just stopped paying any attention to her.

545
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:59,225
It's amazing how much better they started treating me once they found out

546
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,723
that she decided to leave all her money to me.

547
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:08,405
So, how long have they known she was willing her money to you?

548
00:32:09,123 --> 00:32:10,304
They've known for a year.

549
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,634
I wish I could come with you.

550
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:31,176
I know.

551
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:35,137
Thanks for spending all this time with me.

552
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,993
You know, if you wanted to, you could.

553
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:41,548
Crazy thing? I do want to.

554
00:33:05,103 --> 00:33:06,062
Rain?

555
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:22,568
That must be good milk.

556
00:33:25,023 --> 00:33:26,204
Recognise her?

557
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:31,622
That's Rain. One of the girls from the collective.

558
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,048
Real name, Debbie Myer.

559
00:33:34,673 --> 00:33:35,754
She's a runaway,

560
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,166
a minor.

561
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,172
So we gotta call the Gant family right away.

562
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:45,435
Hold it, hold it. Please Dad.

563
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:47,464
Let's think about this for a minute.

564
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,832
This is what we're working for.

565
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,590
We were praying for a break and now you gave it to us.

566
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:59,469
Don't tell me the prospect of having new digs and steady hot water doesn't sound good to you.

567
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:02,250
And we can't just blow this off, Veronica.

568
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:06,008
They're contributing to the delinquency of a minor. It's a serious crime.

569
00:34:06,105 --> 00:34:09,526
Oh, please, Dad, you've been around these people.

570
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:12,479
Do you honestly think they're corrupting anyone?

571
00:34:12,596 --> 00:34:15,157
I think they're exactly what they seem to be;

572
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:18,091
a bunch of sweet, naïve, sixties throwbacks.

573
00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:20,748
That's possibly true but definitely beside the point.

574
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,429
Even if they are the Utopian sweethearts you think they are,

575
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:29,090
we don't answer morally or otherwise to the Moon Calf Collective.

576
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,732
We answer to our clients who pay us to do a job

577
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:34,901
and that job is to find the information they want.

578
00:34:43,597 --> 00:34:44,778
Hey, Veronica.

579
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:47,732
Casey told me you were out at the farm last night.

580
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:50,978
I wish you could have stayed a while, it was so beautiful.

581
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:53,456
The moon was so bright, you could almost read by it.

582
00:34:53,537 --> 00:34:57,086
Holly, there's something you need to know about, right now.

583
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:00,245
The thing is I work for my dad

584
00:35:00,424 --> 00:35:02,758
who's a private detective, okay, and...

585
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:11,278
Mr Clemmons just called me to his office.

586
00:35:14,602 --> 00:35:16,260
My grandma died this morning.

587
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:18,313
Oh, Casey.

588
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:46,530
Josh, Holly.

589
00:35:48,576 --> 00:35:50,621
I've done something I regret.

590
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:54,021
I found out that Rain was a runaway. I told my dad about it.

591
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:56,893
You have to get her the hell out of there right away.

592
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,076
It's okay, Veronica.

593
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,686
We get the picture. Everything's gonna be just fine.

594
00:36:00,774 --> 00:36:02,208
We appreciate you being up front with us.

595
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:03,661
If you'll excuse us.

596
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:05,787
Ah, come join us later if you like.

597
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:09,427
Thanks, Josh. I won't keep him long.

598
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,337
I appreciated you being here.

599
00:36:18,184 --> 00:36:20,061
For no reason that I can see,

600
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:22,360
you've been a real friend to me lately.

601
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:26,073
Can you really say that after what I just told you?

602
00:36:27,117 --> 00:36:29,293
I guess I don't think that you were faking the kindness.

603
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:31,095
Am I wrong?

604
00:36:37,193 --> 00:36:40,065
Well, I guess I better go have this conversation with my parents.

605
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:43,271
They wanna hear that I'm not going to let them starve.

606
00:37:05,715 --> 00:37:07,723
Hey, come on, what are you doing? Hey!

607
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:13,637
Hey! What are you doing to him?

608
00:37:15,077 --> 00:37:18,544
Stop! Stop!

609
00:37:24,215 --> 00:37:28,205
Dad! We have to call the police, Casey's just been kidnapped.

610
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:30,370
What? What are you talking about? Kidnapped by who?

611
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:31,343
By his parents

612
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:33,969
and that creepy guy that was with them at the last meeting.

613
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,730
They grabbed him in the parking lot at the funeral

614
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:38,056
and shoved him in the limo and drove away.

615
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:38,987
They grabbed him?

616
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:42,274
So it was against his will, then? He tried to get away?

617
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:44,512
No, it's not like he was running from them.

618
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:48,306
I was kind of far away but I could tell he was surprised by what was happening.

619
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:49,827
Okay.

620
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:56,851
Okay. I wasn't there. You saw what you saw, I'm not doubting your interpretation

621
00:37:57,065 --> 00:38:01,561
but if I was still sheriff and somebody told me an 18 year old kid

622
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:04,920
got into a car with his parents after his grandmother's funeral,

623
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:07,654
well there's nothing I could do about it.

624
00:38:08,391 --> 00:38:12,585
Not for a couple of days anyway so let's just hold off. See what happens, okay?

625
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:16,656
I wish we hadn't turned over that information about the collective.

626
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:18,729
We didn't.

627
00:38:20,962 --> 00:38:22,508
What? You didn't...

628
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:29,364
I thought about what you said, what I heard on the wire tap and, uh, you were right.

629
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:33,357
Once you get past all the sixties theme park trappings,

630
00:38:34,202 --> 00:38:37,458
that community's a lot more wholesome and functional than,

631
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,578
just for example, Neptune is.

632
00:38:42,707 --> 00:38:44,616
I also did a little checking on Debbie Myer.

633
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:46,961
What a life.

634
00:38:48,798 --> 00:38:51,984
Poor kid's been in four foster homes since she was eight years old.

635
00:38:52,537 --> 00:38:55,158
Reports of serious abuse in at least two

636
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:57,360
and I had to admit it,

637
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:00,284
she's a lot better off where she is.

638
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:19,443
With each day that passes, I come more to terms with the question of my paternity.

639
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:26,375
What's this?

640
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,867
Free Crab Rangoon with purchase of Happy Family Dinner at Wok'n'Roll. Phat.

641
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:38,003
Don't think I didn't notice the sacrifice.

642
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:38,970
My pleasure.

643
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:47,188
I sent off for those test results because I wanted the truth.

644
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:52,099
But can a lab tech really see the shape of my soul in a drunken conga line of genes?

645
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:54,345
Jake Kane could be my father.

646
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:56,219
But whether he is or isn't,

647
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:59,835
would I really claim him as such and deny the man who raised me?

648
00:40:01,006 --> 00:40:02,042
Veronica, wait up!

649
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:03,706
What's up?

650
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:09,915
Oh.

651
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,106
Now that's a sweet ride.

652
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:15,102
What's up, Veronica.

653
00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:39,380
The DNA test results.

654
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,044
It's my call now.

655
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:49,622
I can open this letter and find out if my dad is really my dad.

656
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:54,235
If he's not, then I'm almost certainly the daughter of Jake Kane

657
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:55,668
and, consequently,

658
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,026
an heiress.

659
00:41:28,426 --> 00:41:29,231
Hey, Dad.

660
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,462
Honey, I don't mean to ask a silly question but is,

661
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,591
is it really necessary that you do that right now?

662
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:42,404
Yeah.

663
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:46,295
As a matter of fact it is.
