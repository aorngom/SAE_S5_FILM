1
00:00:00,776 --> 00:00:02,764
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,825 --> 00:00:03,778
Why does she hate me?

3
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:06,759
She'd hate anyone she thought that Duncan might love as much as her.

4
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:10,005
Friendly advice. Watch her. She'll break the two of you up if she can.

5
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:12,382
Ducan Kane. He used to be my boyfriend.

6
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:15,048
It's been a year since my best friend Lilly Kane was murdered.

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,362
That's my girlfriend. Your friend. Duncan's sister.

8
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:19,467
I think we could be a little more patient, Jake.

9
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:21,386
We all lost Lilly and we all miss her.

10
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:23,721
But that doesn't mean we stop living our lives.

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,470
The truth is gonna come out. It doesn't add up. You know that deep down inside.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,990
- Flat? 
- Just as God made me.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,730
Do you need some help?

14
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:31,022
- I'm Troy. 
- I'm Veronica.

15
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:42,168
Okay. I'm uh...

16
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:45,364
- I'm really leaving now. 
- Okay.

17
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,739
Seriously.

18
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:48,789
See you.

19
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:53,668
Okay. Good night, all right, no more. Good night.

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,482
You know, uh, if we were the type of people who attended school functions,

21
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:05,180
this would probably be the time that I'd ask you to Homecoming Dance.

22
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:20,463
So, what did you think of him?

23
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:23,492
Oh, hey, you're home early.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,979
Oh hey, did you run his licence plate? Or did you get fingerprints?

25
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:28,024
Sorry, honey, what?

26
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,390
You know you're not fooling me.

27
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:31,654
Okay.

28
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,907
Veronica, I have no idea what you're talking about.

29
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:42,852
Oh, hey, I forgot to tell ya.

30
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:47,834
If he's gonna be kissing my daughter on my porch for eight and a half minutes, I'll need to meet him.

31
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,109
Sweet dreams, honey.

32
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:51,828
Is that really necessary?

33
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:55,878
He's taking up a lot of daddy-daughter time. I hardly get to see you.

34
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:57,741
- I see you constantly. 
- Oh sure.

35
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,654
You see me but we don't do anything.

36
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:24,703
You buy your Homecoming dress without me?

37
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:25,584
What?

38
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,003
Why do you insist on suppressing your hotness?

39
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:33,724
The world is ready for you Veronica Mars. You don't have to blend in.

40
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,153
I'm not trying to blend in.

41
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:38,410
I mean, wha-, none of this reflects your personality at all.

42
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:44,026
I'm- why, why do you even have this? You are not a yellow cotton dress.

43
00:02:44,353 --> 00:02:45,419
What am I?

44
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:46,965
You're like-you're-

45
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:49,782
you're red satin.

46
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:52,869
You are strapless red satin. Look at this.

47
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:56,561
But there's no time for red satin, Lilly, the dance is tomorrow.

48
00:02:56,627 --> 00:03:01,255
Oh, god, you, wait a minute. You know that we're not really going to the dance, right?

49
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:02,699
Wait, what are you talking about?

50
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:07,276
The dance is just a lame excuse for a new dress and a limo party.

51
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:10,896
Logan has got all the refreshments taken care of so it's going to be amazing.

52
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:12,227
No, I can't do that.

53
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:15,198
You know my dad, he will find out and I'll get crushed.

54
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:17,158
You'll get grounded.

55
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,274
Severely.

56
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:23,036
Oh, whoop-de-frigging-doo, Veronica, I mean, grounding lasts what, a week?

57
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:27,920
You are gonna remember this fun we have for the rest of your life.

58
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:29,477
Trust me.

59
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,099
Let me help you with that

60
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,347
You have to let me do something, Wallace.

61
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:47,941
Okay, that was the pile you just got finished alphabetizing, wasn't it?

62
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:49,497
Actually, it was two piles.

63
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:52,759
Who could be a bigger spaz, seriously?

64
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,773
Yes, you could have knocked over three piles.

65
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,388
I'm so sorry.

66
00:03:57,796 --> 00:04:00,314
You would have been out of here two hours ago if it wasn't for me.

67
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,574
Really not a problem.

68
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:05,456
Okay, you can stop being nice. I know I ruined your whole night.

69
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,326
Georgia!

70
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:08,230
Trust me.

71
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,700
You have it.

72
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,776
I think I did something really stupid.

73
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:23,529
See, I got this email...

74
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:25,849
This guy Karl is super-rich.

75
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,165
A trust fund kid.

76
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,991
And I guess he has a gambling problem and he got into trouble

77
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:33,002
so he sent an email to a friend asking for help, and...

78
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,742
Overflowing toilets. Use the faculty restroom.

79
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:44,717
Well, okay, first of all, a trust fund kid doesn't send a message from grantastic tech dot com domain.

80
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:46,165
That's pure nerd.

81
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:50,015
Hey buddy, I know we've not been in contact for a while but I'm hoping you can help.

82
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,284
He was offering over 200% interest.

83
00:04:52,356 --> 00:04:54,593
And I only had to loan him the money for two weeks.

84
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:57,153
Until his 21st birthday when he gets his trust fund.

85
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,335
So you called and told him you'd front the cash.

86
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:03,194
Yeah, and everything would've been fine if he would've paid me two weeks ago, like he said.

87
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,622
Everything's gonna be fine, okay Georgia.

88
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:06,800
We'll get him.

89
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,289
Will we now?

90
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:15,299
Hi Karl, it's Amber. Um, I got an email from you,

91
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,716
I guess by mistake but I think I can help you. Give me a call. 555-0196.

92
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:24,582
And I'm late for bio, again.

93
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:27,848
Ten per cent of whatever I recover.

94
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,677
Hi! You've reached Amber. Leave me a message.

95
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:39,112
Did I tell you?

96
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:15,188
...last day to buy homecoming tickets.

97
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:18,784
No homecoming tickets for the dance will be sold after that time.

98
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:24,552
Kicking off the homecoming festivities, the dedication of the Lilly Kane Memorial Fountain.

99
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:27,788
The Kane family would like to invite all students and faculty

100
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:30,174
to  attend the tribute and celebrate the memory

101
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,874
of one of Neptune High's most beloved students.

102
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,285
And in other news...

103
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,479
You and me, Thursday night, I'm thinking mini-golf.

104
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:42,928
It's what all the kids are doing.

105
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:47,705
But you don't golf.

106
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,112
My dad wants to meet you.

107
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,135
That's cool.

108
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,103
I'll pick you up at the door. I mean I can't do the beep and wipe but that's no problem.

109
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,495
My dad's a little intense.

110
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:59,922
Don't  worry. I give good parent.

111
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:05,103
And just so I can make the appropriate arrangements.

112
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:09,292
Homecoming is a go, right?

113
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,800
This should make me happy.

114
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,935
Yeah, yeah, it'll be fun.

115
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:22,342
The big dance being a staple of every high school girl's fantasy.

116
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:25,352
I've already lived the dream.

117
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:28,097
Everything else seems like a cheap reminder.

118
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,306
Lilly! Dear! Everyone is waiting.

119
00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:35,040
What the hell is she doing? How long does it take to put on a dress?

120
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:38,798
Honey, you know your sister. It's not an entrance if she's on time.

121
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:40,728
Maybe you should go and help her.

122
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:44,687
Ah-umm, I think she's got it covered.

123
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,946
I believe Keanu Reeves said it best, when he said,

124
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:54,830
Whoa!

125
00:07:56,386 --> 00:08:01,132
All right, let's, ah, let's make with the pictures before the, um, glitter rubs off.

126
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:01,877
Okay.

127
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,684
- Could you... Mr K- 
- Oh yeah, of course.

128
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:08,710
You all look very nice.

129
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,306
Lilly, could you...

130
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:16,605
Hey, I'm only young once. How many braless years do I have left.

131
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:32,017
All right. Let's go.

132
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:33,767
- Be careful 
- Be safe out there.

133
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:38,504
Ladies and gentlemen, Veronica Mars,

134
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:42,926
I've talked to that girl more today than I have in the past four months combined.

135
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,439
- Her pain is your pleasure? 
- Hey, hey, I'm the cavalry.

136
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:48,171
I get to save the day.

137
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:51,774
We are going to save the day? Right?

138
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:54,412
Hello?

139
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,736
Oh yeah, this is Amber.

140
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:58,682
Oh my god, hi!

141
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:01,144
Of course I can meet you today, what time?

142
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:04,011
What are you doing?

143
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:07,605
Ah. My mother thought it would be nice

144
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,560
to have a video tribute of Lilly for the dedication ceremony.

145
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,900
- What, she wanted you to do it? 
- No my dad did.

146
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,670
He wanted someone who knew her.

147
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:19,802
Do you want me to do it, man?

148
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,933
You know I'm awesome at this stuff. Come on, let me do it. I wanna do it.

149
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:27,231
- Thanks man. 
- Yeah.

150
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:33,384
Is that him?

151
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:35,716
I don't think so.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,817
Amber?

153
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:43,692
Karl?

154
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:45,228
That's me!

155
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:50,035
You must think I'm the biggest loser, sending my friends emails, begging for money.

156
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,303
I really don't know when this became my life.

157
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:53,982
Well, gambling is an addiction.

158
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,768
You know? It is, Amber.

159
00:09:57,075 --> 00:10:00,567
Thank you for understanding. You're saving my life. Literally.

160
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:03,983
That's not him.

161
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:07,228
But I think Karl had on the same outfit.

162
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:09,999
He even had the same ugly backpack.

163
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:11,740
Stay right here.

164
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,198
Be careful, Wallace.

165
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,008
So, just so that we're clear,

166
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:27,407
the deal is I give you $3000 this week and you give me $6000 next week?

167
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:28,901
On my 21st birthday.

168
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,114
That's the day my trust fund is unlocked.

169
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:32,798
So who do I make the cheque out to?

170
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:35,993
I'm sorry. Didn't I tell you that it had to be in cash?

171
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:37,366
Did you?

172
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:40,018
Remember? I can't deposit anything at the bank

173
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,625
because all my accounts are frozen...

174
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:43,166
until my birthday.

175
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,105
Okay, I'll-... it must be the hair.

176
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,119
Blonde.

177
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,954
Should we meet back here tomorrow?

178
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,459
Tomorrow. Same time?

179
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:53,743
Perfect.

180
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:59,397
Karl? I can trust you, right?

181
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:00,727
You can trust me, Amber.

182
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:02,771
Hand to God.

183
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:28,499
And where do conmen go when they're done conning for the day?

184
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,023
To a funky Bohemian theatre for an avant-garde staging of a Beckett play, naturally.

185
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:54,022
You've gotta be kidding me.

186
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:09,117
Hey, listen, I'll catch you guys later, okay?

187
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:10,960
- Hey man, nice job.
- Hey, thanks man.

188
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:16,075
What are you doing here?

189
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:18,369
I'm a huge Beckett fan.

190
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:21,552
Hand to God!

191
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:25,091
Wait a minute. This is part of the show, right?

192
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:28,491
Naw, you're not gonna get me like that. T! Liam!

193
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,010
You guys can come out, I'm ain't buying it.

194
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,449
So... is this a part of the same episode or am I getting paid again?

195
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:37,621
What are you talking about?

196
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:38,532
"Duped!"

197
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,844
What, you're telling me that "Duped!" is a show?

198
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,406
Oh, I thought you were part of this.

199
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:46,376
Yeah, it's one of those reality shows where people get duped into doing stupid things

200
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,674
like  giving some stranger their car or a bunch of money.

201
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:49,909
There were no cameras!

202
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,498
You're not supposed to see them, that's the whole point. Right?

203
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:55,464
There's no show, Jimmy!

204
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:59,458
What are you talking about there's no show. I auditioned, I got cast!

205
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:02,610
It's a scam. My friend, Georgia was duped about two weeks ago

206
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:06,031
out of $6000 by some other trust fund Karl.

207
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:09,142
N-no, no.

208
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:11,530
How did you find out about this?

209
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,781
There was an ad in "Back Stage West".

210
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:17,950
Open call but, you know, I'm between agents right now.

211
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:20,234
They just called me today to tell me I got the job.

212
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:21,953
Do you still have the number on your cell phone?

213
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:25,288
Now wait. You're telling me there's no show?

214
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:27,000
For real? This isn't a dupe? 


215
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:35,100
There it is.

216
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:39,250
Hey, what about my SAG points?

217
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:42,685
A pay phone that doesn't accept incoming calls. Shocker.

218
00:13:42,993 --> 00:13:46,991
From a place called Gameland. I guess it's a cybercafé but I'll check it out.

219
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:49,650
Naw, it's not a cybercafé, it's a gaming club.

220
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,592
It's like a bunch of computer nerds trying to blow each other up.

221
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:55,506
Only girls they see in there are japanimated.

222
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:57,805
So, you're not going to really blend.

223
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:00,795
So I won't blend.

224
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:26,477
Thanks.

225
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,761
I have one word. Ownage.

226
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:49,062
I care

227
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:56,294
And, I just fried you again.

228
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,364
Can you watch my stuff?

229
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:07,587
Yeah.

230
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:27,861
Grrrantula, a gamer. Email from grrrantastic-tech.

231
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:30,826
A coincidence, I think not.

232
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:32,433
Gamegirl.

233
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:54,542
Now lets see if I can't get Grrrantula's attention.

234
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:09,378
Stop killing your own team.

235
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:13,277
Hey, cut the crap.

236
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:20,925
Come on, loser. Show yourself.

237
00:16:20,997 --> 00:16:22,913
Hey! I'm on your team, lamer!

238
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:29,164
Wow! I'm really bad at this.

239
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,306
Ownage!

240
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:36,423
Hey, it's not ownage, I'm on your team!

241
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,806
Devlin.

242
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:50,295
- What was the first name? 
- Here, it'll be faster.

243
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:00,336
It was hiding under the Q's.

244
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:07,446
Grrrant's ID indicated he was living in Lannigan Hall at San Diego State.

245
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,739
A university known for its liberal arts, its picturesque campus

246
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:13,508
and its parties.

247
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:18,322
It's not going to work.

248
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:22,924
You can't take the cool out of me.

249
00:17:23,395 --> 00:17:26,545
Look, pocket protector and I'm still full of pimp juice.

250
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:30,010
Shouldn't you be a little more sombre for your poor scammed girlfriend?

251
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:31,777
Now you know she's not my girlfriend

252
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:33,580
so why are you even trying to play it like that?

253
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,537
Like what?

254
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,792
Like you wanna have this whole conversation about whether I like her or whatever.

255
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:41,976
Like we just got out of cheerleading practice. Guys don't do that.

256
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:43,446
Okay.

257
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:46,022
Yeah.

258
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,846
If a guy likes someone, he just likes her.

259
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,894
He doesn't need to have a five hour talk about it

260
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:55,266
So you like her, but we're just not having a talk about it?

261
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:55,944
Yes.

262
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:58,217
Do you like her a lot?

263
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:03,546
Yes, I like her a lot. Yes, I go two floors out of my way between classes so I can see her.

264
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:08,704
Yes. I volunteer to reorganise an entire filing system of attendance crap,

265
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:10,767
just so I can be in the same room with her.

266
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:12,031
You happy?

267
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,472
- I still think you're a badass. 
- And I am.

268
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:17,285
And nobody's gonna buy me as a nerd.

269
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,346
You've already been bought. I called the resident advisor

270
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:22,507
and I told him you were a prospective freshman.

271
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:24,462
And they believed you because?

272
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:27,955
Because I do a surprisingly convincing admissions assistant.

273
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:31,564
But, tonight, you lucky boy, I'm all nerd hag.

274
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,987
Okay, let's get this party started because I am hungry for gratitude.

275
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:53,150
Okay, it's my turn?

276
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,746
- Logan. 
- Truth.

277
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,993
What did you think of Veronica the first time you saw her.

278
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:00,845
I don't know, I thought she was hot.

279
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:03,431
I was 12 when you moved here!

280
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,319
Oh, and, like you weren't working it in your shorts and your kneesocks.

281
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:10,119
- That was my soccer uniform! 
- So, whatever! It totally worked!

282
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,586
Okay, Lilly.

283
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:13,882
Dare.

284
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:15,074
Shocker.

285
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:17,271
Okay, kiss someone in this limo.

286
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:25,560
Here we go.

287
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:33,505
Oh no!

288
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,749
A little girl on girl action in the limo.

289
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:38,238
Oh, man! Dude! That's my sister and my girlfriend.

290
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,572
Yeah, dude, like that one's not in the rotation.

291
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:45,466
Dude, this is my dad's tux.

292
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,465
Didn't know man.

293
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:47,520
Here.

294
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:49,044
I'm soaked!

295
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:56,849
Our boyfriends are all class.

296
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:02,470
Tick-tock! Very cute girl in need of our help right now.

297
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:17,769
Yeah so, we're pretty chill around here.

298
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:23,073
I mean there's rules and stuff but it's mostly, like, don't light stuff on fire,

299
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:25,245
don't get caught with drugs, you know?

300
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:25,925
C ool.

301
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,393
Hey, I think I know that guy.

302
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,893
Grant. Yeah, he's pretty famous around here.

303
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,126
He's like a genius or something.

304
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:37,854
Him and that bouncer looking dude over there.

305
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:42,970
They call them the Silicon Mafia.

306
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:46,953
Basically, around here, these guys are legend.

307
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:51,322
This dude. Got caught looking at Grant's laptop screen.

308
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:57,158
The next day he was put on academic probation because his GPA dropped from a 3.8 to a 1.5.

309
00:20:57,242 --> 00:20:59,318
Overnight on the university computer system.

310
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,769
And they have a security system like with laser beams.

311
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:04,520
I think they're building robots or something.

312
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:08,391
I felt the wall in the dorm next to theirs and it was way hot.

313
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:11,339
Do you know how many grill lights they probably have in there?

314
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:14,665
The walls are so hot, it's because they have a million dollar bag of super computers.

315
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,982
That they bought with their weed money.

316
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,891
Um, it is okay for people to be shooting Roman Candles down the stairways.

317
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,671
Oohh, man. You know?

318
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,438
So, what do you plan in majoring in?

319
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,957
- Math. 
- Math, wow.

320
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:41,102
So, what are you into?

321
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:44,068
Accounts theory, PDEs, joint methods. What's your thing?

322
00:21:44,144 --> 00:21:46,713
I'm pretty interested in, ah, joint methods.

323
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,316
Right now.

324
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:50,016
For error estimation or neutrality?

325
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:54,844
I know this is gonna sound kinda weird but... I'm interested in both.

326
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:21,783
'One can conjecture' or 'Fermat's last theorem'.

327
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:24,347
Which better defines geometry in three dimensional space?

328
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:33,563
What the hell are you doing?

329
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:40,736
They told me this was Sri Lanka. I wanted a coconut toddy.

330
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,026
- What the hell's going on? 
- We had an intruder.

331
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,151
How did you open the door?

332
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,645
I don't know, I just opened it.

333
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,052
It's impossible, it's always locked.

334
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:49,784
Grant.

335
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:54,617
And the real way the Silicon Mafia finances their empire comes clear.

336
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:58,728
I don't feel so good, Papa bear.

337
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:09,931
Papa bear.

338
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,216
Never happened.

339
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:16,761
My first college party.

340
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,371
Drinking Pina Coladas with a dude and talking about math.

341
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:24,493
They've gotta be hiding something big in that dorm room to have that much security.

342
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:27,477
I mean, an alarm that sends a message to your cell phone?

343
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,823
What's wrong with a deadbolt?

344
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:36,381
Wow! You've got it bad.

345
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,355
Nothing bad about this my friend.

346
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:51,112
Mom, if you don't put the camera down, I won't go out there.

347
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:14,212
What part of my ignoring you makes you think you're welcome?

348
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:15,379
What are you doing?

349
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:21,006
Assembling the world's most boring memorial video.

350
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:24,371
Ballet...

351
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,806
choir recital, debutante crap...

352
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,491
girl scouts.

353
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,264
Memories both misty and water-coloured.

354
00:24:38,594 --> 00:24:40,642
It's Lilly as a long-distance commercial.

355
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:42,691
Well, it isn't really about Lilly, is it.

356
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:47,042
God, this would piss her off.

357
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:51,061
Come on, Veronica, it's your turn. Do not lame out.

358
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:52,986
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

359
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:54,850
I've never...

360
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,444
...gone skinny dipping.

361
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,012
What?

362
00:25:00,437 --> 00:25:04,886
That is just unacceptable. We're gonna have to do something about that, Veronica Mars.

363
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:06,315
Oh, oh okay.

364
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,988
I've never taken matters into my own hand in the boys' locker room

365
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,358
after watching the cheerleader tryouts.

366
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:17,030
Dude, you are so dead.

367
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,170
How pervy, Duncan! I am a little impressed though.

368
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:21,480
You must drink, comrade.

369
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,862
Wait! Please tell me that was before we started dating.

370
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:25,453
Of course.

371
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:32,125
I've never, um, I've-I've never seen my parents having sex.

372
00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:35,309
No way.

373
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:38,206
Yeah. I went into their room to borrow Mom's black sweater,

374
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:39,523
- Mom was on top of Dad... 
- I want you to shut up...

375
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,520
- Hold on a second... 
- Oh my god, I don't want to see this.

376
00:25:41,602 --> 00:25:43,332
- She was like this, watch... she was like this... 
- Oh my god.

377
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,041
Lilly, that is so wrong.

378
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,807
I promise, but I think Dad probably thought so too.

379
00:25:54,994 --> 00:26:02,061
I've got one. I, um, I have never not had sex.

380
00:26:04,058 --> 00:26:05,324
Wait, what does that even mean?

381
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:07,863
That means, drink if you are a virgin.

382
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:15,357
What the hell.

383
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:20,898
- Whoa, Duncan! I'm shocked. 
- You are so cool.

384
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:22,526
Oh, so cool, man...

385
00:26:25,437 --> 00:26:27,789
I love you, I love you, I...

386
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:29,300
Oh yeah...

387
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:32,208
Yeah. You're my girlfriend.

388
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:49,171
I don't think this really constitutes quality time.

389
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,785
I've never loved you more.

390
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:54,915
It's a good cause. These guys ripped off a friend at school.

391
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:58,315
And there's a World's Greatest Dad trophy in your future.

392
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:03,384
We were flying over with the heat seeking cameras.

393
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:05,602
Came across some high intensity discharge lamps.

394
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:08,918
Looks like someone's cultivating a little MaryJ.

395
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:13,255
Mind if I come in?

396
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,771
- What's going on? 
- What's your name, son?

397
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,435
Grant.

398
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:22,846
Winters.

399
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:25,478
Any drugs on the premises, Mr Winters?

400
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:26,353
Caffeine.

401
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,185
No sir.

402
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:35,840
You sure about that, plants, seeds, any cannabis seedlings of any kind?

403
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:36,587
No.

404
00:27:37,484 --> 00:27:39,607
Look, we don't have any drugs, okay?

405
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,595
And don't you need like a warrant or something?

406
00:27:42,797 --> 00:27:45,358
What do I need a warrant for? There's nothing here.

407
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:46,633
Come on.

408
00:27:52,716 --> 00:27:55,552
- Why did you let him in? 
- You're the one who let him in.

409
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:58,650
And why wasn't the alarm on? It supposed to be on even when we're here.

410
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,675
- I'm heading to the snack bar. 
- Set the alarm.

411
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:28,970
Yeah?

412
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:32,135
Oh my god!

413
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:33,747
I'll be right there.

414
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:39,437
So. Veronica tells me, um...

415
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:42,933
well actually she hasn't told me anything about you.

416
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:45,150
Well, I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

417
00:28:45,253 --> 00:28:46,122
Neither do I.

418
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:52,375
Well, if you have any questions or, you know, you want a list of references or anything...

419
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:54,325
So you're going to the homecoming dance.

420
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:55,523
Oh yes, sir, if that's okay with you.

421
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:58,242
Of course. And after the dance?

422
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:02,114
Why-I think that, uh, Veronica said that she had to be right home after, so...

423
00:29:02,204 --> 00:29:03,147
Yeah, good.

424
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:06,439
And you're gonna stay for the whole dance, I mean, you're not gonna leave early

425
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:09,792
to go to a party or a hotel and still make it back by curfew?

426
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:11,692
No, you-ah, I mean...

427
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:14,093
the whole point of going to the dance

428
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:16,439
is to go to the dance.

429
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:17,355
Good.

430
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:22,241
So you won't mind them that I cancelled your reservation at the Four Seasons?

431
00:29:25,286 --> 00:29:26,463
I'm here, I'm here.

432
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,661
So. Who's ready for mini-golf?

433
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:44,533
Hello.

434
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,021
Hi, Grant Winters, this is admission calling.

435
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:48,260
Grant.

436
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:50,825
Someone from admissions wants to talk to you.

437
00:29:54,604 --> 00:29:55,413
Grant Winters.

438
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:57,988
Bill Smith, Admissions. Are you free Thursday night?

439
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,874
Sorry, we're really not interested in showing some provo around campus.

440
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:07,038
Oh, that's a shame. We wanted to land this student before MIT snatched him up.

441
00:30:07,317 --> 00:30:09,621
And he asked for you and your crew specifically.

442
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:10,419
Crew?

443
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:13,256
Yeah, I'm sure he did. Sorry, but-

444
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:17,336
We're providing three tickets to Gameland to a private screening of a new game,

445
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:18,688
maybe you've heard of it.

446
00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:20,745
It's the Matrix online game.

447
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,219
Really?

448
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:27,971
How's it going?

449
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,426
It's very "Wonder Years".

450
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:33,572
Celeste will love it.

451
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:40,786
So... I was going through some of my stuff and I found this.

452
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:44,764
- What is it? 
- It's not a violin recital.

453
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:53,673
I've got a lot of work to do.

454
00:30:54,662 --> 00:30:56,387
Yeah. No, me too.

455
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,815
Dude, we're gonna see the new Matrix online game, we're finally gonna see it.

456
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:09,280
Did you see the video posters with their rag doll effects, man, Visi-tinjun is killer.

457
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:10,857
What are you doing?

458
00:31:11,374 --> 00:31:14,804
Just text messaging my girlfriend, tell her how psyched I am.

459
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:30,496
In the past 24 hours of surveillance, this is what I've learned.

460
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:37,281
The so-called Silicon Mafia has developed a game that'll make "Quake" look like "Asteroids".

461
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,797
They've raised their start-up capital by swindling needy and greedy college

462
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:45,314
and high school students using a variation of the Nigerian scam.

463
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:48,653
With no investors, they stand to make millions.

464
00:31:50,445 --> 00:31:53,953
Unless, somehow, someone trips them up along the way.

465
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,847
Wow.

466
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:56,498
I really hate these guys.

467
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:23,828
What the hell?

468
00:33:24,744 --> 00:33:28,145
Wow. I can't believe there's no party.

469
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:31,483
I feel so duped.

470
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:38,575
What the hell?

471
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:40,336
It's the alarm on the backup drives.

472
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:46,486
I set the room alarm.

473
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,980
Then why didn't it go off? You can't get to the backups without getting into the room.

474
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:51,729
Oh, the backups are fine. Nobody's getting into that safe.

475
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,663
What the hell?

476
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:58,524
Oh my god.

477
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,213
The backup drives.

478
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:32,458
Hey buddy, I was hoping you could... help me.

479
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,621
I'm coming into my trust fund next week and if you give me $7600 tomorrow night,

480
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:39,432
I'll give you your hard drives back.

481
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,212
Hello boys, let me guess what you're thinking.

482
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:43,595
Paybacks are a bitch.

483
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:46,549
Yeah, something like that.

484
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,366
Well, here, you're the math whiz.

485
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:52,724
- It's all there. 
- Like we trust you.

486
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:55,663
Yeah, I think that's all of it.

487
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:57,035
Our commission's included?

488
00:34:57,189 --> 00:34:58,187
Yeope.

489
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,523
Ownage.

490
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,238
Can we have our backup drives now?

491
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:03,856
You need to lay off the caffeine, Grrrant.

492
00:35:03,963 --> 00:35:05,427
'Cause you're downright testy.

493
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:09,160
Your backups are in the garbage can, next to the bench.

494
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:11,202
Yeah, you might have to dig a little.

495
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,504
This just doesn't seem fair.

496
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:19,513
I keep thinking about all the people who were scammed

497
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:21,776
and how they don't have kickass friends.

498
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:25,478
Did you know there's a whole anti-fraud agency in the FBI?

499
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,101
I guess it's a big deal.

500
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:31,565
And I was shocked to see how interested they were in the information I had on Liam and Grant.

501
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,141
Game over.

502
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,804
- I got one, I got one. 
- You got one?

503
00:36:06,996 --> 00:36:09,654
Oh my god. They called the cops.

504
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:15,003
They called my dad.

505
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:19,776
This is like, the best dance ever.

506
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:33,963
What seems to be the problem, officer?

507
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:35,746
Lilly.

508
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,672
Are you drunk?

509
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,975
Not so much anymore.

510
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:47,623
You are absolutely unbelievable. Why do you insist on humiliating me?

511
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:52,124
Um, two kids, both out all night and one getting screamed at?

512
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:53,813
'Cause I know you, Lilly.

513
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:57,075
Any trouble this family has ever had, you've been at the root of it.

514
00:36:57,137 --> 00:37:00,209
Mom! It's my fault, it was my idea.

515
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:03,521
You listen, both of you. Inside the house. Come on.

516
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:20,110
Sorry, Dad.

517
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:21,324
We'll talk at home.

518
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:25,274
Jake, Celeste. Thanks for the coffee.

519
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,461
Thank you to the Neptune High Orchestra.

520
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:09,115
I know if Lilly were here, she would have been moved by that rendition.

521
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:12,841
Lilly really loved this place.

522
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:17,860
So it's only fitting that as long as this fountain remains here,

523
00:38:17,972 --> 00:38:20,312
a part of Lilly will always be here.

524
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:24,095
And you, her peers will always be reminded

525
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:29,742
what a generous, kind, sweet girl she was

526
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:35,588
and how she embodied Pirate pride and the school motto,

527
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:40,207
service, loyalty, honour.

528
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:54,009
Hello America! You wanted Lilly. You got her.

529
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,200
Now sit back and enjoy the ride.

530
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:31,523
You love me don't you?

531
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:52,865
Hey, Weev, let's hit it.

532
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:54,420
Weevil!

533
00:40:56,464 --> 00:40:59,899
Yeah, yeah. Let's ride man, Let's go, the night's young.

534
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:12,591
Do you mind if we make a stop?

535
00:41:14,812 --> 00:41:16,539
There's something I need to do.

536
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:20,108
Well, I don't think that's a good idea, we should probably go right to the dance, right.

537
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:21,204
I told your dad...

538
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,694
You have to stay here.

539
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:39,502
Don't ask me, man.

540
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,185
Stopped trying to figure her out day one.

541
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:11,688
