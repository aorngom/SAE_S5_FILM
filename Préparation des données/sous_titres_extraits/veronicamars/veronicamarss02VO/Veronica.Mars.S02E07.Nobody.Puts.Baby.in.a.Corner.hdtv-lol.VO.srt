1
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:02,691
Previously on Veronica Mars

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,128
And we're officially calling
the sheriff's race.

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:08,072
Don Lamb holds onto his seat
in a real nail-biter.

4
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,461
I have information about
that mexican kid who got killed.

5
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:11,625
Felix Toombs?

6
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:13,658
I'm the one who made
the anonymous call from the bridge.

7
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,697
You like me. You really like me!

8
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,351
And I want to thank my agent.

9
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:19,831
You might want to get a lawyer.

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,673
What? For this charade?

11
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:23,935
If it wasn't for me,
meg would have been in the limo.

12
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:25,724
She wouldn't need a machine to breathe.

13
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:28,713
Meg has a laptop my parents
didn't know about.

14
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,756
They're gonna want to see what's on it.

15
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:32,941
We have to get her personal stuff
off this computer.

16
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:34,667
This has to be a mistake.

17
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:37,551
Mr. Casablancas is artificially
driving up his company's value.

18
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:38,936
It is a house of cards,

19
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,001
and someone's gonna sneeze on it -- me.

20
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:42,111
Mr. Casablancas?

21
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,806
Some gentlemen from the S.E.C.
are here to see you.

22
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:49,858
Let me explain something to you.

23
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:52,550
Um, I am not mr. Lebowski.

24
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,260
You're mr. Lebowski.

25
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:55,709
I'm the dude.

26
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,132
So that's what you call me.

27
00:00:57,237 --> 00:00:59,430
You know, uh, that, or, uh...

28
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:04,144
"His dudeness" or, uh,
"duder" or "el duderino,"

29
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:06,106
if you're not into the whole brevity thing.

30
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,411
Veronica, you need to stop being the dude.

31
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:13,058
Stoner bowler doesn't do it for you?

32
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:14,007
A little.

33
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:17,163
Only because I like the way your lips
pout when you do guy voice.

34
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:19,323
These lips?

35
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:22,327
I've had them for years.
I can't do a thing with them.

36
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:33,926
Where's my martini,
and why don't I smell a pot roast?

37
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:39,001
Hey, you're watching "The Big Lebowski."
Why didn't you wait for me?

38
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:40,386
I didn't know when you were coming home.

39
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,701
Well, you know, when
you asked me to move in,

40
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,369
I thought it was because...

41
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:45,965
you wanted to spend more time together.

42
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,360
You just missed the supermarket scene.

43
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:54,400
And there's my room service.

44
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:58,165
Seriously, though, I was reading
"The Third Wheel: A beginner's guide",

45
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:00,499
and we should come up with
some kind of code word

46
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,192
for when you guys are feeling frisky

47
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:04,564
and don't want to be disturbed.

48
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:05,728
Like "scram"?

49
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,747
I was thinking, "awkward,"

50
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:10,284
but "scram" is good...

51
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,134
or "amscray."

52
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:17,347
You're not my grilled cheese.

53
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:18,535
No.

54
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:19,179
Hmm.

55
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:29,913
Ipod girl... with the waxy-eared boyfriend.

56
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:32,681
Small world.

57
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:35,259
Like this big.

58
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:45,146
My code word will be... "endurance."

59
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:52,227
Weren't we doing something?

60
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:55,434
We were making out on the couch,
and then that happened.

61
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:02,581
Dick and Beav's stepmom just came over
to have a go-around with your bunkmate.

62
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,224
How does that not bother you?

63
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,291
'Cause I'm a guy?

64
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:08,033
What?

65
00:03:09,544 --> 00:03:12,259
If he was in there with dick and
beaver's real mom, I'd be bothered,

66
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:13,952
but it's Kendall -- she's like our age.

67
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:15,354
She's 25.

68
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,414
Yeah, but not really.

69
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:19,519
You know what I mean. She's...

70
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,234
What? She's hot.

71
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:24,607
Like that's news.

72
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:30,038
Well, ass slaps and high fives to Logan
for banging the hot chick.

73
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:31,717
Maybe she'll buy us beer.

74
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,740
I'd ask her...

75
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:35,217
but I think she'll be in there for a while.

76
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,390
What a difference a day makes.

77
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:44,723
You're in the pink, you're in the red.

78
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:48,534
You're on top of the world...

79
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,161
you're sleeping in the gutter
without a penny to your name.

80
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:54,411
You've been a puppet,
a pauper, a pirate, a poet.

81
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:59,187
Last week, miss Mars was,
as you kids call it, flush,

82
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:02,262
with mr. Casablancas
breathing down her neck.

83
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,256
Well, the worm has turned.

84
00:04:10,077 --> 00:04:10,964
Booyah.

85
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:14,271
Nobody likes an eager beaver.

86
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,550
Dick, where's your line?

87
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,164
Yeah, hey, where's Dick inc.?

88
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,626
Well, uh, as you'll recall,

89
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:24,023
I recommend you not invest
everything in one company,

90
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:26,661
and yet you put all your money
into Casablancas realty.

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,321
Yeah, baby. Keep it all in the family.
That's right.

92
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,125
Yeah. Well, now you have nothing.

93
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:36,400
Mr. Echolls
Oh, Mr. Echolls, I'm afraid...

94
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:40,254
that your stock has declined
seriously, as well.

95
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:42,237
I'm not worried. I tend to bounce back.

96
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:43,373
And Mr. Kane...

97
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:47,427
well, maybe it's better he doesn't know.

98
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:01,315
This would be more enjoyable
if I were good at it.

99
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,856
Any news on the bus crash, Woody?

100
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,993
The sheriff has assured me
he's working on it.

101
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,568
So you've seen some progress?
He's following up on leads?

102
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,293
Absolutely, absolutely.

103
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:13,023
I want to share something with you.

104
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,019
What's that?

105
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,278
My vision for Neptune.

106
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:17,716
The election's over, Woody.
You sold your vision.

107
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:19,791
I promised a cleaner, safer Neptune.

108
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:22,536
Want to know how I'm going to get there?
Incorporation.

109
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:24,992
Turn our little county seed
into a full-fledged city.

110
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:27,550
Santa Barbara, Carmel,
La Jolla, they all did it --

111
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,878
upped their tax base, turned that revenue
into antique streetlamps,

112
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:33,180
cobblestone streets, increased sanitation.

113
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,735
I defy you to find
graffiti in Carmel, Keith.

114
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:36,904
It cannot be done.

115
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:38,246
Here...

116
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:39,931
what boundaries are we talking about?

117
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:42,950
South to the marina, north to
the airfield, east to the reservoir.

118
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:46,694
That's not a town, woody.
That's a country club.

119
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:47,897
You're exaggerating.

120
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:50,555
9,000 people would reside
in the city of neptune.

121
00:05:50,932 --> 00:05:52,443
They'd need a chief of police.

122
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:56,164
The county would still have Lamb,
twice the police protection.

123
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:57,238
Everybody wins.

124
00:05:57,653 --> 00:06:00,993
I wouldn't even be able to afford to live in
the town that I was protecting and serving.

125
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:03,417
We'd make it worth your while.

126
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,385
See ya.

127
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,982
Check in with the starter.

128
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:13,831
Check in with the starter, please.

129
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:16,933
Hey, are you sick,

130
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:20,165
or am I going to see you singing
"Twist and Shout" on a parade float?

131
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:21,715
Call me.

132
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,246
Hey, remember when we made out
against the sink,

133
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:34,243
and you had your legs around my waist?

134
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:36,119
Stop. You'll make me blush.

135
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:37,171
Honestly?

136
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,798
How much easier would your life be
if you were indifferent to me?

137
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:43,216
So much, since I'm really struggling.

138
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:44,780
What do you want?

139
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:46,768
I don't know if you noticed
that I got arrested.

140
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:48,410
Super fun.

141
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:53,452
This guy came forward, saying he was the
911 caller the night that Felix got killed,

142
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:56,395
and he's attempting to ruin my life.

143
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:59,411
I thought maybe you could do
a little sleuthing for old times' sake.

144
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,606
Really? Could I?

145
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,945
But why would you, right?

146
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:05,377
Hey...

147
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:08,108
At least I got to enjoy asking you for help.

148
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:13,097
Old times' sake?

149
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,480
Give me something I can work with.

150
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,385
The witness said I threatened him.

151
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:22,139
H-he's setting me up. I need to know why.

152
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:24,784
What's his name?

153
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:32,465
Hey, I just tried to call you.

154
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:33,371
I need to talk with you.

155
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:36,294
Hello... um...

156
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,453
Logan wanted me to help him.

157
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:42,364
I'm not really thinking
about that right now.

158
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,906
Lizzie gave me that hard drive
to hide for Meg.

159
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,291
And...

160
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,791
I downloaded some of her files last night.
I just...

161
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,850
I wound up reading some of her e-mails.

162
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:58,914
Why is Meg e-mailing someone
at child protection services?

163
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:02,303
She found out one of the kids
she babysits for is being abused.

164
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:03,389
Oh, my god.

165
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:06,125
She's been e-mailing this agent,
trying to help the kid,

166
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,396
but she doesn't have proof.

167
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,875
It's not sexual.

168
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:09,963
They're not beating him.

169
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,819
They're, like, mentally tormenting him.

170
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,633
I keep going through them, but...

171
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:16,539
she never says who he is.

172
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,176
We have to find him.

173
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,853
<i>A long time ago,</i>

174
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,408
<i>we used to be friends but I</i>

175
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,412
<i>haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

176
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,823
<i>Come on, now, sugar</i>

177
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:40,282
<i>bring it on, bring it on, yeah</i>

178
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:43,719
<i>just remember me when</i>

179
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,123
<i>we used to be friends</i>

180
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:48,332
<i>a long time ago</i>

181
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,626
<i>we used to be friends</i>

182
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,494
So, basically, he's between 7 and 10,
and his parents are psycho.

183
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:02,951
That'll narrow it down.

184
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:06,535
She asks the agent
if one of the books would be helpful.

185
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,196
They make him write these admonishments
over and over, hundreds of times.

186
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:12,962
"I was bad. I deserve to be punished."

187
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,765
I think Meg has one of the books.

188
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,434
I remember reading that she stole one.

189
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:22,059
Well, then, at least we have step one
get the book.

190
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,819
From a house where there's always
someone home and they always hate us?

191
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:28,208
The only time Meg let me come over
was on sunday nights

192
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,574
when her parents went to church group.

193
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,848
Then we'll go sunday night.

194
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:34,610
In the meantime, we have to figure out
who Meg babysat for.

195
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,755
The fullers have a son. And Mrs. Hauser...

196
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,135
there was a neighbor,
but I think they only had a baby.

197
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,677
Um...the Martins had twin girls.

198
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,399
The Goodmans, this other lady, like, once.

199
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,765
She babysat a lot.

200
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,141
I...think they call it a part-time job.

201
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:56,797
I-it's when you do this thing called "work",

202
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:59,330
and strangers pay you
instead of the allowance fairy.

203
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,790
Ah, the allowance fairy --

204
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:04,920
elusive in Neptune outside the 09er zip.

205
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,841
Meg's parents are big on the
"not being spoiled" thing.

206
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:15,685
Well, the Goodmans don't need
a babysitter now that Gia's back.

207
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:19,397
And the others, I'll just have to convince
to trust me with their children

208
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,273
long enough for me to get a writing sample.

209
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:23,216
To compare to the book that Meg stole?

210
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,079
Yeah.

211
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,588
After we break into Meg's house.

212
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:26,578
Pretty much.

213
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:34,369
Well, look who got an invite to the sheriff
department's fund-raiser/bachelor auction.

214
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,649
Please say "Veronica Mars."

215
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:36,870
Sorry, sweetheart.

216
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:38,752
You can't buy love.

217
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:41,969
Bored wives of the wealthy, however, can.

218
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,026
I'm wondering if they'll sell
sheriff Lamb by the pound.

219
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,777
Hey, what's going on?

220
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:55,255
She got you working now, too?

221
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:02,242
The house and cars were paid in full,
so we don't have to worry on that front.

222
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:04,676
Stop it.

223
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,801
I keep thinking it's an earthquake.

224
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:10,436
Unfortunately, in light of recent events,

225
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,608
all of Dick's other assets
have been frozen, pending trial.

226
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:15,713
Trial?

227
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:18,379
Um... the verdict's in.

228
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:21,193
Dick's off drinking mai tais on some beach,

229
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:24,414
probably being fanned
by the local natives with $100 bills.

230
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,871
He's not coming back.

231
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:27,967
As for the boys...

232
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:30,474
Dick jr. and Cassidy each have a trust fund.

233
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:31,543
Sweet!

234
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:34,741
However, you're not eligible
to withdraw until your 21st birthday.

235
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,704
Dude, my 21st birthday
is going to rock so hard.

236
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:39,960
I love you, daddy.

237
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:40,893
And?

238
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:42,856
What about me?

239
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,996
You don't have any
separate accounts from Dick.

240
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,557
He didn't put any property in your name.

241
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:50,638
I'm their mother. Can't
I have some of their money?

242
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:54,555
The only remaining trustee for the funds
is their biological mother.

243
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,930
So, what am i supposed to do?

244
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,524
I don't know. What did you do before?

245
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:05,398
Mrs. Fuller?

246
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,860
This is Veronica Mars.

247
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:09,434
I helped Sabrina out with that GPA issue.

248
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:13,464
Yes. I'm calling because
I'm a friend of Meg Manning's,

249
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,941
and I'm trying to help out
with her babysitting commitments.

250
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:21,373
I do.  I have excellent references,
and I'm available anytime you need.

251
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,774
Yes, i do know CPR.

252
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:26,853
STDs will kill you.

253
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,499
Sexually transmitted diseases
are no joke, Jane.

254
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,139
I wasn't laughing. I sneezed.

255
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,764
See how much you're sneezing
when you have gonorrhea.

256
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:41,497
This is important, useful information
that you, trust me,

257
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:43,038
are going to need to know about.

258
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:45,343
Out!

259
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,155
All right, people, pair up.

260
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,045
You each have a piece of paper
with an STD on it.

261
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:58,149
You have to inform your partner
that you have said STD.

262
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:03,397
All right, Gia, we can be partners, but...
no glove, no love.

263
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:07,540
Yeah. Let's get the dried-up
divorcée to teach us about sex.

264
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:10,173
I heard her husband left her for a man.

265
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,353
And now we get bitchy and bitter for a year.

266
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:17,521
Mrs. Hauser, mine's wrong.
Isn't this a flower?

267
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:20,825
No, Gia. Chlamydia is not a flower.

268
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:24,063
Well, we have it on, like,
a trellis at our beach house.

269
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:25,173
Your trellis is a whore.

270
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:27,827
You're very funny, Veronica.

271
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:30,530
Really. You should know that about yourself.

272
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:31,732
Thank you, Gia.

273
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:35,131
I used to be funny at my old school.
People here don't get me.

274
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:37,090
I think your wit totally translates.

275
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:37,934
You think?

276
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:41,538
I don't know. I used to have
a zillion girlfriends at my other school.

277
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,169
Here, all I meet are guys.

278
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:47,144
You know what I haven't done in forever?

279
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:49,576
Just gone to a girlfriend's house

280
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:52,752
and, like, watched movies
and looked at her clothes.

281
00:13:53,318 --> 00:13:56,269
You should come look at my clothes!
You could sleep over.

282
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:00,280
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

283
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:11,092
Ms. Hauser, I'm taking
on new babysitting clients,

284
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,493
and I know Meg used to work for you.

285
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:15,578
I am a working single mother, Veronica.

286
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:18,400
The last thing I need is a babysitter.
I need a clone.

287
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:21,470
I could be there to help out
while you work around the house --

288
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:24,497
give you a chance to throw in
a load of laundry or take a bath.

289
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,488
The last thing I need
is more time in the tub.

290
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,194
No sale, miss Mars. Know when to fold 'em.

291
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:42,930
First semester at college,
and Sabrina's top of her class.

292
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:46,707
She just flourishes in academia.
Here's your schedule for tonight.

293
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:50,330
You'll see I gave you a five-minute window
in between each activity.

294
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:53,949
I gave you 30 minutes to get acquainted
with Edwin while making cookies,

295
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,608
then on to reading for at least an hour.

296
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:58,092
He likes to keep going until
he finishes the chapter.

297
00:14:58,093 --> 00:14:59,896
Then, he can color until bedtime.

298
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:02,932
He won't give you any trouble.

299
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:05,048
I think my fastball tired him out.

300
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:06,418
Stuart fuller.

301
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,359
Thanks for coming
on such short notice, Veronica.

302
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,845
I'm happy to have the gig.

303
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:11,814
Oh, and there's a phone sheet
on the refrigerator.

304
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:16,588
That has every number we could ever possibly
be reached at, barring alien abduction.

305
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:19,843
Most important : no boys.
I know you're a friend of Meg's,

306
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:22,501
and I almost let her go
because of that boyfriend of hers.

307
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:24,772
This isn't inspiration point.

308
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:26,417
Give mommy and daddy a kiss goodbye.

309
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:36,228
So...Edwin,

310
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:37,525
what do you want to do?

311
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,258
We're supposed to make cookies.

312
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,644
A 10-year-old boy
who voluntarily washes his hands,

313
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:48,097
who enjoys quiet time,
and does what he's told with a smile.

314
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,391
If he doesn't pick his nose soon,
I'm looking for wires.

315
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:58,619
How was your book?

316
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:01,638
Good. May I please color now?

317
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,767
Knock yourself out.

318
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:10,379
Hello?

319
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:11,295
How's it going?

320
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:13,482
Disturbingly well.

321
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:16,748
I grabbed some old homework
for a writing sample,

322
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,421
and I'll snoop after he goes to sleep,

323
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:23,024
which I'm sure will be
in exactly 34 minutes.

324
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,722
I'm having a hard time
picturing you babysitting.

325
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,430
Really?

326
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,652
Maybe because it's such a Meg' thing.

327
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,681
You guys did it so much.

328
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:36,502
Are you all right?

329
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:39,552
Yeah. It's just a really big bug.

330
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:40,747
I'll call you back.

331
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:45,561
I said 10:30pm.

332
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:53,062
How you doing, Edwin?

333
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:53,942
Good.

334
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,782
You need anything?

335
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,050
No, thank you.

336
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:07,436
Your 911 caller, A.K.A. Tom Griffith,
is Dr. Tom Griffith.

337
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:10,878
He is a very expensive,
well-respected plastic surgeon.

338
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:14,574
I don't believe it.
There are no respected plastic surgeons.

339
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,215
That's not him.

340
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:23,723
Sure it is -- "Dr. Tom Griffith."
It says there, right on the picture.

341
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:25,417
That's not the guy from the bridge.

342
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:26,721
What are you talking about?

343
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,177
You told the police
you couldn't identify the guy.

344
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:31,698
You said the whole night was a blur.

345
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:33,184
I lied.

346
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:35,115
Of course you did.

347
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:36,583
I didn't want the guy found.

348
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,192
I didn't know what he was going to say.

349
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:43,820
I knew I was free and clear
if they never found him.

350
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:44,917
You have to go.

351
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,831
I need your help. The guy's lying.

352
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:47,634
Go!

353
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,448
We're a little early.
Hope we didn't scare you.

354
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,275
Not at all.

355
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,281
How did everything go?

356
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:02,463
Great. Really. Uh... Edwin's a dream.

357
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,891
Thanks a lot, Veronica.
We'll definitely call you again.

358
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:13,884
That'd be great.

359
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,862
We have a standing dinner date
with friends on fridays.

360
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,631
Saturdays, of course, I'm on the boat
by myself if you ever want to come by,

361
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:22,414
smoke a jay, and fool around.

362
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:25,760
We usually do a day trip
about once a month with my boss

363
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:27,442
if you don't mind working on a sunday.

364
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:29,172
Um...

365
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:32,102
oh, I almost forgot.
Edwin drew this for you.

366
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:54,219
"Wallace, Wallace, Wallace.
Wherefore art thou?

367
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:56,801
I know that quote doesn't really work,
but you get the point.

368
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,798
Things that have changed in the 19 hours
since my last e-mail

369
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:05,206
I've grown 4 inches,
changed my name to London,

370
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,244
and have discovered that, apparently,

371
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:09,251
I'm not the only love of Duncan's life.

372
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:12,044
You really need to start
answering my e-mails.

373
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:15,093
This is a little too
'doogie howser's journal' for me."

374
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,476
Does this seem like a good place
for you to be standing?

375
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:35,482
Sorry.

376
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,839
Just hanging some flyers.

377
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,710
Do you have references?

378
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,050
I do.

379
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:52,349
I'm coming!

380
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:55,546
God, I hate you.

381
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,174
I'm coming.

382
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,176
Cassidy?

383
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,144
Dick jr.?

384
00:20:05,032 --> 00:20:06,294
Mommy's here.

385
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:08,870
Where are my little boys?

386
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,526
When's the last time
you had a lunch like this?

387
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:17,087
When I was a brady.

388
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:20,201
This is great, mom. Really.

389
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:22,262
We're glad you're here.

390
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,765
And so quickly, right? I hope you see that.

391
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:27,729
You need me, I'm here.
All you have to do is call.

392
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,819
The only time I get to act like your mother

393
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,671
is when your father's not around to stop me.

394
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:34,873
Wait -- you know we want you to,
like, sign something, right?

395
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:37,572
Funds are running a little low
now that dad's M.I.A.

396
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:38,795
I know, Dick.

397
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,156
And so like your father
to think about the glory moment

398
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,881
and I'm forgetting about the day-to-day.

399
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,411
Everything's got to be big and flashy.

400
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,334
It's all million-dollar trust funds,
and you can't buy bread.

401
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:49,512
So you'll help us?

402
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:53,104
Well, I don't know, baby. It's
a lot of money, but that's all there is.

403
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:55,782
If you spend it all now,
there will nothing left for college

404
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:57,841
or, god forbid, an emergency.

405
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:00,108
I have to think about your future.

406
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:01,553
Maybe we can come and live with you.

407
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:02,475
Dude! Stop.

408
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:05,562
Sweetheart, you know we spend
most of the year in europe.

409
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:07,098
So, I like europe.

410
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:08,095
Oh.

411
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:13,885
No bark? Is it your day off?

412
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,864
These are the snacks
Albert is allowed to have.

413
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:22,509
He cannot have anything else.
No juice, no soda, no diet drinks.

414
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,908
If it's not in this bag,
it does not go in his mouth.

415
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,943
Tell me you understand.

416
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:27,144
I understand.

417
00:21:27,196 --> 00:21:30,508
We don't want television in our house,
and I expect that rule to be applied here.

418
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,765
You can play with him,
but don't get him too wound up.

419
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:36,589
If you do exactly like I tell you,
he will be perfectly behaved.

420
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,551
Albert, this is Veronica.

421
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:39,784
Hi, Albert.

422
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,402
Okay... well...

423
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:50,767
what do you feel like doing?
I've got some games --

424
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,832
I want ice cream.

425
00:21:51,914 --> 00:21:53,492
Oh, your mom just said --

426
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:54,793
I want ice cream!

427
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:56,908
I got that. However --

428
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:59,701
aaaaaaah!

429
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:02,625
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

430
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:04,181
They only had --

431
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:04,956
shh!

432
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:27,954
Oh, look at that.

433
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,860
That's so unlike him to fall asleep.

434
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:32,190
I think he was bored.

435
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,973
Well, that makes one of us.

436
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:36,226
Come on, honey.

437
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:38,023
Come on, honey.

438
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:40,615
Come on, baby, come on.

439
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:42,613
There you go. Come to mommy.

440
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:44,263
Ooh, that's a big -- ooh.

441
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:46,500
That's my good boy, yes, yes, yes.

442
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:53,689
'Cause mom's got a date with
the deputy with a name like Sachs, mmm!

443
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,190
Veronica? Hi, I'm Dr. Griffith.

444
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,667
I'm so grateful you were able to fit me in.

445
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:10,557
I know there's a lot of work to be done,

446
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:13,000
and I'd really like to get
started as soon as possible.

447
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:16,419
Uh, please. What kind of work
are you thinking about?

448
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:18,705
Uh, well...you tell me.

449
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,309
Well, that's not really how I work.

450
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:24,918
Okay, uh, well... definitely implants --

451
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:28,817
not like clown boobs,
but like a generous "C."

452
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:34,097
Um, and then there's the bump,
and I think my lips could use some work.

453
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,203
You don't really want
to have these procedures done?

454
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:37,337
If you're worried about money,

455
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:40,200
my mother said I could have
work done for my 18th birthday.

456
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:43,270
Veronica, I don't want to waste your time.

457
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,514
Okay? There's absolutely
nothing you need to change.

458
00:23:46,515 --> 00:23:48,280
You're a gorgeous young woman.

459
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,675
I wouldn't perform
a single procedure on you.

460
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:54,178
Dr. Griffith? They're ready.

461
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:55,879
Oh, right, thank you.

462
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:57,765
Um, look, I have a surgery right now,

463
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:00,956
but I have some literature
I'd really like you to look over, okay?

464
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:05,535
Okay?

465
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:10,584
It's Logan.

466
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:15,179
"Life's tragedy is that we get old too
soon and wise too late -- Ben Franklin."

467
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,901
The good news is, I'm perfect the way I am.

468
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:21,110
The bad -- your plastic surgeon is a mensch.

469
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:23,789
A mensch who's surprisingly on the move.

470
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:29,114
Another patient too perfect for plastic,
or was Dr. Griffith giving me the slip?

471
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:45,638
Don't say I never gave you nothing.

472
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:48,824
Well, it's not on fire.

473
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:52,925
What is this?

474
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:55,252
That's what you'll be wearing
when you dust my armoire.

475
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,656
My mother signed over our trust funds.

476
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:02,492
Yeah, I guess she got
used to life sans dick and beav

477
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,134
and made sure we had enough
coin to keep off her couch.

478
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:07,171
Beaver's, of course, heartbroken.

479
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,597
Me? I see it as a chance
to bond with my new mom.

480
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:22,007
Dr. Ego-stroke's emergency?
Shopping for stogies.

481
00:25:22,116 --> 00:25:25,079
After giving another
five minutes for a half-hour,

482
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,463
I need to get out of the car.

483
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:44,404
Can I help you?

484
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:46,656
Uh, yes.

485
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:50,082
I am looking for a present for my dad.

486
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,286
Um...he likes cubans.

487
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:54,650
Follow me.

488
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,961
Thank you very much, sir.

489
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,915
Yay, I'm so excited!

490
00:26:11,627 --> 00:26:13,810
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
You have to take off your shoes.

491
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:16,392
My mother won't let anybody
wear shoes in the house.

492
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:19,294
You wouldn't believe the stuff
you bring in from the outside world.

493
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,944
You brought your sleeping bag.
That's so cute.

494
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:23,951
Well...

495
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:26,302
I like to have the option.

496
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,313
Don't judge me from my ninja turtles.

497
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:38,968
Whoa. Somebody likes their label maker.

498
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:41,203
Yeah, at least we know
where to find everything.

499
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:45,967
Yes, like, the anal psychos
are located right about here.

500
00:26:47,576 --> 00:26:50,572
Great. They kill their guests
and steal their shoes.

501
00:26:51,704 --> 00:26:53,510
Please tell me they kill their guests.

502
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:55,680
I have a surprise for you.

503
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,029
Don't peek.

504
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:01,777
My spidey sense is tingling.
Something bad is happening.

505
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:04,848
It's a girls' night.

506
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:07,512
<i>Come, mr. D.J., Won't you turn the music up?</i>

507
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,706
<i>Hey, mister</i>

508
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:11,026
<i>please, mr. Deejay</i>

509
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:13,579
<i>tell me if you hear me</i>

510
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:15,265
<i>turn the music up</i>

511
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:18,995
<i>hey, mister hey, mister</i>

512
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:19,987
Oh.

513
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,583
That was perfect...baby. Oh.

514
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:31,246
It feels so good to be with you.
I just want to be with you all the time.

515
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:35,589
Uh, a bit of advice --

516
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:39,721
when looking for a sugar daddy, at least
pick the richest guy in the hotel suite.

517
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,964
I'm sorry, did that hurt your feeling?

518
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:46,974
I can't believe you just said that to me.

519
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:49,526
Doesn't this mean anything to you?

520
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:51,722
It does. It means I'm getting laid.

521
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:53,877
And I owe your village a goat.

522
00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:56,951
You know...

523
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,697
you can joke all you want.

524
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,688
I know we have a connection, Logan.

525
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:03,686
You know, it may have just
started off as sex,

526
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:06,620
but over these past few months,
it's grown into something more.

527
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,444
Wow.

528
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:14,953
So...your feelings have grown
as your available balance has shrunk.

529
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,964
It's like science.

530
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:22,001
One of the problems of sleeping
with your stepson's friend --

531
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:24,684
information tends to leak.

532
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:28,810
I don't know if you've noticed,

533
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:31,818
but you have a pretty good
situation for yourself here.

534
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:35,082
You want to go back to playing
grab-ass with cheerleaders

535
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:36,885
that have just mastered missionary?

536
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,818
See ya.

537
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:41,296
You want things to keep going
the way they've been going,

538
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,382
I'm going to need a few things.

539
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:45,448
I'm sorry, "see ya" was option "a"?

540
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:51,710
Bessie, when the milk stops being free,
I stop drinking it.

541
00:28:51,761 --> 00:28:53,130
Then what am i supposed to do?

542
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,783
"Frankly, my dear" -- you know the rest.

543
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:22,501
I hope you don't mind.

544
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:26,172
It's just that I have this itch on my back,

545
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:28,882
and I was hoping maybe
you could give me a little scratch.

546
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:31,768
I have these fantastic nails...

547
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:34,682
should you need me to return the favor.

548
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:39,977
That's my little brother, Rodney.

549
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:42,343
He just had a birthday,
hence the "thank you" cards.

550
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,501
Hey, Rodney.

551
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:47,343
He's a little weird but sweet.

552
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:50,585
I'm just going to mix these together.
Or will they hate that?

553
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:52,712
Oh, no!

554
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,513
Rodney, it's just water.

555
00:29:58,269 --> 00:29:59,717
He's a little intense sometimes.

556
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,840
Oh, my god, you are crazy.

557
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:05,707
Her butt is so much smaller than mine.

558
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:07,245
Hers is just higher.

559
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:09,960
Rodney?

560
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:11,912
Rodney!

561
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:14,033
Your mother is going to be home soon.

562
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,678
I'm going to have to tell her about this.
You know the rules.

563
00:30:18,865 --> 00:30:20,783
Don't worry. We're not spying on you.

564
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:22,908
Come on, Rodney.

565
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:24,627
We'll get your stuff, take it to your room,

566
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:26,045
and let the girls have their party.

567
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:27,462
Veronica...

568
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,615
do you know how to do dreadlocks?

569
00:30:31,927 --> 00:30:34,764
Don't you just love pizza?
I ate a whole pie once.

570
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:35,649
It kind of hurt.

571
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,627
Pizza has more carbohydrates than,
like, any other food.

572
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,369
Who's got the vodka?

573
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:42,877
Bread has like 1,000 more carbs.

574
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:45,631
Pizza is bread, genius. It's bread and fat.

575
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,477
Wait, I think I just heard my mother.

576
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:48,549
I'll go check.

577
00:31:45,814 --> 00:31:47,933
...Look at the hurdles
G.M. Is trying to clear.

578
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,872
You ever think about just getting a job?

579
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:03,842
This is my job.

580
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:09,756
"Pretty Woman" is still my favorite movie.

581
00:32:09,757 --> 00:32:11,718
Vivian is, like, my hero.

582
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,423
She's a hooker.

583
00:32:13,854 --> 00:32:15,409
Only because she had to be.

584
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,293
She's a hooker.

585
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:22,078
You should put a tattoo right here
so people will have something to look at.

586
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:27,657
So, gia, how are things with you and dick?

587
00:32:27,718 --> 00:32:30,276
Dick? Like, my Dick?

588
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,618
You dated Dick?

589
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:34,593
Um, yeah, for, like, ever.

590
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:35,690
That's so weird.

591
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,195
We came here for the panty raid.

592
00:32:44,602 --> 00:32:46,294
We're staying for spin the bottle.

593
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:48,853
I'm out of here.

594
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:02,460
When you leave a sleepover early,

595
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:05,850
I'm supposed to put a trench coat
over my pajamas and come pick you up.

596
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:07,579
Sorry. I drive now...

597
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:09,333
and I'm not 9.

598
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,737
You'll always be 9 to me, going on 30.

599
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:21,411
Whoa, you two need to be alone?

600
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:24,359
I know we had the smoking talk somewhere
between the birds and the bees

601
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,612
and the drinking and driving.

602
00:33:26,774 --> 00:33:30,466
Actually, I think it was more of
a sentence -- "don't smoke" --

603
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:32,273
and it was between...

604
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:34,569
"The Adventures of Pooh"
µand "Goodnight Moon." '

605
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:35,713
Splain.

606
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:42,279
Oh. I went into a cigar shop
to use the bathroom.

607
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:44,170
Cigar shop on ocean avenue?

608
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:44,798
Yeah.

609
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:48,458
Find other facilities next time, okay?

610
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:51,232
The place is notorious for dealing drugs.

611
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:53,615
I tried to bust them
about 20 times when I was sheriff.

612
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,085
No ski mask?

613
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:02,795
You said, "wear dark colors."

614
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:05,822
We're not breaking into a bank vault
in a James Bond movie.

615
00:34:05,823 --> 00:34:07,008
I don't do this every day.

616
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:10,056
Well, after my brief stint with babysitting,

617
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:12,040
I'm more than happy with the P.I. Life.

618
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:15,767
It's a sad state of affairs when I can't tell
which kid is being locked in the closet,

619
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:18,025
because all the families are equally cuckoo.

620
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:20,814
Hmm. Poetry reading?

621
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:24,343
Hey, uh, Kendall wasn't bugging you
yesterday, was she?

622
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:25,346
No.

623
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,884
Good. Good.

624
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,663
Because, uh...

625
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:32,578
when I saw she was in your room
for a while, I got nervous.

626
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:35,205
You know, I know how she likes
to talk a guy's ear off.

627
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:37,591
She was just asking
for my help with something.

628
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:40,560
We better get going.

629
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:48,136
Tell me they leave it open.

630
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:48,874
No.

631
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,628
I've seen Meg do this a bunch of times.

632
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:53,332
She always forgot her key.

633
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,824
Yeah, this isn't weird at all.

634
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:16,789
Um...I'm going to start with the closet.
Do you want to start with the dresser?

635
00:35:16,842 --> 00:35:19,029
Actually, I'll bet I know where it is.

636
00:35:24,465 --> 00:35:26,268
Giving away Lily's trade secrets?

637
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:28,923
I think she got it from Logan.

638
00:35:29,975 --> 00:35:31,935
I, of course, pass it off as my own.

639
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,349
"The path to god is paved
with righteousness."

640
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:41,216
People suck.

641
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:03,453
This is so neat and perfect.

642
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:06,963
And Rodney's is the neatest of the samples,
and it still doesn't even come close.

643
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:11,667
What?

644
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,749
This isn't little boy's writing.

645
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,163
It has to be.

646
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:19,340
Meg said --

647
00:36:20,353 --> 00:36:23,540
what if... she was covering.

648
00:37:03,326 --> 00:37:04,269
I can't believe this.

649
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,341
Shh, shh, shh.

650
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:27,269
Grace?

651
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:37,537
It's okay, it's okay Grace.

652
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,958
They can tell if the door was open!

653
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:40,307
They're not going to believe me!

654
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:42,012
We're going to get you out of here, okay?

655
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,725
Daddy said I'm not ready.

656
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:47,346
Grace... you remember me, right?

657
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:50,580
It's Duncan, Meg's friend. Remember?

658
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:53,507
I don't want to be tested.

659
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,165
Daddy said I'm not ready.

660
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,458
Hey, that's OK.

661
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:10,248
Grace?

662
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,292
Can you come out, please?

663
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:15,473
Grace, sweetheart?

664
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:16,672
Yes, daddy?

665
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:19,744
Go downstairs, please.

666
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,173
Yes, daddy.

667
00:38:22,078 --> 00:38:23,187
Your mother's in the kitchen.

668
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:25,435
Get down on the floor.

669
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:26,817
Get down on the floor.

670
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:27,575
Why don't you just let us --

671
00:38:27,576 --> 00:38:28,366
Get on the floor!!

672
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:34,495
Honey?

673
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:35,228
Call the sheriff.

674
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,373
I came home from church
and found them in my daughter's room,

675
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:46,422
rifling through her things.

676
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:50,465
We were trying to help Grace.
They've been abusing her.

677
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:52,379
Shut your evil little mouth.
They had her in the closet.

678
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:55,559
Nobody believes a word you say,
you filthy lying whore.

679
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:58,846
Enough, okay? Stop it. Up. Get up.

680
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:06,830
There's a small room inside the closet.

681
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:10,257
He had her locked in. Move the clothes.

682
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,083
I'll be back for a statement.

683
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,567
<i>Holy girl don't get up...</i>

684
00:39:42,107 --> 00:39:44,774
I want them prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

685
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:47,837
I'm not sure if they got anything,
but even if they --

686
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:49,386
what are you doing?

687
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:51,509
You can't do that.

688
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:52,978
I'm the victim here.

689
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:55,943
You have no right to just come into
my house and start poking around.

690
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,006
<i>Run, run</i>

691
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:03,252
It's funny. I heard my father
give that exact speech once.

692
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,683
<i>Stay like this</i>

693
