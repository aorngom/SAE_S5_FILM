1
00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:01,993
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:02,049 --> 00:00:03,355
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:07,017
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts Neuros.

4
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:10,405
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:12,650
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:14,765
something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:17,799
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:21,308
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,039
doing my job...

10
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:25,067
stocking up on aspirin...

11
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,743
because I gotta tell ya,

12
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:30,321
pain's a bitch!

13
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,570
"TRISTATE NATIONAL BANK"

14
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:54,351
So, what do you think he's gonna hit first,
the teller or the vault?

15
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:58,767
- That remains to be seen.
- Or not.

16
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:01,632
Federal agents! Everything is
under control! Connor, get the car.

17
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,694
- Who the hell are you guys?
- Let's go.

18
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:08,318
You're gonna tell me what this is about?

19
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:13,397
Well, you're on your way
to the Freak Zoo Palace, pal.

20
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,287
Not bad, that's the house.

21
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:32,266
Is that what this is to you? Sport?

22
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:36,909
Well, it is us against them, darling, so,
yeah, as long as we're winning, I'm good.

23
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,834
What the hell!

24
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:00,046
Something's up with the Freon.

25
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:03,700
What the hell!

26
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:05,496
It's overheating.

27
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,318
Stop the car.

28
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,304
- Stop the car!
- I can't.

29
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:12,670
Move this damn thing over!

30
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,366
We're not overheating guys.

31
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:19,357
Hang on.

32
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:36,524
Halt! Stop! Stop!

33
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,967
- Stop where you are!
- Connor!

34
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,638
Stop or I'll shoot!

35
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:54,004
You guys want to tell me
what the hell has just happened?

36
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:57,809
That guy was chipped.

37
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,159
PAINKILLER JANE 1x15 "THE HEALER"
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

38
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:11,541
Ok, I've performed over two dozen tests
including a postmortem...

39
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,459
I've found no variation
from the standard Neuro positive.

40
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,460
So how do you explain a chipped Neuro
still able to function.

41
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:20,642
I can't. However,
is merely an assumption...

42
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,175
that this man was responsible
for what happened to the vehicle.

43
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,408
Half the engine block was melted.

44
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:28,608
Trust me, doc, that's a hell of a lot
more than just a bad transmission.

45
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,534
Ok, according to this man's chart,

46
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:33,494
his ability was cellular.

47
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:36,045
Invisibility involves reorganizing
the cellular structure...

48
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,999
to absorb rather than reflect light.

49
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,274
Which has nothing to do
with melting the engine.

50
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,776
Exactly. To date we've never encountered
a Neuro with multiple abilities.

51
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,042
You think we're witnessing
some kind of mutation?

52
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:50,568
Even if we were, and I saw no indication
of that, the man was chipped.

53
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,473
Or maybe the chip failed?

54
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:54,798
My test confirmed
that the chip was functional.

55
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:57,479
Besides, if it failed, wouldn't he
have used his invisibility...

56
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,160
when he attempted to escape?

57
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,428
Something hit that truck, doc.

58
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:06,224
Sure; or someone. But
whatever or however it was,

59
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:08,906
it was not the man you apprehended.

60
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:10,972
Thoughts?

61
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:12,961
Yeah, freak show
is getting freakier by the moment.

62
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:14,499
Constructive thoughts?

63
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,657
If the man did possess multiple powers,

64
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,391
maybe they resided
in different parts of his brain,

65
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:23,700
and when we chipped him,
we only brought half of them down.

66
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:26,622
That's a good thought, but Seth
would've found some indication of that.

67
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,206
So, right now we have no idea
what we're dealing with.

68
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:33,187
Riley, any update on that Neuro
we are looking for? Jennifer Town?

69
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:38,062
She's off the radar. No credit card hits,
bank withdrawals, cell phone use...

70
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:41,356
She's got a removal
a prescription for "Glucofash".

71
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,121
No hits on the pharmacy either.

72
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:46,099
- Anything off the Comsat?
- Flat line. Nothing.

73
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,240
I've got a whole lot of people
giving me a whole lot of nothing.

74
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:54,302
I'll let you know when I have something.

75
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,330
Easier to find real men with real weapons.

76
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:00,079
None of that's easy.

77
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,423
As for our invisible Neuro, I still think
we can't rule out a mutation.

78
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:08,066
Which Seth won't be able to identify
which put some another step ahead of us.

79
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,182
Well, look at the bright side,
you could've been a lawyer.

80
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:14,085
I better take off.

81
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:16,644
You still owe me that incident report
form the Forrest case.

82
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:19,429
Which is still sitting on my desk.

83
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:23,472
As you can tell paperwork
is not my favorite thing.

84
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,377
You don't have to like it,
Jane, you just have to do it.

85
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:32,822
Brian and I have plans tonight.
It's sort of an anniversary.

86
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:35,664
One more day?

87
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,574
What would that be,
the third one more day?

88
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:45,619
Go ahead. Someone at least
will get something out of this day.

89
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,040
- Thanks.
- Have fun.

90
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:54,754
Some times you need a shower
after a rough day.

91
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:57,997
Not just to cleanse the body but
sometimes the mind.

92
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,240
Not to say mine's particularly dirty,
although I do have my moments,

93
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:04,563
I'm talking more about the conscience.

94
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:11,216
Bri, what're you doing here?

95
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:14,938
You want to try that again but
this time with...

96
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:18,881
Bri! Hey, this is great!
I thought you were out of town and...

97
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:21,705
I'm so happy that you came
back a day early just to see me.

98
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:25,246
Of course I'm happy to see you.

99
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,599
But...

100
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,694
But...

101
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,475
I didn't know you were coming...

102
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:36,884
and have this report due...

103
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:40,211
and I promised to have it in
tomorrow morning.

104
00:07:40,698 --> 00:07:43,326
- So, what's another day?
- It's my job.

105
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:51,099
All right, it's all right. I understand.

106
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:56,473
I don't suppose there's another
beautiful, brilliant woman in town who...

107
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,697
wouldn't mind a surprise visit.

108
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,290
I promise I'll make it up to you.

109
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,182
- But the report comes first.
- Only tonight.

110
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:27,328
I had to make sure my nose
wasn't too close to Brian's face...

111
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:29,348
or I might have poked his eye out.

112
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:33,538
When it comes to lying,
Pinocchio has noting on me today.

113
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:39,549
Who was it that said:
"No matter how bad you feel,

114
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:42,309
guilt makes it worse.

115
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,774
No wait, that was me.

116
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,459
Hi. Thanks.

117
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:25,123
- I'm working on it.
- News flash!

118
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:27,514
Our paralyzer Neuro. I've got her.

119
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:33,000
Jennifer Talon. I think she finally
took a chance and used her cell phone.

120
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:35,026
- I hope it was important.
- Location?

121
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,502
The Marina.

122
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:41,858
I'll work in SatCom now to narrow it down.

123
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,290
All right, let's roll.

124
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:47,190
Go at Jennifer Talon from a distance.

125
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:48,935
I'm not an idiot, boss.

126
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,676
Long range night scope with a chip rifle.
Silencer too, for her pleasure.

127
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:57,092
That's good. We get too close to this woman,
we don't know what she's capable of.

128
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:59,574
Well, if we get too close to her...

129
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,684
Adequate.

130
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,123
The cruise was wonderful, thank you.

131
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:16,057
I hoped to be in many more.

132
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,228
Sorry, I...

133
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,932
Don't fight it Adam...

134
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:34,639
It won't do any good.

135
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,410
I know, it must be a disconcerting feeling
experiencing complete paralysis.

136
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,998
The mind fully functioning.

137
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:48,413
aware of what's going on but...

138
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,964
the body just won't respond.

139
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:58,679
It must be just awful.

140
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:12,689
You did tell me I was priceless.

141
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,687
You're wrong.

142
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:19,788
- Riley?
- Sector right, last boat.

143
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:20,881
Got it.

144
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:23,925
- All right, careful boss.
- Thanks, kid.

145
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:41,070
It's right in front of you.
This leap succeed.

146
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,396
The effects of the paralysis
will wear off once I leave.

147
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:11,028
You might be a little sore.

148
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,475
Take two aspirin.

149
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:18,758
Don't call me in the morning.

150
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,596
- You're ok?
- I'm fine. Keep going.

151
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,575
- Connor is down!
- I'm on my way.

152
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,755
- Take it.
- I'll be ok, keep going.

153
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,528
Pressure.

154
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,402
I know, I can be a real bitch sometimes.

155
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:04,897
Come here.

156
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:12,837
- You ok?
- Is that Jennifer Talon?

157
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:15,285
Wasted talent.

158
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:18,865
Yep, you're all right.

159
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:22,767
Get him back to the subway. Have
Seth look him over. I'll clean up here.

160
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,333
What are you gonna do with me?

161
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:33,658
We'll take you some place where there
are a lot of other people just like you.

162
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,198
All right, you're all done.

163
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:44,191
- So, what's the damage?
- Besides his face?

164
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:46,757
The cut was strong. I will have
the stitches out in a few days,

165
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:49,091
Just try not to put
too much strain on that area.

166
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,478
Thanks doc, I'll mention that
to the next Neuro who tries to kill me.

167
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,349
We were fifty yards from that boat.
There's no way she could've seen us coming.

168
00:14:58,426 --> 00:15:02,224
Try telling that to my spleen.
She must've spotted us.

169
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:03,763
I don't think so.

170
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:07,567
It's like the last one. Jennifer Talon
had the ability to induce paralysis.

171
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:09,510
That is not what went down in the dock.

172
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,318
You think this is the same mutation?

173
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:13,792
- Twice in a row?
- A bit of a coincidence.

174
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:16,531
- What then?
- I think we've got a second Neuro.

175
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:19,178
He'd harassed you this morning,
hit us in the Marina this afternoon.

176
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:21,182
I can help up with that.

177
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:25,150
Some of the damps the dock was very
similar to what happened to our transport.

178
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,914
What are you saying, we have
some lunatic Neuro stalking the team?

179
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:31,213
Starting to look that way.

180
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,080
They'd need access to our Intel.

181
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:36,610
They've got that.

182
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:38,311
A leak.

183
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:41,560
Not from my system.
I could not happen.

184
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:44,867
They did, Riley. I need you to double
and triple check your security.

185
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,595
- Look...
- Just do it.

186
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:51,929
The leak could be human, not systems.

187
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:55,730
- Even one of us.
- No, Outside. Morgan's people.

188
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:58,253
- I'll handle that end.
- And our end?

189
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,665
It doesn't make any sense. Everything
that's happened has put us at risk.

190
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,087
Besides, I trust you people with my life.

191
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,780
Something troubling you?

192
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,911
We've been working
together for five weeks now.

193
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:31,778
Has there been any change with you?

194
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:34,005
I don't know.

195
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,952
I think I'm just gonna wind up
a freak that heals with a high IQ.

196
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:40,887
- And that scares you.
- Shouldn't it?

197
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:44,416
Strange, eh?

198
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:49,221
Someone who comes to a healer
hoping he can help her not heal.

199
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:54,263
God chooses different paths
for his children.

200
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:57,410
We see killing most
when we stray from that path.

201
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:00,517
Something else is bothering you.

202
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:04,132
I told you previously that I have
misgivings about my work.

203
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,827
That I'm not always sure
that we're doing the right thing.

204
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,282
And...

205
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,861
I'm not supposed to be talking
about it with anyone.

206
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,824
Now you've assured me
that whatever we discuss...

207
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,601
- ...is completely confidential.
- And it is.

208
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:19,772
Do you trust me?

209
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,358
Yes.

210
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,535
You're still getting the headaches?

211
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,194
Maybe all I really need is some sleep.

212
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:43,086
I'm gonna head out.

213
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:46,481
Can I trouble you with one
more thing before I go?

214
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:49,181
- A hug?
- Of course.

215
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:59,423
I'm available whenever
you feel is necessary, Jane.

216
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:01,308
Thank you.

217
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:29,836
This better be important.
I don't like wasting my time.

218
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:31,920
It is Morgan, we have a leak.

219
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:34,537
- Single instance?
- Multiple.

220
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,783
- Consequences?
- Casualties, none fatal yet.

221
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,653
- Fix him before there are.
- That's why I'm here.

222
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:44,310
I don't appreciate what you're implying.

223
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:47,590
Rest assured my plumbing is very
sound. If there's a leak,

224
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:49,644
it's coming from your own kitchen.

225
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,786
Until this is resolved
I'm taking my team in dark.

226
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:56,896
- People in the dark tend to step their toe.
- They won't.

227
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:02,567
Do it, but watch your step.

228
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:14,291
You're still here!

229
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:16,006
Of course I'm still here!

230
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,738
The man said double
and triple check my systems.

231
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:21,811
You can't go over the blueprints of
the pyramids and get home by 5 o'clock.

232
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,021
Sorry I asked.

233
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:26,172
- Is Seth still in the lab?
- Isn't he always?

234
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,076
Double and triple check your systems.

235
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:34,330
Unbelievable.

236
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:38,909
What you got there?

237
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:41,608
You scared me.

238
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,440
- I'm sorry, I...
- That's fine.

239
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:46,129
What are you into so late?

240
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,311
Just a theory I'm working on.

241
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:50,860
- Tell me about it.
- Really?

242
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:52,796
Really. What's up?

243
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:55,725
Ok, Neanderthal.

244
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:57,585
- Neanderthal?
- Indeed!

245
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,896
One the $ 10.000 questions in genetics,

246
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,804
well, in evolutionary biology
in general, is...

247
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:05,493
what happened to Neanderthal?

248
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,318
I don't know. What did happen to it?

249
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:16,183
No it, them. I don't know either,
but the question is very exciting.

250
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:19,016
It's just a hobby of mine.
So far I surmised that...

251
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,620
Neanderthal DNA maybe somehow
hiding inside the human population.

252
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,970
- Hiding?
- Yes.

253
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:26,869
- Fascinating.
- Yes!

254
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,569
Would you like to see
the genome structure?

255
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:31,381
You know I absolutely would, Seth,
but I've...

256
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,779
I've got this report do and...

257
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,111
- Maybe another time.
- Yeah, absolutely.

258
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,144
Oh, actually, could you...

259
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:41,365
do me a favor?

260
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:44,185
Hairs? Human?

261
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,879
Unless they're Neanderthal.

262
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:49,374
I'm just kidding, Seth.

263
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:53,813
Would you mind running a
DNA test for me and...

264
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,127
keeping it between us.

265
00:20:57,312 --> 00:20:59,502
Andre has to authorize all the tests.

266
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:03,776
Right, that's right.
The ones he knows about.

267
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:11,111
This is US government equipment, Jane.
All the tests have to be authorized.

268
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:13,359
Even with my hobby, Andre sings off.

269
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:17,489
I'm not asking you to do anything
outside of the box here, Seth.

270
00:21:17,924 --> 00:21:20,683
DNA testing is a very important part
of what we do.

271
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:24,214
- Yes, it is.
- So, we're not doing anything wrong here,

272
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,894
and if the results come back
Neuro positive,

273
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:28,788
I'll tell Andre right away.

274
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:30,818
Jane, where did you get this sample from?

275
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:34,309
Seth, I'm asking you to do me...

276
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:37,093
a personal favor, ok?

277
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:40,911
I mean, we got to have something
over the Neanderthals, right?

278
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:45,480
You see, we are smart enough
to know when we can...

279
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:48,209
alter the rules.

280
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:51,529
Ok.

281
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:53,212
Thank you.

282
00:22:00,914 --> 00:22:02,595
Seth!

283
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:04,993
What kind of person are you?

284
00:22:06,454 --> 00:22:08,440
What's it, do you think you're
above the rules, or what?

285
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:11,492
- Riley. Let me tell you, it's all me.
- Jane. Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane.

286
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:16,124
Let Seth explain it himself.

287
00:22:19,653 --> 00:22:23,467
- I don't know what to say.
- Cause there's nothing to say.

288
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:26,316
Seth...

289
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:29,120
when you finish the last cup of coffee...

290
00:22:29,757 --> 00:22:31,623
you put on a new pot.

291
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,377
You put on a new pot.

292
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,123
Plain and simple.

293
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:48,556
- I think what I said.
- Yeah, look

294
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:50,838
- ...call me with the results.
- Immediately.

295
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,438
- Hello.
- Jane, it's Seth.

296
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:09,809
I just thought you'd be glad to know
that the sample tested Neuro negative.

297
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:13,085
Thanks.

298
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:25,894
Okay. I just want to thank you...

299
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:28,576
Jane! Congratulations
on you new promotion!

300
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:32,520
I heard you authorized
a DNA test yesterday.

301
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:38,383
- Yes.
- I want chapter and verse.

302
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,895
Who? What? When?

303
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:42,807
Why?

304
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:45,689
A while back I went out a window.

305
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:48,671
Cut off 46 stories.

306
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,710
All the way down, I thought it was over.

307
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,076
Obviously, it wasn't.

308
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,383
But it's been bugging me
ever since that...

309
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:02,802
the meaning of life and all that.
What I am.

310
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,230
Is this you attempting
to answer my question?

311
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:09,742
- What do you know of the fate of yours?
- Not as much as I want to.

312
00:24:10,077 --> 00:24:14,216
Right, I felt the same way, but this guy,
Joseph Grace is different.

313
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:15,787
Joseph Grace?

314
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,458
You know this guy?

315
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:20,822
Well, yes, he's been the subject
of some controversy in the literature,

316
00:24:20,957 --> 00:24:24,629
involving cases of terminal cancer that
went into remission. That sort of thing.

317
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:26,304
You're saying he's for real?

318
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,272
Well, that depend on what you mean.

319
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:30,816
Do I think people may have healed
under his influence? It's likely.

320
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,542
There's a recognized,
perceivable effect in the body.

321
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:37,705
I'd attribute half of his supposed miracles
to that, the other half to exaggeration.

322
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,282
All right, I want you
to find out more about this guy.

323
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:42,422
You, with me.

324
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:46,956
I'm sorry, I thought he knew.
I thought he knew.

325
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:49,421
And you've been seen this man
for over a month?

326
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,182
Yes.

327
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:53,039
And when we found
we had a leak you had to wonder...

328
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,261
if this was the Neuro stalking our team.

329
00:24:56,807 --> 00:25:00,200
When Joseph uses his healing on me,
I feel something.

330
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:02,996
Like an energy passing through me.

331
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:08,562
I suppose I had to consider the possibilities
that it wasn't all God given.

332
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:13,484
- You told him things.
- Nothing that would compromise the team.

333
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,915
Joseph is a good man
and he did test Neuro negative.

334
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,781
And if he hadn't?

335
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,519
I suppose this would be the last
conversation we'd be having.

336
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:26,138
Is it?

337
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:30,522
Don't ever go behind my back again.

338
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:33,978
You have a problem, you come talk to me.

339
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:37,772
Right.

340
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,209
Eh, Riley, what do you got on this guy?

341
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:50,732
Joseph Grace. He's not criminal record,
never been sued,

342
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,957
Doctors they think he's full of it
but they can't prove anything.

343
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:54,640
Doesn't mean he's not full of it?

344
00:25:54,832 --> 00:25:58,254
Not to the nine documented cases of cancer
remission he's had in the last five years.

345
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,999
Look, whatever healed this people
wasn't this bozo?

346
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:03,187
What's Jane to heal her for anyway? I mean,

347
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,493
it might be the one thing
she doesn't need help with.

348
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,925
She can heal the wound
but she cannot heal the pain.

349
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,346
Did you make that up yourself?

350
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,761
- I read it in a fortune cookie.
- Oh, hey Connor,

351
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,522
- ...you're not feeling well.
- What?

352
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,274
Yeah, you're feeling kind of sick,
you make an appointment with Joseph Grace.

353
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,851
- See what you can find out.
- Look, I already know what I'll find out.

354
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:24,657
The guy tested Neuro negative.
I'd be wasting my time.

355
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:26,296
Humor me.

356
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:49,068
If he lays his hands on me...

357
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:03,804
This means spiritual pace is pretty good.

358
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,781
Hello, I'm Joseph.

359
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:28,144
Thank you for coming.
Won't you come in?

360
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,112
Constant pain.
And they say nothing can be done.

361
00:27:39,147 --> 00:27:42,413
I've tried everything.
This is my last resort.

362
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:46,289
Faith. Is our faith
that keeps us close to the creator.

363
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:50,824
I try and play a small part on that.

364
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:55,231
Do you thing you can help me?

365
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,642
Relax.

366
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:00,899
Close your eyes.

367
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:05,077
Clear your mind of worries...

368
00:28:05,377 --> 00:28:06,713
of questions...

369
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,987
Give me your hands.

370
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:14,315
I'll give them back, I promise.

371
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:23,167
Now, just relax.

372
00:29:16,994 --> 00:29:18,938
Hear boss,

373
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:23,597
We've to talk. Either this guy is a Neuro,
or he's the real deal.

374
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:26,595
Copy.

375
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:33,266
- What do you got, doc?
- Ok.

376
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:37,733
These images are from a medical
investigation into Joseph Grace...

377
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:39,141
conducted at Mass General.

378
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:41,447
This is a broken femur that healed normally.

379
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:43,901
This is femur that was ravished
by bone cancer that was...

380
00:29:43,936 --> 00:29:45,614
quote, unquote, healed by Joseph Grace.

381
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,080
Doctor, I have no idea
what we're looking at here.

382
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:49,472
Ok, that's the normally healed bone.

383
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,140
This is the other one.

384
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:53,486
They're different.

385
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:56,159
Yes, they're different, but
what this shows is that Joseph...

386
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,849
actually has a real effect.
He's actually healing people.

387
00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:01,187
- I'm astonished.
- So was Connor.

388
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,425
Apparently his wound has already healed.

389
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,986
Really? I'll look into that.

390
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:09,737
Doctor, tell me something.

391
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:13,265
Could this healing have
a potential downside?

392
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,830
Could it be dangerous?

393
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,707
To the average person?

394
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:20,495
Not that I can tell. Heal the cells but...

395
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:23,320
these are from Jane.

396
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,749
That's from before,
that's from a couple of days ago.

397
00:30:26,836 --> 00:30:29,582
It's the same. I mean, all I can see here
is that Joseph healing effect on Jane...

398
00:30:29,617 --> 00:30:31,395
- ...is the same as the others.
- Yes, but...

399
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:34,413
you have to remember that Jane
isn't like another people.

400
00:30:38,432 --> 00:30:39,982
Hey boss, what are you doing?

401
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:45,354
No, no, no. It's all right.
I've doing this all night.

402
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,798
I've got a beat on that Neuro
has been ambushing us.

403
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:49,485
It's time we turn the tables.

404
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:52,280
Did you find out how he's getting
access to inside information?

405
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:54,074
No, we chip him first, ask questions later.

406
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,453
It's what I've talking about.

407
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,650
I've got this surveillance shot
off the FBI database.

408
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:00,977
He's a mercenary.
Works for the highest bidder.

409
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:03,653
Seems pretty able to elude
FBI surveillance at will.

410
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,743
We got it at the scene
of every ambush so far.

411
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:11,729
I know exactly where and when
to find you, son of a bitch.

412
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:03,831
Connor?

413
00:32:04,086 --> 00:32:06,455
Yeah, I'm in position.
No sign of the subject.

414
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,734
- Vasco.
- In position.

415
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:11,426
Got nothing either.

416
00:32:11,777 --> 00:32:13,250
Riley, talk to me.

417
00:32:13,852 --> 00:32:16,191
Subject’s vehicle has entered the vicinity.

418
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:18,986
Unless he's been tipped and it's a decoy.

419
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,818
No, no. Play it through.

420
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:32,341
I've got him.
Entering the park from the East.

421
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:39,328
I do not have a clear shot.

422
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:49,428
I got him.

423
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:04,206
Holly!

424
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:23,548
He's moving!

425
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:23,412
Don't bother.

426
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,953
This is Edward Small.
A friend of mine.

427
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,552
Go, will you?

428
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:37,488
You're just gonna let him go?

429
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:42,527
- He's the one who's been attacking us!
- No Jane, you are.

430
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:48,453
There's no doubt in my mind.

431
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,998
There should be. I would never do
anything to put this team in danger.

432
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:54,455
You would never do anything consciously.

433
00:34:54,505 --> 00:34:56,910
I've discovered how
Joseph healing ability works.

434
00:34:57,062 --> 00:35:01,823
Basically he's somehow able to energize
each cell stimulating it to repair itself.

435
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,109
Then that energy creates
an attractive force...

436
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:07,030
bringing the organ
or tissue together with hope.

437
00:35:07,228 --> 00:35:09,928
- But?
- But your constitution is not typical.

438
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:12,244
Tell me about it.

439
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:16,629
Applying Joseph energy to someone
like you, the results are unpredictable.

440
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:21,245
Even so, how is this connected
with my sabotaging the team?

441
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,784
Jane, you have more than once voiced your
doubts about what it is we have to do,

442
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:28,723
and let's be frank; on several occasions
you've deliberately disobey my orders.

443
00:35:30,223 --> 00:35:34,221
Yeah, but during those attacks,
I was in as much danger as you and Connor.

444
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,246
You think I'm trying to take myself out?

445
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:47,174
We believe that Joseph's energy
affected you or your mind in such a way...

446
00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:50,141
that your doubts began
to manifest themselves...

447
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:52,397
and they started to work against the team.

448
00:35:52,811 --> 00:35:54,296
You don't believe this.

449
00:35:56,773 --> 00:35:58,196
Jane,

450
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:02,378
your current genetic profile is something
that we don't fully understand.

451
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,675
you heal rapidly,
you IQ is increasing steadily,

452
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:07,955
there's really no saying
what you're capable of.

453
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:10,605
Even trying to undermine my own team?

454
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,263
There's something else.

455
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,983
Joseph Grace has tested Neuro positive.

456
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:17,065
How is that possible?

457
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:18,996
- Seth told me that...
- When Seth ran the first test,

458
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,133
-  ...you were in proximity.
- First test?

459
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:25,168
We tested again
with a sample that Connor acquired.

460
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,677
And with you out of the picture,

461
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,647
he tested positive.

462
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:32,175
So, wait a minute,
you're telling me that...

463
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,794
somehow I was able to wield
the sample I brought you to change?

464
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:41,400
- I don't believe that.
- No, I didn't think you would.

465
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:44,032
Jane, I have told no one else...

466
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:46,389
about your condition,
no one outside this team.

467
00:36:46,424 --> 00:36:48,832
- Thank you, your point?
- I made a mistake.

468
00:36:49,226 --> 00:36:50,417
I don't blame you,

469
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:53,879
but it's clear you've become a liability.

470
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:58,848
Now, I would prefer
not to have to restrain you.

471
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:24,098
Convincing enough for you?

472
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:30,735
Seth seems fairly certain that
once you stop seen Grace,

473
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:33,899
you'll recover from whatever it is
that happened to you.

474
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,522
I'll heal from the healer.

475
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:38,470
We need to eliminate the source.

476
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:42,357
Whatever Joseph effect has been on me
he didn't do this. I did.

477
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:44,500
All he's ever done is try to help people.

478
00:37:44,544 --> 00:37:48,877
Jane, that is a voice inside your head
trying to justify why a part of you...

479
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:51,142
interfere with this. Joseph is a Neuro.

480
00:37:51,377 --> 00:37:54,887
You have first hand experience of how
his healing can have disastrous results.

481
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:56,608
Yeah, on someone like me.

482
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:58,128
We have to chip him.

483
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:02,239
All right, then let me do it.

484
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,090
It's unnecessary.

485
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,465
No, I have to overcome this.

486
00:38:08,544 --> 00:38:10,357
Let's get it over with then.

487
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:17,548
When you phoned it sounded important.

488
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:18,901
Are you all right?

489
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:24,673
I think it's time you learned
about my work.

490
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,094
For some unknown reason,

491
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:32,169
a neurological aberration has
appeared in our population.

492
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:37,135
This aberration allow people
to make things happen.

493
00:38:38,325 --> 00:38:41,727
Some of these things are pretty fantastic.

494
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:45,804
while other are very dangerous.

495
00:38:46,777 --> 00:38:50,391
I've seen people make
others jump off buildings.

496
00:38:51,058 --> 00:38:55,247
Or start fires, by will alone.

497
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:58,776
Even raise people from the dead.

498
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:00,896
Good Lord.

499
00:39:01,328 --> 00:39:04,817
We call these people Neuros.

500
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:09,437
My job is to go and find these Neuros...

501
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:12,391
and implant them with a chip that...

502
00:39:12,615 --> 00:39:15,729
neutralizes their abilities.

503
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,996
Joseph, you're a Neuro.

504
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:36,366
My gift is God given.

505
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:41,360
Whatever form it takes, who are you
or anybody else to take it away?

506
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:46,284
The diseases that you heal are God given.

507
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:48,985
We might not be meant
to tamper with any of it.

508
00:39:49,173 --> 00:39:51,159
If I run?

509
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:53,958
I don't think you will.

510
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:59,586
Will it hurt?

511
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,807
I don't know.

512
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:42,618
Come on, this way buddy.

513
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:56,200
Good news.

514
00:40:56,256 --> 00:41:00,107
The cellular anomalies caused by Joseph
healing appear to have cleared up.

515
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:02,022
Great.

516
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:05,955
So, I'm back to my
normal, abnormal self.

517
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,385
I wonder if you'll ever
find a cure for that.

518
00:41:12,155 --> 00:41:14,484
Is that why you were going to see Joseph?

519
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:19,501
You said that the anomalies
had cleared up.

520
00:41:19,638 --> 00:41:21,919
Does that that me that, whatever it was,

521
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,949
that last entrapment inside of me
has cleared up too?

522
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:29,904
You want the truth?

523
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:32,944
Probably not.

524
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,875
I'll catch you later, doc.

525
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:43,671
Yes, Sir. Right away.

526
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:45,929
That was Morgan!
We're all getting raises.

527
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,860
That was Morgan and we have a problem.

528
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:50,260
- Another one?
- Do they ever end?

529
00:41:50,954 --> 00:41:52,412
You know anything about this?

530
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:54,928
When it comes to Morgan's business,
I don't want to know.

531
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:03,769
Have been receiving Intel that we may
have problems at the internment zone.

532
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:08,006
NICO is 5000 miles away.
How does that concern my team?

533
00:42:08,186 --> 00:42:09,825
If my information is reliable,

534
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:12,994
somewhere keep people at NICO
may have been compromised.

535
00:42:13,029 --> 00:42:15,473
The only physician in my team is Seth.
I can't imagine...

536
00:42:15,508 --> 00:42:17,820
While the problem may extend
to the medical staff,

537
00:42:17,855 --> 00:42:20,546
our primary concern
is security and administration.

538
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:24,251
You can't be sure who if any
of the locals can be trusted.

539
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:27,560
I'll keep you informed as our
intelligence develops but for now...

540
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:29,394
this is strictly need to know.

541
00:42:29,566 --> 00:42:31,143
Is not to go beyond us.

542
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:46,735
Someone once said
we are our own worst enemy.

543
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:51,916
Their job probably didn't involve
going against neurological aberrant,

544
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:54,804
but after these past few days...

545
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:57,268
I just may have to agree with them.

546
00:42:57,759 --> 00:43:00,563
Is bad enough dealing
with your own inner turmoil,

547
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,727
if that manifested itself
in the physical plane...

548
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:06,890
I can't even imagine what
this world would look like.

549
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:10,291
