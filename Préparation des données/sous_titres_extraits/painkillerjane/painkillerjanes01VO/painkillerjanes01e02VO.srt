00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,200
The Difference Is,
I'm Cool With Being What I Am.

351
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,360
But You, I Don't Know,
There's Something About You,

352
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,560
Like You're Trying To Hide
It From Everyone.

353
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,300
I Think We'd Better
Call It A Night.

354
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,300
There's Still Half
A Bottle Left.

355
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm Beat.

356
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,600
Maybe Another Time.

357
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,530
Okay, See Ya.

358
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,200
 <I>Amanda Was Being</I>
 <I>Honest And I Wasn't.</I>

359
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,030
 <I>Truth Is, I Was More</I>
 <I>"Off To The Side"</I>

360
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,760
 <I>Than She Would Ever Know.</I>

361
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,660
 <I>I Was Angry,</I>

362
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,730
 <I>And Although It Didn't</I>
 <I>Make A Lot Of Sense,</I>

363
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,800
 <I>I Had To Prove It To Myself.</I>

364
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,730
Ahhhhhh!!!!

365
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,030
 <I>Like The Lady Said...</I>

366
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,360
 <I>"Off To The Side."</I>

367
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,860
It's My Opinion, Sir,
That The President's Security

368
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,400
Might Be Compromised.

369
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,830
 <I>The Tower Dedication</I>
 <I>Cannot Be Rescheduled.</I>

370
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,900
Then His Security Team
Needs To Be Fully Informed.

371
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
 <I>They're Already Aware</I>
 <I>Of Risk Potential.</I>

372
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,530
But Not What's Behind It.

373
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,560
 <I>Your Team Will Have</I>
 <I>To Work That Angle.</I>

374
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,430
That's Four People.

375
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,230
If We're Up Against What
I Think We Might Be--

376
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,330
 <I>The Decision Is Final,</I>
 <I>Agent Mcbride.</I>

377
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,430
Yes, Sir.

378
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,230
Boss,

379
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,960
We've Got One
On The Move.

380
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,060
What?

381
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,560
Another Corpse.

382
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,760
I Instructed
Cemetery Personnel
In The Affected Area

383
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,160
To Keep An Eye On
Subjects That Match

384
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,530
The Physical Profile.

385
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,330
Good, Where Is It?

386
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,000
Started Off At
Lawnmore Cemetery.

387
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,130
But He's A Good Five
Miles From There Now.

388
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,430
How're You Tracking Him?

389
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,430
I'm On The Comm Set With
The Cemetery Caretaker.

390
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,200
I Talked Him Into
Following The Guy.

391
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,030
Brave Man.

392
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,400
Not Really, He's Crapping
Himself So You Guys Better
Get Rolling Like Now.

393
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,360
We're On It.

394
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,060
Climbed Right Out Of
The Ground And Walked Here.

395
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,800
We'll Take Care Of It.

396
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,430
I Never Seen
Anything Like It.

397
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,930
He Climbed Right
Out Of The Ground.

398
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,360
Thanks.

399
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,860
Alright, You And Maureen,
You Take The Dead Guy.

400
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,760
Connor And I, We'll See If
We Can Find His Controller.

401
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,330
Okay.

402
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,000
Alright.

403
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,560
Climbed Right Out
Of The Ground.

404
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,700
[ Fighting Grunts ]

405
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,560
Mo!!!

406
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Noooooo!!!!!!!

407
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,200
Mo, Are You Okay?

408
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,200
Night Vision Goggles.

409
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,800
See What Else You
Can Find.

410
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,330
Take It Easy.

411
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,430
Looks Like The Neuro
Gave Up The Fight.

412
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,060
We Must Have
Scared Him Off.

413
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,330
What The Hell's In This
Place That Was So Important?

414
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,030
That's What We're Going
To Find Out.

415
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,400
(Maureen:) Basketballs
And Tennis Rackets.

416
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,500
(Connor:) It's Full
Of Sporting Goods.

417
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,860
Maybe Joe Was Right.

418
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,360
The Guy's Starting
His Own Team.

419
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,300
How Does This Figure
In A Specials Ops Mission

420
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,630
To Hit The President?

421
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,330
It Doesn't.

422
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,960
Using Fit, Young Men
To Form An Army...

423
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,430
His Name's Albert Malley.

424
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,630
Everything About
Him's Off-Profile.

425
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,530
 <I>He Died Of Natural Causes</I>
 <I>Six Months Ago.</I>

426
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,200
What's His History?

427
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
Sketchy.

428
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,300
I'm Not Sure If
He Was Indigent...

429
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,000
 <I>Living Alone...</I>

430
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,460
 <I>But I'm Having A Hard</I>
 <I>Time Coming Up With</I>
 <I>A Last Known Address...</I>

431
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,230
 <I>Family.</I>

432
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,130
You're Having A Hard Time?

433
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,860
Temporary.

434
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,300
Trust Me.

435
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,760
I'll Get What We Need...

436
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,600
I'm Tunneling
Into The I.R.S.

437
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,230
You Can Do That?

438
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,300
Yeah.

439
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,660
Wish I Knew You
Eight Years Ago.

440
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,460
Even If Someone Claimed
Him As A Dependent...

441
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,100
I Should Be Able To
Come Up With A Hit.

442
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,900
Anyone Spotted Him?

443
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,460
Not Since He...Arose?

444
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,060
The Locals Are
All Over It.

445
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,530
If They Find Him,

446
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,400
I Will.

447
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,560
What's The Consensus?

448
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,600
Anyone Think This Is Wired
Into The Tower Ceremony?

449
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,460
Even An Army's Gotta Eat.

450
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,860
Maybe He's A Cook.

451
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,900
You Know A Lot Of Dead
People With Appetites?

452
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,400
Don't Know A Lotta Dead
People Walkin' Around Either.

453
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,600
The Dedication Ceremony's
Tomorrow Morning.

454
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,260
We're Going To Have
To Keep On That Track

455
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,900
Unless Anyone's Got
A Better Idea.

456
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,230
 <I>This Is</I>
 <I>The President's Route.</I>

457
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,360
 <I>He'll Be In The</I>
 <I>Third Car From The Front</I>

458
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,330
 <I>And He's Pretty Much Protected</I>
 <I>Until They Stop</I>

459
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,060
 <I>And Cross Into The Lobby</I>
 <I>Where The Ceremony Is.</I>

460
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,860
 <I>If I Was Going To Try</I>
 <I>For A Hit...</I>

461
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,960
 <I>This Is Where I'd Do It.</I>

462
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,100
 <I>There's A Clear</I>
 <I>Line Of Fire</I>

463
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,130
 <I>From At Least Three</I>
 <I>Different Points...</I>

464
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,800
 <I>Between The Limo And</I>
 <I>The Front Entrance</I>

465
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,360
There's A Tight Window
Of Exposure.

466
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,860
But Enough Time
To Kill Somebody.

467
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,260
 <I>Yeah.</I>

468
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,800
We Have To Proceed
As Planned.

469
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,300
We're Way Off Profile Here.

470
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,100
Sporting Goods,
Albert Malley?

471
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,260
You Really Think This Is
About Hitting The President?

472
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,960
We Can't Risk Otherwise.

473
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,260
But If We're Wrong...

474
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,960
And We Are...

475
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,200
We Might Be Putting Someone
Else's Life At Risk.

476
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,130
No One's Died So Far.

477
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,760
So Far!

478
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,700
Last Night The Guy Tried To Put
A Pipe Through Maureen's Head.

479
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,930
You Even Said,

480
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,600
We Don't Even Know What
We're Up Against.

481
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,530
You Know I'm Right
About This.

482
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,600
You Might Be.

483
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,660
But We Have Our Orders.

484
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,960
I Thought We Didn't
Take Orders.

485
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,430
This Conversation's Over.

486
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,560
Nice Bike!

487
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,900
Thanks!

488
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,960
Is It Yours?

489
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,660
It Is Now.

490
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,930
Doesn't Run But...

491
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,660
...You've Got A Friend
Who'll Fix It.

492
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah.

493
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,260
Hey, A Guy Came
By To See You.

494
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,430
Great.

495
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,960
It Was Your Dad.

496
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,930
What'd He Say?

497
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,630
Dad Stuff, I Guess.

498
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,930
Kept Asking If
You Were Okay.

499
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,360
Said He Hadn't Talked
To You In A While.

500
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,700
Yeah, Thanks.

501
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,660
I'll Tell You
One Thing...

502
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,930
If I Had A Dad...

503
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,160
I'd Talk To Him.

504
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,560
Where The Hell's Vasco?!

505
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,330
Why Wouldn't They
Close The Area Off
To Pedestrians

506
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,630
And Private Vehicles?

507
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,230
Maybe They Thought That
Would Draw More Attention.

508
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,000
You Know, We're Going
To Have To Deploy,
Even Short-Handed.

509
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,460
If There Are Any Shooters,
We're Going To Have

510
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,800
To Leave Them To The
Feds And Hope They Can
Stop Them.

511
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,260
Because They Sure As
Hell Can't Kill Them.

512
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,300
Connor, You Work
Surveillance Up Here.

513
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,330
We'll Work Ground Level.

514
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,800
If We See Anyone
Who Looks...

515
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,700
... Dead?

516
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,960
Radio To Connor.

517
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,860
Give Him The Position And
Hopefully The Neuro's

518
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,460
In Proximity
And Can Be Identified.

519
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,630
If He's Not Wearing
A Sign,

520
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,300
How The Hell Are We
Supposed To I.D. Him?

521
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,260
I Don't Know.

522
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,930
If The Shooter's

00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,990
Maybe.

699
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,990
这里需要听译

700
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,250
Giving Your Kids Stuff

701
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,800
 <I>To Make Up For Not Having</I>
 <I>Time To Talk To Them,</I>

702
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,960
 <I>Can Have Serious Consequences.</I>

703
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,230
 <I>Some Turn To Gangs,</I>
 <I>Drugs, Street Life,</I>

704
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,600
 <I>And Some Find Less Destructive</I>
 <I>Ways To Deal With It.</I>

705
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,300
 <I>Eric Raised People</I>
 <I>From The Dead.</I>

706
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,160
 <I>I'm Not Sure If That Falls Into</I>
 <I>The "Serious Consequences"</I>

707
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,230
 <I>Category Or Not.</I>

708
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,400
 <I>I Mean They Were Already Dead.</I>

709
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
 <I>The Problem With Distractions,</I>

710
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,360
 <I>Cookies, Balloons</I>
 <I>Tequila, Brad Pitt.</I>

711
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,260
 <I>They Never</I>
 <I>Really Solve Anything.</I>

712
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,930
 <I>Okay, Maybe Brangelina.</I>

713
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,430
 <I>The Point Is,</I>

714
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,430
 <I>Most Keep You From Having</I>
 <I>To Face Your Problems.</I>

715
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,560
 <I>Avoid Them Long Enough Though</I>

716
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,330
 <I>And You Never End Up</I>
 <I>Living An Honest Life.</I>

717
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,800
 <I>At Some Point You Have</I>
 <I>To Stop Distracting Yourself</I>

718
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,930
 <I>And Deal With What's</I>
 <I>Really Bugging You.</I>

719
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,760
 <I>Like I Said,</I>
 <I>When You're Young,</I>

720
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,630
 <I>You're Given Something Good</I>
 <I>To Distract From Something Bad.</I>

721
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,060
 <I>Then We Grow Up.</I>

722
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,430
 <I>Hard To Say Exactly</I>
 <I>When That Happens,</I>

723
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,430
 <I>But It Happens.</I>

724
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,560
 <I>... And Distractions</I>
 <I>Seem Harder To Come By.</I>

725
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,430
 <I>(Man's Voice:) Hello?</I>

726
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,460
 <I>Hello?</I>

727
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,830
 <I>I Don't Think</I>
 <I>I'm Ready To Do That Now.</I>

728
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,630
 <I>Maybe It's Because Seth Says</I>

729
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,700
 <I>I Have More Time</I>
 <I>Than I Realize.</I>

730
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,130
 <I>Nah.</I>
