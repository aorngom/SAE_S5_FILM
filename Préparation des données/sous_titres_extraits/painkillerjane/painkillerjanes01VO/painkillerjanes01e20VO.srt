00:00:00,702 --> 00:00:02,054
My name is Jane Vasco

2
00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:03,556
I could use you on my team

3
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:07,098
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:11,144
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,848
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:15,015
Something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:17,795
Okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:21,370
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:22,748
doing my job

10
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,915
Stocking up on aspirin

11
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:27,432
because let me tell ya

12
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:29,692
pain's a bitch !

13
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:00,675
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.

14
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,119
You try beating that,
my jolly green friend.

15
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:18,764
How do you keep doing that ?

16
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:20,643
You win.

17
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:22,370
Drinks on me.

18
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:24,580
Don't feel bad.

19
00:01:25,247 --> 00:01:27,705
You giving me a better fight
than I've had in a long time.

20
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:28,821
Thank you.

21
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:29,669
Cheers.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,352
Blood in your eye.

23
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:33,945
... Thanks, I think.

24
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,668
Is there a storm coming
I didn't hear about ?

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,064
No storm.

26
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:01,247
Why are they locking
the place down ?

27
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:07,350
The beast of bolnar walks

28
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,492
from the eighth hour past noon
to the ninth.

29
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:11,321
And pity anything
which crosses its path.

30
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:12,349
Animal or man.

31
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:15,350
My goat was first, four years ago.

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,819
No one believed me,
they laughed at me.

33
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:20,829
They're not laughing, now.

34
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,607
Dogs, horses, men.

35
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:25,513
Sliced to ribbons and
ripped in half by the beast.

36
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,191
You're kidding, right ?

37
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,458
Anybody tried hunting it down ?

38
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,765
Them that tried all died.

39
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:41,560
Best to stay inside when
it is the time of the beast.

40
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:44,632
Come on, another game.
double or nothing.

41
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,647
You bet.

42
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,436
Just a second.

43
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:54,730
Connor.

44
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:58,300
Yeah, be there in half an hour.

45
00:02:59,147 --> 00:02:59,961
Sorry, my friend.

46
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,258
Have to give you a rain check.

47
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:02,175
Rain check ?

48
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:03,079
I have to leave.

49
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:03,861
You can't go.

50
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:05,709
It's the eighth hour.

51
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:06,911
Right.

52
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,068
Connor, the beast kill you.

53
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:12,124
I'll be okay.

54
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,193
Ahhhh !!!!

55
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:30,527
Ahhh!!

56
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,555
Ahhh !!

57
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:32,519
Ahhh!!

58
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:44,751
No !

59
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:46,706
No!!!

60
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:15,377
Transcript : swsub.com
Synchro : bbd1980

61
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:23,012
Connor ?

62
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,402
What happened ?!!

63
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:25,882
Ah!!

64
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:26,834
Connor !!!

65
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,999
What happened !!!

66
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:28,951
Ahh!!!

67
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:30,606
It almost got me !!

68
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:33,356
I don't know, something.
maybe it was the beast.

69
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,730
What beast ?
What beast ?

70
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:35,805
The beast of bolnar.

71
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,315
- It's okay !
- I got to go !!!

72
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,836
It's okay !! You'll be okay !

73
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,803
Couldn't find much on
"the beast of bolnar."

74
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,682
a few references to a town legend.

75
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:47,063
Similar to bigfoot or
the loch ness monster.

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,471
Animal mutilation, killings.

77
00:05:49,836 --> 00:05:50,761
No proof.

78
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:53,302
Hey, last night I was given
the mother of all tetanus shots.

79
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:54,146
That's proof enough for me.

80
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:55,648
I'm not saying I don't believe you.

81
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:56,706
As many horror movies
as I've seen...

82
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:58,502
You've gotta consider
all possibilities.

83
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,325
Including a neuro on the loose.

84
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:03,492
We have any reports of
neuro activity outside north america ?

85
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:05,275
I knew you were gonna ask that. No

86
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:08,771
The only known neuros this side of
the water are housed in this facility.

87
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,047
It's mcbride.

88
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:14,938
Get in here, thank you.

89
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,642
I'll keep checking but the local
databases are pretty pathetic.

90
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:20,679
You want facts, talk to people.

91
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,386
The guys in that bar knew plenty.

92
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,195
- Agent mcbride.
- Captain

93
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:29,630
One of my team was attacked
last night, in town.

94
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:31,916
It has the earmarks of neuro activity.

95
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:33,990
If it happened in town,
it wasn't a neuro.

96
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:35,303
Not one of ours, anyway.

97
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:37,377
- All the inmates are accounted for ?
- Yes, sir

98
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:40,276
Head counts are done on the hour
since the administrative change.

99
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,089
That will be all, thank you.

100
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,846
Alright, connor, put some clothes on,

101
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:49,036
I want you to show me
where this happened.

102
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:02,336
It's mine.

103
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:08,720
I don't know if I hit it,
didn't take it down.

104
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:12,148
Connor,

105
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:15,739
try to find me a blood trail.

106
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:18,460
Right.

107
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:21,406
Ever see him like that ?

108
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:22,929
Not even close.

109
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,794
What is that ?

110
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:42,539
Looks like the claw mark
of some animal.

111
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:44,709
Yeah, king kong's bigger brother.

112
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,783
What the hell could do that ?

113
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:48,402
Mark of the beast it is.

114
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,806
Beware the eighth hour past noon.

115
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,065
Have you ever seen this beast ?

116
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:55,759
No one who sees the beast
lives to tell of it.

117
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:57,526
Where does it come from ?

118
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,632
Have you no eyes, woman?

119
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:01,812
The beast comes right out of hell.

120
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:05,404
But there has got
to be something...

121
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,230
Connor ?

122
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:17,783
Find that blood trail ?

123
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,613
Only my own.

124
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:23,034
Welcome to bolnar.

125
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:25,868
New people in town
tend to create a stir.

126
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:27,528
I'm constable farkas.

127
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,100
Andre mcbride.

128
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:31,868
We're u. S. Federal agents.

129
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:33,963
Really ? That's a first.

130
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,834
What brings u. S. Federal agents
all the way to our little town ?

131
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:39,960
One of our colleagues
was attacked last night.

132
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,865
- Between eight and nine ?
- Yeah

133
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:44,812
The beast of bolnar.

134
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,549
Trust me I know how it sounds.

135
00:08:46,663 --> 00:08:48,100
You have to understand.

136
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:49,587
Two different worlds.

137
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,943
- Each has their own rules...
- What're you saying ?

138
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:53,441
You don't believe
in this beast or not.

139
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:57,239
I'm saying that there are things here
that can't be explained away with...

140
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:58,736
"Rational explanations ?"

141
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:01,536
and the beast of bolnar
is one of those things ?

142
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,949
You already know the answer
to that, don't you?

143
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:08,470
I know something attacked me last night.
Who or what, I don't know.

144
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:11,001
There could be rational explanations
that you are unaware of.

145
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:13,144
Then I'd be more than
happy to hear them.

146
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:17,933
Four years ago, the people
in this town elected me,

147
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:20,659
believing that I could
help protect them.

148
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:22,646
I haven't been able to do that.

149
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:26,834
If there's a chance that
we could help each other

150
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,412
to meet that end,

151
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,575
I'd like to participate

152
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,697
You know the town,
you know the people.

153
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,639
We can use all the help we can get.

154
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:52,367
That's the last one.

155
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,612
The square's been sealed off.

156
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:56,398
The streets have been cleared.

157
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:57,584
Except us.

158
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:00,763
If even a cockroach crosses
my sensor perimeter,

159
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:02,112
we'll know about it

160
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:05,844
You're all keyed into infra red
in case we need a heat signature.

161
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:08,265
Lovely. you're a bloody genius.

162
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:10,671
Five minutes to 8:00. Places

163
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,984
- I got the north end.
- I've got the south.

164
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,032
Farkas, here.

165
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:25,985
West end.

166
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,299
We're about to discover

167
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:47,374
whether or not science
can triumph over mythology.

168
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:49,582
Alright,

169
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:52,064
riley, what do you got ?
Not a peep.

170
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,256
Wish it would come out
and get it over with.

171
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:40,821
Maybe it's not coming out tonight.

172
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,524
The beast comes every night.

173
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:47,109
- It's almost 8:30 and I've got nothing.
- Keep going til 9:00

174
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,117
If he knows we're out here...

175
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:51,328
With all this brilliant science...

176
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,301
We're not talking about a he.
We're talking about an it.

177
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,770
Still nothing.

178
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:57,604
Looks like a wash.

179
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:04,537
Farkas ?

180
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:07,805
Ahhh!!

181
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:08,577
What's going on ?

182
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:09,788
Farkas, I'm on my way.

183
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,675
There's nothing on my screen !

184
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,453
I see something's got him.

185
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,004
what ? I can't see it.

186
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:20,147
Jane, be careful.

187
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:22,582
Hold your positions,
we're on our way.

188
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:51,148
Check vasco.

189
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:58,572
She's alright.

190
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:00,903
Good.

191
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,853
He's not.

192
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,355
No prints, no fibers.

193
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:09,517
Good thing we stayed up all night.

194
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:11,795
À good man's dead and
all we've got is a lot of nothing.

195
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,297
I've checked my sensor array
and transmitters over and over.

196
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,807
Everything's working perfectly.

197
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,344
Except it didn't work.

198
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:18,948
How was the perimeter compromised ?

199
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,268
I can't explain it.

200
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:23,726
Farkas tried to tell us
that this is an it and not a him.

201
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:25,481
Even if this is some kind of beast,

202
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,481
it should give off
body heat on infra red

203
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,253
and anything that moves should
set off a motion detector.

204
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,035
Only it didn't. Why ?

205
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,464
- I haven't got a clue.
- You better get one, riley.

206
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,837
One thing we know for sure,
whatever it is, it kills.

207
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:43,993
Whoa, whoa, check this out ! Boss

208
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:47,463
Does that mean the thing's still here ?

209
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,013
I don't know, I can't tell,
I can't zoom in any further. Jane ?

210
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:51,129
Connor?

211
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:55,535
I have it calibrated
for a uv 15 overlay.

212
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:56,841
It should work.

213
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:13,090
) Alright, you
sonovabitch, where are you ?

214
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:19,115
Connor, anything?

215
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,080
No !

216
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:33,232
Guys !!

217
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:42,507
Footprints.

218
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:44,914
How could something
so tiny be so strong ?

219
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:54,778
Anything yet?

220
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:55,988
Yes and no ?

221
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:57,199
Meaning what ?

222
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,459
I know what didn't
kill constable farkas.

223
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:02,588
It wasn't the wounds on his back
or the beating he took.

224
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:03,862
Then what was it ?

225
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:05,903
Farkas died from a
complete shutdown

226
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:07,781
of his central nervous system.

227
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,063
And it was sudden as though
someone just flipped a switch.

228
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,128
Never seen anything like it.

229
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:16,108
Can you confirm that this is the same
thing that attacked connor last night ?

230
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:17,714
Not with absolute certainty

231
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,359
but the wound patterns are identical.

232
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,322
Boss...

233
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:35,227
Sorry, go.

234
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,370
Got a preliminary
analysis of the footprint.

235
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:41,935
Trace electromagnetic
energy in and out of it.

236
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,163
It wasn't there before
farkas was killed.

237
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:46,190
Okay, it belonged to the killer.

238
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:47,891
What're we dealing with ?

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,428
Based on the depth of the print.

240
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:52,217
À female, five-six and 110 pounds.

241
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,598
The guy I talked to in the tavern

242
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:58,095
said the beast first attacked
four years ago. His goat.

243
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:00,639
So we're not talking
about an ancient legend.

244
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:04,455
We're talking about a legend that started
after nico moved into the neighborhood.

245
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,862
Hell of a coincidence.

246
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:09,815
According to newman, whatever killed
farkas attacked his central nervous system.

247
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:11,359
You're damn lucky to be alive.

248
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:14,107
Riley, I want you to delve
deeper on this footprint analysis.

249
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,849
I'm going to head back to newman.

250
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:17,800
I still think we're missing
something in the inmate population.

251
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:20,399
You two get back to town
and find the guy from the tavern.

252
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:23,413
See what he remembers
about this thing's first kill.

253
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:26,820
Could shed light on
how this began and why.

254
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,369
Let's go.

255
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:29,593
Find this.

256
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:45,825
Sorry, I couldn't come up
with more answers for you.

257
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:46,900
That's alright.

258
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:49,035
It's to be expected in our line or work.

259
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:51,280
Let me ask you something, doctor...

260
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:54,406
These detainees, you have
been here for a while...

261
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:56,556
Have you encountered any
conditions under which

262
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:58,556
the effects of a chip could wear off ?

263
00:16:58,706 --> 00:17:01,114
Encountered it? No. Is it possible?

264
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,814
Like you said...
"In this line of work... "

265
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,623
no way to be sure.

266
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,269
Yes, but look around you.

267
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:09,188
Nico has over a thousand neuros

268
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:11,024
who are not using their powers.

269
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,994
And they aren't all living here
in the section for model detainees.

270
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:19,878
I assume these questions stem
from the incident in bolnar.

271
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,314
Let me say this, agent mcbride.

272
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,854
We know that proximity is required

273
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,126
for neuro power to have any effect.

274
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:29,500
Bolnar is 25 miles away.

275
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:31,405
The beast of bolnar didn't appear

276
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:33,636
until after nico was established here.

277
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,840
I don't believe in coincidence, doctor.

278
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:37,852
You're right, of course.

279
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:40,723
But you might have
to consider the possibility

280
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,777
that you're not dealing with a neuro

281
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:45,235
but something altogether different.

282
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:31,056
Well, if it isn't the dart
champion of bolnar.

283
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:35,368
Lot of work I am doing.

284
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,066
This won't take very long.

285
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:39,590
Horvath, something happened to
me the night I left the bar.

286
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:41,243
I told you not go, you went anyway.

287
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,545
I remember you saying something
about your goat

288
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:47,053
was the first thing attacked
by this "beast."

289
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,020
torn apart.

290
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:49,242
My name's jane.

291
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,296
We know this beast is dangerous

292
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:53,215
and we want to help your
town get rid of it.

293
00:18:53,337 --> 00:18:54,459
Can not get rid of.

294
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:55,425
Why not ?

295
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:56,742
Curse of the gypsies.

296
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:57,907
Gypsies ?

297
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,430
World war II, many gypsies died here.

298
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:03,153
Gypsies curse bolnar, beast come.

299
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:05,243
World war ii was 60 years ago.

300
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,917
How come the beast only
showed up four years ago ?

301
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,060
I'm not a gypsy.

302
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,417
That's loud.

303
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,447
Church, next door is good,
protection from the beast.

304
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,417
You said your goat was
the first thing attacked.

305
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:21,069
Attack goat, not person.

306
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:34,783
No.

307
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:36,660
Boy must learn.

308
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:43,089
I said, boy needs to learn.

309
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:00,524
Thanks for your time, horvath.

310
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:05,150
Nice class of people
you hang around with.

311
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:07,030
He seemed like a good guy
in the tavern.

312
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:09,343
Guess that's why they
call it happy hour.

313
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:10,649
Poor kid.

314
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:12,576
Reminds me of the old man.

315
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,134
Minus the left hook.

316
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,406
- What've you got ?
- Nothing.

317
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:20,610
Horvath doesn't know
how or why it started.

318
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,656
Unless you buy the gypsy story.

319
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:23,909
I'm listening

320
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:26,997
There's some superstition
about a gypsy curse

321
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:29,120
but it doesn't add up.

322
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,320
Actually, farkas thought it did.

323
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:34,055
And something got past riley's sensors.

324
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:37,165
I think I might have a way to track it

325
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:40,468
using part of the uv frequency
that revealed that footprint.

326
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,969
Still, thing should've
had an infrared signature.

327
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:44,942
Should have, but didn't.

328
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:47,152
You sure this will work ?

329
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:48,975
Only one way to find out.

330
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,183
Is that it ?

331
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:01,135
That's it.

332
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:04,054
À mile north of here.
Moving twelve miles an hour.

333
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,006
We move.

334
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:06,884
You're our eyes, kid.

335
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:08,610
Got your eyes

336
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:10,599
and my mojo.

337
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,977
Riley, eta.

338
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,541
Two minutes.

339
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,480
Understood.

340
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:42,364
Remember we hit this thing as one.

341
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:05,099
Hey, guys, do you see what I'm seeing ?

342
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:07,330
Oh, yeah, I see it!

343
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,650
We just don't know what the hell it is.

344
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,066
Hey, guys, do you see what I'm seeing ?

345
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:14,852
Oh, yeah, I see it!

346
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,206
We just don't know what the hell it is.

347
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,165
Jane, you've got point.

348
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,539
Connor, you move on my mark.

349
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:27,076
3...

350
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:29,471
2...

351
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:39,173
Where'd it go ?

352
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,356
I don't know. It was on my screen...

353
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:46,034
Jane ! Behind you !

354
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:53,980
Vasco!!!

355
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:01,828
You okay ?

356
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:02,644
Yeah.

357
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:06,780
Wouldn't have been if whatever
the hell that was didn't show up.

358
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:18,513
Any history of this thing
saving anyone before jane ?

359
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:20,364
Not that I could find.

360
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:24,241
None of the people I spoke to could
rember it happening before, either.

361
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:26,526
Yesterday, it snapped her in half.

362
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:28,385
Doesn't make any sense.

363
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:30,409
Are you wearing perfume ?

364
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:31,375
What?

365
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:33,824
Pheromones.
They've been known to excite predators.

366
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:35,022
Among others.

367
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,489
Other than changing my clothes,

368
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:40,823
I can't think of anything that made
yesterday any different than today.

369
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:46,904
Ahhh !!!

370
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:51,136
What kind of prison has frigging cats ?

371
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,647
It's therapeutic. It calms the inmates.

372
00:23:54,245 --> 00:23:56,857
Whatever happened to
a good smack in the mouth ?

373
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:58,329
You okay?

374
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:01,935
This remind you of anything ?

375
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:04,030
You don't need a cut
man in your corner ?

376
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:04,928
What's your point?

377
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,145
These scratches aren't
nearly as linear and parallel

378
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:09,130
as the ones the beast left in town.

379
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:11,293
Or the ones we saw
on connor and farkas.

380
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,906
What difference does it make ?
The beast isn't a cat.

381
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:15,334
We don't know what it is.

382
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,539
Or isn't.

383
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:20,181
I'd like to go back
and speak to horvath.

384
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,133
Do it.

385
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:25,183
Riley, anything on those footprints ?

386
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,667
I've got a firm handle
on the energy signature.

387
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:34,938
If I can enhance it
I might be able to produce an image.

388
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:36,386
Something like a mug shot.

389
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:37,931
Sooner than later, riley.

390
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:38,965
Of course.

391
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:55,051
You looking for something ?

392
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:56,248
Yes.

393
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,156
I'm just not sure what it is.

394
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,367
I told you everything I know.

395
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:04,313
I know you have. There's just...

396
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:05,633
Something here...

397
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,238
Something I'm missing.

398
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:08,545
I am sorry

399
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:11,442
But I have no time for talking.
I have work to do.

400
00:25:11,564 --> 00:25:13,558
If I could just have one more second...

401
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:16,129
Or not.

402
00:25:17,993 --> 00:25:18,619
Hi.

403
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:21,050
Let me help you with those.

404
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:25,254
Whoa.

405
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:27,471
You've really got some muscles there.

406
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:29,022
I can do twenty push-ups.

407
00:25:29,246 --> 00:25:30,100
Not bad.

408
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:32,181
More than I can do.

409
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,996
Are you ametican ?

410
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:35,016
American.

411
00:25:35,574 --> 00:25:37,025
Sorry. My english is not so good.

412
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:38,944
I think your english is very good.

413
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:40,413
Where'd you learn ?

414
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:41,692
At orphanage.

415
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:44,957
My name is jane, what's your name ?

416
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,978
Kristoff.

417
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:49,525
Kristoff,

418
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:55,254
it doesn't have to be this way.

419
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,736
If you want,

420
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,395
I can help you.

421
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:06,486
I have to go.

422
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:23,888
How's it going ?

423
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,612
Tell you in a second.

424
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:30,762
I'm trying to render an image out
of this electrical signature.

425
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:32,145
Fascinating.

426
00:26:33,236 --> 00:26:36,142
I'm hungry, I'm gonna render
a sandwich. You want anything ?

427
00:26:37,408 --> 00:26:39,530
This'll take a while.
I'll come with you.

428
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:41,435
Doesn't make any sense.

429
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:43,700
How do you "render" a sandwich ?

430
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:22,744
Yes!!!

431
00:28:28,949 --> 00:28:30,745
So much for turning over a new leaf.

432
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:31,860
It did, actually.

433
00:28:31,988 --> 00:28:34,400
Until last night they'd
always been safe inside.

434
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,271
I'd say you could call
this a sign of forced entry.

435
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:40,824
I'll take interviews. They know me.

436
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:43,640
Let's check this body.

437
00:28:54,163 --> 00:28:55,028
Oh, god.

438
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:57,869
Not cut off, either.

439
00:28:58,168 --> 00:28:58,985
Ripped.

440
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,244
It saves your life one day,
overkill the next.

441
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:07,081
Think we're affecting the pattern
simply by looking for the killer ?

442
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,153
Wish I knew.

443
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:11,521
I suppose we should
find the rest of them.

444
00:29:11,643 --> 00:29:13,534
Much as I hate to pass that up.

445
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:15,413
Horvath has a son.

446
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:19,297
Someone needs to check up on him...
Let him know what's happened...

447
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:20,697
See if he's okay.

448
00:29:21,568 --> 00:29:24,125
Alright, I'll find the head myself.

449
00:30:27,122 --> 00:30:28,060
Kristoff ?

450
00:30:35,507 --> 00:30:37,072
Kristoff, it's jane.

451
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:40,801
Kristoff ?

452
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:45,698
Where are you ?

453
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:58,772
Hi.

454
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:15,945
There's something I have to tell you.

455
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:18,244
- I'm not allowed to talk to you.
- Why not ?

456
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:19,579
The mister said.

457
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:20,722
The mister ?

458
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:22,436
Your father?

459
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,726
Told me never to call him that.

460
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:26,577
Why aren't you supposed to talk to me ?

461
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:27,774
I don't know.

462
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:31,236
But if I talk to you, the mister
will send me back to orphanage.

463
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:34,485
Kristoff, listen to me.

464
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:39,113
There's something I have
to tell you, something sad.

465
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:42,841
The mister isn't coming back.

466
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:47,992
Because I was bad ?

467
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,271
No, kristoff,

468
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:51,442
you're not bad,

469
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:52,789
he is bad.

470
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,078
To do this to you.

471
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,233
To hurt you.

472
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,186
Do this to me because I was bad.

473
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,976
- Now he's left me.
- He didn't leave you.

474
00:32:03,785 --> 00:32:04,636
He died.

475
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:08,629
I'm so sorry.

476
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:12,478
I go back to the orphanage, aren't I ?

477
00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:19,455
I'm not going to let
anything bad happen to you.

478
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:21,309
Okay ?

479
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:23,227
No, you'll go, too.

480
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,982
Everybody goes and leaves.

481
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,392
I won't go until I'm sure
you're taken care of.

482
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:34,256
Have you had breakfast today ?

483
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:35,202
No.

484
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,665
I'll see what's in the kitchen.

485
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:41,162
Eggs, bacon and potatoes. That's
what I make the mister every morning.

486
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:42,591
Well, you wash up.

487
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:45,042
Today, I'll make breakfast for you.

488
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:02,442
Just trying to get you guys on the comm.

489
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:05,078
I've got positron emission
tomography of the beast of bolnar.

490
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:06,835
Have a look.

491
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:08,916
Given that you guys don't
believe in monsters,

492
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,060
I ran it against the inmate population.

493
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:13,632
There's a 91 percent
match to one of them.

494
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:15,339
Gabriella flanagan.

495
00:33:26,802 --> 00:33:28,716
I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

496
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,026
The truth !!!

497
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:33,536
I've been telling you the truth.

498
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,399
Tell me.

499
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:42,220
I've never hurt anyone in my whole life.

500
00:33:42,873 --> 00:33:44,955
If you don't count robbing people blind.

501
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:47,236
I'm not saying I shouldn't be here.

502
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,278
I stole and that was
wrong and I'm paying for it.

503
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:53,509
But you said people have been killed.

504
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,407
I'd never do that.

505
00:33:59,722 --> 00:34:01,633
There's a town called bolnar.
You been there ?

506
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:02,409
No.

507
00:34:02,714 --> 00:34:04,426
I never even heard of it.

508
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:05,330
Argh !!

509
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:12,833
You were seen.

510
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:14,533
Can you explain that ?

511
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:16,206
No, it's a mistake.

512
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,517
I've been here for ten years.

513
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:22,653
Lady, you're gonna die here unless
you tell us what we want to know.

514
00:34:23,423 --> 00:34:24,978
I don't know anything.

515
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:26,986
I don't.

516
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:30,596
Why won't you believe me ?

517
00:34:45,415 --> 00:34:48,014
That's the best damn
liar I've ever seen.

518
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:49,735
Or she's telling the truth.

519
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:52,626
You saw that thing on riley's computer.
It looks just like her.

520
00:34:52,748 --> 00:34:54,150
She's a model detainee.

521
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:56,643
Never caused any problems.
How do you explain it ?

522
00:34:57,457 --> 00:35:01,120
Seriously, boss, just gimme
ten more minutes with her. Please.

523
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,907
No.

524
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:06,862
Find dr. Newman and have him
run every test in the book on her.

525
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:09,105
Alright.

526
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:16,503
I don't know what
you're expecting to find.

527
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,612
Even if I did find something,

528
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:22,673
gabriella's "talent" was that
she could see through solid objects.

529
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:24,842
She didn't tear people apart.

530
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:26,105
I understand that.

531
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:28,908
But if her power were somehow
to mutate, change form.

532
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:30,439
That's a big "if."

533
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:31,607
besides,

534
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:35,681
gabriella flanagan is still chipped
and the chip is functioning.

535
00:35:35,804 --> 00:35:36,838
You're positive.

536
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:38,198
Agent mcbride,

537
00:35:38,294 --> 00:35:41,688
right now, this woman
is no more a neuro than you or I.

538
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:44,331
Kristoff

539
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:46,208
Breakfast is ready.

540
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:42,548
- Vasco.
- Jane, it's riley.

541
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:43,741
You still at horvath's ?*

542
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,579
Yeah, I think I found something, too.

543
00:36:45,695 --> 00:36:48,237
Whatever this is, it's somehow
connected to this place.

544
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:49,716
You've gotta get out of there !

545
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:51,896
In a minute
Tell andre those aren't claw marks.

546
00:36:52,007 --> 00:36:53,063
Listen to me !

547
00:36:53,189 --> 00:36:55,019
The beast is on the move.
And it's heading right for you.

548
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:56,046
In broad daylight ?

549
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:59,904
All I know is, it's headed
toward horvath's and it's moving fast.

550
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:04,262
Jane !!!

551
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:05,483
Jane!!

552
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:24,083
Kristoff.

553
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:25,580
Kristoff, wake up.

554
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,245
Kristoff, wake up.

555
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:30,240
Wake up !!

556
00:37:37,718 --> 00:37:39,609
Kristoff, it's alright.

557
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,718
May I see that ?

558
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,123
There's no doubt about it.

559
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:10,849
No doubt about what ?

560
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:12,373
I've found the beast of bolnar.

561
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:14,238
You mean we found her,
gabriella flanagan.

562
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:15,377
Yes, and no.

563
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:18,710
When gabriella flanagan came here
ten years ago, she was pregnant.

564
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:21,200
She had a child who was then
transferred to an orphanage.

565
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:22,085
Kristoff.

566
00:38:22,207 --> 00:38:23,908
I've confirmed that with dna.

567
00:38:24,023 --> 00:38:26,346
I've also confirmed
that the boy is a neuro.

568
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:29,502
Doc, what're you saying ? That
this freakazoid gene can be inherited ?

569
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:30,795
It would appear to be.

570
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,398
This is the first we've seen it.

571
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:34,183
Doesn't make any sense, gabriella's...

572
00:38:34,306 --> 00:38:37,493
Apparently, the inherited ability
can be different from the mother.

573
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,295
I don't buy it. If the kid did
all this, why does it look like her ?

574
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,358
Right now, I can only give you
a best guess. The boy...

575
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:45,039
- His name is kristoff.
- Kristoff's

576
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:48,549
unconscious mind
seems to have created an entity,

577
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:52,441
a creature from the id, so to speak,
that carried all of his rage.

578
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,237
And there was a lot
of that to go around.

579
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,255
Kristoff was adopted at the age of five

580
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:57,827
for little more than slave labor.

581
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:58,956
He's nine, right ?

582
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:01,036
The beast of bolnar
appeared four years ago.

583
00:39:01,158 --> 00:39:04,554
Apparently, kristoff didn't
even know what he was doing.

584
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,736
The entity created itself
during a specific portion

585
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:11,010
of rem sleep which
turned out to occur...

586
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,425
Between 8:00 and 9:00 p. M.

587
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:14,550
When the church bell sounded,
it would wake him up

588
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:16,084
or interrupt the rem sleep.

589
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:17,500
Like it did today.

590
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:19,345
Think about it. You're kristoff,

591
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:20,931
getting worked half to death

592
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:23,631
by a man who offers
zero comfort or warmth.

593
00:39:23,753 --> 00:39:25,092
Deep down you're mad as hell.

594
00:39:25,214 --> 00:39:26,357
I still don't get it.

595
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:28,058
Why does it look like his mother ?

596
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,827
He shouldn't even be able to rember her.

597
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,110
Yes, he does.

598
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:35,790
In his mind, she's the only
protector he's ever known.

599
00:39:38,824 --> 00:39:40,337
Until you helped him.

600
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:43,525
That's why his monster saved you.

601
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:46,828
When the kid went to sleep again,
why didn't the monster show up ?

602
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,889
Most of us only experience rem sleep

603
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:52,361
once or twice per sleep cycle.

604
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:55,049
The deepest level is usually the first.

605
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:57,934
Son of the neuro.
Sounds like a horror movie.

606
00:39:58,025 --> 00:39:59,916
Although, sequels usually suck.
There was...

607
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,399
Riley, shut up.

608
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:03,263
If this is true,

609
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:07,373
then the neuro ability can spread through
genetics, we could be in for one hell of a party.

610
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:10,036
I'm afraid that's a strong possibility.

611
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:12,621
If you'll excuse me,

612
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:14,613
I have a report to write up.

613
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:19,564
I guess the circus is gonna
be in town for a long time.

614
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:21,965
Look at the bright side.
You will never be out of work.*

615
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:25,314
Trust me, boss, if we could take
the last of these freaks off the planet,

616
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,137
I'd he happy to collect
my unemployment check.

617
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,229
Well, if you'll excuse me, there's
a freak that needs some attention.

618
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:13,986
I've spoken with the new director

619
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:17,179
and it's all arranged...

620
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:20,120
You'll never have to
go back to that orphanage.

621
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:21,971
And you'll stay with me ?

622
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,485
Kristoff...

623
00:41:25,474 --> 00:41:26,419
I can't.

624
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,134
I have my work to do.

625
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,640
But I do know someone
that can stay with you.

626
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:37,762
And I've spoken to her.

627
00:41:40,158 --> 00:41:41,774
And she's missed you

628
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:44,343
Every day of your life.

629
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:47,595
And, kristoff,

630
00:41:50,455 --> 00:41:51,949
There's nothing better

631
00:41:52,066 --> 00:41:53,918
Than being with your mother.

632
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,778
Go on, you'll be okay.

633
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,861
Will I see you again ?

634
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,037
Of course.
