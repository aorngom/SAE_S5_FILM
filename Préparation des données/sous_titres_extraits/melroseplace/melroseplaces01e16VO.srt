1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:01,655
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,776
It's not like our engagement
expires at midnight.

3
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:05,974
If it doesn't happen today,
it'll happen another time.

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:09,281
Or not ever?
Would that be better for you?

5
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,303
Wait... I don't want to
be just a one-night stand.

6
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:14,639
You're not.
<i>There's something you need to know.</i>

7
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,807
I slept with Ella last night.

8
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,728
Are you guys, like,
over or, like, over over?

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,813
There's no putting
empty back together again.

10
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:25,232
What are you doing
with my mom's ring?

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,402
You could get in, like,
so much trouble if my father caught you.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,206
Take that back and
then we'll just act like

13
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,615
- none of this ever happened.
- I have a better idea.

14
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:34,533
I'll take an IOU.

15
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,371
Amanda does not come all the way across
the country just to slap us on the wrist.

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,020
She's been asking all kinds of

17
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:42,333
- questions about you.
- She's the president of WPK.

18
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,179
The painting
I'm looking for isn't here.

19
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:46,894
Are you sure you searched
every apartment in the complex?

20
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:49,078
Searched and shot
film in all but one.

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,465
- You called your dad?
- Hell, no.

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,180
You owe me one last job.

23
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,640
I want you to break David's heart.

24
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,552
Whatever you have with him, end it,

25
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:01,437
or I tell the entire
medical community

26
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,701
that I got a house call
from Dr. Lauren Yung.

27
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:19,816
I am literally gonna be
drinking myself into a haze

28
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:23,074
at this party tonight.
Dude, check this out.

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,348
State-of-the-art fog machine.

30
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:30,785
If we are celebrating
my script sale,

31
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,015
it's got to be a couple notches over
watered-down beer

32
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,758
and a bowl of potato chips.

33
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:36,898
I guess I'll have to
pre-hydrate for this one.

34
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:38,423
Spoken like a seasoned vet.

35
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:42,152
You don't mind if I rig some lights
from outside your place, do you?

36
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:44,301
I am sparing no expense
throwing this party.

37
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:50,276
I am all about turning this
place into club Melrose, but, Jonah,

38
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,170
keep in mind,
that paycheck you got...

39
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:55,114
there is a little thing
called taxes and commissions.

40
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:59,395
I always said to myself,
as soon as I make my first stack

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,352
of Hollywood Benjamins, I'm
gonna throw a huge blowout

42
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,567
for all the people
who believed in me.

43
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:05,692
So sweet.

44
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:07,835
Hold on one sec. I'll be right.

45
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,562
Has...

46
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:14,592
- Lauren broken her silence yet?
- She hasn't said a word.

47
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:18,905
I just want some clue why she just
suddenly pulled the plug on us.

48
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,367
Well, who knows? Maybe
tonight she'll loosen up.

49
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,155
Normally, when the alcohol
flows, so do the words.

50
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:34,937
Who's buried in her work now, huh?

51
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:36,131
I'm almost done.

52
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,237
So, in honor of your
first day off in, like, ages,

53
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,532
I'm thinking that we go
shopping on third street,

54
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:45,372
lunch at Joan's and mani-pedis?

55
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,177
- Sounds like perfection.
- Doesn't it?

56
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,678
I could use a day off, too.

57
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,879
This fund-raising crusade
is like pulling teeth.

58
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,883
If anyone can do it, you can.

59
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,451
You've been through so much.

60
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:57,510
And you're still standing.
I'm in awe.

61
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,588
It hasn't exactly been easy.

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,817
Especially watching Jonah
leap into Ella's waiting arms.

63
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,559
But it's getting better.

64
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,644
What about you and David?
You never told me what happened.

65
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:12,916
Come in.

66
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,265
Ladies.

67
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,040
I admit it. I am slightly intrigued

68
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,443
by the idea of wearing
women's lingerie,

69
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:24,572
but since I am new here,
I thought I'd return these.

70
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:27,373
- Found them in the dryer.
- Oh, God.

71
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,502
- How did you know?
- Your name's embroidered on them.

72
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:35,170
- Very classy.
- They were a gift from my grandma.

73
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:37,800
Well, grandma had a great taste.

74
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,932
Yeah, sure. I'll be right in.

75
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:49,257
- I gotta work.
- Wait, what about our girl date?

76
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:51,689
Team Mancini has
no time for social lives.

77
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,107
When you're working with the top

78
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,613
cardiologist in the country,
there's a certain amount

79
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:57,417
of abuse that comes
with the territory.

80
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,655
You're the

81
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,074
resident expert on
all things kid-related.

82
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:05,243
And since your girl day
is a no-go, do you

83
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,062
do you want to come
toy shopping with me?

84
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:14,169
I should probably get back to
working on my fund-raising thing.

85
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,505
Please tell me
the toys aren't for you.

86
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,340
They're for my rug rats.

87
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,436
- Your rug rats?
- They're for the kids

88
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,838
- in the pediatric ward.
- Oh. All right.

89
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,639
Well, I just thought I'd ask.
Knowing me, I'll probably end up

90
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,458
buying toys made from lead.

91
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,436
We can't let that happen.

92
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,236
So, Jane, what dragged you out
of the 818 so bright and early?

93
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:42,698
Typically, when a friend
drops by, you ask how she is,

94
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,626
maybe offer her coffee or tea.

95
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,704
I wasn't sure we fell into
the "friends" category.

96
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,207
Don't be silly. I did agree
to let you live here, Amanda.

97
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,662
Not quite out of
the goodness of your heart.

98
00:04:56,501 --> 00:05:00,174
Along with a security deposit,
you insisted I fire Ella.

99
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,736
And I'm still waiting.

100
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:04,303
I honestly don't understand
what's taking you so long.

101
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:07,389
Ella will suffer for pulling the
red carpet out from under you,

102
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:09,436
but personnel changes take time.

103
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:11,560
You know,

104
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,812
I have a long list
of people who'd move

105
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,230
into this penthouse tomorrow,
if it were to somehow go vacant.

106
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,228
Ella will get what's coming to her.

107
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:27,294
Now, if you'll excuse me, not
everyone can spend their day

108
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,495
playing dress-up with mannequins.

109
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,480
Okay, Jasper, sweetheart.
Yeah, yeah, calm down, okay?

110
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,796
When you talk like that,

111
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,880
you sound like you're
in a Guy Ritchie movie.

112
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:43,383
What? WPK billed you
ten grand last month?

113
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:47,076
That's impossible. I signed you.
Your retainer's for $5,000.

114
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,849
Okay. I will e-mail you
a statement right now.

115
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,568
There has been some sort of mistake.

116
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,420
I will clear this up before you are done
with your breakfast tea and crumpet.

117
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,831
Clear what up?

118
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,147
That was Jasper Barnes.
There seems to be some sort of...

119
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,382
Billin mistake.

120
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:16,418
I just got an earful
from his business manager.

121
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,120
He is accusing the company

122
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,489
of deliberately trying to
pocket an extra five grand.

123
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:24,560
- That would never happen, would it?
- On one of my accounts?

124
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:25,634
No. Never.

125
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,605
Good, 'cause if anyone tries to
steal out of WPK's cookie jar,

126
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:32,952
they'll be walking out with a
pink slip, wearing handcuffs.

127
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,209
What the hell is going on?

128
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:44,546
That was a close call with
Mr. Lewis this morning.

129
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,282
Nearly bled out on
the operating table.

130
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,799
- Is he all right?
- He pulled through like a champ.

131
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:50,986
You want me to start
his post-op blood work?

132
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,951
Actually, I'm going to
need you for something else.

133
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,396
You know, surgeries like this one,

134
00:07:00,773 --> 00:07:02,940
they can really get
the adrenaline flowing.

135
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,383
I can't unwind. But luckily, I think

136
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,635
that's something you
can help me with.

137
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:12,777
I did what you asked.
I broke up with David.

138
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,111
You wouldn't want me to tell
the people in your building

139
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,145
that they sharpool with
a hooker, would you?

140
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:22,483
If you did that, you'd
be exposing yourself.

141
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:25,688
Actually, it's a funny
thing about heart surgeons.

142
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,590
You realize that no one really
cares about your personal life

143
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,616
when you're holding
their heart in your hand.

144
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:34,828
Now, I paid for a transaction
that was never completed.

145
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,359
So, I booked a room
at the Waverly, and...

146
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,629
I have to scrub in
for a triple bypass.

147
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:50,265
I hope it goes well.
I'll let you get to it.

148
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,226
I'll call you when
I get out of the OR.

149
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:54,515
Lauren?

150
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,843
Plan on spending the night.

151
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,233
Dark_Chii, Just-In, peluche0706,
P$!ko^^, simplicity, WoLF971

152
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,332
How much do you love this place?

153
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,397
I used to make my allowance
stretch here for days.

154
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:25,740
You know, it was really sweet of you

155
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:28,811
- to cheer Lauren up the other night.
- Yeah, Dr. Teflon Yung...

156
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:30,552
She had a real moment.

157
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,887
How is she doing?

158
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,244
Are you asking because
you're a concerned neighbor,

159
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,461
or because,
now that she's single, you...?

160
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,148
Lauren? Oh, come on.

161
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:41,614
Look, the girl's impressive...
she's smart, she's beautiful...

162
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:44,118
but dating a coworker
who's also your neighbor

163
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:46,316
is doomed on so many levels.

164
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:49,945
See, this would be fun for battle...

165
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,827
like, gurney to gurney... as
long as nobody pops an I.V.

166
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:56,081
Maybe something like this...

167
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,787
To cuddle in a dark hospital room?

168
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,040
- It's goofy, but it's cute.
- Yeah, maybe we should ask an expert.

169
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:06,545
Cual es tu, uh, juguete favorito?

170
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:09,339
- Este.
- Si'?

171
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,382
Si'.

172
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:15,053
All right. Take one of
each. Quiero todo, si?

173
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,806
- Bueno, senor. Gracias.
- Oye, mi amigo.

174
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,310
- Gracias.
- De nada.

175
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,750
So, how many of Sydney's
paintings did you find?

176
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,613
Jane had a bunch in
that storage unit.

177
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:30,793
Tested all the canvases. None
were hiding a Dutch masterpiece.

178
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:34,990
Well, someone in this building
knows where that painting is.

179
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,910
Yeah, let's put the bar over here.

180
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,155
Okay, sure.
What do we have for alcohol?

181
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,548
- We got whiskey, tequila...
- You know what?

182
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,835
I'll just have to find another
tactic to get them talking.

183
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,179
Gorgeous, yes. Right there.

184
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,848
Gorgeous. That's right.

185
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,637
Give me more eyes. Eyes here.
Beautiful. Okay, shoulder.

186
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,971
That's right. Gorgeous.

187
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,610
Closer!

188
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:15,629
Cupcake.

189
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,680
How are you?

190
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:20,187
I'm on the clock for W, not WPK.

191
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:24,164
- And, uh, this is a closed set.
- Oh. Will you look at that?

192
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,540
You are actually letting the models

193
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,804
keep their clothes on for once.
How sweet.

194
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:30,045
Please don't tell me you
traipsed all the way downtown

195
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,756
to give me another
lecture on selling out.

196
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:36,510
I just wanted to make sure
that you were properly paid

197
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,199
for the Anton V project. That's all.

198
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:42,554
If you're wondering if
the check cleared, the answer is yes.

199
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:45,021
And now, if you'll excuse me.

200
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:47,194
Here. Let's go with the 35.

201
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:51,127
You must have quite the agent,

202
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:53,245
to have negotiated that deal,

203
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,615
I mean, 200 grand for a day's work?

204
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,734
Even Annie Leibovitz
would be jealous.

205
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,785
$200,000? Are you kidding me?

206
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:04,631
Try doing some math
and dividing by ten.

207
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,166
Your check was for $20,000?

208
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:11,978
Well, your name was on it.

209
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:14,577
You're my account rep.
You should know.

210
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,512
We're all set for my
friend's party tonight, right?

211
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,093
Sushi trays, kobe beef sliders,

212
00:11:22,218 --> 00:11:24,313
- and French fry bar?
- I'm all over it.

213
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:27,764
- Okay. Great.
- I love watching you in action.

214
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,266
Morgan, what are you doing here?

215
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:32,460
You didn't call.
Which kind of shocked me,

216
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:35,117
considering I'm pretty sure
you had a good time the other night.

217
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,006
I did. I did, but...

218
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,156
Hey, I need two
drinks at table eight.

219
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:41,992
- You got it.
- I brought you something.

220
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,383
That's a $5,000 watch,
Morgan. Where'd you get that?

221
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:48,915
Stole it from my dad.

222
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,445
You're not the only one who
gets a rush from stealing.

223
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,225
When I saw you take my mom's ring,
I knew we were made for each other.

224
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,084
Morgan, come here.

225
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:02,601
Listen, that ring was
the end for me, all right?

226
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:04,825
That's the last time I'm
ever gonna rip anybody off.

227
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,261
Why am I having a hard
time believing that?

228
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,106
Okay, look.

229
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,023
I just got out of a relationship.

230
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,275
I'm so sorry if I lead you on.

231
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,013
I just... I can't do this with you.

232
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,405
You're not saying you
don't want to see me again?

233
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,208
Because my dad is
sitting right there.

234
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,203
And I think you know he is not the
kind of guy you want to mess with.

235
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,705
What do you think you're doing?

236
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:32,167
Father-daughter lunch.
He loves to hit the hot spots.

237
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,732
My dad and I are super close.

238
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:38,632
And he'd love nothing more
than for me to open up to him,

239
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,095
tell him all about you.

240
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:47,425
So... I'll see you soon. Okay?

241
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,260
Sounds great, man.

242
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,122
Okay, this one... this
is my favorite one so far.

243
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,019
- Great. Here's another one.
- Ella. Come here.

244
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:14,845
I have yet to master
the art of solo drinking.

245
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,948
Help me sample some of
these delicious cocktails.

246
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,950
Oh, it is like you
looked inside my brain

247
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:20,901
and saw a flashing Martini glass.

248
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:25,156
Either you're trying to
set a speed drinking record,

249
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:26,958
or you had one bad
day at the office.

250
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,215
I was going to
text you on my way home,

251
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,220
but I gave up texting and driving.

252
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,531
- Thank you.
- May I...?

253
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:35,066
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

254
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,569
Jonah, something seriously
shady is going on at work.

255
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,638
I think I'm being set up.

256
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,908
It sounds like my conspiracy theories
are finally catching up with you.

257
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,444
Unfortunately, I think
it's beyond a theory.

258
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:49,080
There are financial discrepancies
all over my client list.

259
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:53,209
It's like a gigantic red arrow
is pointing at my pockets.

260
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,488
- How are you?
- Sweetie.

261
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,890
Oh, God,
I looked like you a minute ago...

262
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,958
Then I discovered vodka
makes a lot of things better.

263
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:06,664
Thank you, but I'm so
not in a party mood right now.

264
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:09,166
I think I just had the worst
day at the hospital ever.

265
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,550
Mancini is making my life hell.

266
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:14,038
Well, it's a good thing
you're done for the day.

267
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:17,074
There's actually one more
thing I'm supposed to do.

268
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,477
Whatever it is, it can wait.

269
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:21,178
No work talk. No boy talk.

270
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:23,014
Tonight, all we do is drink, dance,

271
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,605
and deal with our collective
nightmares in the morning.

272
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:27,685
- I feel better already.
- See?

273
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,787
I'm going to go get changed,

274
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,222
and come right back out.

275
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:34,206
You better. Director's orders.
Don't make me get my megaphone.

276
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,506
Okay, we've got ankimo,
kurodai, yellowtail...

277
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,258
all line-caught this morning.
You want first crack?

278
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:58,647
I'm heading over to the Waverly.
I'll expect you there in an hour.

279
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:02,845
And, Lauren? You know that cute little
dress you had on the other night?

280
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,259
Wear that.

281
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:09,860
I don't know what any of this is,
but I'm practically drooling.

282
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:12,160
It's pupusas. Nothing scary inside.

283
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,831
I taught down here for two years.

284
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:17,234
- How do I not know about this place?
- Well, between work and traffic,

285
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,626
it's easy to get caught up in your
own world. Especially if you're

286
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,096
sharing the same bed with
somebody for five years.

287
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:28,113
Now, I don't want to pry, but...

288
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,716
What happened between you guys?

289
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,392
I mean, it must've taken a seismic shift
for it to flame out after five years.

290
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:38,683
Jonah was so focused on the future,
and I just

291
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:41,481
wasn't in a place where I was ready
to commit for the rest of my life.

292
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,413
And in the end, I think that we both
just wanted different things out of life.

293
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:48,436
He likes to make movies
and play pretend,

294
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:50,148
and I'm all about the real world.

295
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:56,246
In the game that is called life...

296
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:58,915
Jonah has rolled
the dice and moved on.

297
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:01,543
What about you?

298
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,005
Are you ready to get back
out there and take your turn?

299
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,174
I guess that all depends
on what I'm playing for.

300
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,442
Make every drink a triple, and believe
me, I'll make it worth your while.

301
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,601
No problem.

302
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:43,904
Hey, you made it, with drew.

303
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,424
- Where are you guys coming from?
- Drew took me to the most amazing

304
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,962
- Salvadorian place downtown.
- She was fearless.

305
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,845
She wanted to try
everything on the menu.

306
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,100
I knew you were having a party, but I didn't
know it was gonna be a major blowout.

307
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,472
Hey, you know, once I got
paid for "Living in Reverse",

308
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:04,365
I just thought, you know something?
Why not give back a little?

309
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,602
Okay, people,
shots are not optional.

310
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,030
- What is this, plutonium?
- Close. It's called a ghostbuster.

311
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:23,750
How painfully cute!
Who'd you knock up?

312
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:27,431
No one. I actually kidnapped
Riley today to go toy shopping

313
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:29,403
for the pediatric ward.

314
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:32,008
Why not give back a little, right?

315
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:54,864
I know why you broke up with me.

316
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:59,088
- This is not...
- Just say it: I grew up in a trailer;

317
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:03,081
I didn't go to a fancy college,
I have a rap sheet, not a resume.

318
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,595
- I'm not good enough for you.
- That's not true.

319
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:09,379
No, that not true. Non-of
this is matter to me.

320
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,090
You don't have to lie to me,
Lor. What?

321
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,466
If it's not who I am,

322
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,802
then tell me what I
did, and I'll let it go.

323
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:18,310
You didn't do anything.
Okay? It's just...

324
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:25,089
- You don't really know who I am.
- What?

325
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:29,218
- I'm not good enough for you.
- What are you talking about? Lauren...

326
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:36,114
- I can't talk about this anymore.
- What?!

327
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,285
- Where are you going? Lauren!
- David, I'm sorry.

328
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:04,768
Michael! Something tells me

329
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,270
you didn't read about this
little bash on Twitter.

330
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,547
What brings you back
to Melrose place?

331
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:14,917
I was just in the area.
I thought I'd check in on you,

332
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,956
see if those prescriptions I wrote
you were, making a difference.

333
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,049
Oh, I'm feeling good as new.

334
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:23,386
Amanda, I thought you'd be the one
phoning in the noise complaints,

335
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:24,829
not causing them.

336
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,006
Look at you.

337
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,298
- Wow, time has been good to you.
- You, too.

338
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,305
So, I... read about that... What
was it? A heart valve you invented?

339
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,742
Maybe our second
divorce was a mistake.

340
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,228
Wow, that almost sounded
like a compliment.

341
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,214
Jane, before you pull
the plug on this party,

342
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,383
you have to try at least one mojito,

343
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:55,891
'cause I'm sure you guys have
a lot of catching up to do.

344
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,158
So, who'd have thought, all those
years ago, lying around the pool,

345
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,966
that you'd end up
owning this building?

346
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:07,914
It does seem to have a strange
gravitation pool, doesn't it?

347
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:19,801
Ella. Should I have your assistant

348
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,259
scrape you off the patio
tile tomorrow morning?

349
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:26,323
I was just getting
in the spirit of things,

350
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:28,393
but I can assure you
that all of my clients

351
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,560
- have been fed and watered.
- Ella, we're off the clock.

352
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:35,723
Now I know that you and Sydney

353
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:38,319
used to have a drink or two
when she had the penthouse.

354
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,727
We should do the same.

355
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:42,563
I'm sure you could handle
your liquor better than Sydney could.

356
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,598
She had a tendency to
not to stop drinking

357
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:48,051
- until she was unconscious.
- Her coping mechanisms

358
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:49,789
weren't always doctor recommended,

359
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,000
but at least she had an
outlet through her painting.

360
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:56,510
Her own art? It was a
step above finger painting.

361
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,546
I rather liked it.

362
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:01,816
She actually was working on a piece
for me around the time that she died.

363
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,803
And I've been looking
for it everywhere.

364
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,014
Do you know if she had
any of her work in storage?

365
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,416
I wouldn't know. Syd knew
the only artists I cared about

366
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:13,594
were Manolo, Prada and Louboutin.
If you want to know about her art,

367
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,887
you're going to have to ask David.

368
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,078
What about the Jasper Barnes
account? Issue resolved?

369
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:24,774
Not yet.

370
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:31,539
Look, Amanda, something
is happening at work

371
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,125
that I think you should know about.

372
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,503
I think somebody's been
embezzling money from WPK.

373
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:41,257
- You have any proof?
- I'm working on it.

374
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:45,720
But I did find out that not
only was Jasper overbilled,

375
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,529
but Jo Reynolds got paid $20,000

376
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:51,444
when the outgoing
withdrawal was for $200,000.

377
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:55,229
Anyone you suspect?

378
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,733
I have my theories, but...

379
00:21:59,593 --> 00:22:01,615
No, nothing concrete yet.

380
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,697
So someone is getting
rich off of my company.

381
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:07,730
Thanks for filling me in.

382
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:13,873
This one's going in.

383
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:21,673
I swear,
my cups are wider than yours.

384
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,122
What happened to being
almost professional at this?

385
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:26,859
Okay, everyone has their off days.

386
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:29,138
Especially after they've
drunk a few test tubes.

387
00:22:29,578 --> 00:22:31,933
- Anybody got a winner?
- Hey, bro. No, I'm, uh...

388
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:34,008
Think I'm going to grab a beer

389
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,924
- and retire undefeated.
- What?!

390
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:40,347
Just gonna call it quits as soon
as some real competition shows up?

391
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:42,616
We need some balls over here.

392
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:46,745
- Anyone got any balls?
- Set 'em up, Hollywood.

393
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,372
You're gonna lose.

394
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:39,540
He's still got it. Excuse me.

395
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,586
He's still got it!

396
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:43,476
I still got it. Okay.

397
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:45,673
Why am I suddenly thrilled
that I didn't meet you

398
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,514
till after your crazy college years?

399
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,978
Come on, Lauren, open up.

400
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,011
I know you're in there.

401
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:18,903
You can't avoid me all night.

402
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:38,422
Sorry I'm late.

403
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,022
I didn't know that
you were going to be here.

404
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,439
I told you at lunch
I'd see you soon.

405
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:47,708
Now, let's go get me a cocktail.

406
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,923
I got a better idea.
Let's go up to my place.

407
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,553
This ridiculously hot chick just
asked me for a bottle opener.

408
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,624
You gotta get me one.
I think she's into me.

409
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:05,336
Nice! I think I...
I have a spare in my...

410
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,131
In her apartment.

411
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:54,302
There's my Milla the killa.
Where'd you disappear to?

412
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:57,805
I went to find a bottle opener.

413
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,287
I found drew and Riley
making out instead.

414
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:03,178
Wow! That must have been rough,

415
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,541
because you look like
you just got hit by a bus.

416
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:08,691
What? No.

417
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:12,077
I mean, I didn't expect
her to go join a convent,

418
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:14,113
and he doesn't appear
to be a serial killer.

419
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,443
The only weird thing is how quickly
the guy went into attack mode.

420
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:22,330
- At my party, in my old apartment.
- You're not exactly one to talk, Jonah.

421
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,876
I mean, who knocked on my door the night
that you and Riley called it quits?

422
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,365
Jo Reynolds is here?
Did somebody complain

423
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,885
this party wasn't bossy
and overbearing enough?

424
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:39,180
It's beautiful. Wish I'd been there with
you when you ripped it off.

425
00:26:39,594 --> 00:26:42,266
I got that from a gallery,
Morgan. I'm a collector.

426
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:46,402
Most of the boys I know
only collect video games.

427
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,719
I bought you
in here so we could talk.

428
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:57,358
- We can talk, too.
- Okay... all right...

429
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,492
So, the idea that you and I can be

430
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,702
Mr. And Mrs. Smith... I
mean, you gotta let that go.

431
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,247
All right?
Look, Morgan, you're gorgeous,

432
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,497
you're smart, you don't
need to blackmail someone

433
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:09,336
- into being in a relationship.
- But it is so much more fun this way.

434
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,603
But... okay...

435
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:14,090
I'm not going to be happy
with some boring guy.

436
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,987
I'm that boring guy now.

437
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:18,344
Morgan, I've made too may mistakes

438
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:20,598
in my life, and I'm done.
I'm done repeating them.

439
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:25,684
David, you'll never be done.
You'll miss the danger too much.

440
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:26,952
The thrill.

441
00:27:27,668 --> 00:27:30,090
Guys like you weren't
born to live by the rules.

442
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,693
I'm sorry. Don't let me interrupt.

443
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,746
No, not at all.
Morgan was just leaving.

444
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,616
Bye. For now.

445
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:47,997
Girls do love the bad boys.

446
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,929
Steal any paintings lately?

447
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,079
I don't know what
you're talking about.

448
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:55,381
I own a restaurant.

449
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:59,510
And the money you used to pay for it
wasn't exactly hard-earned, was it?

450
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:04,073
And the rumor has it... that you stole
the paintings that Sydney sold overseas.

451
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:07,435
But that's your business.
I'm just looking for the painting

452
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,814
- she took from me. Any idea where it is?
- I have no idea.

453
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,233
What about the art she
did herself? Her paintings.

454
00:28:15,032 --> 00:28:17,136
I have the one that you saw,

455
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:19,703
and she gave one to Auggie
right before she died.

456
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,907
Not worth much, aside
from sentimental value.

457
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:24,702
Auggie...? He's the chef
that used to live here.

458
00:28:26,215 --> 00:28:29,915
- He and Syd had a special bond.
- I'm sure they did.

459
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:40,826
So, Jane, what do you
say... we turn back the clock

460
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:42,907
and have a little fun tonight?

461
00:28:46,044 --> 00:28:49,886
After everything we've been through,
I will never be that desperate.

462
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,609
Oh, my God. I feel
like I'm in a time warp.

463
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,844
- Look who it is!
- My God! Jo?

464
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:01,941
Oh, my goodness.
It's been forever.

465
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,018
Did Amanda invite you or what...?

466
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,411
Something like that.

467
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,578
So, has anyone seen
the queen of publicity?

468
00:29:09,703 --> 00:29:13,181
Isn't this nice? A little
mini-reunion in the courtyard.

469
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:16,241
Let's do it again in ten years,
shall we?

470
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:21,433
- Amanda, do you have a moment?
- Does this mean you're here for more

471
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:23,926
than hot boys in skinny jeans?

472
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:27,598
Ella Simms told me about
the WPK payout in my name,

473
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:31,175
and I had visions of
vintage Amanda Woodward

474
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,437
embezzling money
from D&D advertising.

475
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,786
I don't know what you're
trying to accuse me of.

476
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:40,986
Especially since all the jobs that
made your career came from D&D and WPK.

477
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,364
But I guess that
generosity is lost on you.

478
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:46,659
You don't have a generous bone in
your body.

479
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:49,362
But that's about to change.

480
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,397
I mean,
unless you want everyone to know

481
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:53,666
that you've probably bled
your own company dry by now.

482
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,701
Make the check out to
global hunger project.

483
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,846
Diagnosis, awkward.

484
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:11,252
No, it wasn't. It's fine.

485
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,144
Hey, that's life.

486
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:17,456
You're totally cool
with me and Riley?

487
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:18,607
I'm with Ella.

488
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:21,936
Man...
that is so great to hear, man.

489
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:24,297
I guess I can cancel
my trip to home depot

490
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,582
to get that dead bolt
for Riley's front door.

491
00:30:30,516 --> 00:30:32,061
What's that supposed to mean?

492
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,809
Just some friendly advice:
the unannounced drop-in

493
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,128
is a little freakier
when you don't knock.

494
00:30:39,945 --> 00:30:41,803
You might want to call next time.

495
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:46,594
Dr. McChuckles,

496
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,929
my name is on that lease, all right?

497
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:52,958
And I lived there for a long
time, so I don't really need you

498
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,797
telling me what I can
and might not want to do.

499
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:58,898
You don't get to do,

500
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,193
whatever you want with Riley
anymore. She's not your girlfriend.

501
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:05,446
Okay, so you just
move into this building,

502
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,740
and you start hitting on
every girl who lives here.

503
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,311
Lauren's not around,
so you zone in on Riley?

504
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,677
That's a little desperate, isn't it?

505
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:14,947
- Who's desperate?
- I think you are.

506
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:18,507
Desperate's throwing a party like this
to show everybody how awesome you are!

507
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,012
Yo, guys, stop it!

508
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:34,975
Jonah, stop it.

509
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:57,289
- You need to stop calling me.
- You never showed up at the hotel.

510
00:31:58,405 --> 00:31:59,591
I lost track of time.

511
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:02,920
I gotta say, Lauren, standing
here outside your door,

512
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,964
I'm feeling a little neglected here.

513
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,823
I mean, you okay with me
chattin' up your friends...

514
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,370
Tellin' 'em all about
your little part-time job?

515
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:22,731
Leave me alone.

516
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,526
What's the big deal?

517
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,088
You're a pro.
You do this stuff all the time.

518
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:32,324
Boy, if I was a less secure
man, I might be offended.

519
00:32:37,526 --> 00:32:40,124
The compromises I made
in my personal life...

520
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:43,515
they were all about protecting
the one thing that matters to me.

521
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:45,879
And that's my medical career.

522
00:32:46,688 --> 00:32:50,309
Don't worry, because
this is going to be fantastic

523
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:51,885
for your medical career.

524
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,263
Hey, don't you dare walk away

525
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,015
- from me, Lauren.
- Watch me.

526
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,498
Hey, you guys. Hey.

527
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:04,773
Lauren, are you okay?

528
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:07,817
There's something
I need to tell you.

529
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:15,784
I've been really scattered
and really overwhelmed

530
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,204
for the last few months, and I've been
telling you all that it's because of work

531
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,624
but it was...

532
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:24,376
a lot more than that.

533
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,706
Lauren, sweetheart...

534
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:29,590
Do you think maybe you've had
a little bit too much to drink?

535
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:35,804
This isn't a drunk confessional
I'm going to forget in the morning.

536
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:43,422
I lied to you... all of you...

537
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,736
And I know I hurt you.

538
00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:52,988
Six months ago, I fell
behind in my tuition payments.

539
00:33:53,737 --> 00:33:55,794
And, I had to come up with
money

540
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:57,943
fast... or my dream

541
00:33:58,068 --> 00:34:00,078
of being a doctor
was going to be over.

542
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,637
So...

543
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:06,627
I did something that I'm going to have
to live with for the rest of my life.

544
00:34:13,945 --> 00:34:15,383
I had sex for money.

545
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:20,697
I was a prostitute.

546
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,578
Dream or reality?

547
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:04,732
I heard Dr. Lauren Yung
declare herself a prostitute.

548
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:09,400
It's not a dream, it's a nightmare.

549
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:12,983
I mean, she's the last
person I ever thought

550
00:35:13,108 --> 00:35:15,006
would be turning tricks
in her spare time.

551
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:17,910
Did you have any idea?

552
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:20,576
I had my suspicions.

553
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:21,776
Really?

554
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:25,830
You smell like one part chlorine,

555
00:35:25,955 --> 00:35:27,675
two parts Tequila.

556
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,045
I really tackled drew
into the pool, didn't I?

557
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,966
- You did.
- Oh, well, that's bad.

558
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,428
Normally I find a brawl between
two red-blooded boys kinda hot,

559
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,847
but when it's over your ex-fiancée,

560
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:43,626
not so much.

561
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:47,177
I'm sorry.

562
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:49,688
I acted like a total ass.

563
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,360
I thought we were way past this.

564
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,336
We are.

565
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,990
- Totally.
- Good.

566
00:36:00,507 --> 00:36:01,533
You better be.

567
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:05,113
Sorry.

568
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:15,383
I gotta grab my alcohol
poisoning by the horns.

569
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:18,582
I'm being summoned
to Amanda's office.

570
00:36:18,707 --> 00:36:20,803
- On Saturday morning.
- What?

571
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,953
Do you think
she knows you're onto her?

572
00:36:23,078 --> 00:36:26,054
Well, I'm still alive...
so, no, not yet.

573
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,279
About last night. I...

574
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,670
Obviously didn't want
to tell you like that.

575
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:57,447
When I heard you blaming yourself

576
00:36:57,572 --> 00:36:59,800
for what happened to us, I...
I couldn't take it anymore.

577
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,705
Thanks. That means a lot.

578
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:08,642
About the way you took
things slow with me,

579
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,173
the late shifts, mysterious texts,

580
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:14,878
that guy Rick.

581
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:20,153
How many times did you
look me in the eye and lie?

582
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:24,991
And the scary thing...

583
00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:27,786
is how good you were.

584
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,584
That tore me up, David.

585
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,963
I tried not to get
involved with you, okay?

586
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:40,016
But I... I couldn't help myself.

587
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,011
I've never felt like
this about anyone before.

588
00:37:42,424 --> 00:37:44,553
And I'm suddenly
supposed to believe you?

589
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:49,933
I get it.

590
00:37:53,113 --> 00:37:56,064
Just know that I didn't want
to break up with you, David,

591
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,453
and I've never said
this to anyone before...

592
00:38:02,308 --> 00:38:03,674
But I love you.

593
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:26,911
Remember, I know what it feels like

594
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:29,167
to have your whole world
drop out from under you.

595
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:30,708
You're my best friend.

596
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,772
I'll always be here.
Call me back, okay?

597
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:59,176
Boy, I don't know who the jerk was
who threw this party last night,

598
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:01,579
but he sure let things
get out of hand, huh?

599
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:05,467
What were you thinking, coming
into my apartment like that?

600
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:08,553
And then playing
schoolyard bully with drew?

601
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:12,488
I'm sorry.

602
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:15,519
Last night was not
my shining moment.

603
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:20,315
You and Ella have been nesting
like lovebirds in this courtyard

604
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,632
ever since the night we
called off our wedding.

605
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,207
Do you think that's
been easy for me?

606
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:44,271
It's 8:00 a.m. On a Saturday
and you are in the office.

607
00:40:45,807 --> 00:40:48,111
I guess that's what
it takes to be on top.

608
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:50,982
It's too late to charm your
way out of this one, Ella.

609
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:54,599
- I know you're the embezzler.
- What?

610
00:40:54,724 --> 00:40:56,244
After what you told me last night,

611
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,362
I audited your accounts,
and it appears

612
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:00,624
that you've stolen hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

613
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:05,087
Do you really think that
you can get away with this?

614
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:08,465
I overheard you talking
to Jo. You set me up.

615
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,551
How much did you drink last
night? God knows what you heard.

616
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:15,847
And I looked up to you.

617
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:18,582
You weren't just my boss,
you were the prototype

618
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:20,477
of everything I wanted in my career.

619
00:41:22,674 --> 00:41:26,415
- But you're nothing but a thief.
- Who's the thief?

620
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:31,571
With all the money
missing from WPK's coffers,

621
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,743
there's a lot of jail time at stake.

622
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:37,587
I have never stolen
anything before in my life.

623
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:39,621
Then I'll consider this
your first offense...

624
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,939
So you better work real
hard to make amends.

625
00:41:42,354 --> 00:41:43,974
Because you, my dear,

626
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,878
do not have the curves to
pull off a prison jumpsuit.
