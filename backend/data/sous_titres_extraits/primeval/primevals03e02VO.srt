1
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,000
We'll get done.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,040
No chance.

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,000
This is brilliant.

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,680
I gotta check this.
It's wicked for boarding.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,760
Come on then.

6
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,960
Matt?

7
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,280
I've been trying to trace
the origins of the Qilin.

8
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,720
Also known as the Chinese Unicorn.
Exactly.

9
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,400
The earliest reference was
in the 5th Century book Zuo Zhuan.

10
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,640
I made a rough calculation
and put it into the matrix.

11
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,360
I love this thing!

12
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,920
Connor,

13
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,440
if you touch that, you could change
the entire destiny of the universe.

14
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,400
I'm not gonna touch it.
I'm just gonna... Good man.

15
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Whoa! Please tell me
this all means something.

16
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,760
This is a 3D model
representing all known anomalies

17
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,000
throughout history.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,160
All cultures have
their own mythical beasts

19
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,360
like...the Loch Ness monster.

20
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,440
My guess is where there's a myth
we'll find an anomaly.

21
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,160
All we have to do
is date these myths accurately.

22
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,920
Like a road map of time.

23
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,840
Then we can start
to predict where and when

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,480
new anomalies might start to open.

25
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,840
Call me stupid, but couldn't we have
done all this on a computer?

26
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,200
This way it's more tangible.

27
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,640
It makes him feel more like God.
You know, the creation thing.

28
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,280
Connor, you might be right.

29
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,040
But unless I'm very much mistaken

30
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,480
I think we may have made
our first prediction.

31
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,520
All right. Listen up. We've
analysed the most recent anomalies

32
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,600
and put them into the model.

33
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,560
The prediction is specific
and local, but there's a problem.

34
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,720
It could happen tomorrow
or many years from now.

35
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,560
Check it out,
and take Sid and Nancy with you.

36
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,120
I'll go, too.
No, I need you here.

37
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,080
I should handle this. No, we'll go.
Anything happens, call me.

38
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,440
Sarah.
Help!

39
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,040
I've been taken hostage
by an obsessive scientist.

40
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,720
Welcome to our world.

41
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,480
This is the place.

42
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,160
So this is where Cutter predicts
the anomaly will open.

43
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,640
We'd better check it out.

44
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,720
Then what?

45
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,120
We sit twiddling our thumbs
till an anomaly appears?

46
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,200
Something like that

47
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,640
Hold me back! I don't think
I can take the excitement.

48
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,840
Seems quiet enough.

49
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,960
Connor!

50
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,200
Window was open. Nobody in.

51
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
What happened here?

52
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,360
This place must be worth millions.

53
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,400
Why's it just been left?

54
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,880
The smell maybe. It stinks in here.

55
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,760
Could be the sewers
or maybe some damp.

56
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,240
It's more like
they've been keeping animals.

57
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,560
What kind of animals? Skunks? Hey.

58
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,960
Maybe the owners are abroad.
We'll keep watch for a while,

59
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,480
but we can't stay indefinitely
just to satisfy Cutter's whims.

60
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,880
You think he's wrong?
I think he's crazy,

61
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,960
but not necessarily wrong.

62
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,680
Seems like he's getting
beneath your skin.

63
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,480
Abby.

64
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,800
Have you ever been attracted to
somebody that you don't even like?

65
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,000
I fall for the wrong men
all the time.

66
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,960
One thing I do know

67
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,960
if you're interested, don't wait
for the man to make the first move

68
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,920
cos you could die of old age
before anything happens.

69
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,800
You going to take your own advice?
Thinking about it.

70
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,880
Hello?

71
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll call you back.

72
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,280
Abby?

73
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,920
Abby?

74
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,480
Gotcha!

75
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,480
That was childish.

76
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,080
Were you scared?
No.

77
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,400
A little bit.

78
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,680
I thought you were in trouble.
Yeah.

79
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,360
You came to rescue me.

80
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,040
Thank you.

81
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,920
You know, I like this place.

82
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,080
It's fun.

83
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,040
Yeah.

84
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,500
I'm sorry.

85
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,620
The Qilin.

86
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,980
A magical creature
from 5th Century China.

87
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,340
Amazing what people used to believe,
isn't it?

88
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,660
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Thank you.

89
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,620
Thanks.

90
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,860
That was eventful!

91
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,860
It's a nice place, isn't it? Care
to explain what you're doing here?

92
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,100
Just visiting. The way I see it
you're either burglars

93
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100
or trespassers.

94
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Do we look like burglars to you?

95
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm pretty sure I've seen
laughing boy on a wanted poster.

96
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,420
Are you talking about me?
Officer?

97
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Detective Constable Quinn. You are?

98
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,780
We're property developers.

99
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,100
You're lying. I should arrest you,

100
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,460
but to be quite frank
I can't be bothered.

101
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,060
You people aren't worth
the paperwork. Now go.

102
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,060
What do you mean "you people"?

103
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,020
Murder tourists.

104
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,180
You make me sick. Now get out.

105
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,380
If I see you here again,
your feet won't touch the ground.

106
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,220
Come on.

107
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,780
Can I just say that I think
the police do a fantastic job?

108
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,980
The occasional lapse into cliche

109
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,860
is understandable
in the circumstances.

110
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,660
Connor.

111
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,540
Something strange
is going on in there.

112
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,900
Stay here. If anything out
of the ordinary happens, call us.

113
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,540
Where are you going?
To get some answers.

114
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,060
Connor, you're coming with me.

115
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,500
Keep your head down
and don't look anyone in the face.

116
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,300
Cutter's the only one
likely to recognise you,

117
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,620
but if something does go wrong
you know what to do.

118
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,580
Go.

119
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,300
I'll call Maintenance.
That's Sector 8, isn't it?

120
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,500
No-one gets in without a pass.
I had it in here when I left.

121
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,740
It's not like
you don't know who I am.

122
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,060
Sir, according to this Dr Page
entered the building 15 minutes ago.

123
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,940
Close down the entrances.

124
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,860
Don't move!

125
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,260
Turn around slowly.

126
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,420
Put your hands where I can see them.

127
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,180
Drop your weapon
and get down on the ground now!

128
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,740
I know this man.

129
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,100
That's impossible.
Why?

130
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,100
I watched him die in the Silurian
Desert millions of years ago.

131
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,100
Clear.
Clear.

132
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,300
Chief, have they reopened the case?
What case?

133
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,020
I caught three government spooks
sniffing round the Brooks House.

134
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,260
Not this again! They said
they were property developers,

135
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,500
but their plate was from
a government vehicle. Leave it!

136
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,140
The way I see it
they'll have another inquiry.

137
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,100
You're losing your mind. I haven't
got time for this. Make time, sir.

138
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,460
Because of your history
with that house

139
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,020
I'll pretend you didn't speak
to a senior officer like that.

140
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,860
Forget it, Danny. It's over.

141
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,460
Not for me.

142
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,780
Excuse me.

143
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,260
Hello.
Hi. Hi.

144
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,900
We had some questions
about a property. Which one?

145
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,380
The abandoned house on the island.
You're interested?

146
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,780
Yeah. We're looking,
aren't we, darling?

147
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,180
Wondered why it hadn't sold yet.

148
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,660
The market's been a bit soft.

149
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,980
That's not the only reason.
Something happened there.

150
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,780
You mean the kids?
Kids? Three of them.

151
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,540
Local lads. They broke
into the house for a laugh.

152
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,620
What happened?

153
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,380
They disappeared. Not a trace
of them since - 14 years.

154
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,860
There must be some explanation.

155
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,180
Only one ever came out,
a boy called Ryan Mason.

156
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,260
Mason?

157
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,580
Yeah, Ryan Mason. Man, some people
say the place is still haunted.

158
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,020
They hear screams, noises.

159
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,780
If you're interested,
I can get you a killer deal now.

160
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,300
We'll think about it.

161
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,820
Better be quick.
Want to get rid of it soon.

162
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,780
Thank you.

163
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,780
Now what?
We need to track down Ryan Mason.

164
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,420
I'll make a call.

165
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,540
Hello?

166
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,580
Who's there?

167
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,940
Hello?

168
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,500
Ryan?

169
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,260
Ryan, can we talk to you?

170
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,820
Ryan.
Just leave me alone.

171
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,660
But you are Ryan Mason?
You ain't paid.

172
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,260
I always fancied this job. We know
you didn't harm your friends.

173
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,620
We just want to know
what happened in the house.

174
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,580
Hello?

175
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,740
Must've driven you crazy knowing
people thought you were a killer

176
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,660
when you've done nothing wrong.

177
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,420
I heard this terrible screaming.

178
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,020
There was this light shining.

179
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,620
It wasn't there before.
Was it flickering?

180
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,580
How do you know?

181
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,060
I just ran.

182
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,500
Screaming.

183
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,700
Like an animal.

184
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,580
No animal I'd ever heard.

185
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,380
Never saw my mates again.

186
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,100
Look, this is my job.
Please, no-one here knows.

187
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,660
We understand. You have nothing
to blame yourself for, Ryan.

188
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,060
I've been back to the house
a thousand times

189
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,620
and never once had the guts
to go back in.

190
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,620
But I will.

191
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,620
Come on.

192
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,320
Abby!

193
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,880
Abby.

194
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,200
Abby.

195
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,360
Hi.
Hi.

196
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,800
I must have fallen.

197
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,360
Let's get you up.

198
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,800
Come on.

199
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,440
Slowly, slowly.

200
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,320
I'll just sit down.

201
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,200
Abby, what happened?

202
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,280
I was upstairs.

203
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,640
I thought I saw someone
in the bedroom.

204
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
I can't remember after that.

205
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,360
We should get you to a doctor.

206
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,880
OK. You stay here,
but wait outside.

207
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,360
This guy was eaten by a giant
scorpion in the Silurian Desert.

208
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
I'd say that makes him fairly dead.

209
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,840
I didn't say it made sense.
All right.

210
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,400
It's his identical twin.

211
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,360
What's he doing here
going through my laundry?

212
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,320
We killed his brother,

213
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,400
so he steals your shirt.

214
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,240
You said it yourself,
it doesn't make sense.

215
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,000
There's another option: Helen.

216
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,400
Maybe she had something to do
with it. She employed him before.

217
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,280
So now she's brought him
back from the dead?

218
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,800
That's scarier than I thought.
You can't even begin to guess.

219
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,880
Rule number one:

220
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,520
something inexplicable happens
Helen's usually behind it.

221
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Trust me,

222
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,880
she's back.

223
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,880
Hi.

224
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
OK.

225
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,000
Where's my phone?

226
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,160
No!

227
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,840
You can't go inside.

228
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,880
I won't tell anybody, if you don't.

229
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,800
OK, phone.

230
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,600
Ah! What are you doing?

231
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,160
Arresting you
for breaking and entering.

232
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,880
No, you can't do that.
That's a mistake.

233
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,680
I can't leave this house.
Something bad might happen. What?

234
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,640
Come on.

235
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
You were warned.

236
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,520
Never let a good commission go
without a fight.

237
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,880
This is a blatant miscarriage
of justice.

238
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,720
I demand habeas corpus.

239
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,400
I would if I actually knew
what it meant.

240
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,320
I know my rights.
Name them.

241
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,480
You what?
Name them!

242
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,920
Phonecall! I get a phonecall.

243
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,400
Good lad.
And the right to remain silent.

244
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,000
Well, you've lost that one,
haven't you?

245
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,040
What is this?

246
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
A police state?

247
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,480
You can't take people's rights away
without asking them first.

248
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,280
You're not funny.

249
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,920
Please.

250
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,120
You have to let me go.
I have to speak to my friends.

251
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,640
Tell me what you were doing
at that house with your pals.

252
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,080
I can't do that.

253
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,160
You're not a property developer or
Oxbridge enough to be MI5, so what?

254
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,720
One phonecall.

255
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
I'll clear the whole thing up.

256
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,720
Please.

257
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,360
Is that a yeah or a no?

258
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Connor?

259
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,160
What?!

260
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,600
Oh, for heaven's sake.
I'm coming.

261
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,160
Connor's in jail.

262
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,200
OK, I'll stay here
and watch the house. Sure you're OK?

263
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,720
It's fine. I slipped. That's all.
Honestly, go.

264
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,720
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Give him my love.

265
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,320
Hey.

266
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,720
Hey!

267
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,440
Don't be scared. It won't hurt us.

268
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,040
I look after it. I feed it so it
doesn't eat Alfie or the other pets.

269
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,400
Everyone here
pretends it's not real.

270
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,440
But it is.

271
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,120
I have to stop it from being bad.

272
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,160
It's my job.

273
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,120
It's OK, Emily.

274
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,760
You can leave that to us now.

275
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,720
OK?

276
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,960
It lives in that house.

277
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,000
Please don't go in there.

278
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Don't worry, I won't.

279
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,040
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

280
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,200
Come here. It's so nice to see
a friend. It's been horrible.

281
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,240
I've been going stir crazy.
You were only in a few hours.

282
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,880
I'm not Nelson Mandela. It doesn't
mean I haven't suffered. Oi.

283
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,440
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

284
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,320
DC Quinn. I've come
to retrieve my colleague.

285
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,800
You'd be well advised to stay
out of my way. And if I don't?

286
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,560
It's for you.

287
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,440
DC Quinn.

288
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,200
No, sir. Of course not.

289
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,240
Yes.

290
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,720
Yes, sir. I'll do it right now.

291
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,480
I hear the Home Secretary
hates being woken in the night.

292
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,280
Be wise
if you didn't upset him again.

293
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,360
Phone.

294
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,920
Do you think
I'm entitled to compensation?

295
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,680
If you go near that house again,

296
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,040
none of your fancy phonecalls
will help you.

297
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,120
Leave it to the professionals.

298
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,200
It's now out of police jurisdiction.
It's government business.

299
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,800
So if you or any of your people go
there again, you'll be trespassing.

300
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,560
Leave it to the professionals.

301
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,880
Abby? 'The creature
can camouflage itself.'

302
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,200
That's why we didn't see it.
I'll call Becker for backup.

303
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,160
'Don't go in there.'

304
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,480
Hey!

305
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,760
Don't go inside the house!

306
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Jenny, change of plan. I'm going in.

307
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,560
Get here as soon as you can.

308
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,520
Don't shoot!

309
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,040
Who are you?
Ryan Mason.

310
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
I had to come back,
to know the truth.

311
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,320
Yeah? Well, your timing's lousy.

312
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,280
Come on.

313
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,280
Go, go!

314
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,240
Abby!

315
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,920
Wait.
OK.

316
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,320
Is it upstairs?
Yeah.

317
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,800
Are you OK?
Yeah.

318
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,280
After you.
Thanks very much.

319
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,240
You stay here.

320
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,560
No! Help! Help! Help!

321
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,840
Ssh. Trust me,
we can get you out of here.

322
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,760
But you have to stay calm,
and don't make any noise.

323
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,480
OK?

324
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,440
I'm gonna take my hand away now.

325
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,240
Help! Help!

326
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,080
Ow!
Connor!

327
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,200
Come on!

328
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,560
What did you do
with the others, Ryan?

329
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,640
It was the creature.

330
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,680
What did you do with my brother?
You've got it wrong.

331
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,720
Stay out of this.
This is out of your jurisdiction.

332
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,720
You're dealing with things you don't
understand. He killed my brother.

333
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,160
Just wait -
Shut up.

334
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,640
No!

335
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,880
He was my little brother.

336
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,360
Look out!

337
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,840
Stay still.

338
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,000
He's camouflaging.

339
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,880
An anomaly. Where's it gone?

340
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,840
I've got a clear shot.

341
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,800
Wait.
What?

342
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,000
It was waiting for the anomaly
to reappear. It wants to go home.

343
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,520
Cutter called it right.
The anomaly came back.

344
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,240
Has it gone?

345
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,120
Get down!

346
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,880
Antistab vest.
Standard police issue.

347
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,680
I am so gonna get one of them.

348
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,160
I suppose an explanation's
out of the question.

349
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,200
Totally.

350
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,240
Yeah, I thought so.

351
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,400
I thought it was you.

352
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,440
Yeah, I got that.

353
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,480
I'm sorry.

354
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,520
You couldn't have known.

355
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,360
Nobody could.

356
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,800
Come on.

357
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,200
Hi. Come on. Come on.

358
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,360
They never found my brother's body.

359
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,640
Maybe the creature didn't get him.

360
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,200
Maybe he went through the...

361
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,360
The anomaly.

362
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,320
Yeah.

363
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,800
That was a long time ago now, Danny.

364
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,760
Maybe it's time just to let him go.

365
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,720
You're right.

366
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,280
I've just phoned Cutter.

367
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,840
Told him he was right about
his prediction. What did he say?

368
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,240
His words exactly? Mm.
Something like,

369
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,200
"Of course I was right."

370
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,400
What's going on, Quinn?

371
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm quitting, boss.

372
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,160
We both know I wasn't right
for this job.

373
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Besides it gives you a chance
to be divisional champion.

374
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,160
What are you gonna do?

375
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,480
I'll think of something.

376
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,600
I need something concrete
nobody could fake.

377
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,200
Dinosaurs are different.
No-one believes they exist now.

378
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,920
Where is everyone?

379
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,080
I hear you've been looking for me.

380
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,200
I wish there was another way.

381
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,400
You are so fired.

382
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,400
