1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,480
Et dimitte a nobis...

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,920
..debita nostra sicut

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,160
et nos dimittimus a debitoribus nostris.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,600
Only you can save us from
the beast, Sir William.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,280
God bless and keep
you in this enterprise.

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,360
Father.

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
Sir William.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,880
Will you take this for your protection?

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,960
It will keep you from fear.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
My lady.

11
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,440
Where is he?

12
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
Where's Rex?

13
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,000
Jack...where's Rex?

14
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,080
He's with my mate, Tony.
I said he could borrow him.

15
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,800
He loves lizards.

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,480
You idiot! He's bringing
him back this morning,

17
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,280
I swear.

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,520
He better be here by the
time I get back from work.

19
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,120
He's just a stupid lizard.

20
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,440
Show some respect, Jack!

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,600
Reptiles have feelings too, you know.

22
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,560
Who's there?

23
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
Connor? Yo.

24
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
Something suspicious
has come up on the Net.

25
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,240
What kind of suspicious?

26
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,880
Have a look.

27
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,040
Rex. What?

28
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,400
Huh? Oh, no.

29
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,200
That's just a bearded dragon.

30
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,880
I am gonna kill Jack.

31
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,200
Really? That's a good idea
(!) Any particular reason?

32
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,320
He lent Rex to a friend.

33
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Isn't that what you just said? Me?

34
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,040
What? When?

35
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,560
When you looked at the
screen, you said, "Rex."

36
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,680
Next. I said, "Next," as in,
you know, "We've done that.

37
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,520
What else have you got?"

38
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,760
Whatever. Are you OK?

39
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,840
So we don't need to take any
action? No action. OK, fine.

40
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,200
Action? What action? Nothing, nothing.

41
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,240
What's with all the...questions?

42
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,160
So Jack definitely
said he lent him to...?

43
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,120
Yes. Why?

44
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,000
Stop.

45
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,240
Hello? 'Jack, do me a favour.'

46
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Explain to me why Rex is up
for auction on the Internet.

47
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Gambled him at poker.

48
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,120
You had no right to use Rex
to pay off your gambling debt.

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
What do you think student loans are for?

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,320
Get him back. How? 'Just do it.'

51
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,680
OK?

52
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
So where is it? Not far.

53
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,000
Where are you going?

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,040
Danny, I am sick of working on
the artifact. I need a break.

55
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,800
No, no, no. We need you
here. Well, I'm coming.

56
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,440
He's gonna kill it.

57
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,160
Yeah!

58
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,000
This is madness. Come on!

59
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,400
Stop! Oi!

60
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Stop!

61
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,440
Get him out of there! MAN: Oi, what?

62
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,880
What is that thing?
You don't wanna know.

63
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,680
It's injured. We have to help it.
Afraid you were gonna say that.

64
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
Abby!

65
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,520
Sarah, wait! Get back! I can help.

66
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
We're gonna push it back to the anomaly.

67
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,760
If it's gonna die, it's gonna die
in its own world. It's not gonna die.

68
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,800
Where's the anomaly?

69
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
It's close.

70
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,320
Abby, how's it injured?

71
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,480
It's got something stuck in its side.

72
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,920
Abby!

73
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
Oi!

74
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,200
Oi!

75
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,800
Danny! I'll make a noise.

76
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
Go on.

77
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,480
Go.

78
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Grab something.

79
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,200
Go on!

80
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,880
That was easy.

81
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,600
Why is it coming back?

82
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,720
Ego in Abysso sum! Meam
quaesitionem persequor. Ad Gloriam.

83
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,710
Anyone else? Hey?

84
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,670
Well, we've had a dragon,
a knight in shining armour...

85
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,790
A damsel in distress would be nice.
It's not a real dragon, though.

86
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,550
Dracorex, late cretaceous, herbivore.

87
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,270
It's still dangerous. It's wounded.

88
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,790
Close the anomaly. We'll
try and get it back to you.

89
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,630
What did he say, anyway?

90
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,550
"This is Hell. I carry on
to Glory." You speak Latin?

91
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,630
A copper can't have a classical
education? No, I didn't say that.

92
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,910
It's just it was more, "This is Hell,

93
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,190
my quest continues onto
Glory." I was paraphrasing.

94
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,710
The dracorex must have come through
an anomaly into Medieval England.

95
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,910
This is a waste of
time. It's a maze here.

96
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,430
I'm gonna go and get Connor,
we'll go after the knight.

97
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,470
Abby, take Becker, chase down the
dragony thing. You go too, Sarah.

98
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,430
Erm...Danny?

99
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,630
I think I'll stay here.

100
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,950
I thought you said you wanted to get
involved. I know, but you're right,

101
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,710
I'm probably more of a back room girl.

102
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,950
Look, if you're frightened, it's
nothing to be ashamed of. Yeah.

103
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,910
I'll keep that in mind.

104
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,030
He's on the high
street! He's over there!

105
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,510
Come on!

106
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,630
It's over there.

107
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,710
Don't lose it.

108
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,270
Die!

109
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,830
Die!

110
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,230
Our knight?

111
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,630
So what happens when we
actually catch up with him?

112
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,230
We sit and talk to him like
rational human beings. Yeah?

113
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,950
Yeah.

114
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,470
I think we found it.

115
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,470
I don't want it harmed.

116
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,750
We use tranquillisers. Is that clear?

117
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,590
Look, it's my job to protect
you, not the creatures.

118
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,150
All right?

119
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,190
Bye. Thanks.

120
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,190
Stand back, demon.

121
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,950
We're not demons. We're flesh
and blood, just like you.

122
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,590
You are demons and I am in Hell.

123
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,590
Technically, it's London.

124
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,230
But it's an easy mistake to make.

125
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,270
We can help you get home.

126
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,950
My only way home is to slay the
beast and to complete my quest.

127
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,830
Killing the dragon
will not get you back.

128
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,270
It's not a dragon. We can help you.

129
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,390
I know this seems weird, but -

130
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,550
Peasants.

131
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,830
Look, we're never gonna find him.

132
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,190
Danny, he's wearing a full suit
of armour and carrying a sword.

133
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,310
Even in London, that's
gonna get noticed.

134
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,670
Don't worry, he's gonna
stand out like a sore...

135
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,150
..thumb.

136
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,230
Don't ask.

137
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,150
Just unlock the anomaly.

138
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,870
Well...

139
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,990
Look, Lester instructed it.

140
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,950
You sure? Yes, I'm sure.

141
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,510
OK.

142
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,550
Right, as soon as I get
through, seal it again,

143
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,270
and then unlock it in exactly
an hour's time. You got that?

144
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,350
Yeah.

145
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,790
Wish me luck.

146
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,030
No.

147
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,230
I told you, I don't
want it to be harmed.

148
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,910
Abby, what are you doing?

149
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,590
Go, go, go!

150
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,350
Yargh!

151
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,830
If it comes any closer,
I'm going to kill it.

152
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,990
That is not the answer. (ROARS)

153
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,310
I think you should take a look at it.

154
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,910
Hey.

155
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,230
It's OK, we're not gonna hurt you.

156
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,990
Looks as if it's on its last
legs. Yeah, we need to get it back.

157
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,110
Yeah, how? Well...

158
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,550
that's your department.
Oh, dinosaur transportation?

159
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,830
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

160
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,670
Hurry up, we haven't got much time.

161
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,630
Here's your field hospital.

162
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,190
Hang in there, dragon.

163
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,550
I know this place.

164
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,510
Ooh, very nice.

165
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,870
All right, mate?

166
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,670
Nice costume.

167
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,390
Recycled, is it?

168
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,390
Satan?

169
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,950
No, his name's Brian, actually.

170
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,590
The mark of the beast! Sling your 'ook!

171
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,910
Oi, you two. Take it outside now.

172
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,630
Take it outside!

173
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,550
Sir Lancelot? Yeah.

174
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,430
Satan!

175
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,990
Oi!

176
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,310
See how your master cowers before me!

177
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,470
I don't think he's who you think he is.

178
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,390
How many demons must I slay this day?

179
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,750
Sort something out.
I'll keep him busy. What?

180
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,470
Go on.

181
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,150
Can't we just talk about this?

182
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,190
Obviously not. What's that up there?

183
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,710
Ah, that's just made
you cross, hasn't it?

184
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,590
You are too feeble an
opponent to be worth killing.

185
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,470
But do not try my patience again.

186
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,670
State of my pub!

187
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,310
Quick! We can't lose him!

188
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,150
This is worse than the wife's hen night!

189
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,310
Oh, it's all right.
You can come out now.

190
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,510
Gotcha!

191
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,670
Now what?

192
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,190
Come on!

193
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,650
Stop.

194
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,450
We need a vet. I'll call the ARC.

195
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,490
There's not enough time.

196
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,610
I'm gonna have to do it.

197
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,690
You can do this, Abby.

198
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,010
Come on, I need your help. Right.

199
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,850
Right, so put your hands
round there and pull. Yep.

200
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,530
OK. Just really steady.

201
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,770
Not gonna let you die, dragon.

202
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,130
Halt!

203
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,130
Are you a witch? No.

204
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,690
Oh. Why?

205
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,090
You were out there and
the dragon didn't eat you.

206
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,170
I hid.

207
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,610
How long have you been in here
- in the church?

208
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,490
Since the dragon came.

209
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,690
But the knight will save us. Really?

210
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,610
And who is this knight?
Sir William de Mornay.

211
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,650
Where are you from?

212
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,930
Well, I'm from a place
that's very, very far away.

213
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,890
The Holy Land? Bit further than that.

214
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,410
Tell me more about the village.

215
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,210
Why should I?

216
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,770
Good question.

217
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,370
There you go. That's why.

218
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,290
It looks like mud.

219
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,290
It certainly doesn't taste like mud.

220
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,330
Go on.

221
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,850
Hey, slow down. That stuff
can ruin your teeth, OK?

222
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,170
Know what? Here, have the whole bar.

223
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,930
So, what else do you wanna know?

224
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,370
Well, this knight...

225
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,610
You never saw me, this didn't happen.

226
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,330
Right. Good.

227
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,010
Bingo.

228
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,250
We should split up? Split up?

229
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,930
I'm not splitting up. Have
you not seen horror films?

230
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,010
We've got to find him
before he kills someone.

231
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,450
It's me. Talk to me.

232
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,690
The knight's name
- it's William de Mornay.

233
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,330
He was a mercenary who fought all
over Europe for whoever paid him.

234
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,650
He's killed a lot of men, Danny,
and he's looking for redemption,

235
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,930
and he thinks killing
the dragon is gonna do it.

236
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,010
How do you know all this?

237
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,330
My job is to research, so I researched.

238
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,970
Well, you're very good.
Better than you think.

239
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,050
We have to find him. He's lost
in a world he doesn't understand.

240
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,410
I mean, maybe he's not
trying to find the dragon.

241
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,010
Maybe he's just trying to
get home. Well, in that case,

242
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,290
there's a ruins of the old parish
church by the river. Shh-shh-shh.

243
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,130
Erm...I'm sending you
the map reference now.

244
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,290
'OK, you get Becker and meet me there.'

245
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,850
Well, he can't at the
moment. He's helping Abby.

246
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,570
What's he doing?

247
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,650
She's operating on the dracorex.

248
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,250
All right, wait for Becker and meet
me at the church. I can come now.

249
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,050
Sarah, you do not leave
without backup. That's an order.

250
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,090
Do you understand? I
can't hear you, Danny.

251
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,250
'Sarah, do not hang
up!' You're breaking up.

252
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,890
'Sarah, do not hang up the
-' Oh...

253
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,290
shame.

254
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,450
What's going on? How's Abby? She's fine.

255
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,370
She's trying to save the dragon.

256
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,010
Really?

257
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,850
I should be with her.
Maybe I could help.

258
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,450
Well, go on, then.

259
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,490
Really bad time, Jack.

260
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,890
The bidding for Rex is up to two grand.

261
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,650
You better get hold of the cash, then.

262
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,410
Where am I gonna get £2,000 from?

263
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,530
There's nothing I can
do. Abby's gonna kill me.

264
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,490
Really? She'll have to join the queue.

265
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,450
Look, just leave it with
me. I'll think of something.

266
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,290
OK?

267
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,250
Thank you.

268
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,290
How's he doing? I think the wound's OK.

269
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,250
It's the shock that's killing him.

270
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,730
If he survives for another
hour, I think he might make it.

271
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,490
Is there anything I can do to help?

272
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,570
We need to put pressure on the wound.

273
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,970
OK.

274
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,690
Is he OK? Yeah.

275
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,810
My grave.

276
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,290
I am dead and gone to Hell.

277
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,650
I am too, God help me.

278
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,690
William.

279
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,970
I know none of this makes
any sense but I can explain.

280
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,170
You just have to trust me.
Are you the devil's champion?

281
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,290
No, I'm not the devil's
champion and you're not in Hell,

282
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,250
but I can help you.

283
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,490
With God on my side...

284
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,850
..I will not be defeated.

285
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,050
I don't want to fight you.
Because you are a coward.

286
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,530
That's a bit harsh, isn't
it? This will be over quickly.

287
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,530
You are an infernal imp
sent to torment my soul.

288
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,050
You sound just like my mother.

289
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,730
Stop! Sir William!

290
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,330
Stop!

291
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,330
Sir William...there's
something that you must see.

292
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,730
Do you know what this is, William?

293
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,290
It's my grave.

294
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,450
I am dead and gone to Hell.

295
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,090
You're not dead yet.

296
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,930
See...what it says here?

297
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,450
You have many years to live.

298
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,970
Then why am I already
in the world to come?

299
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,970
Look...closely.

300
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,410
My wife lies here beside me.

301
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,610
I have no wife. Not yet.

302
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,610
But you will when you get back.

303
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,290
Lady Elizabeth Langley.

304
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,930
How do you know her? You
will marry her, William.

305
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,010
You will have three children together.

306
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,530
I am just a wandering
knight, far below her in rank.

307
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,490
Listen to me. Just calm down.

308
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,170
You must have done something
to impress her, William.

309
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,370
You will live a long
and happy life together.

310
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,850
It's written here...in stone.

311
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:26,250
It's your fate, your destiny.
If you let us take you back.

312
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,250
My only way back is to kill the beast.

313
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,210
That is not your quest, William.

314
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,050
Your quest is to leave this
place and marry Elizabeth.

315
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,130
The beast is wounded and likely to die.

316
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,650
Honour is satisfied.

317
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,370
Well, you know where it is?

318
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,130
Take me to it!

319
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,970
Take another step and I will
dispatch her without mercy!

320
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,090
All right. You will
not hurt me, William.

321
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,850
It goes against all laws of chivalry.

322
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,050
Bleeding stopped?

323
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,330
He's gonna be OK.

324
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,610
One tough little dragon, eh?

325
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,810
Becker, change of plan.
I need picking up. Now.

326
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,490
It ends at last.

327
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,130
Out of my way.

328
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,970
No.

329
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,050
Out...of my way.

330
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,490
You show strange courage for a demon.

331
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,090
Oh, I'm a demon all right.

332
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,610
William! William!

333
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,490
Elizabeth is waiting for you.

334
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,370
You have my word of honour.

335
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,170
The dragon will never
come to your village again.

336
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,050
Your quest can end in triumph.

337
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,010
I am weary of killing.

338
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,890
I know.

339
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,210
I crave only of rest and
the pleasures of peace.

340
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,930
And they can all be yours.

341
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,730
If I kill the beast! No! No!

342
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,570
I will never let you kill him!

343
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,370
Then I will cut you both down!
Abby, move out of the way!

344
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,730
William! Drop your weapon
and get down on your knees!

345
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,770
Becker, no! What?!

346
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,570
If you kill him, then history changes.

347
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,690
His children will never be born.
And who knows where it will end.

348
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,490
He has to go back.

349
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,010
No, he's gonna kill Abby. Becker, do it!

350
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,730
You would sacrifice your life...

351
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,850
..for this savage beast?

352
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,930
Willingly.

353
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,090
This is not how demons
behave, is it, William?

354
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,410
No, this is some sort of trick.

355
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,090
No trick and in your heart, you know it.

356
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,490
We're humans...just like you.

357
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,210
You've done enough, William.

358
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,090
Your quest is over.

359
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,890
Yargh!

360
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,730
No!

361
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,330
I thought this might be Hell.

362
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,130
Yeah, we got that.

363
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,090
But if it is not... can it be paradise?

364
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,530
Well, it's not exactly paradise, no.

365
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,210
Thank God, for it is an awful place.

366
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,450
Yeah, sometimes.

367
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,490
But it's home and er...

368
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,250
And your home is...

369
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,610
Through there. Yeah.

370
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,090
Sarah.

371
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,170
Ego vos relinquo in pacis.

372
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,610
What did he say?

373
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,770
He said, "I depart in peace."

374
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,210
It was more like, "I
leave you in peace."

375
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,130
Oh, yeah.

376
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,010
What did he leave you?

377
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,690
It's from Jerusalem.
It's seven centuries old.

378
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,450
Worth a few quid on eBay.

379
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,290
Well, you expect we'll have difficulty

380
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,090
explaining why it's still brand new.

381
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,290
So, look, tell me something.

382
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,850
Where did you find out all
that stuff about William?

383
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:03,370
You know, a bit of luck,
intuition, a few educated guesses.

384
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:06,050
Amazing. It's almost
like you were there.

385
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,890
Well, I did tell you I
was very good, didn't I?

386
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,810
So...

387
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,610
what are you gonna do with the dracorex?

388
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,810
I'm gonna wait till an anomaly
opens to the right time period

389
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,850
and then put him back.

390
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,690
You can't keep him, you know.

391
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,530
I mean, for one thing, I don't
think he'd fit in the flat.

392
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,130
I wasn't going to.

393
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,290
Well, not forever.

394
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,570
I've gotta go. Where?

395
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,450
Just some stuff to...do.

396
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,450
Open the doors!

397
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,610
It's Sir William!

398
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,770
The beast is...

399
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,650
vanquished!

400
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,970
My lady Elizabeth.

401
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,170
I believe this is yours.

402
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,250
I've come for the lizard.

403
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,970
Cost you three grand.

404
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,730
How about you bring him to me?
Or I'll come in and get him.

405
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,690
Yeah? You and whose army?

406
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,890
Mine...

407
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,970
actually.

408
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,690
You better come in.

409
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,730
Thank you.

410
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,690
He's found my detector.

411
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,090
It's your responsibility
to keep that safe!

412
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,130
He's gone through the anomaly.

413
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,330
The bug is from the same place
as the artifact. It's possible.

414
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,810
Which means that the future could be
just the other side of the anomaly.

415
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:43,490
If those things got loose,
humanity never stood a chance.

416
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,210
Connor, get him out of here!
