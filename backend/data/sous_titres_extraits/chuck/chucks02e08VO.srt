1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
<i>Previously on "Chuck"...</i>

2
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:02,706
<i>There are a few
things you might need to know.</i>

3
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:04,308
Don't hurt him again.
- I won't.

4
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:06,007
The hotel's booked,
so we should probably

5
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,378
go if we're gonna beat traffic.

6
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:08,479
With this list,
it's just a matter of time

7
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:10,080
before we learn the identities

8
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:11,015
of FULCRUM's agents.

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,991
Oh, wow!

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,293
Chuck, look at this view!

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,161
It's amazing.

12
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:27,832
Chuck? It's just
a Ferris wheel.

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,200
It's fine.

14
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:30,734
Ah. Yeah.

15
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:33,504
Yeah, it's not the...
it's not the wheel so much

16
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:34,939
as it is me.

17
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,575
What? What does
that mean?

18
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:41,545
I kind of sort of
bribed the carny

19
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:44,048
to stop us at the top.

20
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:45,983
Well, for someone
who's afraid of heights,

21
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,751
that was
pretty moronic.

22
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:50,754
I was going for... romantic,

23
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:52,523
but...

24
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,258
Okay, here goes. Uh...

25
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:57,161
Jill, we... we've been friends

26
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,263
for... for, like,
a semester now, right?

27
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,198
And it's been really fun.

28
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:03,567
And I was just...

29
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:04,802
I was thinking that maybe,

30
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,437
you know, uh,
you and I... we could,

31
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:10,074
I don't know...

32
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:11,642
You know what? You're right.

33
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,977
I-I... What am I thinking?

34
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:14,712
You're right.
This is moronic. I...

35
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:16,680
You were happy being friends,
and I'm happy being friends,

36
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:17,948
and I just thought...

37
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:19,450
Chuck, there <i>is</i> a problem.

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,320
You talk way, way

39
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:25,422
too much.

40
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:29,560
<i>Jill Roberts is FULCRUM?</i>

41
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:31,162
And she has Chuck?

42
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,063
How is that possible?

43
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:35,366
Well, the LaFleur List
contained a code name

44
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:37,735
our computer translated
to one Jill Roberts.

45
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:40,404
By the time we saw it,
they were already gone.

46
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:41,605
His cell is switched off,

47
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:42,673
and his watch is still
in the apartment.

48
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:43,841
Find him.

49
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,009
I don't care how. Just do it.

50
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:48,412
You know, it doesn't matter.

51
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,847
FULCRUM's working him over
about now.

52
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:51,348
He's not gonna last an hour.

53
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,550
No, you're wrong.

54
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:54,018
They don't know
Chuck's the Intersect,

55
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:56,554
and they don't know
Jill has been burned.

56
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:01,058
Well, if it ain't torture...
what are they doing to him?

57
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:04,962
We have ways to
make you talk, Mr. Bartowski.

58
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,897
Do your worst.

59
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:17,641
There's gonna be yelling.

60
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,543
Well, was it worth it?

61
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,682
Was it worth it?

62
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:29,720
Mmm.

63
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:32,590
It was so worth it.

64
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:36,293
Good.

65
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,862
I'm going to take a shower.

66
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:39,463
You deal with the yelling, okay?

67
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:40,731
Okay.

68
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,801
Have fun.

69
00:02:57,983 --> 00:02:59,817
Oh, that's not good.

70
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,825
Jill, your phone's buzzing.

71
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:09,293
What?

72
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:13,063
Oh, no. No, no, no, no!

73
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:22,206
This can't be happening.

74
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,507
What was that, Chuck?

75
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:24,675
Nothing!

76
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:26,677
Um, nothing at all, actually.

77
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:28,445
I was just saying,
I'm a little...

78
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:30,514
I'm a little, uh, parched,
'cause-cause,

79
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:32,550
well, last night was incredible.

80
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:35,186
You know? Like,
we had some fun, didn't we?

81
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:37,488
Then I was thinking,
hey, you want some coffee?

82
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:38,556
Yeah, that'd
be great.

83
00:03:38,623 --> 00:03:40,457
Okay, great, great.

84
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,968
Oh!

85
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:53,003
You idiot!

86
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:54,638
You sad-sack,
bleeding heart idiot!

87
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:55,873
She's-She's...

88
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:57,608
Chuck, never do that again.

89
00:03:57,676 --> 00:03:59,009
It's Jill. I think....

90
00:03:59,077 --> 00:03:59,710
We know.
- We know.

91
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:00,978
Wait.

92
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:03,914
This-This has got
to be a mistake, okay?

93
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:06,016
I've known Jill
for eight years, since college,

94
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:07,418
and we-we had
this really amazing...

95
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:10,221
...night. Look, she's not a spy,

96
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:12,056
and she has
no FULCRUM code name.

97
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:13,524
The code name was...
Wait, wait, wait.

98
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:14,391
Don't say it.

99
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,993
Sandstorm.

100
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:20,798
Oh, my God.

101
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,068
Jill's a spy.

102
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:25,669
I'm sorry, Chuck.

103
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:33,677
<i>What do you mean</i>

104
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:35,312
I have to go back in there?

105
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,114
Think, Bartowski. We
don't want Jill to know

106
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:38,849
that we know
she's a spy, right?

107
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,017
Oh, okay, look, okay.

108
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:41,519
Jill is FULCRUM.

109
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,521
FULCRUM is looking
for the Intersect,

110
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:45,890
and the Intersect just happens
to be <i>me.</i>

111
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:47,158
Chuck, they don't know that.

112
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,526
Trust me. We're right here.

113
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,227
Everything will be fine.
You will be safe.

114
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:51,595
Yeah. Buck up,
soldier.

115
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:52,963
FULCRUM pulled one
on us.

116
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,832
Let's return the favor.

117
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:08,145
Oh!

118
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:10,481
Thank you, sweetie.

119
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,917
Oh...

120
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:16,253
You're welcome... darling.

121
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:44,482
# Na-na na-na na-na #

122
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:47,418
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

123
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:49,019
# Na-na na-na na-na #

124
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,688
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

125
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,223
# Na-na na-na na-na #

126
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,526
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

127
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:06,792
<i>Chuck, are you sure</i>
<i>everything's okay?</i>

128
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,861
Huh? Yeah. Everything's
fantastic. It's great.

129
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:11,563
This is me on the verge
of total happiness.

130
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,632
Okay, do you want to do
something tonight?

131
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,335
Um, yeah, I would...
I would love to,

132
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:18,837
but the problem is,
the apartment is not safe.

133
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:20,172
My sister's back,

134
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,107
and I can't blow my cover, so...

135
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:23,842
Well, we can go out.

136
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,612
Okay. All right.

137
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,016
Okay.

138
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:32,918
Bye. Drive safe.

139
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:42,962
Are you okay?

140
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,296
You know, for a few days,

141
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:45,864
I thought things were going
to be different.

142
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,800
I could have a life.
I could have a girlfriend.

143
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,068
I could be
a regular human being.

144
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:50,269
I thought Jill was...

145
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:52,171
Different?
- No.

146
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:53,639
Normal.

147
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:54,673
How could
this happen?

148
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:56,041
Jill must have been recruited

149
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:57,910
when she was at Stanford.

150
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:00,512
FULCRUM uses leadership seminars
to look for possible agents.

151
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,849
Excuse me, I'm sorry, General,
but who in my life isn't a spy?

152
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,351
My sister? My best friend?

153
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:06,552
Should I just start
asking people that

154
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:07,853
when I first meet them?

155
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:09,488
Hi. I'd like
the extra value meal,

156
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,790
and while we're on the topic,
do you covertly work

157
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:12,858
for a government espionage
faction?

158
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:14,927
Your flash in Jill's room

159
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:16,629
referenced an agent
called Leader.

160
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:19,031
We want you to use
your relationship with Jill,

161
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,566
see if she makes contact
with him.

162
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:21,867
General, Chuck is not ready

163
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:23,102
for this type of mission.

164
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:24,703
He could barely handle
a good-bye with Jill.

165
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,105
She's going to see
right through him.

166
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,973
This is our best opportunity
to infiltrate FULCRUM,

167
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,541
but if you don't think
he's ready...

168
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:30,776
I'll do it.

169
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:35,781
Jill betrayed me twice.

170
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:38,484
You bet I'll do it.

171
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,361
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't sit down!

172
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:52,464
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What is it?

173
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:54,233
Devon's parents are coming
tomorrow for Thanksgiving,

174
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,834
and the couch is... perfect.

175
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:57,603
Okay, perfect.
- The Awesomes?

176
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:59,038
The Awesomes are coming here?

177
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:01,073
Yes, the Very Awesomes
are coming here.

178
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,642
They make their son
look mildly impressive.

179
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,411
Sis, you got nothing
to worry about.

180
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:06,912
They love you.

181
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,614
Huh. I guess
when you're a doctor,

182
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:10,049
and you marry a doctor,

183
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:11,684
and you raise
three awesome boys,

184
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:13,786
you tend to judge people
a little harsher.

185
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:16,455
I guess that's how I feel
when Mrs. Awesome is around.

186
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:19,291
I have never heard you use
the nickname that many times.

187
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:21,093
I know. I know. It's okay.

188
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,162
I'm just a little
stressed right now,

189
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:24,997
but we all have
our burdens to bear.

190
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,268
Hey, Chuck, yo!

191
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:30,936
Hey, yo!

192
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:32,771
What?

193
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:33,939
Anybody here?

194
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:35,074
Like whom?

195
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,342
Like whom?

196
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,010
Like, the other
woman, dude. Jill.

197
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:39,545
Morgan, there is
no other woman.

198
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:40,813
Really? That's great,

199
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,182
'cause I thought I
was gonna have to do

200
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:44,583
some sort of intervention
or something.

201
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:46,185
You know, help you
with your addiction

202
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:47,553
to really
attractive women.

203
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,455
What's that smell?

204
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:51,023
Uh, probably Ellie.

205
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:52,725
She's doing some
practice cooking for tomorrow.

206
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,193
Naturally.
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

207
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,728
So, that smell is...

208
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:57,663
turkey.

209
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:16,649
Morgan?

210
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:17,850
Morgan?!

211
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:20,152
I need you to try this.

212
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,121
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

213
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,389
Oh, my God.

214
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:29,862
It's heaven.

215
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:32,031
No. No, it's too...
it's too dry.

216
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,835
Test turkey #1 is too dry.

217
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:39,271
Uh, three hours, seven minutes.

218
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:43,175
What are you doing?

219
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:44,977
No, no, no, no. Ellie,
what are you...?

220
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,211
Oh, my God.

221
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,782
Okay, Morgan, we need to talk.

222
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:52,751
It's fine. Please just don't
hurt another turkey like that.

223
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:54,353
Morgan, this Thanksgiving
is very important.

224
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:55,721
Sure.

225
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:57,222
And things need
to run smoothly.

226
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,491
I know. I know.

227
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,759
You've been so stressed.
Everything's great.

228
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,061
It's perfect. What can I do?

229
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:03,329
Morgan?

230
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:04,697
Yeah?

231
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,598
You're...

232
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,766
Not invited!

233
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,034
I can't believe this.

234
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:11,170
I mean, how?
Uninvited to T-day...

235
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:12,438
Morgan, Morgan, relax.

236
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,673
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you.

237
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:16,208
It's all going to be okay.

238
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:18,477
I'm gonna talk to Ellie,
and we're gonna sort it out.

239
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,646
Anna's out of town,
and you guys were my only hope.

240
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:22,514
If I don't Thanksgiving with you...
Morgan! Morgan, breathe.

241
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:24,383
Excuse me, sir?
- Hi. Can I help you?

242
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:25,617
Grimes! With me.

243
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:27,987
Okay.

244
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:29,922
Did I just hear you don't
have Thanksgiving plans?

245
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,457
That's terrible,
damn terrible.

246
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:33,459
I'm amazed to find
so many staff members

247
00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:35,327
without proper plans
for Thanksgiving.

248
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:37,496
Like these two
poor creatures.

249
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:38,764
Sir, are you inviting us
to dinner?

250
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:40,966
No... God, no.

251
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:43,936
I need you lonely bastards
to stand guard here at the store

252
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:45,804
on Thanksgiving.
- Stand guard?

253
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:47,473
Yeah, because
of Black Friday.

254
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,707
We have more product
in the store

255
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:49,975
than ever before,
and you three

256
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:51,744
are gonna make certain
nobody steals it.

257
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,919
Answer it.
- Not on the first ring.

258
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:02,154
It implies
an eagerness

259
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:03,656
that I'm not really
feeling right now.

260
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:05,224
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

261
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,625
Hi, hi, hi, Jill.

262
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:10,896
A-a date?

263
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:12,064
Tonight?

264
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:13,966
Yeah, sounds...
sounds great.

265
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:15,067
Where?

266
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:16,969
It's a surprise.

267
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:20,005
Of course I can tell
my bodyguards

268
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:21,907
to take the night off
so we can be alone.

269
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:22,841
Just the two of us.

270
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:26,178
I'm looking forward
to it as well.

271
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:29,415
Ow, ow!

272
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:30,549
What are you doing?

273
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:32,051
What was that for?
- The kissy noise.

274
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:33,519
Have some self-respect,
Bartowski.

275
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:35,087
You're a man.

276
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:37,056
I got to go talk to Sarah.

277
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,497
What... what is it?

278
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:46,832
Sarah, I need your help.

279
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,167
How am I gonna survive tonight?

280
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,303
Well, a good spy knows

281
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:52,771
what their
mark wants.

282
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,540
And what do we
know about Jill?

283
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:56,575
She's a spy;
she wants you to be

284
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:58,444
under her spell.
- Okay, how do I do that?

285
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,845
She's gonna test you.

286
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:01,847
When the time is right,
she's gonna make certain

287
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:03,882
that she has you,
that you love her.

288
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,484
How is she gonna do that?

289
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,119
When you're
most exposed.

290
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:08,620
Emotionally exposed.

291
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:11,223
Like a... an intimate moment,
say, a kiss.

292
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,025
Okay.

293
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,426
Imagine that I am Jill.

294
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:15,794
The moment
is romantic.

295
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,029
She's close to you.

296
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,164
She's looking
into your eyes.

297
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,833
Got it, okay.

298
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,067
You got... I-I got that.

299
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:23,402
I'm trying not
to be distracted

300
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,770
by the oh-so-romantic
secret base.

301
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,442
Concentrate, Chuck.

302
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,744
Keep looking into my eyes.

303
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:33,012
Don't look up.

304
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,180
And if you can't
hold Jill's stare,

305
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:36,415
look at her lips.

306
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:38,217
Good.

307
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:40,419
Now, move her hair
back over her ear.

308
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:45,024
And when you
start to kiss,

309
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,760
focus again on her.

310
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:51,063
And just before your lips
are about to meet,

311
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:52,798
close your eyes.

312
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:57,136
Okay, good.

313
00:12:57,203 --> 00:12:59,505
Good, you're all set.

314
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:00,506
Huh?

315
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:03,008
Oh, yeah, good.

316
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:04,109
Hey.

317
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:05,744
NSA just picked up
a purchase

318
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:06,979
on Jill's credit card.

319
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,547
Two tickets
to some stupid concert

320
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:10,482
down at the Music Center.

321
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,184
Better not be another
freaking opera.

322
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:13,986
Well, we'll be there
waiting for you.

323
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,387
Look, just remember,

324
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:16,588
Jill is capable of anything.

325
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:35,774
You look great.

326
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:37,109
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

327
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:43,716
So, what do you
think of my surprise?

328
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,951
Uh, weren't-weren't we
supposed to...

329
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:46,952
What?

330
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,520
Nothing, nothing.

331
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,956
If I seem tense, it's just my
irrational fear of carnivals

332
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:52,391
acting up on me.
- Oh, right.

333
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:53,892
Come here. I've got
another surprise for you.

334
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:04,103
You saw this coming,
didn't you?

335
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,038
You bribed a carny.

336
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:09,775
You know what
happens next?

337
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:12,077
You get really,
really nervous,

338
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:13,979
and then you
ramble on

339
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:15,848
for a couple seconds,
and then...

340
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:18,851
I have to kiss you.

341
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,900
I'm sorry, Chuck.

342
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:38,237
For what?

343
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:49,676
What are you doing?

344
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:51,044
I work for a group
called FULCRUM.

345
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:52,880
You know who they are,
don't you, Chuck?

346
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:55,182
I plan to eliminate you.

347
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,317
Jill, please don't do this.
- Believe me, Chuck.

348
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:59,052
I don't want to.
I'm not a killer.

349
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,921
This isn't what I do for a living.
- You pull that trigger,

350
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,289
and it is what you do
for a living.

351
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:03,290
You already broke my heart.

352
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:04,391
Is it necessary for you

353
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:05,359
to shoot it as well?

354
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:10,731
You're right.

355
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,701
Okay, Chuck, here's the truth.

356
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,036
There's a FULCRUM operative
down there.

357
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:17,137
He's watching
us right now.

358
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:19,139
I'm supposed
to transport you to a car

359
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:21,108
in the parking lot, and if
I don't follow their plan,

360
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:22,509
they're gonna eliminate
you and me

361
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:24,211
as a precaution.

362
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:27,981
We're almost
to the Music Center.

363
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:28,949
What's the ETA

364
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:30,717
on Chuck and the FULCRUM agent?

365
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:33,454
Wait, I lost him.

366
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:35,722
His signal just dropped off the grid.
- What?!

367
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,357
It was a ghost.
Turn us around, Casey, now!

368
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,430
They're not at the Music Center.

369
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:44,531
North 101. Go!

370
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,769
Chuck, you have to
do exactly what I say, okay?

371
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:50,237
I think you should know

372
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:51,972
that my completely
rational fear of carnivals

373
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,273
has spread to ex-girlfriends.

374
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:55,342
I mean, how do I know
I can trust you?

375
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,411
How do I know you're
not just gonna take me

376
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,879
to the parking lot
to do something

377
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:00,013
you said you wouldn't?
- Oh, no.

378
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,048
It's him.

379
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:02,416
Who's him? Him who?

380
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:05,719
Leader.

381
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,627
Okay, come here.

382
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:23,137
Um, excuse us,

383
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:24,605
person we don't know,
you're blocking us.

384
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,106
His handlers are closing in.

385
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:27,574
Eliminate him.

386
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:29,176
What, here?

387
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:30,110
Don't think.
- Shoot him

388
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,311
in the head and let's go.

389
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,913
Did-did you...
did you just say...

390
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,348
Let's talk about this first.

391
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:36,450
Think I should just leave
if there's a... ow!

392
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:37,618
This is a test, Jill.

393
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:38,752
Do it now.

394
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:40,988
Too late.

395
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:47,561
You're making a big mistake.

396
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,433
Sorry, sorry, excuse me!

397
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,582
Mr. Bartowski.

398
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:11,585
You need
to come with me.

399
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:14,455
Um, you told Jill to shoot me.

400
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:16,490
Why would I ever
go anywhere with you?

401
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,092
I'd rather not leave your body
here on the ride.

402
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,794
What if some kid saw it?

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,299
Wow, that's, uh...

404
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,601
that's strangely considerate
of you.

405
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:30,330
Okay.

406
00:18:52,954 --> 00:18:54,555
That's exactly how I feel.

407
00:18:54,622 --> 00:18:57,925
Chuck, you have to trust me.
- Jill?

408
00:18:57,992 --> 00:18:59,426
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

409
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:00,961
Where are you?

410
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:02,796
Jill, where are you?
Why are you doing this?

411
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:04,898
When did you join FULCRUM
and why?

412
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:09,136
It started
at Stanford.

413
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:10,704
They sponsored

414
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:12,306
a leadership seminar.

415
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:14,608
After school, whatever job
we wanted, they got us.

416
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:17,644
They made our dreams
come true.

417
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:18,946
Couldn't you get out?

418
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:19,980
When someone
controls

419
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:21,482
every part of your life, Chuck,

420
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:23,250
you have to do what they say.

421
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:26,220
After a while,
I found myself doing things

422
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,322
I never thought
I would have done, but...

423
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:31,125
but then it was too late.

424
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,227
Too late for what?

425
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:34,761
Jill?

426
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:36,396
Jill!

427
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:40,567
I'm impressed,
Mr. Bartowski.

428
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:42,970
I wasn't really certain
you were a spy,

429
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:45,439
but... now I see.

430
00:19:57,786 --> 00:19:58,819
Good-bye.

431
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:12,800
Chuck, come on.

432
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,940
Don't move!

433
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:21,742
No, no, wait,
wait, wait!

434
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,976
Don't hurt her.

435
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:24,578
She saved my life.

436
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:36,325
# #

437
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,088
So one more time,
what's the plan?

438
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,124
We stay here
in the store all day.

439
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:43,659
Anything goes wrong, we call you.
- Good.

440
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:46,462
Remember, you three are the last
line of defense against...

441
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,363
Yeah, but, can I...
this is a bit overkill.

442
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:49,498
Overkill?

443
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:50,265
Dude.

444
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,400
Grimes, my first store

445
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,101
was The Husky Lad:
Big and Tall.

446
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,671
"For the more than
average man."

447
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:56,772
It was robbed.

448
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,273
Thanksgiving of '88.

449
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,275
That was a dark day, Morgan.

450
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,244
Husky lads throughout Burbank

451
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:04,079
went without britches
for Christmas.

452
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:07,116
The store closed
before the new year.

453
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,350
So, no...

454
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:10,152
it's not overkill.

455
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,220
It's business.

456
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:13,522
Sure.

457
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,991
Um, but before you lock us in,

458
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,660
um, isn't there some
sort of law or rule

459
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:20,362
about locking us in the store?
I mean, what if there's a fire?

460
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,697
I'm not worried about a fire.

461
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:23,665
I'm worried
about thieves.

462
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,934
All right, Lady Big
Mike is cooking

463
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:27,736
with the family;
I got fish to catch.

464
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:31,740
Lady Big Mike?

465
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,118
Everything's going
to be all right.

466
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:49,158
Answer all of our questions
with a "yes" or "no."

467
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,325
Okay.

468
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,760
Is your name Jill Roberts?

469
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,462
Yes.

470
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:58,400
Did you attend
Stanford University?

471
00:21:58,468 --> 00:21:59,535
Yes.

472
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:03,038
Can I ask a follow-up question?

473
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,206
You're about to leave
through that window.

474
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:05,707
I rescind my follow-up question.

475
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:07,910
Do you have a degree
in molecular biology?

476
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:08,544
Yes.

477
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:12,214
Are you a FULCRUM agent?

478
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:13,382
No. Wait...

479
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,517
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,586
Telling the truth is new to me.

481
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:19,721
Yes,

482
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:22,157
I am a FULCRUM agent.

483
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:25,127
Do you know the current
whereabouts of your FULCRUM

484
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:29,164
handler,
codename Leader?

485
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:30,766
Do you know the current

486
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,935
whereabouts of your FULCRUM handler...
- Yes.

487
00:22:33,002 --> 00:22:34,403
Give us the location now.

488
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,042
Tell me now or I lose my calm.
- Jill.

489
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,243
Jill, just tell, just tell him.

490
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,644
Please, just tell him.

491
00:22:42,712 --> 00:22:44,613
Okay, I'm not supposed
to know this,

492
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:46,381
but FULCRUM has
a mobile medical unit.

493
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,550
You'll find Leader recovering
in an office building

494
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,052
in downtown Los Angeles.

495
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,121
Is this a trap?

496
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:53,422
No.

497
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:00,863
What about Jill, Sarah?

498
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,297
I know what
you're thinking.

499
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:04,633
That Jill is the same person
that you went to school with,

500
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:06,468
and the same person
that you dated.

501
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:08,137
But we cannot
be certain.

502
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:11,006
Trust me, Chuck.
You can't trust her.

503
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,314
Is he setting a trap?
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:21,550
Good friend Jeffrey's been doing
this job for, give or take,

505
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:22,785
15 years.

506
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:24,353
This is his Thanksgiving
tradition.

507
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,654
Amazing.

508
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:26,855
How many traps
does he set?

509
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:28,657
Just the one trip wire,
it's kind of sad.

510
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:29,992
He tripped over it
last year.

511
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,794
Anyway, bon appétit,

512
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:33,796
buddy. Mmm.

513
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,233
Turkey in plastic? No, no.

514
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:39,501
Les, this is
all wrong.

515
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:40,669
This is not what
Thanksgiving's about.

516
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:41,737
This is pathetic.

517
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:43,438
Dude.
- What?

518
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,706
What else is there?

519
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:46,542
There's so much more.

520
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:48,644
Man, yeah, there's-there's fun,
and food, and friends.

521
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:50,312
And that's, that's just the Fs.

522
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,613
Where?

523
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,315
Out there.

524
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:58,353
Morgan, we can't leave.

525
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,191
Dude, what if I could
bring it back here?

526
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:04,259
A turkey.

527
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:05,327
We, we...
- No, not-not,

528
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:06,395
not like this.

529
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:08,530
A real turkey?
- Yes!

530
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:16,171
What do I have to do
to get this...

531
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,273
real turkey?

532
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:20,542
# #

533
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,311
Okay, motor's off.
Come on.

534
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,846
Dude, we
got to push harder here.

535
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:24,947
I'm trying.

536
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:26,048
I'm trying.
- Come on.

537
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:27,516
This is such a fire hazard.

538
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:28,684
Look, look, look.
- Okay, okay.

539
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:31,353
Hold, hold, you
got to hold it.

540
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:32,621
Ow!

541
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:34,490
Jeff!

542
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,724
Open the door, buddy.
Open the door.

543
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:36,625
Okay.

544
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:37,459
Oh, my Lord.

545
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,695
Jeff!
- Got it.

546
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:43,065
Okay, nice, Jeff.

547
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,600
Now can you
open the door

548
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,235
that is currently
chopping me in half?

549
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:48,370
Oops. My bad.

550
00:24:48,438 --> 00:24:50,272
Okay, just pull.
Just pull.

551
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:03,485
Did he make it?

552
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,374
Security breach at Buy More

553
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,976
location 2453.

554
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:30,212
Security breach at Buy More

555
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,048
location 2453.

556
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,418
T-time is 45 minutes.

557
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:37,886
What time are your parents
getting here?

558
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:39,354
Okay.

559
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:40,956
Mm-hmm.

560
00:25:41,024 --> 00:25:42,624
I love you, too.

561
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:43,792
Babe...
- Hmm?

562
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,894
I got some news.

563
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,763
My parents
can't make it.

564
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,667
Don't toy with my emotions
right now, Devon.

565
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,669
Honey, I wouldn't dare.

566
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:55,604
You're serious?

567
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:57,339
Yeah.
- Oh, that's great!

568
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,575
Oh, that's so great!

569
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,743
Oh, my God.
- Now can we just have some fun?

570
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,645
Yes!
- Listen to Chuck's stories.

571
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:05,514
Laugh at Morgan
as he o-faces

572
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:08,050
through his, his mashed
potatoes and stuffing.

573
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:10,052
Oh, no!

574
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,553
I uninvited Morgan.

575
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:12,788
He's like the one person

576
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:14,156
who loves this dinner
more than everyone.

577
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:21,396
Ah, man, some animals
got in the trash again.

578
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,670
Oh, what?

579
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:32,674
Well, I saw you
put it in the bag.

580
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:34,443
You know, and I figured
it was still gonna be good.

581
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,844
So I...

582
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:36,879
Okay.

583
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:40,048
Morgan, I'm so sorry

584
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:41,817
that I uninvited you
to Thanksgiving.

585
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:43,018
Please, please forgive me.

586
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:44,019
Forgive you?

587
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:45,454
Yeah, of course.

588
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,589
Yes, I understand.
I completely understand.

589
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:49,925
I mean, you've been so stressed
out with this whole thing

590
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:51,627
and, you know, with our
new boss at work

591
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,128
and this Chuck
and Jill thing

592
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,763
is like...
- What Chuck and Jill thing?

593
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:56,031
Hmm?

594
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:57,266
What Jill thing?
- I didn't say anything...

595
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,901
Morgan, you tell me
everything that you know.

596
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,369
Mm-hmm. Absolutely, I will.

597
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:02,137
Can I just get one
small favor?

598
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,872
I need to invite a
couple guests over.

599
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,877
Chuck?

600
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:12,381
Hey.

601
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:13,182
Hey.

602
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,891
I was just seeing
if you, you know,

603
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,626
if you needed a water
or something.

604
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:26,595
No, I'm good.

605
00:27:26,663 --> 00:27:28,497
Are Casey and Sarah ready
to start again?

606
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,466
Um, no.

607
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,034
No, not just yet.

608
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,570
But before they do,

609
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:38,006
I was wondering if I could
maybe ask you a few things.

610
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,108
Do you know how to work
all this stuff?

611
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:41,677
Yeah, totally.

612
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,645
I, uh, read the manual.

613
00:27:43,713 --> 00:27:45,280
You read a lie
detector manual?

614
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:48,283
No, this is the manual
for the entire Castle base.

615
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:51,253
Oh, you read a manual
for a base?

616
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:53,188
Well, you know, I mean, um...

617
00:27:54,357 --> 00:27:56,225
...I skimmed it.

618
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,796
Would you, uh,

619
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:02,764
would you mind if I ask you
a couple questions?

620
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:04,433
Go ahead.

621
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:17,913
Back at Stanford,

622
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:19,848
when we were dating,

623
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:22,417
was that for real?

624
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:24,219
Yes.

625
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,025
You really liked me?

626
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:31,760
Those were real emotions?

627
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:33,095
Yes.

628
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:40,335
Okay, then, well then
why did you sleep with Bryce

629
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:42,004
right after I got kicked
out of school?

630
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,006
Chuck, it has to be a "yes" or
"no" question or it won't work.

631
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:46,308
Did you love him, too?

632
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,644
No.

633
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:54,483
Great.

634
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:56,218
That's great.
That makes it even worse.

635
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:58,187
There's a question
you're not asking.

636
00:28:58,254 --> 00:29:00,989
It's right there, and
you're not asking it.

637
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,128
Did you sleep with Bryce?

638
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:07,830
No.

639
00:29:09,032 --> 00:29:10,632
I didn't.

640
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,317
Everyone freeze!

641
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:32,254
Take 'em all out of here.

642
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:33,822
Except this one on the table.

643
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,492
He's mine.

644
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,260
So you're telling me

645
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:41,430
that for the last six years
of my life

646
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:43,298
I've been believing
that you betrayed me.

647
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:44,733
Why would you do that?

648
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:46,568
When you got kicked
out of school,

649
00:29:46,636 --> 00:29:49,371
my FULCRUM advisor said
that I had to let you go.

650
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,606
Now you weren't
talking to Bryce,

651
00:29:50,673 --> 00:29:52,274
so that was the easiest
way to do it.

652
00:29:52,342 --> 00:29:53,976
I'm so sorry, Chuck.

653
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,678
I don't believe this.

654
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:59,348
FULCRUM told you to dump me?

655
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:01,016
I didn't have a choice.

656
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:05,687
I guess
in your defense,

657
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:07,990
when they told you to kill me,
you didn't do it.

658
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:10,559
So, I guess
that means something.

659
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:11,560
It does.

660
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:16,398
I never wanted to hurt you,
Chuck, ever.

661
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:20,002
You were my first love.

662
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:29,511
Do you think that
when this is all over,

663
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,547
we could try again?

664
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:33,449
Get me out of these.

665
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,625
Yes.

666
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:56,171
Chuck, we have Leader.

667
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:58,307
We're taking him back to Castle.

668
00:30:58,374 --> 00:31:00,075
Great. See you
when you get back.

669
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:06,115
I'm sorry, Chuck.

670
00:31:21,402 --> 00:31:22,603
Chuck?

671
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,538
Chuck, what's the matter?
- You promised

672
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,573
that you wouldn't hurt them.

673
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:29,543
Put the guns on the table,

674
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:31,445
take the cuffs off now.

675
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:32,346
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

676
00:31:32,414 --> 00:31:33,347
I let her out.

677
00:31:33,415 --> 00:31:34,381
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

678
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:55,736
Now, I believe we were headed
to a holding area.

679
00:31:55,804 --> 00:31:56,770
Show me the way.

680
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,684
Chuck, do what he says
and you'll be okay.

681
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,519
What about my friends?

682
00:32:12,587 --> 00:32:14,188
Just do what he says.

683
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:16,457
How could you do this, Jill?

684
00:32:16,524 --> 00:32:17,658
Chuck, it's complicated.

685
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,595
Listen, I know
complicated, okay?

686
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:22,930
How could <i>you</i> do this?

687
00:32:22,997 --> 00:32:25,065
You did

688
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,667
an excellent job, my dear.

689
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,374
Show him the access screen

690
00:32:34,442 --> 00:32:35,876
for the Joint
Intelligence Database.

691
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:38,245
Um, I'm sorry.
I don't know how to do that.

692
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:40,347
Do it now
or I'll kill your friends,

693
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:44,051
starting
with the blonde.

694
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:54,261
Thank you, Chuck.

695
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:57,231
This was all a trick, wasn't it?

696
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:58,499
I mean, you guys
just did all this

697
00:32:58,566 --> 00:32:59,967
just to get in here
and access our computer.

698
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:01,368
Y-You, you let her shoot you.

699
00:33:01,436 --> 00:33:03,003
Devious, aren't we?
Move him.

700
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:15,916
Oh, baby.

701
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,952
Jill, you're making
a big mistake.

702
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,055
I have to do
what he says, Chuck.

703
00:33:22,123 --> 00:33:23,690
Why? Why? What is
your boss searching for?

704
00:33:23,758 --> 00:33:24,858
I mean, what,

705
00:33:24,926 --> 00:33:26,527
what secret is worth this?
He's searching

706
00:33:26,594 --> 00:33:27,995
for someone.

707
00:33:28,062 --> 00:33:29,496
Who?
- Bryce Larkin.

708
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:32,933
Bryce?

709
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:34,368
Why are you looking for Bryce?

710
00:33:34,436 --> 00:33:35,335
Chuck, don't try
and protect him.

711
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:37,337
We know he's CIA.

712
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:39,573
He stole something from us.

713
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,478
They're looking
for the Intersect.

714
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:45,712
I'm sorry, Sarah.

715
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,514
I should have listened to you.

716
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:48,816
We'll figure something out.
- Actually,

717
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:50,184
I have a plan.

718
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:51,952
Hey,

719
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,287
what are you doing?

720
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:54,855
That's the Castle manual.
I told you that's

721
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,356
top secret.

722
00:33:56,424 --> 00:33:57,758
Yeah, I know.

723
00:33:57,826 --> 00:33:58,659
So am I.

724
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:13,140
Chuck.

725
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:16,610
What did you do?

726
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:19,480
Like I told Jill,
I read the manual.

727
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:21,548
What... did you do?

728
00:34:21,616 --> 00:34:23,183
Well, I locked you out
of the computer system

729
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:24,985
using the remote console
that every room

730
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:26,620
in Castle is
equipped with.

731
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,921
It's in the manual.

732
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:31,091
Unfortunately, said manual
is in here with me,

733
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,761
and since I overrode
Castle's primary controls,

734
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:36,697
we're now safely locked
within these bulletproof cells.

735
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:39,666
Devious, aren't I?

736
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:42,136
I'll make one call and my men
will be here in 20 minutes.

737
00:34:42,203 --> 00:34:43,704
I'm so glad you
brought that up

738
00:34:43,772 --> 00:34:46,740
because I also activated the
base's communications jammer,

739
00:34:46,808 --> 00:34:48,041
so no calls out--

740
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:49,376
sorry about that--

741
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:52,012
and because I triggered
the CIA's trouble alarm,

742
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,015
I think the cavalry's going
to be here in ten minutes or so.

743
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,550
The nerd in me

744
00:34:56,618 --> 00:35:00,254
really, really wants to say
"Checkmate" right about now.

745
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:01,789
Never say that.

746
00:35:01,856 --> 00:35:03,424
Why?
- Because you don't know

747
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:05,826
who you're playing against.

748
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:06,960
These cells

749
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:08,462
might be
bulletproof,

750
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,030
but they can't withstand that.

751
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:12,900
The blast will kill them,

752
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,601
but I'll bet
your cell will be fine.

753
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:16,236
Chuck, don't do anything.

754
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:18,005
Stay in that cell, Bartowski.

755
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:20,107
Jill?
- Just do what he says, Chuck.

756
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:21,442
Open the door

757
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:22,910
or your friends will die.

758
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:30,384
Good-bye, Mr. Bartowski.

759
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:31,485
W-W-W-W-Wait!

760
00:35:31,553 --> 00:35:33,253
Wait.

761
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,295
Now, show me the way
out of here.

762
00:35:42,664 --> 00:35:44,498
Jill, if you hurt him,
I swear...

763
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:10,290
It's a message
from Chuck.

764
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:40,487
# #

765
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:51,165
Drop it!

766
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,704
Sarah, don't hurt her!

767
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:18,992
Jill, Jill.

768
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,861
Hey, I can
help you.

769
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:22,262
Come with me.

770
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:25,566
Come on.

771
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:45,185
You thought
you were going to

772
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:46,220
take me down?

773
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:47,755
No, baby, I am!

774
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,940
I hate thieves.

775
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:09,610
Grimes put you in charge?

776
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:10,611
Yeah.

777
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:13,046
Smart boy.

778
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:14,715
<i>What's going on?</i>

779
00:38:14,783 --> 00:38:16,450
What are we doing?
- Look...

780
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:17,885
you're taking
the Matrix, okay?

781
00:38:17,952 --> 00:38:18,952
All-wheel drive,

782
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,654
touch screen navi,
iPod capability,

783
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:22,022
and a full tank of gas.

784
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,424
It's the perfect
getaway car.

785
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:25,626
Just get in
and drive as far as you can.

786
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:27,060
I won't call it in, I swear.

787
00:38:27,128 --> 00:38:29,329
Thank you.

788
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:33,400
Come with me.

789
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:34,768
We can still be together.

790
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:36,537
How?

791
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:37,538
Just you and me.

792
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:40,074
No secrets, no spies.

793
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:43,043
Come with me, Chuck.

794
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:44,778
No, I, I can't. I can't.

795
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:46,547
I... look,
obviously,

796
00:38:46,614 --> 00:38:49,450
there's the whole "opposites
attract" chemistry thing

797
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:51,251
that we have, and I, I...

798
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:54,621
it's just the-there's,
there's one small problem.

799
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:57,357
What are you doing, Chuck?

800
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,701
What's going on?
Don't do this to me, Chuck.

801
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:09,203
You should know
I wanted to help you.

802
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,572
I was going to
let you get away.

803
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,806
Chuck, no.

804
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:14,708
But when you were
about to kill Sarah,

805
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:16,610
you made the
decision for me.

806
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,379
You're under arrest, Jill,

807
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:20,981
and I'm
breaking up

808
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:21,982
with you.

809
00:39:35,403 --> 00:39:36,736
I'm sorry, Sarah.

810
00:39:36,804 --> 00:39:38,505
I should have listened
to you from the beginning.

811
00:39:38,572 --> 00:39:40,407
You were right: I wasn't
ready for this mission.

812
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:43,009
No one is ready for this type
of mission, Chuck.

813
00:39:43,077 --> 00:39:44,978
Your girlfriend
being FULCRUM

814
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:46,579
isn't something
they teach you in spy school.

815
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:47,547
I'm just too trusting.

816
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:49,082
Ever since I was a kid,

817
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,750
I really wanted to believe
what everybody always told me.

818
00:39:50,818 --> 00:39:52,052
You know?

819
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,586
I'm just getting used
to this new job--

820
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:55,055
all the spying and lying.

821
00:39:55,122 --> 00:39:56,323
Don't get used to it.

822
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,657
What makes you special

823
00:39:57,725 --> 00:39:59,426
is that you're not
like every other spy.

824
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:01,795
You're a good guy,
and you want to help people.

825
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:03,730
Leave the deception to me.

826
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,600
I'm glad I have you.

827
00:40:07,668 --> 00:40:10,437
# #

828
00:40:11,706 --> 00:40:13,573
Yeah, we're better as a team.

829
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:17,210
Oh, yeah.

830
00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:18,211
Happy Thanksgiving.

831
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:19,446
Can I borrow you?

832
00:40:19,513 --> 00:40:21,381
Sorry, I'm stealing
him real quick.

833
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:24,351
Are you absolutely certain
that Jill is not with Chuck?

834
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:26,653
Yeah, I mean, that's what
he, that's what he tol...

835
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:28,588
Why, you think that Chuck's
gonna break up with Sarah?

836
00:40:28,656 --> 00:40:30,557
Well, I hope not.

837
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:31,958
Yeah, me, too.

838
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:33,193
You know what
we need here?

839
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,427
What?
- Thanksgiving miracle.

840
00:40:34,495 --> 00:40:35,795
Yeah, y-y-yeah,
listen.

841
00:40:35,863 --> 00:40:37,097
Chuck and Sarah are gonna
walk through that door,

842
00:40:37,164 --> 00:40:38,765
they're going to be
as happy as can be,

843
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:40,000
and everything's
going to be fine.

844
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:43,236
Wow, good job, Morgan.

845
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:44,504
Hi.

846
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:45,872
I could have asked
for anything.

847
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,940
Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi.

848
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:48,141
Happy Thanksgiving.

849
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:53,680
Ellie, uh, do you, do you
realize that Lester and Jeff

850
00:40:53,748 --> 00:40:55,115
of the Nerd Herd
are at our table

851
00:40:55,182 --> 00:40:56,249
right now? Is
everything okay?

852
00:40:56,317 --> 00:40:57,984
Yes, well,
the Awesomes couldn't make it,

853
00:40:58,052 --> 00:40:59,319
so you know me--

854
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:01,354
just expand Thanksgiving.

855
00:41:01,422 --> 00:41:03,423
Okay.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

856
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:04,357
You, too.

857
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:05,425
Are you okay?

858
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:06,493
Of course, yeah.

859
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,761
Why, why do you ask?

860
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:12,132
Well, because Morgan told me
about you and Jill.

861
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,566
I'm sorry.
I just...

862
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:14,968
I was worried about you.

863
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:17,304
Um, no, yeah,
everything's good.

864
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:19,039
She wanted to see if
we could work it out

865
00:41:19,106 --> 00:41:21,207
and maybe give it a second try.
- And?

866
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:24,411
And I realized that Jill,
Stanford, and Bryce--

867
00:41:24,478 --> 00:41:25,578
that's the story
from my past.

868
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:29,950
But my new story is you
and Sarah and these...

869
00:41:30,017 --> 00:41:31,384
frigging yahoos.

870
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:32,752
And sometimes...

871
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,688
it can be a really fun story.

872
00:41:34,755 --> 00:41:36,156
Uh, Swedish
bikini team.

873
00:41:36,223 --> 00:41:37,490
Uh, DeLorean, flying DeLorean.

874
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:38,692
Hey, Morgan.

875
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:40,527
Come on, buddy.

876
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:42,996
So anyways, where was I?

877
00:41:43,064 --> 00:41:44,698
Yeah, you were saying how,
how the turkey gets made.

878
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:46,266
You were saying that
the turkeys volunteer.

879
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:48,068
No, they don't.
It's more of a draft.

880
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:52,005
Toast to, uh, some of the great,
uh, faces that I know

881
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:53,173
and some new ones
to Thanksgiving.

882
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,207
Yeah, we don't know
each other.

883
00:41:54,275 --> 00:41:55,742
Hear, hear.

884
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,178
Happy Thanksgiving.

885
00:41:58,245 --> 00:42:00,747
Great job, babe.

886
00:42:00,815 --> 00:42:02,983
Done, first, complete.

887
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,317
One, number one.

888
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:06,319
I have to carve the turkey.
Careful. Coming through.

889
