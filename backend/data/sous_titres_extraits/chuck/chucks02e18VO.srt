1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,934
Freeze! Drop him.

2
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,234
Take your masks off.

3
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:39,700
Do it!

4
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:46,201
Untie him.

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,201
Stay still.

6
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:50,867
Stay still, hold still,
hold still.

7
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,101
Man up, Charles.

8
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:54,000
Why would you do this to me?
Sorry, man,

9
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:55,367
it was a practice run

10
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:56,900
for when we kidnap Awesome
for his bachelor party.

11
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:59,034
You guys aren't even invited!

12
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:00,468
Right, right,
what finer way to be invited

13
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:01,700
than to kidnap
the guest of honor?

14
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:04,067
A bachelor party
is a mythical place

15
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:06,667
where booze
and women are free.

16
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,967
It's Xanadu.

17
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,633
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,101
Stop it!
Stop it!

19
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:18,633
You... stop it!

20
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,767
Okay, I'm going to bed.

21
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:21,834
What the heck?!

22
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,667
Chuck?

23
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:35,700
Bartowski?

24
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:38,367
General! Hey.

25
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,667
What are you, what are you...

26
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,267
I wanted a private word
with you.

27
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,633
Pardon the intrusion.

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,834
On this moment?

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,767
Or on my life in general?

30
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,767
I'd like to know if your
relationship with Agent Walker

31
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,800
is compromising
your job performance.

32
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,568
How do you mean?
What does that mean?

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,468
Has your situation
gotten too complicated?

34
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,934
What? With, with Sarah?

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,967
No, God, no.

36
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:00,867
No, Sarah Walker

37
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,234
is a pleasure to work with.

38
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:03,633
A delight, even.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,101
I want facts, I don't care
about your feelings.

40
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,733
What feelings?
These feelings:

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,733
Sarah, you want to go
on a date with me?
A real date?

42
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,434
Sarah, you're the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

43
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:15,134
I guess I wouldn't mind time
to sort out my feelings.

44
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,834
My mother's charm bracelet.

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,700
My dad gave it to her.

46
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,434
I'm crazy about you
and always have been.

47
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,633
My job is to make sure
you're protected

48
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,000
without interloping emotional
complications from my team.

49
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:30,434
We're going to have
to do a 49-B.

50
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:33,367
Okay, if you could just tell me
what a 49-B is

51
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:35,101
that would help...

52
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,633
Chuckster.

53
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,700
Time to flush out
your system, dude.

54
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,800
Oh. Oh, God.

55
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,201
No, I'm good
with my clog.

56
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:58,834
Hey, about your
bachelor party,

57
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,700
do you still want to do
that camping thing

58
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,501
or, uh, do you want to do
something more traditional,

59
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:03,834
or...?
Hey.

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,867
Chuck, uh, this came back
in the mail for you.

61
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,134
It's from Dad.

62
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:11,434
I'm so sorry, Ellie.

63
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:12,767
I'll keep searching.

64
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,667
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

65
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:15,967
You can't get disappointed

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,201
if you don't
have expectations, right?

67
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:22,101
So, um, I was overhearing
about the bachelor party.

68
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:25,101
For the record, I don't care
what you guys do,

69
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:26,834
because I trust you
completely.

70
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,468
Which is why
I'm marrying you.

71
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,301
What is that?

72
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:35,167
That is the taste
of a healthy colon.

73
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,733
Who's General Beckman?
What?

74
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,733
Video game stuff.
Yeah, it's video game stuff.

75
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,700
It's top-secret vide game stuff
that I-I, you know,

76
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:50,434
I'd be breaking all kinds
of rules to talk about it.

77
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,800
Morgan, huh?
Yeah.

78
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,167
So if Morgan's
General Beckman,

79
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,234
who are you?

80
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,234
Uh, well...

81
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:59,167
I am Special Agent Carmichael.

82
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:09,334
Carmichael. I like it.

83
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:18,267
Sarah. Hey, Sarah,

84
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:19,667
I messed up.
General Beckman,

85
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,401
she called me, asked me
about our relationship.

86
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:24,134
And, you know that conversation,

87
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,733
the one where I
might've maybe

88
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:26,900
mentioned
that I'm crazy about you.

89
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,201
Well, I tried to cover it,

90
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,501
but I'm not so sure
that she bought it.

91
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:40,733
Wha-- where's Sarah?

92
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,733
I'm Agent Alex Forrest.

93
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:43,967
General Beckman sent me.

94
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,067
I'm your 49-B.

96
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,867
For the chuck team

97
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,734
I'm sure you've all had a chance
to welcome Agent Alex Forrest.

98
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:29,867
Of course, General.

99
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,400
Then onto the matter at hand.

100
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:33,168
We're all familiar

101
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
with the elusive leader
of a terrorist group

102
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,534
who has been hiding in the
Afghani caves for years:

103
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,467
Hassan Khalid.

104
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,500
I dream of finding him.

105
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:46,168
A member of Khalid's
inner circle is this man:

106
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,134
Rashad Ahmad.

107
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,934
Ahmad is privy

108
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,934
to all of Khalid's
nefarious plans.

109
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:54,600
While on banking business
for Khalid in Los Angeles,

110
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,267
a man we believe to be Ahmad
had a heart attack.

111
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,767
He needs a pacemaker and
has checked into a hospital

112
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:02,267
under the pseudonym: Harry Lime.

113
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,400
You believe this
man to be Ahmad?

114
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,801
That is the mission.

115
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,200
Intelligence has only
been able to obtain

116
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,001
grainy satellite
images of Ahmad.

117
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,068
Mr. Bartowski, using his unique

118
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:14,267
skill set, must infiltrate
the hospital

119
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,434
to confirm Ahmad's identity.

120
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,667
Questions?
Sounds straightforward,
General.

121
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,534
Yeah, I have a question.

122
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,467
Yeah, I have a question.
Just a teeny little one.

123
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:24,567
What exactly is a 49-B?

124
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,934
Mind fielding that one,
Agent Walker?

125
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,634
Agent Forrest is here
to assess my performance.

126
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:31,300
And during
my evaluation period,

127
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:32,667
she will assume
the role

128
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:34,367
of the asset's handler.

129
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:35,534
Thank you.

130
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,834
That will be all.

131
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,767
What?

132
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,567
What is this all about?

133
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm sorry,

134
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:46,734
to discuss this further
would be a breach of protocol.

135
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:51,200
"To discuss this further
would be a breach of protocol"?

136
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,634
Is it possible that
someone kidnapped Sarah

137
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:53,934
and replaced her
with some kind of

138
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,667
soulless replica?
Let me guess.

139
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:57,233
You want to talk about
your feelings, Bartowski?

140
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,434
Please.
Wrong!

141
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,168
That's what got
the 49-B involved

142
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,734
in the first place.

143
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:05,001
How could...
Chuck.

144
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,001
All right, buddy, we are here
to plead our case

145
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:08,434
about Awesome's
bachelor party.
You know what?

146
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:10,233
Not now, guys, I'm right
in the middle of something.

147
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,534
The world revolves
around the sun,

148
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,701
Charles, not you.

149
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,834
Ooh, astronomy snap.

150
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,567
Okay. It's just that--

151
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,634
we just-- we'd like you
to reconsider.

152
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,667
Reconsider what?
You guys aren't even invited!

153
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,567
You tell him or I will.

154
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:28,767
Jeff and I...

155
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,534
we've never been
to a bachelor party.

156
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,967
Never known anyone

157
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,600
qualified enough to land
a woman for life.

158
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,500
So, please,
please.
Please, please.

159
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,267
Please...
No and no.

160
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,101
Okay,

161
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:40,734
how about this? As a plus,

162
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,300
since Big Mike
has been dating my mother,

163
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,534
he's made me lock up.

164
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
So, we can use this place
for the party,

165
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:47,267
save a little cash
and guess what?

166
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,634
Spend it on lady dancers.

167
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:50,634
Pow!

168
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:51,867
Lady dancers.
Pow.

169
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:54,767
Hey now. Hey now.

170
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,233
We're talking
serious...
The answer's no.

171
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,734
Hey...
Oh, please.

172
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:58,767
Don't-don't say no.

173
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,801
Say you'll wrap

174
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,734
your mind around it.

175
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:06,200
Hey, does the new girl know
about, uh...

176
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,567
No.

177
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,001
She won't know
that top secret information

178
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:10,634
unless her position
becomes permanent.

179
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,101
What, what do you
mean permanent?

180
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:13,667
It's not going to happen.

181
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,068
The 49-B will come in,
make her findings

182
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:19,101
and be on her way.

183
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:21,200
Hey, uh,

184
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,233
I'm sorry, Sarah.

185
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,068
For what?

186
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:27,101
I didn't mean to get you in
trouble at work 'cause I told

187
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:28,467
you my feelings.
I didn't know

188
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
I was being taped
that much.
No, it's fine.

189
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,001
Really.
I've just been kind of
stressed out lately.

190
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:33,300
You know,
I promised Ellie

191
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,034
that I'd find our dad
to walk her down the aisle,

192
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,300
but I've tried everything;
he's nowhere.

193
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,801
It's like he's fallen off
the face of the earth.

194
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:38,967
Hey, you've
got clearance.

195
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,801
You mind running my dad's name

196
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,434
through the big Castle computer?

197
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,534
That's impossible.

198
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,034
Damn right.

199
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:46,534
If Agent Walker

200
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,500
did that, not only
would she be fired

201
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:49,901
but potentially
face charges

202
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:51,834
of misappropriation
of government intelligence.

203
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Enough personal time.

204
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,867
We have work to do.

205
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,534
<i>The asset and I
will enter the facility,</i>

206
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,767
obtain uniforms
to assimilate and

207
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,634
attempt to confirm
Ahmad's identity.

208
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:05,701
Is there anything
I can do, Casey?

209
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:06,367
I got it.

210
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,267
Casey, uh, what is that?

211
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,068
You confirm Harry Lime is Ahmad,

212
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:14,233
I'll sneak into the hospital's
high-security area

213
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,333
where the equipment
and donor organs are kept.

214
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,068
Why? Aren't we just
gonna arrest him?

215
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:20,034
Don't underestimate
the gamesmanship

216
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:21,168
of the U.S.
Government.

217
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,534
Yeah, I'll place this

218
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,434
GLG-4000 inside
Ahmad's pacemaker

219
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,034
before it's implanted.

220
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:27,967
When he returns
to Hassan Khalid's secret cave,

221
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,101
he'll be a high-tech human bug.

222
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,200
Then not only will we know
the terrorists' secret location,

223
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,233
but we'll be one step ahead
of their plans.

224
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,701
Checkmate.
Checkmate.

225
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:39,734
Get the door.

226
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:44,734
Are you guys crazy?

227
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,400
I can't go in here.
This is the hospital

228
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:47,534
where Ellie and
Awesome work.

229
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:48,767
It's okay.
We checked their schedules.

230
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,001
Ellie's not working today.
Devon is

231
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:52,767
mid-surgery.

232
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,600
Hey,

233
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:55,867
you're here to observe.

234
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:57,233
Stay in the van, Walker.
That's an order.

235
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:08,600
And what were you little
kids doing in there?

236
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:11,168
A little hanky-panky?

237
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
What? Why?

238
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:14,467
Why would you do that?

239
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,001
Relax, I only tranqed her.

240
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:18,467
She'll be awake
six to eight hours.

241
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Now grab a leg.

242
00:10:32,168 --> 00:10:33,801
Oh, hey!

243
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,600
I didn't think you were on
call today, Dr. Bartowski.

244
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,801
Yeah, well, they keep
switching my shifts around.

245
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,801
See you.

246
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,300
You know, that grandma
was no threat to us.

247
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,168
I don't get why
you decided...
I don't decide.

248
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,233
Protocol dictates
my actions.

249
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,667
Chuck...

250
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:51,500
your sister is 30 feet
northeast of you.

251
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,333
Doctor...

252
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,367
Yeah?

253
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,467
You forgot your pen.
Oh.

254
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,134
Now or never.

255
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:07,134
See you.

256
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:28,867
It's him.

257
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:31,400
Are you his doctor?

258
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,134
Of course.

259
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:35,300
Am I not wearing
a doctor's coat?

260
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,901
Who else would I be if not
one of this man's doctors?

261
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:40,333
Doctor, I am Harry Lime's
private physician,

262
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,634
Dr. Mohammed Zamir.

263
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,200
Ah. Doctor.

264
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,434
Doctor.
Doctor.

265
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,934
Doctor.
And Doctor.

266
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:48,233
Nurse, would you excuse us

267
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:49,300
for a moment, please?

268
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,467
I'd like to consult

269
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:51,834
the doctor privately, please.

270
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:54,200
Yes, yes, we will be
discussing doctor things

271
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,534
that only doctors
understand.

272
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:56,667
Please go.

273
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:58,101
Please don't go.

274
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,200
Be right outside...
Doctor.

275
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:13,500
Major, what's your 20?

276
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,200
In position.

277
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,500
Identification affirmative.

278
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:17,500
Roger that.
Proceed.

279
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,233
Hey!

280
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:30,567
You!
Yeah?

281
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,434
Hysterectomy in 806
didn't make it to the toilet.

282
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:34,867
You mind?

283
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,801
You got it.

284
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,001
Well, heart sounds
appear to be normal.

285
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,534
For a patient with this type

286
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,667
of atypical
cardio-cardiac condition.

287
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,734
You should know
that this patient

288
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,300
is a very important man.

289
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,734
Well, I... I took an oath

290
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,967
to treat my first
patient with the same

291
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,101
kind of care
as every subsequent patient.

292
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:17,500
It's a very dangerous job

293
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,734
to be the surgeon
of a very important man.

294
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,667
You understand
my meaning, Doctor?

295
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:26,200
I'll do the best job
that I know how to do.

296
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:27,600
Your life depends on it.

297
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:32,934
If I have to eat
an apple a day

298
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:34,233
<i>to keep that
doctor away,</i>

299
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,034
then bring on
the fresh fruit.

300
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:38,134
Hey.

301
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:39,801
Security system
has been updated.

302
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,534
I'll either need 40 minutes
to decrypt the code

303
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,101
or four ounces of C-4.

304
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:44,367
Or you could just

305
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:45,901
take out some doctor
and steal his card key.

306
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:48,134
I like the cut of your jib.

307
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,801
Wow, you two are a match

308
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,967
made in a very frightening
part of Heaven.

309
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,567
Now, all we'll need
is some idiot doctor

310
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,068
with a key card to get us
into the restricted area.

311
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:05,834
No way.

312
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:08,134
No, no way,
absolutely not.

313
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:18,601
No, uh-uh, I am not getting
my soon-to-be brother-in-law

314
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:20,734
involved in a government
spy mission-- no way.

315
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:23,134
Fortunately, you,
like felons and children,

316
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,401
don't get a vote.

317
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,267
Is there a different doctor
we can access?

318
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
This mission does put Chuck's
cover close to the action,

319
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,300
risking potential
exposure.

320
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:32,000
And boom-- the words
I was thinking

321
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,601
just came out of
Sarah's mouth.

322
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:34,701
Connected professionally.

323
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,100
No time, Bartowski.

324
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:38,801
Only a couple docs
have that card key.

325
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,634
Your sister's Ken doll
is one of them.

326
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,234
Well, how are you going
to do that?

327
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,501
You can't just walk up
to Awesome and ask for it.

328
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:45,801
I'll handle things my way.

329
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,067
No, wait, wait, wait!

330
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,367
There will be no
tranqing... no tranqing.

331
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:49,701
I think I might know

332
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,033
how we can have our spy cake
and eat it, too.

333
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,801
What the...

334
00:14:57,701 --> 00:14:59,334
What are you doing?

335
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:04,033
Surprise!

336
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,601
You guys are awesome.

337
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:09,801
To the bachelor!

338
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:16,534
What are you doing?

339
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:17,634
Visual souvenirs, dude.

340
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,067
He does quite a bit
of scrapbooking.

341
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,300
You got to be kidding me.

342
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:21,367
Listen to me, guys.

343
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:22,701
What happens in the Buy More...

344
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:24,234
stays in the Buy More.

345
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,334
Oh, right.

346
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,701
Yes, no, I-I got it.

347
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:27,868
I'm... I'm sorry.

348
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,801
Bachelor
party virgin.

349
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:30,801
Lock it down.

350
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,267
Okay, okay.

351
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,567
Hey, hey, hey.

352
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,067
Uh... happy bachelor
party there, Captain.

353
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,567
Well, thanks
for all your help

354
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,100
throwing it,
General Beckman.

355
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,534
Nothing gets by me.

356
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:46,701
Okay.

357
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,967
Based on my observations,

358
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,467
Agent Walker is far too
emotionally entwined

359
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,768
with the asset.

360
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,634
Her decisions
weren't made

361
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:56,434
with respect to
established protocol.

362
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:57,701
She always places

363
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,634
the subject's feelings
above orders.

364
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,634
Is that your final assessment,
Agent Forrest?

365
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:02,701
It is.

366
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
Agent Walker.

367
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you for your dedication

368
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,000
to this mission.

369
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,033
General, please, I...

370
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,300
But as of right now,

371
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:14,167
your services
are officially terminated.

372
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:17,300
Report back to Langley at 0900.

373
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:26,200
Please take good care of him.

374
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,701
I'll do my job,
if that's what you mean.

375
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:32,667
Well, I'll be on my way

376
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,300
as soon as I say
good-bye to him.

377
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:37,067
I don't think so.

378
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,234
You've already done
enough damage here.

379
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:40,868
<i>Chuck's my
mission now.</i>

380
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,100
No further contact.

381
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,234
That's an order.

382
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,134
To finding the love
of your life.

383
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,834
Hey!

384
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,434
Happy bachelor party, my friend.

385
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:56,801
We got you half a dozen

386
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,067
five-dollar foot-longs
from Subway.

387
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,701
That's six feet
o' meat.

388
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,234
Five-- I ate a foot.

389
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,467
What is the
matter with you?

390
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:03,501
Thanks, boys.

391
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,434
Gonna be quite a tasty event.

392
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,033
Thank you.

393
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:09,834
Here we go, gentlemen.

394
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:11,200
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

395
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,334
He's going to be so drunk
when you steal his card key,

396
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,067
he won't even
notice.

397
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,234
No tranqing
necessary.

398
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,534
And how are we gonna
distract him?

399
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,501
Oh, I'm one step
ahead of you, my friend.

400
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:22,134
I had Jeff hire some
exotic female entertainment.

401
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:55,834
At least the sandwiches
are fresh.

402
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:56,900
Wait, Jeffrey.

403
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,734
Isn't that your sister?

404
00:17:58,801 --> 00:17:59,801
She gave us a deal.

405
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:07,801
Hello?

406
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:09,167
Hey, babe, it's me.

407
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,933
Chuck and the boys kidnapped me
for my bachelor party.

408
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,900
Wow, lucky you.

409
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,100
I am lucky, knowing
what's waiting

410
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,134
for me at home.

411
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,167
Hey... great party, huh?

412
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,734
That's very charming for a man
who's so close to temptation.

413
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,933
How could I
be tempted

414
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,634
by a hamburger
when I have steak at home?

415
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,067
Seriously, babe, I love you.

416
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,134
All right,
you've sucked up enough.

417
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,134
I trust you.

418
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,100
Have fun.

419
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,701
Thanks, honey.

420
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,367
Got Woodcomb's wallet,
but came up empty.

421
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:42,000
No card key.

422
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,401
Must still be around his neck.

423
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:45,768
We'll have to get it
another way.

424
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:46,801
Don't worry.

425
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:48,067
Got a backup plan.

426
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,401
You're still
here, Walker.

427
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:57,834
I thought I made
myself clear.

428
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,100
I'm just tying up
some loose ends.

429
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:04,801
Make it quick.

430
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:53,067
Freeze, boys.

431
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,234
You're all in trouble.

432
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,200
Five-O.

433
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:56,200
Got to flush my stash.

434
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,033
No, no, Jeff, no, this

435
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,267
is what you've
been waiting for.

436
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,601
This... is Xanadu.

437
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:28,933
I understand one of you
has been a naughty,

438
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,334
- naughty boy.
- Me... oh, my God, pick me.

439
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,734
I'm so bad, I've been bad,
I'm a bad person.

440
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,033
I'm a terrible person-- ouch.

441
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,601
I broke eight
and a half commandments

442
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,200
on the way to work
this morning.

443
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,200
This is your guy.

444
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,900
This is him.

445
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:46,501
I'm going to have
to strip-search you.

446
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,667
Uh, help.

447
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,501
No, no, no.

448
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:56,033
A little help here?

449
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,100
No, no, you're under arrest.

450
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,367
I can't help you.

451
00:20:58,401 --> 00:20:59,734
This is the law,
this is the law.

452
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:01,100
We're not going
to go against the law.

453
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,334
Be gentle with him.

454
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:03,933
Oh, my.

455
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,367
Are you kidding me?

456
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,801
Listen, I know the guys
probably put you up to this,

457
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,234
but we really don't have
to be alone in here.

458
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,200
Oh, my...

459
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:14,601
Wait... hey.

460
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,434
Why don't you just
take this off?

461
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:18,801
That way, nothing's going
to come between us.

462
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:19,900
I can't.

463
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,200
I lose it, I, uh... I get fired.

464
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,701
Uh, no, no, no, hold on.

465
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:27,734
Hold on, stop.

466
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:29,300
Stop.

467
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:30,734
I love my fiancée.

468
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:32,900
I would never do anything
to jeopardize that.

469
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,634
Guess romance is alive and well
and living in Burbank.

470
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,734
No, no, no!

471
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:49,367
I said no tranqing!

472
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,401
That is not
no tranqing!

473
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:54,933
Can't you keep
your stinking CIA darts

474
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,634
out of people?

475
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:59,033
Good work.

476
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,067
Now I can access the
restricted area and plant

477
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,367
the bug before
Ahmad's surgery.

478
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:03,834
Be sure and sell it
for the friends.

479
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,868
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
have I no rights?

480
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,000
You can't just go around
willy-nilly

481
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,701
knocking out my family members.

482
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:11,933
Looks like we can.

483
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,367
Sarah never would've done this.

484
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:14,768
You've gone too far.

485
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,667
Back off, Bartowski.
What are you gonna do about it?

486
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:18,367
I'm calling the General,
that's what.

487
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:20,000
Is that so?
No one's calling anyone.

488
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:21,501
Listen, this 49-B stuff is over.

489
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,801
From now on, the only person
I work with is Sarah.

490
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:25,534
Walker's gone;
she's been dismissed.

491
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:28,601
What?

492
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:30,868
What are you talking about?

493
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm your new handler.

494
00:23:08,968 --> 00:23:10,801
<i>With the use of Dr. Woodcomb's</i>

495
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:14,300
<i>card key, Major Casey entered
the hospital's restricted area</i>

496
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,934
and planted the GLG-4000
on Ahmad's pacemaker.

497
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,267
General Beckman?

498
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,200
One moment, Mr. Bartowski.

499
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:21,300
Turn up the volume.

500
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:28,901
That is the sound of success.

501
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,667
General?

502
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:33,334
Soon Ahmad and his men
will be on their way back

503
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,834
to Khalid's Afghani hideout,

504
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:37,200
and we can begin our covert
surveillance in earnest.

505
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:39,300
General, look,
I understand that this is

506
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:40,834
an important mission, I do.
But what about Sarah?

507
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,300
How can she be gone
just like that?

508
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,934
It's the way
it is, Bartowski.

509
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:46,133
No, why didn't you tell me that
this could happen with a 49-B?!

510
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,534
I was under the
impression that

511
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,200
Agent Forrest was here
just to evaluate Sarah.

512
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:50,200
You lied to me!

513
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:51,501
Come on, it's a job, Chuck.

514
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,234
No, for you, it's a job.

515
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,167
For me, it's my life.

516
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,701
We disclosed everything
that was pertinent to you.

517
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:01,467
That's the way the National
Security Agency operates.

518
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,434
Get used to it.

519
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:07,367
I'm gonna go
clean my weapons.

520
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,667
When it comes to security,

521
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:15,701
one can never be too cautious.

522
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:24,534
Who is Rashad's doctor?!

523
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:29,901
One of the surgeons
put a bug inside him.

524
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:32,567
Dr. Devon Woodcomb.

525
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:40,400
You two go bring me the doctor.

526
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:41,701
When the doctor
woke up this morning,

527
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,334
he didn't know that today...

528
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,734
I'm gonna die.

529
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:48,467
Oh, my God,

530
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,133
I'm going to die.
I would love to

531
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,701
feel sorry for you, honey,
but I think you kind of

532
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:52,701
brought this one on yourself.

533
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:53,834
How'd I get so wasted?

534
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:54,968
I don't remember a thing.

535
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:56,200
Well, you drank a little bit,

536
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:57,534
you cut loose,

537
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:59,234
no harm done.
I remember

538
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,000
our lovely neighbor, John Casey,

539
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:02,801
carrying you home
at 4:00 in the morning,

540
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:04,834
smelling like booze
and cheap hairspray.

541
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:06,634
Does that ring
a bell for you?

542
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,234
Honey, I mean, please
don't say the word bell.

543
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,601
Honey?
Huh?

544
00:26:14,634 --> 00:26:16,934
Did I have my key card
on me last night?

545
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,300
What?

546
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:21,501
Did you take my key card
off me or not?

547
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:22,934
No, I didn't take
your key card off.

548
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:24,400
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

549
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:25,868
Oh, God.

550
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:26,667
It's always around your neck,
under your shirt.

551
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,601
Whdid your shirt come off?

552
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:33,901
Well, do you want to tell me
if your pants stayed on?!

553
00:26:33,934 --> 00:26:37,467
Ellie, please, will you just
help me look for the key card?

554
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:39,133
Guys, guys, it'll turn up,

555
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,434
I just know it.

556
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,701
You know, I'm, I'm really sorry

557
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:42,734
that you don't remember

558
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,000
what happened last night.

559
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:46,200
I hope whatever it was,
it was worth it.

560
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,834
Dude, I wish I had a do-over

561
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:52,100
for last night.

562
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:53,334
I'd take it all back.

563
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:02,834
Can you believe Walker?

564
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:04,300
What about her?

565
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,100
Getting all wrapped up
in the asset?

566
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:09,334
Clearly her feelings have
jeopardized your missions.

567
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,801
You must be relieved
that she's gone.

568
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:13,934
Things can now finally
be professional.

569
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,634
Agent Forrest,

570
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:16,734
for the record...

571
00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:21,634
Either something's wrong
with our equipment...

572
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:22,868
Or something's wrong with Ahmad.

573
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:26,033
Hey, Casey, it's me.

574
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,300
Look, uh, we got to get Awesome
his key card back

575
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:29,701
or he's going to be
in big trouble.

576
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:31,701
We must find this
doctor at once.

577
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:37,434
Which one is
his apartment?

578
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,267
What are we going to
do with the doctor?

579
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,100
That is up to the boss.

580
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:46,601
Awesome, Awesome.

581
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,734
Hi, I'm Dr. Woodcomb, can...?

582
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,434
Government issue.

583
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:26,434
Doesn't make any...

584
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:27,567
This...

585
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:31,167
Oh, my God,
it smells like Heaven.

586
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,100
Okay, that means either someone
is baking sugar cookies

587
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:34,734
or that is...

588
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,534
I need to ask you a favor.

589
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,067
Anything, anything--
you can have my firstborn.

590
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:45,100
I need to know
what happened last night

591
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:47,033
at Devon's bachelor party.

592
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:48,667
Come on, El, you
can't ask me that.

593
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:50,200
There's a bro code.

594
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:52,067
Please, Morgan.

595
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,701
I'm sorry, I can't.

596
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,701
I have to lock it down.

597
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,634
I just-- that's what I--
but listen to me, I...

598
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,067
Oh, my God.

599
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,634
I know.

600
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:10,767
Can you believe our
first bachelor party was

601
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:11,667
so freaking awes--?

602
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,834
Ellie.

603
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:18,000
Wait,
wait, wait,

604
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:20,801
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie,
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie,

605
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:21,868
Elizabeth, Eleanor, Elton.

606
00:29:59,033 --> 00:29:59,934
Got nothing.

607
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:02,067
Me neither.

608
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,367
Casey.

609
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,334
I can't get in.
I don't have access.

610
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,567
She's off the assignment.

611
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:07,567
Look,

612
00:30:07,634 --> 00:30:09,634
I think Chuck's in trouble.

613
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,334
He never goes anywhere
without his phone.

614
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,901
She's right.

615
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:15,501
Now, Forrest, what I was
going to say earlier--

616
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:17,234
I disagree
with your assessment.

617
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,300
About what?

618
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:19,300
Walker.

619
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,234
She's a pro.

620
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:23,434
Not only that, she's the best
damn partner I ever had.

621
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:30,367
I found this when I went
to say good-bye

622
00:30:30,434 --> 00:30:31,767
to Chuck.

623
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,801
Which directly
disobeyed an order.

624
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,067
You were fired

625
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,601
for exactly
this reason.

626
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,667
Then there's nothing stopping
me from kicking your ass.

627
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:46,400
Chuck's in the courtyard.

628
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:47,767
He's fine.

629
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:00,267
We lost the surveillance
signal from Ahmad's heart.

630
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,634
Got to be a
connection

631
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,701
between the signal's
disappearance and Chuck's.

632
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:03,834
I don't understand.

633
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:05,968
Isn't the GLG4000
specifically designed

634
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,133
to track deep inside
the Afghani caves?
Yeah.

635
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,434
You'd need at least six feet
of solid steel

636
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,534
to block that signal.

637
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:15,467
This is the last location
his heart registered

638
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,067
before going off-grid.

639
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,801
Overlay the satellite image.

640
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:22,601
Wait a minute.

641
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,767
They're in a
bank vault.
Yeah,

642
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:29,033
that would do it.
Great work, Walker.

643
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay, Dr. Woodcomb,

644
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,834
time for you
to remove the bug

645
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:47,601
you placed inside my friend.

646
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,300
And if you don't
save him,

647
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:52,167
nothing can save you.

648
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,934
The patient
is now fully under.

649
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:01,600
Cool.

650
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:02,600
Cool, good, good.

651
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:03,701
Well done there.

652
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:04,834
That's how we do things.

653
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:06,901
I'm going to need
to take a minute

654
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,600
just so that I
can center myself,

655
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,233
if you will.

656
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,434
I, uh,

657
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,467
need a mellow headspace
when I operate.

658
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:15,200
Quit stalling, Dr. Woodcomb.

659
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,068
I'm a little out of
practice, honestly.

660
00:32:29,101 --> 00:32:31,200
Maybe if you could do it.
Cut him open...

661
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:32,233
<i>or I'll cut you open.</i>

662
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,168
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
I'm bleeding!

663
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:39,001
Oh, my God,
I'm bleeding.
Come on.

664
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:42,400
I'm sorry, I just get a little
woozy at the sight of blood.

665
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:44,600
A surgeon who is afraid
of blood?

666
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:46,467
I know-- a little ironic, right?

667
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,634
Get the door,
get the door!

668
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:52,267
Get the door!

669
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:04,901
Who the hell is Chuck?
Huh? Chuck... Chuck?

670
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:06,267
No clue... I have no clue.

671
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,901
I'm Dr...
I am Dr. Woodcomb, okay?

672
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:09,267
Oh, yeah?
Or Devon or Doc.

673
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,567
Or sometimes people
call me Captain Awesome,

674
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,001
but I have no idea who this...

675
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:13,200
who this Chuck...

676
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:14,901
<i>Oh, you mean that Chuck.</i>

677
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:16,134
You're a dead man, Chuck.

678
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,367
Now Chuck is
locked inside

679
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:23,567
with one of Interpol's
most wanted.

680
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,567
It is your job
to protect him, damn it.

681
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,200
I've got nitroglycerin

682
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:32,767
and a blasting cap
in the van.

683
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:34,233
I'll have this door off
in no time.

684
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,101
Hold on, I think I saw
a nitrous setup in there.

685
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:38,367
You're gonna blast
the door open,

686
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:39,667
are you're gonna kill Chuck
in the process.

687
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:41,901
Come on, come on!

688
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,500
What makes you think
he's not already dead?

689
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:45,967
Come here!

690
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:17,333
What?

691
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:19,034
What... what is it?

692
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,634
I forgot why I was mad at you.

693
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:33,068
I was gonna cut you with this.

694
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:37,567
That's odd.

695
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:39,634
I think I hear Chuck laughing.

696
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:40,834
Here, give me
the walkie.

697
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:42,600
I'll handle it.

698
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:47,834
You're lying.

699
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:48,867
No, I'm not.

700
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:50,367
Think about it.

701
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:53,101
Ladybugs can't
all be ladies.

702
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:55,634
I mean, that's
just crazy.

703
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,267
Then, how would we get
little ladybugs?

704
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,567
You know
what I mean?

705
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,434
Chuck, can you hear me?

706
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,534
Hey, your
pocket's talking.

707
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,734
Oh, hey, can
I get that?

708
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,200
Yeah.

709
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,434
Hi.
Hi.

710
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,367
Hi, yeah, I'm fine.

711
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,667
I'm fine.

712
00:35:08,701 --> 00:35:11,367
I'm... I'm also
high from nitrous,

713
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,101
but so is... so is my
man, Zamir, here, so...

714
00:35:15,134 --> 00:35:17,034
But I'm not coming out
until you find Sarah

715
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:18,934
and you bring
her back here.
That's right.

716
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:20,467
Stand your ground.

717
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:21,901
Like Hassan Khalid.

718
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:26,134
Hey, where is
that guy, anyway?

719
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,934
'Cause I haven't seen
him around in a while.

720
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:30,834
He's in the Eastern

721
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:32,034
Karakoram caves.

722
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,034
All right.

723
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:39,168
Good for him.

724
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:42,600
He's a bad dude, huh?

725
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:45,333
Hey, Chuck,
turn off the gas, idiot.

726
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,168
You inhale too much
of that stuff, it'll kill you.

727
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:49,333
We're going to die.

728
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,168
You're gonna die!

729
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,467
Open this door
right now.

730
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:59,300
No, look,

731
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:01,068
I'm not listening to you, okay?

732
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:02,333
This isn't working.

733
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,767
I can't risk this
going any further.

734
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:05,068
I'm getting the nitro.

735
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:06,901
Forrest, we can
do this your way,

736
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:07,901
or we can
actually save

737
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,333
the asset.

738
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,467
Here.
Sarah.

739
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:32,434
Is it really you,

740
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,134
or am I
super stoned?

741
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:35,500
Uh, both.

742
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:42,567
Both Rashad Ahmad
and Dr. Zamir are in custody.

743
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:45,067
Though the mission didn't go
according to plan,

744
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,234
Chuck was able to ascertain the
hidden location of terrorist,

745
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,501
Hassan Khalid.

746
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,501
Thank you, Agent Forrest.

747
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:52,667
Just doing my
job, General.

748
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,200
Agent Walker,

749
00:36:57,234 --> 00:36:59,400
despite your heroism,

750
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,133
you have directly disobeyed
several orders.

751
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,267
Wait, General.

752
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:04,734
I'm sorry, but-but...
isn't the most

753
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,868
important part
of being my handler making sure

754
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,434
that I stay
alive?
It's okay, Chuck.

755
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:09,834
No, it's not.

756
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,701
Let him finish.

757
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,367
Thanks.

758
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,334
Um... General...

759
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,334
what I'm trying
to say is that...

760
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,234
I think that maybe because my
relationship with Sarah is so...

761
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:32,367
You know, we're...
we're close.

762
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,534
We care about
each other.

763
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:34,868
That's what I'm
trying to say,

764
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:37,367
and I know it's not
protocol or whatever,

765
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,767
but it's those feelings
that wound up saving my life.

766
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:46,267
Agent Forrest diagnosed

767
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,601
your emotional connection
as a liability.

768
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:52,467
But I suppose
it can also be an asset

769
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:54,133
to the...

770
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,234
well, asset.

771
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,000
You may resume your post,
Agent Walker.

772
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,934
We hope not to see you too soon,

773
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:02,234
Agent Forrest.

774
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:05,567
That's all.

775
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,067
no, this isn't...
this isn't what you think.

776
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:27,601
Yes, it is, Chuck.

777
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:29,434
It's exactly what I think it is.

778
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:31,634
I can't believe that you
are covering for him.

779
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,334
Nothing happened
at the bachelor party.

780
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:34,901
He didn't do anything,
I swear it.

781
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:36,901
Chuck, I saw the photos, okay?

782
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:40,601
I'm sorry.

783
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,200
I know you're just trying
to protect him.

784
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:43,467
Bro code, whatever,

785
00:38:43,534 --> 00:38:45,033
but, Chuck, Iam your sister.

786
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,601
You're supposed to protect me.

787
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,400
Sarah, please,
I am freaking out, okay?

788
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:01,801
I don't know
who else to talk to,

789
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:03,934
but I also don't want to get you
in more trouble at work.

790
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,300
It's okay-- this is
my private residence.

791
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:06,801
There is no surveillance
that can talk to me.

792
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:08,033
I don't know
what to do.

793
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:09,501
Ever since you guys
rolled into town,

794
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:12,400
my life has been... has been
spinning out of control.

795
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:14,133
My whole world
is about juggling lies.

796
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,200
It's like...

797
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:16,367
it's like this.

798
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:18,234
I bet this is a...
what, a submachine gun?

799
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,901
No, it dries
my hair.

800
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Okay, fine, but everything else
is completely screwed up.

801
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:33,634
I just want to be able
to tell Ellie the truth

802
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:36,033
about who I am and what I do.

803
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,200
I can't believe how much

804
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:43,534
the United States Government
has hurt the people that I love.

805
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:46,801
Well, maybe it's time

806
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:49,234
for the United States Government
to help you.

807
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,968
Chuck, you saved my life, man.

808
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,701
Thanks for finding my key card.

809
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:09,634
Dude?

810
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:12,968
Special Agent Carmichael.

811
00:40:22,234 --> 00:40:24,267
Nah.

812
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:45,133
Well, you, uh...

813
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:48,434
probably had to break
a few rules, huh?

814
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:51,601
Go on, knock.

815
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:57,200
I couldn't find him.

816
00:40:57,267 --> 00:41:00,400
The man didn't want
to be found.

817
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:01,868
I mean...

818
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:04,400
you had to illegally
access the government's

819
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:06,501
master database to...

820
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:07,434
Chuck.

821
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:10,701
It will be good to see him.
