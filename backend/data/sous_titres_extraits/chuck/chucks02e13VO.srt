1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,717
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,017
You've been selected for
an elite operations unit.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,977
With your permission,
we'd like to conduct a test

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,177
to determine your
suitability for service.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,093
Sure. You mind me asking
what you're testing me for?

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,623
Just relax.

7
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:16,807
We have a short training video
that will explain everything.

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,520
Wait.

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,375
Are you okay, Chuck?

10
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,792
{\pos(192,240)}Oh, um... no, no.

11
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,745
{\pos(192,240)}Not since Emmett started
playing romantic comedies 24/7.

12
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,645
{\pos(192,240)}He must love Must Love Dogs,
'cause that's always playing.

13
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:42,932
{\pos(192,240)}Right.

14
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:46,145
- {\pos(192,240)}I was just wondering about tonight.
- Is there a mission tonight?

15
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,362
Actually, I was referring

16
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:50,132
to the whole Valentine's Day thing.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,651
Oh, my gosh, right.

18
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:53,594
I'm so sorry... did you
want to do something?

19
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,232
No, no, I was just curious.

20
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:56,931
<i>Unless you wanted to do something?</i>

21
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:00,012
Doesn't it seem like we
ought to do something?

22
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:01,832
- I mean, it's up to you.
- Yeah, sure.

23
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,354
We have been cover dating

24
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,975
for over a year now, right?

25
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,108
It would be
weird if we didn't do something.

26
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,275
Completely weird.

27
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,364
Maybe we could give our
covers the night off.

28
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:16,545
I have a bunch of paperwork
to catch up on anyway.

29
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:17,618
Good. Great.

30
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,315
Happy Valentine's Day, you two.

31
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:20,955
Any hot plans for today?

32
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,126
Absolutely, there is.

33
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:28,713
My house at 8:00, right?

34
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:30,840
I can hardly wait.

35
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,342
- I'll see you then, sweetie.
- Oh, okay.

36
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,457
Bye.

37
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,372
Did you ever think that the two of us
would wind up with smart, beautiful,

38
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,560
sexually adventuresome
girls on Valentine's Day?

39
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,853
The answer is no.

40
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,232
Two jackasses like you

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,532
landing two hot pieces
like Anna and Blondie?

42
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,358
It's a cruel trick of nature.

43
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,026
Get your butt to the sales floor

44
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,528
before I kick it over there.

45
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,821
Bartowski,

46
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,239
herd up your nerds.

47
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,295
They're right...
they're right there.

48
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,036
And you two dimwits,
don't leave the cage until that backlog

49
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,638
of repairs are finished.

50
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:03,873
And where is Milbarge?

51
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,200
Hello.

52
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,128
Sorry I'm late... I was
just waiting for these to cool.

53
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,888
What the hell is that?

54
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,977
I put little lips
on the cupcakes for you.

55
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,925
I'm talking about that
thing on your head.

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,447
Well, Henrietta's in town.

57
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,138
I wanted to look my best.

58
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,100
I mean, it's not that
much of a difference.

59
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,185
Really?

60
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,854
I'll be in my office.

61
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,200
Next time, do your
baking on your own time.

62
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,446
My God, who crapped in
his box of chocolates?

63
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,930
I don't care what it costs!
Get it here tomorrow!

64
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,017
What's he doing in there?

65
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,630
I don't know, but it's
completely unnatural.

66
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,128
Oh, my God.
You don't think that he's...

67
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,307
Working calm down, Morgan.

68
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,424
There's got to be
a rational explanation for this.

69
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,087
Oh, no, look at him.

70
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,427
The guy's a machine.

71
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,187
I think Morgan's on to something.

72
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,017
What if it's not really Big Mike?

73
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,247
What?

74
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,217
Like, a robot sent from the future?

75
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,787
A cybernetic organism.

76
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,887
A skin job.

77
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,747
There's only one way to find out.

78
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,417
If he bleeds, he's human.

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,687
Guys.

80
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,300
How about I just talk to him?

81
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,047
Please.

82
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,487
Okay, fine.

83
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,485
It's your funeral, Bartowski.

84
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,535
Let me ask a question.

85
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:30,816
What kind of woman
delivers divorce papers

86
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,202
on Valentine's Day?

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,673
- Your... your wife?
- The lady Big Mike is no more.

88
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,187
I'm-I'm so sorry to hear that, sir.

89
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,947
Damn straight.

90
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,221
I had the catch of a
lifetime and let her get away.

91
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,730
You want to talk about it?

92
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,447
I'll be fine.

93
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,447
Long as I keep working,
I won't have time

94
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,437
to realize I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life

95
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,940
alone and unloved.

96
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,110
There is one thing
you can do for me.

97
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,630
Sure.

98
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,448
Tell those imbeciles out
there to get cracking!

99
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,117
'Cause from now on,

100
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,778
it's a whole new Buy More!

101
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,630
<i>Get that damn
Must Love Dogs off the TV.</i>

102
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:24,271
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

103
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:26,390
This is the worst
Valentine's Day ever, right?

104
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,393
- Come on, don't be silly.
- Please, you're not going to offend me.

105
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:31,617
There's got to be someone somewhere

106
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,981
having a far worse Valentine's Day.

107
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,387
<i>On the night of August 12, 1965,</i>

108
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,130
<i>the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines</i>

109
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,400
<i>endeavored to make a
daring helicopter assault</i>

110
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:43,657
<i>on the Elephant Valley.</i>

111
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,869
<i>- I hope I'm not interrupting.</i>
- What can I do for you, General?

112
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:51,547
LAPD just picked up one of ours.

113
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,044
The agent's name is Jim Yeager.
He's been missing for over a year,

114
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,755
although he was presumed to be
on a covert domestic assignment.

115
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,417
Unfortunately, we have no
record of this assignment,

116
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,817
and so far, the subject has been...

117
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,844
uncooperative.

118
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,847
Cat's got his tongue, huh?
You want me to take a crack at him?

119
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,268
As you can see, his mental
state is fragile enough already.

120
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,305
The subject's last confirmed
location comes from a phone call

121
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:17,466
traced to this LA cul-de-sac.

122
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:19,050
Yeager was living in the Valley?

123
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:20,943
No wonder he went nuts, right?

124
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:22,946
We took the liberty of
purchasing a home there

125
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,698
to serve as a base of operations.

126
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,742
Zoom in on that, please.

127
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:32,713
- What's that he keeps saying?
- Salamander.

128
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:35,000
Possible code name
for his enemy contact.

129
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,478
Our best guess:
he chose this location

130
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:39,440
for its proximity to a sleeper cell.

131
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,190
I need for someone to
resume Yeager's assignment,

132
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:43,670
identify his contact

133
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:45,636
and infiltrate
their terrorist network.

134
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,322
I don't know how well I'd fit
in with those people, General.

135
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,349
Not you, Major Casey.

136
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,101
We need a normal couple.

137
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,982
- That Casey?
- Looks like we got a mission.

138
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,673
Thank God.

139
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,240
I'm afraid you two are gonna
have to drop your dating cover

140
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:08,860
- for this particular assignment.
- No problem. What is it?

141
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,790
Thai street racing gang, a
Ukrainian prostitution ring?

142
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:14,183
No, for this mission,
you and Agent Walker

143
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,813
are gonna be married.

144
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,257
You two kids are going
to the suburbs.

145
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:25,092
Good luck as a normal couple.

00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:23,860
- Love what you've done with the place.
- Thanks... I had help.

173
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:26,360
Uh, sorry, but whose
life have I stepped into?

174
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:27,900
What-What...

175
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,248
What are you doing?

176
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,696
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm making potato salad.

177
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,845
Are you cooking for
the entire neighborhood?

178
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:37,960
- No, Chuck.
- You are.

179
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:39,813
Hey, there's the grill-meister!

180
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,930
Welcome, neighbors.

181
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:46,084
Don't forget, one of our new neighbors
is a suspected terrorist.

182
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,381
You heard the little lady.
Get out there and mingle.

183
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,143
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

184
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,725
I think that I speak
for all of us when I say

185
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,064
that the only reason that I
took this job at the Buy More

186
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,890
was to do as little
work as humanly possible.

187
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,233
And the big man... he
made that dream a reality.

188
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,760
That man's an inspiration
to slackers everywhere.

189
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,612
Until his old lady dumped him.

190
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,890
We're screwed...

191
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:17,013
now that he has nothing to
live for except for work.

192
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:19,830
Yeah, but how do we get Mrs.
Big Mike to take him back?

193
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,430
How do you mend a broken heart?

194
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:23,330
You mean, how do we get him laid?

195
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:27,060
I'm sorry to interrupt this
little meeting of the minds,

196
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,590
but you're not the only ones

197
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:30,613
who find
this new regime insufferable.

198
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:32,506
It's obvious that our rotund leader

199
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,509
is channeling his sexual
energies into the Buy More.

200
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,191
- In my opinion, our only hope...
- Is to channel them back into sex.

201
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,295
Yes brillant Emmet,
but where do we find

202
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,567
Big Mike a ridiculously
out of his league hottie?

203
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,030
Someone who will suck his...

204
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:46,543
- will to work out of him.
- Not at a Bennigans's bar.

205
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,772
Sometimes, that fruit
hangs a little too low.

1
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,109
<i>Where do you meet people you
don't have to pay for sex?</i>

2
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,533
Welcome to the neighborhood.

3
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,630
Oh...

4
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:02,559
- Hi.
- How you doing?

5
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,430
I'm good. I'm...
My name is Charles.

6
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:05,513
Oh, I'm Brad.

7
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,499
I live next door. There you go.

8
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,127
I'm so sorry.
I just ran out.

9
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,090
Lucky for you,
I'm in the stationery biz.

10
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,330
Check this baby out.

11
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:16,216
It is 110 pound card stock,
brand-new,

12
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,759
genuine embossing,

13
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,180
antique finish.

14
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:22,160
Listen, don't let any
of these bums know,

15
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:24,224
but I can get you a
thousand of those at cost.

16
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,199
Enough shoptalk.
Let's go meet some of the natives.

17
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:28,860
- What do you say?
- Okay.

18
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,260
Guys, this is Charlie.

19
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:32,443
Uh, Charlie, over here we got Mark.

20
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,151
Hi. Hi. Whatever you do,

21
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,028
do not let him drive your golf cart.

22
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,948
We got Dennis here.
Uh, Dennis and his wife,

23
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,827
Trudy, every Friday night, they play
a pretty wild game of charades.

24
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,318
It gets pretty zany.

25
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,873
And this one, last but least, Mitch.
Do not believe a word this dog says.

26
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:56,340
Hold on a minute.
Who is that talking to my wife?

27
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,030
Oh, that's-that's my wife.

28
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:02,304
That's Sarah.

29
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,224
Well...

30
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,573
Well done, Charlie.

31
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,773
You want to trade sometime?

32
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:17,673
I'm kidding!

33
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:20,190
No way the PTA would stand for that.

34
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,830
All right, just a few more details
and you will be ready

35
00:12:22,913 --> 00:12:24,730
to mingle with the singles.

36
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:26,643
Who the hell is
this Lando Calrissian?

37
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,289
He's only the coolest guy
in the entire universe.

38
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,530
- It's just your user name.
- Six-two, 185 pounds?

39
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,387
I don't know, Morgan. Listen to me.

40
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,613
Everybody is taller
and thinner online.

41
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,156
It's called the Internet
hotness conversion factor.

42
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,675
What do you want your job to be?

43
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,343
Uh, manager at the Buy More.

44
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,460
Make him an astronaut.

45
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:47,557
What about lion tamer?
Wait, I got it. I got it.

46
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,060
I just don't know about this whole
World Wide Web business.

47
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:53,960
That ain't no way to meet a woman.
You know how I met my wife?

48
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:55,060
Church picnic.

49
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:56,460
Look how that worked out.

50
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:00,230
There was no hiding who
you were or-or how you felt.

51
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,860
The very first time

52
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:04,460
I laid my eyes on Gladys, I knew.

53
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:05,790
Good Lord.

54
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:06,790
Who are they?

55
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,130
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

56
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:09,760
Users who matched your profile.

57
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:11,173
This ain't no church picnic.

58
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:13,290
Check out Red Hot Mama.

59
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,243
<i>Muy caliente.</i>

60
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,730
What about the Internet
hotness conversion factor?

61
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,089
Doesn't that work both ways?

62
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,799
Why can't you see her
face in that picture?

63
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,830
Focus on the body, Michael.

64
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,160
Gee whiz, Mike.

65
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:26,413
We're trying
to help you find love here.

66
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,860
Dirty, nasty, filthy love.

67
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,860
So, then the Greek guy says,

68
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:33,913
"Well, at least we know
where the olive went."

69
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:45,043
My sentiments exactly.

70
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:50,930
Can I let you in on little a secret

71
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,330
about your neighbors, Mr...?

72
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,190
Carmichael. Charles.

73
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:56,230
They bore me.

74
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:57,590
Oh, yeah?

75
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:58,873
Yeah, it's, uh...

76
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,973
it's not really my scene either.

77
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:05,043
Perhaps the two of us can,
uh, get together sometime.

78
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:07,260
Maybe engage in
something a little more...

79
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,960
stimulating?

80
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:12,113
Don't-Don't...
Sorry. I... Slippery.

81
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:15,490
That's very kind of you to offer
and it sounds like a lot of fun,

82
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:17,613
but I am very, very married.

83
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:20,984
Congratulations, Mr. Carmichael.

84
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,320
But who isn't?
My husband's right over there.

85
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,865
He's a big fella, isn't he?

86
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,360
What line of work is he in?

87
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:29,618
Lumberjack?

88
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:32,313
The kind that keeps him out of town.

89
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,207
Charles!

90
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:38,877
Is that your wife?

91
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,921
She seems very...

92
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,608
pretty.

93
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,050
Well, got to run.
You know how it is.

94
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,590
- The old ball and chain.
- Listen, Charles.

95
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:49,212
I just live right across the street.

96
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:53,260
So call me...
when the honeymoon's over.

97
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:55,313
I've got a chain, too.

98
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:58,513
I bet you do.

99
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,573
Excuse me.

100
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:07,790
- Well?
- No flashes. No nothing.

101
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,457
I think our neighbors are clean.

102
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:11,660
Except for that lady
across the street.

103
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:13,243
She's got a dirty mouth.

104
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,760
Well, are you sure
you checked everybody?

105
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:18,463
- Maybe we got the wrong cul-de-sac.
- Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael?

106
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:20,919
Come inside, please, there's a slight
problem with your cable.

107
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,431
Looks like one of ours.

108
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,441
Uh, correction...
that was one of ours.

109
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,486
That bug was stolen from
a CIA substation in Omaha

110
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,155
in 2006.
Now it belongs to FULCRUM.

111
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,710
And here I thought

112
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,784
we were all looking for a
garden-variety terrorist.

113
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:55,245
Better hurry up, buddy.

114
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,951
Your wieners are burning.

115
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,504
I knew these people creeped me out.

116
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:30,447
{\pos(192,240)}Hi. Did you sleep well?

117
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,691
{\pos(192,240)}Like a log, honey.
How did you sleep?

118
00:16:33,774 --> 00:16:36,703
What are you doing?
Did Casey find more bugs?

119
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,204
I'm cooking breakfast.

120
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,360
Casey swept the house. It's clean.

121
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,542
Okay. Well, are we going to
invite the neighbors over?

122
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:46,243
No, Chuck.
I'm cooking for you.

123
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,718
What?

124
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:52,886
Nothing.

125
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,290
It's just funny.

126
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:59,230
I never pictured you doing this.

127
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:00,860
Well, what can I say?

128
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:01,978
I'm versatile.

129
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,313
Sit.

130
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,442
Hold on.

131
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,213
Are you enjoying
this whole Martha Stewart thing?

132
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:13,790
I can't believe it.

133
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:15,651
Please tell me you're
not going soft on me.

134
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,592
Just shut up and eat your breakfast.

135
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:19,890
You better be careful, Sarah.

136
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,011
One day you might actually
turn into a real girl.

137
00:17:58,213 --> 00:17:59,990
Sweetie.

138
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:01,260
Sweetie?

139
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,773
I almost forgot, would you mind
swinging by the store for me?

140
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,373
Have a great day at work.

141
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:18,617
Okay.

142
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:51,171
- Wipe that look off your face.
- Wait, that's Sarah's...

143
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,042
Invisible ink, really?
You guys can't just use the phone?

144
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,543
We're dealing with FULCRUM here.

145
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,100
Bugged your house and the phones.

146
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:58,261
Sometimes you got to do
it the old-fashioned way.

147
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,638
"Location clear. Target on move"?

148
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,636
You guys figured out
who planted the bug?

149
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,601
Yeah.
Ring any Intersect bells?

150
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:07,690
Yeah, that's crazy
cougar lady's husband.

151
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,063
How do you know it's him?

152
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,847
While you both were
busy playing house,

153
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,430
I was doing some
{\old-fashioned} spy work.
{\Les lignes entre crochets apparaisse pas à l'ecran, donc j'ai enlever un mots pour que le sous titre soit lisible, mais si dans la trad c'est mieux, il faut garder}

154
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:14,849
Pulled a fingerprint off the bug,
ran it through the database.

155
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:16,946
- Who was this guy before FULCRUM?
- CIA Psy-Ops.

156
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,990
Agency shrinks.
A real bunch of weirdos.

157
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:20,575
I also ran his bank records.

158
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,364
Turns out he bought enough of this stuff
to stretch from here to Gardena.

159
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:25,361
Infiniband data line.
The same stuff we use

160
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,916
to tap into the Agency's intranet.

161
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,501
Any idea what your
neighbor was using it for?

162
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:31,160
I don't know.

163
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:34,005
Uh, online gaming?
Porn?

164
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:35,757
- Or...
- I don't know. Or...

165
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,630
- Hacking into government servers.
- Or hacking into government servers.

166
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:41,130
I was going to say that eventually.
I'm glad you guys cracked it.

167
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,389
- Glad I could help.
- Help...

168
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,747
by getting us into that
house and onto that computer.

169
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,039
- You want me to go in as Nerd Herd?
- Wrong again, Bartowski.

170
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,939
You're going to go in
the old-fashioned way.

171
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,330
You want me to sleep
with our neighbor Sylvia?

172
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:55,630
No, we want you to pretend
to want to sleep with her,

173
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:57,820
and then see if you can get
on her FULCRUM husband's PC

174
00:19:57,903 --> 00:19:59,280
and see if you flash on anything.

175
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,827
You want to throw in a little sex...
that's your prerogative.

176
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:04,630
Whatever.
Look, I just don't know

177
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:06,401
how Sarah's going
to feel about this.

414
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,030
There's no way she's

415
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:07,960
going to let her husband
just sleep with...

416
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:10,230
Is he ready?

417
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:13,060
Chuck, look, I'm sorry,
but this is our best option.

418
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:14,630
Target's got the house rigged
with state-of-the-art security.

419
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,730
And since his wife's expressed
a romantic interest in you...

420
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,430
We need you to exploit it.

421
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:21,960
Oh, exploit it. Gotcha.

422
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,530
Yeah. Textbook CIA.

423
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:26,060
Look, Casey and I will be
with you every step of the way.

424
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,660
Yeah, if the cougar gets a little hairy,

425
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:28,890
you can always tap out.

426
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:30,230
Look, we understand

427
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,660
if this makes you uncomfortable.

428
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:33,290
Breaking my fake wedding vows?

429
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:34,560
No, forget about it.

430
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:35,990
I'm golden. Just hit
me with another spritz

431
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:37,373
of that, would you?

432
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:39,613
Why here?

433
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:45,490
Mr. Carmichael.

434
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:48,190
I didn't expect you to come so quickly.

435
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:52,943
Charles Carmichael always comes quickly.

436
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:55,773
Real smooth, Bartowski.

437
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,243
Come on in. Okay.

438
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:06,430
The cable enters the house

439
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:08,030
through the northwest corner, upstairs.

440
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:09,490
Oh, hey!

441
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:10,890
This is where the magic happens.

442
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:13,230
What do you think
your, uh, wife would say

443
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,760
if she knew you were up here?

444
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:16,030
You think she'd be jealous?

445
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:18,590
Well, it's like you said.

446
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:19,930
I mean, the honeymoon...

447
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,713
she is over.

448
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:24,960
Hi-oh. If you don't mind me asking,

449
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:29,030
when was the last time you
and your wife made love?

450
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:30,955
Well, that's a...
that's a... that's a...

451
00:21:32,113 --> 00:21:33,160
That's a good one.

452
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:34,490
You know, things have been a little cold

453
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:35,873
in that department
lately. Oh, poor baby.

454
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:39,473
Do you know what I'm going
to do to you, Charles?

455
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:42,243
I got a pretty good idea.

456
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,730
I'm going to thaw you out.

457
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:47,730
Oh, I bet you are,

458
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:49,460
you-you
she-devil.

459
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,830
You temptress, you've taken my sock off.

460
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:53,490
Ticklish. Ticklish. Ticklish.

461
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:54,760
Those are my feet. That's my feet area.

462
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:56,260
Maybe-Maybe you know what?

463
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:57,330
Maybe we could just
talk for a few minutes.

464
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:58,422
How's that sound? Ugh.

465
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:01,130
You didn't come here to talk.

466
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:02,490
I didn't? I didn't come here to talk?

467
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,560
Why, why not? Talking's perfectly...

468
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:07,330
Talking's overrated anyway, isn't it?

469
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:08,590
No, you know what?

470
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:09,690
It's just that I'm a little...

471
00:22:09,773 --> 00:22:10,590
I'm a little nervous because this is...

472
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:12,430
the whole adultery game is

473
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:14,590
a little new... little new to me.

474
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:16,330
And I think, I think
just a... just a drink,

475
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,443
a little liquid courage would
really go a long way right now.

476
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,060
Is Scotch okay?

477
00:22:22,143 --> 00:22:23,190
Sounds delish.

478
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:25,060
Thank you.

479
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,560
I'll be right here.

480
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:27,960
But you already knew that.

481
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:31,190
Crazy person.

482
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:32,413
Come...

483
00:22:33,773 --> 00:22:34,760
Casey, I'm handcuffed.

484
00:22:34,843 --> 00:22:36,860
Relax. Handcuffs are a cinch.

485
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:38,360
Really? Yeah.

486
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:39,890
There's a bone in your thumb. Tiny bone.

487
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:41,160
Real easy to break.

488
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,590
What you're gonna want
to do is you're gonna

489
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:44,460
want to apply torsional
pressure to it until it snaps.

490
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:46,530
I'm not gonna break my bone!

491
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:48,273
Well, in that case, you are screwed.

492
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:52,330
Think. Think. Think.

493
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,530
Wait a minute. Wait.

494
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:54,890
Hey.

495
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,273
Hey. Hey.

496
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:01,813
Oh, okay.

497
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:24,573
Damn it. Password protected.

498
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:31,973
Salamander.

499
00:24:12,643 --> 00:24:15,024
Chuck.

500
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:17,260
Chuck, you have to get out of there.

501
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:19,361
Chuck? Chuck?

502
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:21,013
Stay where you are, Agent
Walker. I'm going in after him.

503
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:27,113
Have you tested him yet?

504
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:30,543
He's upstairs. I've got him cuffed.

505
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:41,313
He was just here.

506
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:11,990
He ran the test.

507
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:13,590
He survived.

508
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:16,173
We found our subject.

509
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:28,043
Good afternoon.

510
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:31,130
Charlie?

511
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:32,143
Brad.

512
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:38,730
You are never gonna believe what
just happened to me over there!

513
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:39,973
Well, this ought to be good.

514
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,416
I send you there undercover

515
00:25:55,673 --> 00:25:58,794
and you not only nearly
expose Mr. Bartowski to FULCRUM

516
00:25:59,113 --> 00:26:00,963
but to an entire
cul-de-sac of civilians?

517
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,230
No excuses, General, we pooched it.

518
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,090
No.

519
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:05,390
No, we didn't pooch it.

520
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:06,930
We didn't pooch it. General, look,

521
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:09,160
I-I saw something on
that computer, okay?

522
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:11,223
I saw... pictures.

523
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:12,890
How illuminating. General,

524
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:14,360
they weren't regular pictures.

525
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:16,090
They were like Intersect pictures,

526
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:18,730
embedded files, like the ones
that Bryce sent me, only...

527
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,960
very different.

528
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:23,230
We think Chuck could have
FULCRUM programming in his brain.

529
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:24,445
In that case,

530
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,739
I'm pulling Mr. Bartowski
from this operation.

531
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:29,430
But as long as Agent
Walker's cover is intact,

532
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:31,290
I want you two to lock
down the cul-de-sac,

533
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:32,630
monitor FULCRUM,

534
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:33,930
see what else you can uncover

535
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:35,789
before we make a move on their cell.

536
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:38,213
The Carmichaels are getting a divorce.

537
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:45,424
Oh, my, my, my.

538
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:47,890
Don't you look prosperous, Michael.

539
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,360
Wow, tonight's the night
with the Internet lady?

540
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,360
How ya feeling, big guy?

541
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:51,460
Like an imposter.

542
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,690
Look at me.

543
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:54,030
Look at this ridiculous outfit.

544
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,960
She's gonna take one
look at me and realize

545
00:26:56,043 --> 00:26:58,771
I am not a 185-pound shipping magnate.

546
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:00,760
Oh, relax. That suit is...

547
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:02,566
very slimming. That's right.

548
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:04,193
That's right. You know what?

549
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:05,730
<i>It'll make your wallet look fat.</i>

550
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:07,090
Yeah, Morgan's right.

551
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:08,890
That poor lady is not
gonna know what hit her.

552
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:11,530
You're gonna need a hydraulic
crowbar to pry her off.

553
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,343
Yes.

554
00:27:16,913 --> 00:27:18,130
What do you say, Bartowski?

555
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:19,790
Should I come clean?

556
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:21,160
Tell her who I really am?

557
00:27:21,243 --> 00:27:22,590
You got your girl without having to lie

558
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:23,730
about your lowly occupation, right?

559
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:26,330
Um... yeah, you know,

560
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:28,560
I'm-I'm not so sure
I'm the best role model.

561
00:27:28,643 --> 00:27:30,130
You're better than these losers.

562
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,790
When was the last time
any of y'all had dates?

563
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:33,013
And I'm not counting Bennigan's.

564
00:27:34,473 --> 00:27:37,260
And you... you and Anna
break up every other week.

565
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:38,830
And you...

566
00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:40,730
I don't even know what
your affiliation is, Elvis.

567
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:42,960
What does he mean, my affiliation?

568
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:43,990
That bathroom thing.

569
00:27:44,073 --> 00:27:45,860
Look, Mike, I don't know.

570
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:47,330
It's up to you.

571
00:27:47,413 --> 00:27:49,290
But do you really want to
be a part of a relationship

572
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:51,213
that's founded on lies?

573
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:56,690
The answer's yes.

574
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:58,043
Yep. Absolutely. He is not thinking.

575
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:14,673
Oh, my...

576
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:34,032
Agent Walker,

577
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,990
I've got unknowns
moving on your position.

578
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:39,030
This is Sarah. Leave a message.

579
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:41,330
Sarah, Sarah, you and Casey
have to get out of the cul-de-sac

580
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:43,330
immediately... I just flashed,
I just flashed on something.

581
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:45,260
I think it was FULCRUM...
it was something that I...

582
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:46,530
I uploaded off the computer, okay.

583
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:48,672
Excuse me. Hi. Yeah, could you

584
00:28:48,913 --> 00:28:50,660
give me a hand with my cable, please?

585
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:53,135
The company that built the
neighborhood is a front.

586
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:54,960
Uh, if you're looking
for free premium channels

587
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:56,130
I'm not the guy.

588
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:57,190
Oh, no, no, no.

589
00:28:57,273 --> 00:28:58,230
It's nothing like that.

590
00:28:58,313 --> 00:28:59,660
It's not just a house.

591
00:28:59,743 --> 00:29:00,990
The entire neighborhood is FULCRUM.

592
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,260
For some reason

593
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,060
I'm getting some kind
of weird interference.

594
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,130
I think somebody in the neighborhood
might be running some kind

595
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:08,190
of high-powered electronic equipment.

596
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:09,690
Actually, I think it... it might be

597
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:11,013
that house right over there.

598
00:29:25,943 --> 00:29:26,830
Hi.

599
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:28,090
I'm so sorry

600
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:29,360
about what happened with your husband.

601
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:31,131
It must have been awful.

602
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:33,930
It's times like these you
need your neighbors most.

603
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,830
Oh. Thank you.

604
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:37,490
Uh, come in.

605
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:38,843
I hope you like brownies.

606
00:29:50,443 --> 00:29:52,090
Looking for the wife?

607
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:54,843
She's having a chat with the ladies.

608
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:02,243
You feeling all right, buddy?

609
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,090
- How's this blood pressure?
- A little heigh.

610
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:37,760
Should I give him more sedative?

611
00:30:37,843 --> 00:30:39,230
No. CHUCK: Sarah?

612
00:30:39,313 --> 00:30:41,130
He's going to be fine. Sarah?

613
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:42,530
Where's Sarah?

614
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:44,373
Sarah?

615
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:47,330
Where's Sarah?

616
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:49,330
Where's my wife? Mr. Carmichael,

617
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:50,443
she isn't your wife.

618
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:53,313
She's a CIA agent.

619
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,613
And so are you.

620
00:30:55,843 --> 00:30:57,190
Wha...

621
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,330
What do you want with me?

622
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:02,713
You have got a very special brain.

623
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:04,390
Don't worry.

624
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:06,943
We're going to do everything
we can to not damage it.

625
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:08,430
Damage? Damage?

626
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:09,690
What is he talking about?

627
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:11,390
What you saw upstairs was a small part

628
00:31:11,473 --> 00:31:12,660
of a computer program.

629
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:14,190
The CIA designed it

630
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,090
to implant intelligence
directly into agents

631
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:17,530
through encoded images.

632
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:19,560
But the CIA gave up on the program.

633
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:21,290
They decided to slug it out,

634
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:23,773
fighting the war on terror
using Cold War tactics.

635
00:31:24,037 --> 00:31:25,290
But we're training agents

636
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:27,060
who are ready to fight tomorrow's wars.

637
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:29,760
How would you like to
be a part of that future?

638
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:31,543
How would you like
to be part of FULCRUM?

639
00:31:33,773 --> 00:31:35,673
What about...

640
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:37,260
What about her?

641
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,513
Look, I'll do whatever
you want, just let her go.

642
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:42,630
Don't tell me you have feelings

643
00:31:42,713 --> 00:31:44,490
for your partner? Boy,

644
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:46,030
you really let her get
into your head, huh?

645
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,130
What did she tell you?

646
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:49,390
That someday you two would be together?

647
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:52,330
Maybe settle down in a
cute little cul-de-sac

648
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:53,573
like this one?

649
00:31:53,817 --> 00:31:55,673
You're funny.

650
00:31:55,944 --> 00:31:58,760
This place isn't real.

651
00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:01,943
Her feelings for you aren't real.

652
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,360
Don't worry.

653
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,473
This next part should
help you get over her.

654
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:09,313
If he survives it.

655
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:21,043
Chuck!

656
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:25,273
He can't hear you.

657
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:13,013
No, no, no!

658
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,213
Chuck... Chuck...

659
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:54,760
Oh, he's toast. SARAH: Chuck.

660
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:56,090
Get him out of here.

661
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:58,413
Dump him where you dumped the others.

662
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,360
What just happened?

663
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,913
Mr. Carmichael.

664
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:13,190
Do you know where you
are, Mr. Carmichael?

665
00:34:13,273 --> 00:34:16,460
Beneath Meadow Branch
subdivision in a FULCRUM lab

666
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:18,413
that was built as part
of a secret initiative.

667
00:34:20,046 --> 00:34:21,490
What initiative?

668
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,543
To rebuild the Intersect computer.

669
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,230
Oh, my God, it worked.

670
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:27,790
Can I ask just

671
00:34:27,873 --> 00:34:30,030
one more question?

672
00:34:30,113 --> 00:34:33,490
You mind if we, uh, test your wife next?

673
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,313
Wife?

674
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:39,013
I don't have a wife.

675
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:01,730
Before you run the test,

676
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:03,190
I'd like to tell Agent Walker something.

677
00:35:03,273 --> 00:35:05,713
Agent Walker.

678
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:10,043
Now we have a name.

679
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,343
Close your eyes.

680
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:36,013
No, no, no!

681
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:09,160
Are you okay?

682
00:36:09,243 --> 00:36:10,930
Yeah. You?

683
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:12,473
I think so.

684
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:33,010
Take these guys to the detention center.

685
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:35,010
That one goes to the agency morgue.

686
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:36,763
We're not done with him yet.

687
00:36:42,793 --> 00:36:44,680
Besides testing on humans,

688
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:46,540
it appears that FULCRUM
is perilously close

689
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,840
to completing their
own Intersect computer,

690
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:50,910
making Bartowski more
important than ever.

691
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:52,840
His life has never been in more danger.

692
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:54,580
The honeymoon is over, Agent Walker.

693
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:56,963
Yes, ma'am.

694
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:00,210
Hey, everything okay?

695
00:37:00,293 --> 00:37:02,580
Yeah, just a routine debriefing.

696
00:37:02,663 --> 00:37:04,340
Uh, so I was wondering

697
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,940
if you wanted to swing by
the old cul-de-sac tonight.

698
00:37:07,023 --> 00:37:08,240
Why?

699
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:11,310
Uh, I don't know, I mean, I... you know,

700
00:37:11,393 --> 00:37:12,810
I figured we've still got the place,

701
00:37:12,893 --> 00:37:14,210
and Ellie still thinks
we're house-sitting,

702
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:16,810
so I thought that,

703
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:19,540
you know, we could maybe
enjoy a night in the suburbs,

704
00:37:19,623 --> 00:37:21,210
order in, rent a movie.

705
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:24,010
No mission to worry about,
just Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael.

706
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:26,280
Maybe have some fun. Chuck,

707
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:27,310
we can't go back there.

708
00:37:27,393 --> 00:37:28,580
It was just a cover.

709
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,310
Yeah, I know that,
I just thought that...

710
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:32,680
Casey and I have to
shut down the operation.

711
00:37:32,763 --> 00:37:33,623
Can we talk later?

712
00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:37,910
Absolutely.

713
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:39,410
Uh, Chuck?

714
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:40,410
Yeah.

715
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:42,540
I'm going to need that back.

716
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:44,823
Right.

717
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:49,193
Almost forgot.

718
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:05,110
Hey.

719
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:06,510
How was the big date?

720
00:38:06,593 --> 00:38:10,680
Gentlemen, it was a night
of exquisite passion.

721
00:38:10,763 --> 00:38:13,280
I did things with that woman
I didn't even know existed,

722
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:15,180
which are likely illegal.
Yes! So you took our advice?

723
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:16,780
I lied my ass off.

724
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,910
What did we tell you? Way to
get back in the game, chief.

725
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:21,310
Enough chitchat. We're burning daylight.

726
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:22,710
Lester, man the Nerd Herd desk.

727
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:24,640
Jeff, help out the green shirts.

728
00:38:24,723 --> 00:38:26,440
I want the new inventory
stocked by lunch.

729
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:28,440
My store had better be shipshape.

730
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:29,780
What, you're making us work?

731
00:38:29,863 --> 00:38:30,910
What about your new girlfriend?

732
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:32,210
What about her?

733
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:33,540
She's gonna be here any minute.

734
00:38:33,623 --> 00:38:35,323
I invited her down.

735
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,780
Michael,

736
00:38:49,863 --> 00:38:51,080
what's going on?

737
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:53,980
Why are you dressed like that?

738
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:55,440
Because I work here.

739
00:38:55,523 --> 00:38:57,940
I am a manager at the Buy More, Bolonia.

740
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:00,510
But I thought you were a boat captain.

741
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:02,210
Shipping magnate,

742
00:39:02,293 --> 00:39:04,340
but that was something I just made up

743
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:06,380
so I could get to do
what we did last night.

744
00:39:06,463 --> 00:39:09,910
But after we did what
we did last night, I...

745
00:39:09,993 --> 00:39:11,840
I can't bear to lie to you anymore,

746
00:39:11,923 --> 00:39:16,710
so I'll understand if you want
to tell me where to shove it,

747
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:18,140
but I hope you'll forgive me.

748
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:20,080
I do forgive you.

749
00:39:20,163 --> 00:39:22,110
The truth is

750
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,663
I wasn't 100% honest on
my dating profile either.

751
00:39:25,993 --> 00:39:28,093
Aw, honey, I don't mind
a little extra weight.

752
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:30,540
I have a son.

753
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:33,840
Oh, w-well,
s-so what?

754
00:39:33,923 --> 00:39:35,210
I love kids.

755
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:36,903
He's 26 years old.

756
00:39:37,163 --> 00:39:38,610
I thought you found out.

757
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:39,680
I thought that's why you wanted

758
00:39:39,763 --> 00:39:40,910
to meet here in the store.

759
00:39:40,993 --> 00:39:42,210
I don't follow.

760
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:44,493
Michael, my son works here.

761
00:39:51,463 --> 00:39:53,523
Please, Lord, let it be Bartowski.

762
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:08,140
Mother.

763
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:10,123
<i>Mi hijo.</i>

764
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:13,510
Ah, yeah.

765
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:15,163
<i>?i hijo?</i>

766
00:40:16,323 --> 00:40:18,263
You're banging my mom?

767
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,880
Hey.

768
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:24,210
What did I tell you?

769
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:26,140
House-sitting really
changes things, huh?

770
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:29,563
Absolutely, just-just not
in the way you were hoping,

771
00:40:29,953 --> 00:40:31,068
... El.

772
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:32,680
To tell you the truth,

773
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,840
the suburbs were kind of a
disaster for me and Sarah.

774
00:40:34,923 --> 00:40:37,610
Well, what happened? What went wrong?

775
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:41,180
I guess something that's
been wrong from the start.

776
00:40:41,263 --> 00:40:42,880
You know?

777
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:46,410
Are... you guys aren't
breaking up, are you?

778
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:50,140
No, no, no, no, no, trust me,
Sarah's not going anywhere.

779
00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:51,810
Chuck, I guess I don't...

780
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:53,740
I don't know what you're saying exactly.

781
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:55,610
Look, El, I know how much you love Sarah

782
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:57,740
and I know how much
you love the idea of us

783
00:40:57,823 --> 00:40:59,610
and us moving forward
with you and Devon,

784
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:01,980
but we're not anything like you guys.

785
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:04,180
But you guys seem so perfect.

786
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:08,244
Yeah, I know, I guess, but
being in that house with her,

787
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:11,540
<i>it was so close to being perfect...</i>

788
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:16,110
<i>the way I had always
pictured it would be...</i>

789
00:41:16,193 --> 00:41:17,128
<i>that I realized</i>

790
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,963
<i>what was wrong with that picture.</i>

791
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:24,393
<i>And it was us.</i>

792
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:31,980
Sarah and I are never
going to be anything more

793
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:33,493
than what we are right now.

794
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,440
And you know what?

795
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:40,993
I'm okay with that.

796
00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:45,893
Anyway...

797
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:54,140
Agent Walker,

798
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:55,740
you get everything you need?

799
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:57,123
Yeah.
