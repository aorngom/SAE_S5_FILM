1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,550
*******

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,650
How do I like my eggs?

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,040
What's up?
Poached.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,130
Yeah, baby!

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,030
I don't know why I play this game with you guys.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,960
- ???/
- Don't rush me, okay.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,690
Oh!Six.

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,160
Okay.Easy.Easy.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,140
My all-time favorite pet?

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,270
Um...

11
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,180
- Cocker Spaniel...
- Yeah!

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,000
- Peaches!
- Oh, who got Peaches?

13
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,340
MORGAN: Wrong.

14
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:27,550
Incorrect.

15
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,360
It was a Springer Spaniel named Peaches Two, 

16
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,760
not to be confused with Original Peaches who got hit by a car.

17
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,970
I think we can just give it to Sarah, Morgan.

18
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,360
Yeah.Yeah,
fine, fine.

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,100
I'll just say anything next time 
and i'll just take a point.

20
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,110
You told me that the original Peaches ran away.

21
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,240
She did.She did.

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,190
What are you doing, Morgan?

23
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,530
MORGAN: Most humiliating childhood nickname?

24
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,860
I promised Morgan I would never say it out loud.

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,200
Okay.
Um, Organ.

26
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,770
Oh, boom!

27
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,210
You see what I'm talking about?

28
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,990
What's it say?
What's it say?

29
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,230
Organ!Organ!
Boom!Yeah!

30
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,740
Okay.

31
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,220
Yeah, move me up a spot.

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,160
The victory battle.

33
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,920
ELLIE: Keep it moving.

34
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,210
Here we go.

35
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,340
Okay, big money, big money.????

36
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,850
Next.Next.Next.

37
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,530
Most dangerous situation ever?

38
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,610
He doesn't know it.

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,740
I...
I don't know.

40
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,090
Fixing a flat tire on the side of the freeway?

41
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:29,850
Good guess.

42
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,820
Sunburn.

43
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,220
I was nine and we were on a family 
vacation and my sister and I, 

44
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,000
put on baby oil instead of sunscreen.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,820
We ended up looking like two little blond lobsters.

46
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,840
I know!

47
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,240
Okay.

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,220
Most hated person ever?

49
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,650
Ah, it's so easy.
A total gimme.

50
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,780
Harry Tang?

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,740
Harry Tang?
Come on.

52
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,600
Guys.I don't know.

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,220
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

54
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,450
It's, it's a stupid game.

55
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,620
Well, no, no, hold on a second.

56
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,160
No, no, it's, it's Bryce Larkin.

57
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,050
I mean how could you not know Bryce Larkin?

58
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,900
Dude pretended to be his buddy, sexed up his girl, 
and got him kicked out of Stanford.

59
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,660
- If-if Chuck is Solo, Larkin is his Fett.
- Okay.

60
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,360
Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Okay.No point.No point.

61
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,260
Understood.

62
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,250
See you in a bit.

63
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,110
Take your time.

64
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,400
Well, we did great tonight.

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,050
Yeah, you know, I like to win, 
but, uh, Morgan clearly has an edge.

66
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,970
Yeah, when he started to list off 
my favorite thirty-one-derful flavors 

67
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,210
of ice cream in descending order, 
that was a little much.

68
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,980
Yeah, he's like the Intersect on you.

69
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,120
Yeah.Wish I could access your file, 

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,020
But the stupid thing doesn't really work like that.

71
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,690
Well, you could always just ask me.

72
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,770
Really?I...

73
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,550
I... Okay.
Yeah.Um...

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,580
Well, I mean, you know, 
I know that you and Bryce worked together, 

75
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,040
but how close were the two of you exactly?

76
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,800
Uh, well, Bryce was my partner, 
but we were never really friends, 

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,170
if that's what you're asking.

78
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,760
Right.Right. So your relationship, 
you'd say, was more like"You,

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,150
hey, get that bad guy,"  or "Nice judo-chop" or "
How about them Redskins?" Or something like that.

80
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,430
Yeah, well, you know, when you're undercover, 

81
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,830
you're still you, but the details are different.

82
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,850
Yeah, speaking of details, there were a couple of 

83
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,380
those questions we could've done better with.

84
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,140
Which ones?

85
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,250
You know those...

86
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,040
Those questions..
The...

87
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,470
Questions.

88
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,760
- The sex questions?
- There you go.

89
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,240
Morgan did well with those, too.

90
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,920
Well, what exactly is our cover for that topic?

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,620
Uh, we're taking it slow.

92
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,210
Right.Yeah.
We're being prudent, aren't we?

93
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,270
Oh, you meant...

94
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,520
Walk Sarah to her car?

95
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,780
Makes sense.I don't...
I don't have a car.

96
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,920
* I knew it was you.

97
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,290
You always telegraph your punches.

98
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,460
Bloody nose says otherwise.

99
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,480
Your cover?

100
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,520
Carina.

101
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,750
You?

102
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,320
Sarah.

103
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,650
Sarah Walker.

104
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,570
So, Sarah Walker, what brings the CIA to Los Angeles?

105
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,620
Same thing that brings a DEA agent like yourself: a job.

106
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,050
Well, whatevert is, it looks boring.

107
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,260
All right, Carina, wt is it?

108
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,870
If you're here, it means you need something.

109
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,620
A diamond.

110
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,560
Wow, are you, uh...

111
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,310
You looking to settle down?

112
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
No, I'm going to steal one.

113
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,420
And you're going to help me.

114
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,540
Well, couldn't you just have called?

115
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, guys.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,580
Guys, did you know that there's an undercover 
DEA agent out in the courtyard?

117
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,470
Relax.We know.

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,390
Should I go?

119
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,410
GRAHAM: He can stay.

120
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,240
Uh, uh, who, who are they?

121
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,030
Seen but not heard.
.Being debriefed here.

122
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,610
GRAHAM: The diamond is heavily guarded 
inside of Peyman Alahi's Malibu compound.

123
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,400
Are they with us?

124
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,730
Alahi is an international financier for the opium cartel, 

125
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,370
which is why the Drug Enforcement Administration 
has asked us to cooperate.

126
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,700
You'll assist Carina in acquiring the rock.

127
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,620
- Acquiring?
- Shh.

128
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,800
You'll take Chuck to Alahi's compound to get 
his Intersect data on his alarm system.

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,740
Set the grab for the following day.

130
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,790
Sir, Carina is a tremendous field agent, but...

131
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,030
We can't trust her.

132
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,270
Chuck is way too valuable.

133
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,860
GRAHAM: Alahi has friends outside the opium trade.

134
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,900
We've received intel that he plans on 
moving the stone within the next 72 hours.

135
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,770
I've had dealings with Carina in the past, too.

136
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,010
She could be a bit of a...
Wild card.

137
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,930
We're aware of what happened in Prague, Agent Casey, 

138
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,710
which is why you and Agent Walker return the diamond to us.

139
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,380
Under no circumstances should Carina be entrusted with it.

140
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,840
What happened in Prague?

141
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,700
I-I don't...
I don't need to know.

142
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,440
So, this is your team?

143
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,510
My team.

144
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,930
Oh, hello, Casey.

145
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,080
Nice to see you with your pants on.

146
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,210
And, uh, who might you be?

147
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,480
- I'm Ch-Chuck.The new guy.
- Really?

148
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,960
He's an analyst.

149
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,520
MORGAN: Hey, Chuck?

150
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,490
Another member of your team?

151
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,020
Uh, no, that's Morgan, Chuck's best friend.
He's a civilian.

152
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,080
Hey, Morgan, uh, this is my friend Carina.
We used to work together.

153
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,580
Hello.

154
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,300
Madame Carina.

155
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,590
- And I say, "Madame Carina.
- "</i> Right?

156
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,840
And she goes, "A pleasure to meet you, sir.

157
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,990
" But it's her eyes.

158
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,160
Man, her eyes say everything.

159
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,660
Like what?

160
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
Like, Martin.

161
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,800
She kind of got my name wrong.
She goes Martin instead of Morgan.

162
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,850
- It's completely fine though.
- Tang's coming. 

163
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,440
Okay, gotta go.

164
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,310
Morgan wasn't made to mix with the opposite gender.
Unlike me.

165
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,680
Chuck, how are you supposed to get any female friction 

166
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,870
action with him third-wheelin' you althe time?

167
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,350
What does that even mean?

168
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,700
Sex.

169
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,980
Can't you just say that?

170
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,900
Yeah, I mean I could.
It just, it lacks, uh, flavor.

171
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,690
I can guess what Casey's doing here, 
but, uh, what about this Chuck guy?

172
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,350
What is he analyzing?

173
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,640
You?

174
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,310
Our cover is boyfriend/girlfriend.

175
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,070
Speaking of.

176
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,070
I'm sorry to hear about Bryce.

177
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,070
Thanks.

178
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,310
It's, uh...

179
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,740
It's been hard.

180
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,360
Of course, getting dead is an occupational hazard.

181
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,510
So, what's the assignment here anyway?

182
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,760
It's top secret.

183
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,520
So i'll guess i'll just talk to Chuck myself.

184
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,170
That's not happening either.

185
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,330
Hey, Carina, come on.

186
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,480
Carina!

187
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,990
And where do you think you're going?

188
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,330
I need two eyes on the revolving wieners.
Hear me?

189
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,590
Hey, Carina.

190
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,620
Excuse me.
Do you work here?

191
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,460
Oh, uh.
Yeah.

192
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,350
Uh, we met this morning at Chuck's.

193
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,710
Martin.

194
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,830
Oh, right.

195
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,920
Have you seen Chuck?

196
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,000
Chuck?

197
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,780
No, where is he?

198
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,310
Oh, my God, she is way too good for him.

199
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,030
She's too good for this store.

200
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,190
Is there a nicer establishment where beautiful people can shop?

201
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,990
Hi.

202
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,560
Chuck, you have to fix me up with Carina.

203
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,490
No.I mean...

204
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,680
No, actually, I don't think that's such a good idea, Morgan.

205
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,010
Chuck, I know what a third wheel is.
I know it's me.

206
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,930
Give, give me a chance here, man.

207
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,090
Let, let me be a fourth wheel for once.

208
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,910
Or maybe like any other even number.

209
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,940
What do you think you're doing here?

210
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,600
I'm just getting to know your team.

211
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,480
If I'm going to trust them with my life and my diamond, 
I want to be certain they're the best.

212
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,080
Wait.

213
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,440
You don't think I'm good enough.

214
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,250
- That's it.
- Yes. 

215
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,550
No, no.

216
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,730
I just, uh...

217
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,940
Chuck, if you can get Sarah, man, 
that means just about anything is possible.

218
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,190
Let me spread my wings, man.

219
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,420
Fine, fine, i'll see what I can do.
But no promises.

220
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,830
Thank you.Thank you.
Thank you.Thank you.

221
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,320
Have the girls gotten hotter around here or is it just me?

222
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,980
Well, this is my op and my rules, 
and you're going to do exactly what I say.

223
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,950
We'll see about that.

224
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,790
Sarah,ey?
Sorry to interrupt.

225
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,150
- Hi, Carina.Can I just talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

226
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,910
anby that I mean, 
I need to ask you a favor, and feel free to say "no," 

227
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:49,000
say "no," but, uh, could you fix Morgan up with Carina?

228
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,100
Make sure you really exaggerate "no" so they can lip-read it.

229
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,120
They're a little lame, but I think they can crack "no.

230
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,220
- " You know, that is a great idea.
- No, it's not.

231
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,900
"No" is the answer.
You're supposed to say "no.

232
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,170
" Think this thing can pierce through bone?

233
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,990
Carina, you want my help with your mission?

234
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,860
I believe those were your orders.

235
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,250
Then I need your help to protect Chuck's cover.

236
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,390
You're going on a double date.

237
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,000
With Morgan.

238
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,740
Small price to pay.

239
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,410
Which one of these geeks is Morgan?

240
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,530
Green shirt.

241
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,220
Well, that'll be fun.

242
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,130
Easy, girl.Easy, girl.
Easy, take it down.

243
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,600
You guys are so cute, really.

244
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,950
You're, like, the cutest couple ever.

245
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,570
Ah, well...

246
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,830
Thanks, yeah.We're doing...
We're doing good.

247
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,290
Good?I'd say we're doing very good, sweetie.

248
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,440
Well, I stand corrected.

249
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,230
So, um, how did you two meet?

250
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,890
- At work, I guess.Right, yeah?
- Yeah, work.

251
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,060
MORGAN: Sarah came into the store with a broken cell phone, 

252
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,170
like a modern-day damsel in distress.

253
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,470
I guess you're right.

254
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,610
A lot of people who meet at work end up dating.

255
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,030
Uh, so do you guys want to watch a movie or something?

256
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,500
Good idea...

257
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,410
Sweetie.

258
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,700
Yeah, that's a great...

259
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,780
I rented that penguin movie.

260
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,880
No, no, no, no, no-- a movie's a terrible idea.
Don't you think?

261
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,470
I think that people don't take enough time 
to get to know each other.

262
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,870
All I want to do tonight is find out 
everything there is to know about Carina.

263
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,080
Really?

264
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,470
Like what?

265
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,390
Were you always this hot or did you just, 
like, recently find your hotness?

266
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,950
You're so cute.

267
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,830
Man, dude, Carina is really into me.

268
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,630
Yeah, it seems that way, doesn't it?

269
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,300
What does that mean?

270
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,510
What?

271
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,940
The way you said that.

272
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,790
"Seems," like, why wouldn't she be into me?

273
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,210
No, no, no, I'm sure.

274
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,390
I'm sure that she's into you.
Really?

275
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,120
You know, you don't have to be so hands-on with Morgan.

276
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,340
You said I'm on a date.

277
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,260
This is me on a date.

278
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,790
- You're going to give himthe wrong ide
-  Oh, come on.

279
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm just giving the kid a thrill.

280
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,830
I mean, this place is like...

281
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,350
If a yawn could yawn.

282
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,840
How do you stand it?

283
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,210
I'm good here.

284
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,670
Yeah, right.

285
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,840
Who's up for a hot slice?

286
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,730
Do you like to travel?

287
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,610
Mm-hmm, with someone fun.

288
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,450
Shh!Shh!

289
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,280
You "shh"!

290
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,690
Sorry.

291
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,770
Where were youast?

292
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,830
CHUCK: Argentina, okay?
Now will you shut up.

293
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,430
They're almost at the Antarctic.

294
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,510
Do you want to get out of here and 
go to Chuck's room or somewhere private?

295
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,720
Yeah?

296
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,220
MORGAN: Hey, dude, uh, did Carina call about me yet?

297
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,830
No, Morgan, it's the middle of the night.

298
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,160
She hasn't called yet.

299
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,380
Uh, when do you think it's cool for me to call her?

300
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,050
I am asleep!

301
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,770
Not true, 'cause here we are talking.

302
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,250
Right?
You know...

303
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,980
Chucky?

304
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,760
Okay, okay, you know what?

305
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,930
Listen, listen, she has not called in the time 
that it's taken me to pick up and hang up.

306
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,870
Leave me alone, Organ!

307
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,590
And hello to you too, ma'am.

308
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:55,520
Yes, I-I am, uh, the on-call Nerd Herder for 
all Nerd Herd Computer emergencies.

309
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,420
And-and what is your room number?

310
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,520
Hey, Chuck.

311
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,640
Use your feet.

312
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,380
Where's...

313
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,870
Where's, uh, your computer?

314
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,290
I don't have one.

315
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,180
I lied to get you over here.

316
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,810
Why would you do that?

317
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,030
Because I know you're with us.

318
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,710
Who's "us"?

319
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,040
Who's "with us"?

320
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,930
Oh, thank you.

321
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,220
But no, thank you...

322
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,080
You can't access my file to know about Argentina 
unless you have a G6 clearance or higher.

323
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,230
Cheers to spying.

324
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,780
I hope you like what you see.

325
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,980
I should probably call Sarah.

326
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,360
Sarah should probably be here.

327
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,460
I think that it would be important for her to know...

328
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,750
You're not much of a spy, are you?

329
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't know how many more clues I can...
Take off.

330
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:09,370
But if Sarah were here, I couldn't seduce you.

331
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,050
Unless maybe, you're into that sort of thing.

332
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,780
Just one...

333
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,740
Or maybe I'm wrong, and you're already sleeping with Sarah.

334
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,680
Are you sleeping with Sarah?

335
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,890
You know that a gentleman never...

336
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,830
Oh, got it.

337
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,740
Well, that makes sense...
Considering Bryce.

338
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,070
Bryce?Bryce?
What are you talking about?

339
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,650
What, you don't know about Bryce?

340
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,860
Bryce Larkin?

341
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,040
Her boyfriend.

342
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,690
We'll go in undercover as party guests and locate the diamond.

343
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,000
Where's the diamond?

344
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,470
Well, that's your job, Chuck.

345
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,000
The Intersect knew about Peyman Alahi's 
connection to the opium cartels.

346
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,210
So you want me to steal the diamond?

347
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,580
No, we'll grab the stone later.

348
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,590
Today, we just get in, we find it, and we get out.
And that's it.

349
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,660
Right, get in, get out.

350
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,440
Got it.

351
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,450
Are you okay?

352
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,070
Yeah, fine, why?

353
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,990
Well, you just seem a little...

354
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,660
I don't know, something.

355
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,390
- Are you sick?
- No, fine.

356
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,710
, one last thing.

357
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,810
At the mansion, I need you to do me 
a favor and stick by my side.

358
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,040
Why is that?

359
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,700
Well, Carina, she likes to improvise, 
and things can get sticky fast.

360
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,790
She likes trouble, and she looks for it.

361
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,010
You know, one time in Pakistan, 
I really had to save her...

362
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,010
Okay, it doesn't matter, but the point is 
that Carina is not to be trusted.

363
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,140
Oh, Sarah.

364
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,310
You have no idea how happy I am to hear you say that.

365
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,780
What is it?
Why?

366
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,420
Well, Carina said something last night...

367
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,250
Last night?

368
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,610
Oh, right.

369
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,690
Uh, well, she put a call in to the Nerd Herd afr-hours number 

370
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,180
and I was the one who was on call.

371
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,050
What did she tell you?

372
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,590
Ms.Walker, your break is abutting the 25-minute mark.

373
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,150
Uh, one second, please.

374
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,040
What did she say?

375
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,140
I mean, it doesn't matter if it's not true.

376
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,720
Just, just tell me.

377
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,160
Something about Bryce and you...

378
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,600
You know, being together.

379
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,790
I'm sure whatever you lovebirds are 
discussing is a matter of national security, 

380
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,570
but the ketchup vat isn't just going to refill itself.

381
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,350
Did you know that 55% of accidents occur in the kitchen?

382
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,950
And I'm sure most of them are accidents.

383
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,420
It's not true, right?

384
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,270
You and Bryce, that's not true, right?

385
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,130
It was complicated.

386
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,230
I thought you were supposed to be good at lying.

387
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,710
You know what?
This is ridiculous.

388
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,260
I'm buying the next suit.
I can see my own boxer shorts in my pants.

389
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,410
Well, I think you look very sexy.

390
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,950
Listen, I'm sure Sarah's warned you about me.

391
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,790
That I improvise, take risks.

392
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,450
Yeah, she might've mentioned something about that.

393
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,440
Did she also mention my record?

394
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,740
How I took down the Quintana Gang in Colombia?

395
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,020
So trust me.

396
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,360
Got it?

397
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,410
Great.

398
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,440
Now, see that man over there?

399
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,040
Peyman Alahi, his house, his party, 
his diamond...For now.

400
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,960
Are you talking about Señor Wookie over there?

401
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,210
Just, uh, grab a drink.

402
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,810
- And, uh, look casual.
- Okay, casual.

403
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,150
There's a southern egress with two armed guards 
and by the garage exit, three more.

404
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,150
Why did you tell him about Bryce?
You compromised my cover.

405
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,330
We're on a mission here, Sarah.

406
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,180
Try keeping your private life 
and work life separate for a change.

407
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,760
Hey, we okay?How are you?

408
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,730
Uh, yeah, I'm cool.
I'm cool.

409
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,370
Um, so I count six SVB-54 explosion-protected 
security cameras with infrared surveillance.

410
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,400
Did you have a flash?

411
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,850
No, they sell them at the spy shop in the Buy More Plaza.

412
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,690
Hey.

413
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,090
You got a light?

414
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,350
You know studies indicate that smoking 
can be hazardous to your health.

415
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,350
Pick up a paper...

416
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,110
From the '60s.

417
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,660
Thermal imaging cameras-- north and west walls.

418
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,010
Someone really doesn't want us getting in there.

419
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,880
Let's go for a little stroll.

420
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,250
CHUCK: So I guess if this were you and Bryce,
you'd be breaking into the bedroom, huh, Sarah?

421
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,250
- Chuck, it's not the time.
- Okay.

422
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,570
Oh, that's awesome.

423
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,670
There you are.

424
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,470
You know, I really think we should go now.

425
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,160
????

426
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,800
So you like my diamond?

427
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,800
Oh...Yeah.

428
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,890
Uh, it's really pretty.

429
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,800
You're not supposed to be here.

430
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,670
Oh, i'm, I'm really sorry, but the door was unlocked.

431
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,740
And, uh, and who are you?

432
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,530
Pretty girls call me Peyman.

433
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,340
- Hi, Peyman, I'm Carina...
- Hey, Peym...

434
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,640
This is Sarah, and this is our brother Chuckie.

435
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,880
PEYMAN: A brother?

436
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,100
More good news for me.

437
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,840
So, uh, what would I have to do to get this thing on my finger?

438
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,800
It is said that he who owns the Nadan-I-Noor rules the world.

439
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,870
So...

440
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,090
What if, like, someone tried to steal it?

441
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,930
It's impossible to steal.

442
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,920
Because if touched, the vault will seal itself off; 
the gas will fill the room; 

443
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,130
and after that, my security team would eliminate the threat.

444
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,030
But me, I am more of a lover than a fighter.

445
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,470
Wow, you know, I saw some really cool paintings outside.

446
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,540
Can I have a look?

447
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,700
PEYMAN: Sure.

448
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,390
- You like this one?
- Oh, yeah.

449
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,420
Oh, you got a nice pair of eyes amongst other nice pairs.

450
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:18,530
The guy wearing the fur sweater failed to mention 
one fairly significant security detail.

451
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,350
Like what?

452
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,450
20,000 volts of electricity protecting the stone.

453
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,310
Hmm, problematic.

454
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,830
How you going to fix that?

455
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,860
I'm sorry.You're asking me?

456
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,540
Well, yeah, Sarah told me you're supposed
to have this really big brain, 

457
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,400
so for our follow-up mission, what do you recommend?

458
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,290
I mean, now that we know that there's a trap, 

459
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,120
I might use compressed air to knock it off the pedestal.

460
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,720
The dude liked to paint naked girls.

461
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,600
I mean, I can't say I blame him.

462
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,000
Like, like what?

463
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,460
I, I don't...

464
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,270
You know, s-something like...

465
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,040
Oh, th-that, that, that would work.

466
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,670
Carina.Carina!
Carina, what are you doing?

467
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,500
Improvising.

468
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,860
I got it!

469
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,540
- Hey, this was only recon.
- Hey!

470
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,540
Just like Little League.

471
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,340
I got it!
I got it!

472
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,770
????

473
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,510
Ary guys approaching fast!

474
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,830
CARINA: So I made a split-second decision.

475
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,260
I was doing us a favor!

476
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,730
Stop doing me favors!

477
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,090
CHUCK: Excuse me, pardon me!

478
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,710
Your shoulders are looking a little red!

479
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,740
Oh, no, no!

480
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,550
Thank you!

481
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,600
Carina improvised.She snatched the diamond.
Meet us on the beach.

482
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,420
I'm on it.

483
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,900
Hey, Carina, what now?

484
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,860
You two run for it.

485
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,170
Give me the stone.
I'll take the heat.

486
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,330
You can double back and get me out.

487
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,730
What?No, she's lying.

488
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,340
Chuck, trust me.

489
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,890
You-- remember what I said.

490
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,190
Yeah.

491
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,220
Which lie are you referrg to?

492
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,470
- Hard to keep track these days.
- ???

493
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,280
Thanks, Chuck.

494
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,400
You planned this?

495
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,640
Catch you later.

496
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,300
Oh, my God.

497
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,060
CASEY: Get in!

498
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,530
I have to be able to trust you on a mission, 

499
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,050
Chuck, no matter how you're feeling about me personally.

500
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,450
H-How am I supposed to know that Carina 
has a remote-controlled Jet Ski?

501
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,140
It's not usually an option in real life.

502
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,930
Our orders were to bring the diamond in, Chuck.

503
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,440
What is she going to do with it?
Is she going to sell it?

504
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,390
No, she's a gamer.

505
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,320
She'll give it to her bosses, 
move up the DEA's covert ranks.

506
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,290
What are you...
What are you doing?

507
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,650
Can't believe I have to work my stupid hot dog shift.

508
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,490
If I call in sick again, i'll get canned.

509
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,700
- What?
- Don't be mad.

510
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,600
Well, you left us to die.

511
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,920
I knew you'd get out of it.

512
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,550
You're burning a bridge, Carina, 
d the CIA is going to have your ass for this.

513
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,870
Well, I got to run.
Thanks again.

514
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,160
You go to work; i'll get the diamond.

515
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,970
- What?
- NSA magic.

516
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,330
I put a trace on her phone.

517
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,310
Wherever she's going, I'm going.

518
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,190
Eyes up front, soldier.

519
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,430
I-I-- what are you...
I was looking...

520
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,820
Carina?

521
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,380
Damn it.

522
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,450
- Carina.
- Martin?

523
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,010
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.

524
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,610
????

525
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,680
Wow, you look...Fantastic.
???

526
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,680
I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
This is great.

527
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,070
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call, 
but it's just not going to work out.

528
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,100
I've got...
This old relationship thing.

529
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,530
Oh, well, do you want to talk about it over coffee?

530
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,130
One for each of us.
I'll treat.

531
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,830
I can't.It's just...
It's too soon.

532
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,070
Hello, Casey.

533
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,130
Where's the diamond?

534
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,620
Love the cpetitive spirit, Johnny, 
but I don't have the diamond.

535
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,860
I'm not in the mood for any of your games, Carina.
Give it to me now.

536
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,780
I don't have it, I swear.
If I did, I'd give it to you.

537
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,900
Go ahead.
Look anywhere you'd like.

538
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,720
In fact...

539
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,230
Maybe you should just start with me.

540
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,790
Chuck.

541
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,250
I haven't heard from Casey in an hour, 

542
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,870
so I'm going to Carina's hotel, 

543
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,770
and I need you to stay home tonight.

544
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,330
Got it?

545
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,390
You don't want my help?

546
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,410
Not tonight.

547
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,490
So I'm off the team.

548
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,640
No, Chuck, just benched, 
but we're going to have to talk about what happened.

549
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,660
Someone got a headache tonight?

550
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,930
Yeah, yeah, that would be me.

551
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,170
MORGAN: X-Box?

552
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,410
Where's Sarah?

553
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,360
Oh, we had a fight.

554
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,850
You don't want to hear about it.

555
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,260
Fight, huh, man?

556
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,030
That's, like, your first fight.
That's kind of a big deal.

557
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,740
I wonder what our first fight would have been like.

558
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,690
I mean, I know it's stupid, 
but it's Sarah's fault, I think.

559
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,160
I mean, I never would have done it 
if she'd just told me the truth to begin with.

560
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,940
You're not even listening to me, are you?

561
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,860
Oh, sorry, man.

562
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:27,880
I stopped listening when it wasn't about Carina, 
like how she kissed me and then dumped me.

563
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,980
Carin-- you kissed Carina?

564
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,090
Yeah, man, at her hotel.

565
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,090
On the lips.

566
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,090
But I guess she has some past relationship or something.

567
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,730
I don't know, man, whatever.

568
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,700
Her loss.

569
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,050
You want another one?

570
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,110
Hells, yeah, I feel a bender coming on.

571
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,990
All right, one grape soda coming up.

572
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,140
Thanks, bro.

573
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,070
Oh, I, uh, got the new "Stealth Underlords" game.

574
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,000
I was going to surprise Carina, 
but that's another thing she'll be missing out on, so...

575
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,440
If you want to grab it, it's in my bag.

576
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,410
Sure.

577
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,270
Oh, Chuck?

578
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,040
Can I get some more pizza?

579
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,750
'Cause I just...

580
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,870
I'm feeling a little...

581
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,170
Got it.

582
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,630
Hey, Chuck?

583
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,020
Yes, Morgan?

584
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,740
You know what?

585
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,040
If our relationships don't work out...

586
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,850
Okay, 'cause we got each other, don't we?

587
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,190
That's really, really sad.

588
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,390
I know.

589
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,360
Wow, it's, uh, just like Prague, huh?

590
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,920
Hey, that's very, very funny.

591
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,550
What are you doing?

592
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,530
Smile.

593
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,470
He who owns the Nadan-I-Noor rules the world.

594
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,310
Okay.

595
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,250
Sarah, hey, oh, hey, thank God.

596
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,740
Listen, I-I know that you're really mad at me right now, 

597
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,130
okay, but-- wait, you know this is Chuck, right?

598
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,320
Okay, good, good, good.

599
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,640
Okay, listen, listen, the diamond.

600
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,260
The diamond that we stole from the wooly mammoth-- 
it is not a drug diamond, okay?

601
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,570
I repeat:it is not a drug 
It belongs to an Afghani terrorist group.

602
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,940
Look, I could get into a lot more details, 

603
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,300
but the point: it is way more dangerous than we thought.

604
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,200
Chuck.

605
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,100
Find Carina and tell her to bring me the diamond.

606
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,240
Please.

607
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,290
Hey, Morgan, buddy, long story, 
but I'm going to have to go ahead and step...

608
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,030
Hey.

609
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,980
Listen, go ahead and take whatever you want.Okay?

610
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,020
I keep a little cash in my sock drawer.

611
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,040
And by little, I mean spare change.

612
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,330
Pizza?

613
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,490
You...Yeah, absolutely.

614
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,110
Help yourself.

615
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,370
It's right behind me on the counter.

616
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,510
This? You want this.

617
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,010
I can't...

618
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,110
I can't actually give you this 
because it's not mine to give, really.

619
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,850
Carina?

620
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,580
Fine, it's me.

621
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,150
The mask is so Martin wouldn't ID me.

622
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,420
Now, give me the diamond.

623
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,660
Wait.No, no, no, no, no.

624
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,230
I need your help.

625
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,220
Sarah's in trouble.

626
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,080
Sarah's fine.

627
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,400
She's very resourceful.

628
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,700
Now, the rock?

629
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,310
Wait.

630
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,570
So you're just going to cross your fingers 

631
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,350
and hope for the best instead of helping your friend?

632
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,570
Oh, come on, Chuck.

633
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,740
You know, this thing of ours?

634
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,470
We're all in it for ourselves.

635
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,120
It's what we do.

636
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,310
It's not what Sarah does.

637
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,710
And-And...

638
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,060
And if she would have thought that in Pakistan, 

639
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,740
then you wouldn't be alive right now to have this conversation.

640
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,650
You want it?

641
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:05,770
Here you go.

642
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,310
But with or without you, I'm going to go help Sarah.

643
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,360
Just hold onto it.

644
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,520
In case I change my mind.

645
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,700
MORGAN Dude, what's the ETA on my pizza?

646
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:24,750
Uh, uh, buddy, I got to go pick up some more, 
and your grape soda's on the kitchen floor.

647
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,770
Who do you work for?

648
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,450
Tiffany.

649
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,690
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

650
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,150
You didn't just take that diamond from me.

651
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,730
I was holding it for a friend of mine.

652
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,050
A very grouchy, dangerous friend.

653
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,510
Does he like your new look?

654
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:46,200
Normally, I don't mind women being rough, 
but that was very rude.

655
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,270
Watch the one with the clovers.

656
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,940
CARINA: I don't get it, Chuck.

657
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,820
I thought you and Sarah were on the outs.

658
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,580
I made a mistake.

659
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,820
I'm still getting used to how you guys 
need to lie about who you are.

660
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,070
I'm feeling like a knife fight.

661
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,550
You analysts don't know what it's like for us field agents, 
but it's our job.

662
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,670
We shed identities like people shed clothes.

663
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,450
In your case, that's quite often.

664
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,040
Try 'em on, like 'em or leave 'em.

665
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,390
After a while, it doesn't even matter.

666
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,470
So you don't let anyone know who you really are?

667
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,750
Can't.

668
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,950
Might have to leave them in five minutes, 
or shoot them in the head.

669
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,930
Trust me, a spy doesn't want you to 
know anything about them that's real.

670
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,050
No matter who you are.

671
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,150
You carry the diamond; i'll act as intermediary.

672
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,230
And listen, if we're still alive afterwards, 
how about we go back to my room?

673
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,670
Kind of stuck back on the still alive part.

674
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,890
Told you smoking could be hazardous to your health.

675
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,290
Do you have what I want?

676
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,070
Maybe.

677
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,510
Maybe I pawned it for front row tickets to Justin Timberlake.

678
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,500
Why do you always have to provoke people?

679
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,970
Show me the diamond.

680
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,180
I have it.I have it.I have it.
It's right here.

681
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,670
I have it in the...

682
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,000
Just...There its.

683
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,790
Here's your...

684
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,910
That's your...

685
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,290
I have it right here.

686
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,240
Now give it to me.

687
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,010
No.

688
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,150
I know that I'm new to this, 

689
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,460
but I'm pretty sure that this is 
the part where I do what the man says.

690
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,310
He didn't say please.

691
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:57,310
Now, if you want it so badly, 
try taking it away from me.

692
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,770
Look around you.

693
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,560
Everyone in the room is with me.

694
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,880
What are you going to do, fight us all?

695
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,680
All by yourself?

696
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,150
She's not by herself.

697
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,690
- ?????
- ????

698
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,630
Miss.

699
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,260
Got to hide it.

700
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:54,700
Got to hide it.

701
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,600
Got to hide it.

702
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,150
Wait!

703
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,880
Wait!

704
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,790
Wait!

705
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,230
You know where this goes?

706
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,240
No.

707
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,000
Neither do I, so step back, 
or I let it go.

708
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,050
Now what?

709
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,530
You know, I'm not really sure.

710
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,080
I hadn't thought it through that far.

711
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,260
What?

712
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,510
What?

713
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:55,490
Capturing the Nadan-I-Noor Diamond has 
dissolved Peyman Alahi's credibility.

714
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
His network has fallen apart.

715
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,720
We were also able to thwart the purchase of
$26 million of surface-to-air missiles 

716
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,300
the Afghani terrorist group was planning on buying.

717
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,680
No diamond, no cash, no sale.

718
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,440
Job well done, people.

719
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,830
You didn't?

720
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,940
Well, this was fun.

721
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,450
Yeah. Good-bye, Carina.

722
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,520
Working with you has been...

723
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,500
Well, let's never do this again, hmm?

724
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,520
Oh, thanks, Johnny.

725
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,950
Maybe next time you can shake it up a bit 
and pull the four-leaf clovers out of the rotation.

726
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,750
Well, you know, as much as I hate your methods, 
there's never a dull moment, right?

727
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,820
Well, if you want a dull moment, 
just check out your cover life.

728
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,530
Well, you know, we have our adventures.

729
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,180
Right.

730
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,180
Oh, uh, dinner tonight so we can talk?

731
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,180
Pizza?

732
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,390
Sounds good.

733
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,860
Sure you don't want toome back to my hotel room?

734
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,230
Um, as...

735
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:03,040
As flattered and intimidated as 
I am by your proposition, why me?

736
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,790
Well, you're sort of cutish.

737
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,720
But, um, the real reason is, 
I love taking what Sarah wants.

738
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,370
What? What? Me?

739
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:13,920
No.

740
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,520
Sarah...

741
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,630
No, Sarah doesn't want me.

742
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,310
Yeah, she probably doesn't even know it herself yet...

743
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,550
But, um, I do.

744
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,110
Hey.

745
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,230
Vegetarian with no olives.

746
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,350
It's the only thing I know about you that's true.

747
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,180
You don't like olives.

748
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,480
Thank you.

749
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,230
Come in.

750
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,390
Thank you.

751
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,490
Look, i'm-I'm sorry about the beach.

752
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,940
You're absolutely right.

753
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,490
I-I shouldn't let my feelings affect the mission.

754
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,030
And, um...

755
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,470
If you and Bryce-- if you had a...

756
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,650
Thing, well, that makes sense.

757
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,850
He always got the great girls.

758
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,420
I just wish I knew something real about you.

759
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,830
Can't you just tell me just one true thing?

760
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,440
Just-Just one?

761
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,140
Like-Like, where did you grow up?

762
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,190
Or-Or if that's too much-- and I get it, 
I get it-- if that's too much, what's your...

763
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:45,920
What's your name?

764
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,450
What's your real name?

765
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,330
Middle name.

766
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,160
What's your middle name?

767
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,180
Can't you just tell me your middle name?

768
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,710
I'm going to.

769
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,310
I'll go get the napkins.

770
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,800
It's Lisa.

771
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,240
My middle name is Lisa.

772
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


773
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
