1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,300
Hi. I'm Chuck.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,000
Here are a few things
that you might need to know.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,300
As the assistant manager
and your boss,

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,600
it's my duty to inform you that

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,900
I have had several complaints
from customers about you.

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,800
General, what exactly is the Cipher?

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,800
The Cipher is the artificial brain
for the new Intersect computer.

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
<i>Tomorrow, the new computer
will be on-line,</i>

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,600
<i>and Operation Bartowski
will officially be over.??</i>

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,200
<i>Enjoy the rest of your life, Chuck.</i>

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,700
You can do anything.
I have seen you in action.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,500
Anything you wanted,
you could have.

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
You want to go on a date sometime?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,900
Okay.

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,900
We have to call off the date.
The Intersect was destroyed.

16
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,100
What? But the Cipher...

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,100
<i>It was a Trojan horse,
a sabotage device.</i>

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,700
<i>The moment it came on-line...</i>

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,600
You're still the only Intersect.

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,300
<i>I don't get it.</i>

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,500
This time today,
I was supposed to be a free man.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
No more Intersect.

23
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,100
Possibly reclining on a beach with a
colada and some undisclosed companion.

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,900
- What the hell happened?
- It's technical.

25
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
If it's a computer malfunction,
maybe I can help?

26
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,400
You know that's my department.

27
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,900
It exploded into a million little
pieces and Agent Graham with it.

28
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,800
You want to help, better get
yourself some rubber gloves.

29
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Graham is dead?

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,300
We're playing for keeps here, Chuck.

31
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,800
Well, at the risk of sounding callous,

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
where does that leave us
with the new Intersect?

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,900
If I were you, I'd get used
to working at the Buy More.

34
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,500
You ain't leaving anytime soon.

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,300
??

36
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,200
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,600
females, as the new assistant manager,

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,500
I just want you to know that

39
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,700
things are gonna run a little
differently around here.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because we did our time together
in the trenches,

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I know what screwups
most of you are.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,300
For example, Jeffrey,

43
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,500
you spend the hours of 3:00 and 5:00

44
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,800
sleeping in stall two
of the employee bathroom.

45
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,700
Dude, that was our secret.

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,400
- Morgan?
- Oh, boy.

47
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,400
No more borrowing company DVDs
and then just re-shrink-wrapping them.

48
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,000
What? That's outrageous, man.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,100
- I've never heard of such a thing.
- Yeah.

50
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,200
I'm actually insulted
that you would...

51
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,300
Oh, but...

52
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,000
- Oh, no.
- Oh, okay, like...

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,400
Okay, okay, company
DVDs you're saying?

54
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,300
- Right.
- Right.

55
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,500
Please, call me Mr. Patel,

56
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,200
or boss, or for our Latin friend,
<i>eljefe. Questions?</i>

57
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Uh, Chuck, when are the we...?

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

59
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,400
All questions addressed
directly to me.

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,900
<i>- El jefe?
- Thank you.</i>

61
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,700
When are we offering our
low-interest Buy More credit cards?

62
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,100
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

63
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,900
- Today.
- Today.

64
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,400
Morgan, get the displays out.

65
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,500
Any other questions?
Good. Dismissed!

66
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,200
I can't believe this is my life.

67
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,200
Morgan, do you remember a time
when I actually had potential?

68
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,500
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, you were bursting with it.

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,700
Man, I'm glad that's over with.

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,900
I'm kidding. Come on,

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
we all know that you're gonna
go on to do great things,

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
all right, great things,

73
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,000
but until that day, just know that
no matter how bad your life gets,

74
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,200
you get to go home to that.

75
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,300
Is that, uh...

76
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,900
Is that a real kiss or a cover kiss?

77
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,300
'Cause I'm confused right now.

78
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a "we have a national
security emergency,

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,800
and I need to speak
to you privately" kiss.

80
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,200
See, I knew I felt something...

81
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,700
??

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,100
Hey, I got an idea.

83
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,200
Why don't we blow off this
whole national security thing,

84
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,100
and go down to Mexico
for a couple of days?

85
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,500
I'll get the daiquiris if the
CIA picks up the plane tickets.

86
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,300
Coach is fine.

87
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,900
Chuck, I told you
we can't be together.

88
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,200
It's unprofessional.

89
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,900
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

90
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,200
but weren't you with
Bryce Larkin, super spy,

91
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,500
when you two were working together?

92
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,100
Bryce was a spy. You're an asset.

93
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,900
And my job is to protect you.

94
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,400
Wait a minute.
Why are we in a freezer?

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
All this to protect your toppings?

96
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,800
What the hell?

97
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,700
This is new. What is this place?

98
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, CIA decided
to spring for new digs.

99
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,200
Finally, a first-rate operation.

100
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,600
Looks... expensive.

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,700
Does this mean you guys are
planning on staying for a while?

102
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
That depends on you, Chuck.

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
How does it depend on me?

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Colt fed us a Trojan horse
that blew up the Intersect.

105
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,200
The real Cipher is still out there.

106
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,700
Our intel tells us
it may be in the possession

107
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,500
of the former KGB operative,
Sasha Banacheck.

108
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,300
We believe she's in town to sell it.

109
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,600
If we think she's got it,
why don't we grab her and find out?

110
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,500
Sasha Banacheck was
in a Bulgarian prison for seven years.

111
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,900
They got nothing out of her.

112
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,700
The good news is
one agent was able to get close.

113
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,200
He's the reason she went away,

114
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,600
and he knows more about her
than anyone alive.

115
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,300
That agent is Roan Montgomery.

116
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,200
Crap.

117
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
The guy hates me.

118
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,600
My supervisor in operative training.
Flunked me twice.

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,300
Well, he's off the grid now.

120
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,900
Use the Intersect
to find Agent Montgomery.

121
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,100
All right.

122
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,100
Guys, sounds like a blast.

123
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,700
Really, uh, but you can
count me out on this one.

124
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,900
No more dangling me off of buildings,

125
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,600
no more guns being pointed at my head,

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,100
no more putting my life in danger.

127
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,200
I am going back to my peaceful, quiet,
albeit degrading life at the Buy More,

128
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,500
so have fun on the mission,

129
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,100
and really love what you've done
with the place.

130
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,700
Is there a problem with the asset?

131
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,700
No problem, General.
I have the situation under control.

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
Chuck, wait.

133
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,800
- ??
- Sarah, look, you're right, okay?

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,700
I'm not a real spy.

135
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,900
I'm not cut out for this
adrenaline-pumping,

136
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,300
chase-the-bad-guy,
risk-life-and-limb daily existence.

137
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,200
Okay, look, the sooner
we get the Cipher back,

138
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
the sooner you can have
the Intersect removed,

139
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
and the sooner you can be free

140
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,100
to live whatever life you choose
with whomever you choose.

141
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
What are you saying?

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,300
I'm saying that you can have
everything that you've always wanted.

143
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,900
Let me see the file.

144
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,000
??

145
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,700
Okay. Uh, the guy lives
in Palm Springs.

146
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,500
He knows a lot of ladies.??

147
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,700
??

148
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,500
<i>So,</i>

149
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,100
what's the deal with this Roan guy?

150
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,700
He's a legend in the department.
Incredible spy.

151
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,400
Real old-school James Bond type.

152
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,700
Overrated if you ask me.

153
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,200
What was the class that you failed?

154
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,500
Infiltrating and Inducement
of Enemy Personnel.

155
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,200
Yeah, in the academy,
we call it Seduction School.

156
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, like I need a class.

157
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,200
Wait. Someone's already been here.

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,700
Yeah, and they tossed the place.

159
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, my God. Oh, uh, maybe...

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,900
maybe I should wait in the car.

161
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm still having nightmares
about the last few dead bodies.

162
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,000
Sugar, I got a flight to catch.

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is the guy
who's supposed to help us?

164
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm going to be the Intersect forever.

165
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,100

168
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,600
Morning, sunshine.

169
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,500
What do you say
we hit the shower for a quickie?

170
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,700
Sorry, Chuck.

171
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,900
And you know what? It would be nice
if we had some romance on occasion.

172
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
I got a good 42 minutes

173
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,900
before I have to perform an
emergency endotracheal intubation.

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,300
That's very funny.

175
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you realize that you have not
taken me on one single romantic date

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,900
since we've been engaged?

177
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,100
Took you out last week.

178
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,300
??To Subway...

179
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,900
with Chuck and his little bearded friend.

180
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,500
It's not exactly every girl's dream.

181
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,200
- No offense, Chuck.
- None taken.

182
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,700
I guess I have been remiss
in the romance department.

183
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,900
What we need to be is more
like Chuck and Sarah.

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,800
Excuse me.

185
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,700
Every time you see her,
your eyes light up.

186
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
I mean, how do you keep
that spark alive?

187
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,500
I-I... You know, I don't think
I should be getting involved in...

188
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,900
Come on. What's the secret, bro?

189
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,200
You know what?
We-We kind of just...

190
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
You know, we pretend
like we're not really dating,

191
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,600
which is weird, I know,

192
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,400
but it-it forces me to have
to win her over again and again.

193
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,500
And again.

194
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,000
That is so sweet.

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,400
Honey, see, all I'm talking about is
simply an evening of wining and dining.

196
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,500
I hear you, babe.

197
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,900
Mission accepted.

198
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,000
<i>The mission is the Cipher.</i>

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The brains of the Intersect,
the most important piece.

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
If Sasha Banacheck has the Cipher,

201
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,600
we got 24 hours max
before she unloads it.

202
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
What's wrong?
Did you find Agent Montgomery?

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,900
We did. It's just...

204
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,200
he's having
a bit of trouble remaining...

205
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
upright.

206
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,000
??water, aspirin. The guy's out.

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,400
??if we want Sasha Banacheck,
it's up to us.

208
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,900
G man, G man, G man.

209
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,700
Hello, Giorgio.

210
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,600
??

211
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I suggest going old-school.
Torture it out of her.

212
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Torture will never work.

213
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,500
Hello, Diane.

214
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,600
Hello, Roan.

215
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,400
The only way to get
Sasha Banacheck is to seduce her.

216
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,700
- Well, duty calls.
- Not you, Agent Frankenstein.

217
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,400
She'll peg you as CIA
in an instant.

218
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,200
We need somebody innocuous.

219
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,500
Someone with whom
she can let her guard down.

220
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,500
Essentially, the last person in the world
she'd ever suspect of being an agent.

221
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Charles, I'd like to have
these Nerd Herd invoices

222
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,300
logged into the computer
by later today.

223
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,400
Uh, Lester, these are
all from your jobs.

224
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,300
Correct, and during your brief tenure
as the assistant manager,

225
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,500
you should have had me
deal with it.

226
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,100
You didn't. Now I have
to clean up your mess.

227
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
Come on, brother.

228
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,900
Time for you to show me something.

229
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Let's go, Lover Boy.

230
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,200
I need your services
in a romantic capacity.

231
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Oh, I'm flattered.
I just hope Sarah's involved.

232
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,000
So, your date tonight will be
with Sasha Banacheck.

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,800
Um, I'm sorry. What?

234
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,000
You mean previously tortured
in a Bulgarian prison Sasha Banacheck?

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,900
Don't worry. Casey and I
will be there for cover.

236
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,100
Just approach her at the bar,
and get her to invite you up,

237
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,200
and see if you flash
on anything in her room.

238
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,400
One small problem.

239
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Why is she gonna choose me?

240
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
Because you're not going to be you.

241
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,600
You're going to be me.

242
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll teach you
everything you need to know.

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,500
First, the proper way
to drink a martini.

244
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,900
Hold by stem, nod to mark.

245
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,900
Slowly tilt back.

246
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,200
A moment to learn,
a lifetime to perfect.

247
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,700
Let's get to work.

248
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,100
??

249
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,800
His liver must look like camouflage.

250
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,800
Hey, Morgan, you seen Chuck?

251
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,000
He, uh, left early.
Why? What's up?

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,300
I wanted to see if he could
make himself scarce tonight.

253
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,700
Planning a romantic evening
with my lady.

254
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
??

255
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,500
Check you out, you big softy.

256
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,800
What's on the agenda,
if I may be so bold?

257
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Not sure.

258
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,900
I may pick up some flowers,

259
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,800
some-some candles, vino,
feed each other some??

260
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,000
You know about Ellie
and shrimp, right?

261
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,700
- No. What?
- Famous Nantucket trip of '92.

262
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,100
Spent days curled up
on a bathroom floor.

263
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,900
For years, she couldn't go
near a beach without vomiting.

264
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
What else you got?

265
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,000
Her favorite dessert, pecan pie.

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,500
Okay, she likes pecan pie.

267
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,700
Not her, you know, "stuck on a
desert island" all-time favorite,

268
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,900
but she likes it.

269
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,200
Morgan, I know my fiancÈe.

270
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,100
Really?

271
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,400
How long have you been in love
with Ellie for?

272
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,500
Three years?
Give or take.

273
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Take a walk for a second.

274
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,100
I have dedicated myself
to the study of that woman

275
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,600
for the better part
of 19 years.

276
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,400
So I hate to pull rank here,
homeboy,

277
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,200
but I think I know Ellie
a little bit better than you.

278
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
All right?
For example. For example.

279
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
What is Ellie's favorite
song of eighth grade?

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,600
??Eighth grade.

281
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,500
You don't know. That's okay.

282
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,700
You came to the right place, all right?

283
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,900
We are gonna set her off.

284
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
You're not gonna wear
that shirt though, right?

285
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
I need to see what I'm dealing with.

286
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,600
Assume your partner is the mark.

287
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,900
How would you seduce her?

288
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
That's an excellent question.

289
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,800
I-I would probably start
with the, uh,

290
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,100
bedroom eyes maybe.

291
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,500
You know, the old, uh,
Bartowski eyebrow dance.

292
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,500
Then come in at you like this.

293
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,800
You know? And then I'd start
firing the guns at you, you know.

294
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
- Hey, baby...
- Hey, don't encourage him!

295
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,200
This isn't happy hour at Chili's.

296
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,700
This is Sasha Banacheck.

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know,
I-I would probably, you know,

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
I'd-I'd-I'd be myself,

299
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,100
and I'd try and make her
laugh a little bit,

300
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
find a common
cultural interest-- music.

301
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,300
Be yourself?

302
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,900
You think a woman like this
could ever fall for a guy like you?

303
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know.

304
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Barring any national
security emergency,

305
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,100
I think I might have a shot.

306
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,700
Be reasonable.

307
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,700
This is a gorgeous,
sophisticated woman, and you're...

308
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,000
Passionate and-and sweet and caring.

309
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,900
Really?

310
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,300
Tall, dark and caring. What a combo!

311
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,100
I didn't mean it like that.
He-he has a lot to offer.

312
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,500
Fine. Let me see this caged passion.

313
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
- Kiss him.
- Excuse me?

314
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,900
I don't think that's necessary at
this particular juncture right now, Roan.

315
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm-I'm solid as a rock
in that department.

316
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,900
What's wrong? Don't you find
Agent Walker attractive?

317
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,800
Of course I find her attractive.

318
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,700
It's just that I had a burrito earlier,
and I'm trying to be respectful.

319
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,700
While I admire your chivalry,
if you can't kiss her now,

320
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,600
what makes you think you're
gonna be able to kiss Sasha Banacheck

321
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,800
when the entire
mission is on the line?

322
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,800
Chuck, it's okay.

323
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,200
- Really?
- Yes. Yes.

324
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,700
- There.
- Perhaps I've moved too fast.

325
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
Have you had intercourse before?

326
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,900
Okay, you know what?
You're crazy. This is crazy.

327
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,200
I don't have
to take lessons from you.

328
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
Really? Maybe I picked the wrong agent.

329
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,000
??I'll get Agent Casey
to kiss her.

330
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,300
You really want me to kiss her?!

331
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,100
- Desperately.
- Fine.

332
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,800
Bravo.

333
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,600
I better fix my lipstick.
Excuse me.

334
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,300
Sure.

335
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,600
Something tells me that wasn't
the first time that's happened.

336
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
What? No. No.
We're totally professional.

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,100
That's... we work together.

338
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,300
Don't worry, Charles.

339
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,800
I'll teach you how to get her, too.

340
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,400
But first, we're gonna need more gin.

341
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
??

342
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Okay, you make sure his mic works.

343
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200
I'll go load up the weapons.

344
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,500
Well, it may not be the steamiest,

345
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,400
but we probably have the strangest
relationship in Los Angeles.

346
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,500
I doubt that.

347
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Morgan is still dating, right?

348
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Good point.

349
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,400
Tonight will be fine. I wouldn't
take Roan's advice too seriously.

350
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,500
Just be yourself.

351
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,800
I doubt Chuck Bartowski's
gonna be charming anyone.

352
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,700
Why not?

353
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,500
Worked on me.

354
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,000
We need to talk about protection.

355
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't think it's gonna
get that far, Roan.

356
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,100
I mean a gun.

357
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,900
Why do you think
she's known as the Black Widow?

358
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,100
She's African-American
and her husband died.

359
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,400
Because she kills all her mates.

360
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,600
Big Mike?

361
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,900
Hey. Uh, you wanted to see me?

362
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,000
First, I'm digging the new vest.

363
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,800
Oh, thank you.

364
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,700
Next,

365
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
why aren't my credit card
displays out?

366
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Yeah, I've-I've told Morgan
three times, sir,

367
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,700
but don't worry, I am on it.

368
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,200
They ain't listening to you, huh?

369
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Just a matter of time, sir.

370
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,400
Look, Patel, the problem is
they don't fear you.

371
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,400
Yeah.

372
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Yeah, you're right.
They don't. They don't.

373
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
How do I get them to fear me?

374
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,800
Don't you watch Animal Planet?

375
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,300
Find the wounded gazelle and pounce!

376
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,500
Thus endeth the lesson.

377
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,400
If he survives the night,
it'll be a miracle.

378
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Shh! He can hear you.

379
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,700
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

380
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,800
Don't be nervous, Chuck.
We'll be watching your every move.

381
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,700
Now, Charles, I'm gonna walk you

382
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,500
through the world-famous
four-pronged Montgomery attack.

383
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,200
First, work the room.

384
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,200
When you enter a room,
every eye should be upon you.

385
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,000
You could leave the bar
with any woman you desire.

386
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,100
But you have chosen her.

387
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,400
Easy, Chuck. You're doing great.

388
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,700
Next, she'll need to be
well lubricated.

389
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,300
Ice-cold dirty martini, three olives.

390
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,000
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

391
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,800
I'll take that as a no.

392
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,500
Charles Carmichael.

393
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,800
And you are?

394
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,700
Bored.

395
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,200
Well, maybe I can change that.
GarÁon!

396
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,300
- ??
- Yes, sir,

397
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,500
please, uh, two
ice-cold dirty martinis, three olives.

398
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,300
Thank you.

399
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,800
That's very nice.
But I no longer drink.

400
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,300
Doesn't drink? That's absurd.

401
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,400
How is this boy supposed to
seduce her without alcohol?

402
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,500
Don't worry, Chuck.
It'll be fine.

403
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,100
I should probably cut back, too.
Lot of calories in those martinis.

404
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,100
Enjoy your martinis,
Mr. Carmichael.

405
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,100
It's okay, Chuck.
Don't get discouraged.

406
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,300
That was just round one.??

407
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,500
you're calm, confident, charming.

408
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,100
Yeah, apparently not.
She left after 12 seconds.

409
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,600
You're still alive, aren't you?

410
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
That's a victory.

411
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,800
Okay, Chuck, here we go.

412
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
A woman wants a man to take control.

413
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,700
Even though she won't say it,
she wants to be rescued.

414
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,500
Actually, that's not true, Chuck.

415
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,200
Some women prefer a man
who can take a backseat.

416
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm not talking about you, darling.
I'm talking about the Black Widow.

417
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So am I.

418
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,400
Maybe he doesn't need to try
and pretend to be someone else.

419
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,300
I promise you, Chuck Bartowski,
on his own, can seduce this woman.

420
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,500
I appreciate all of that,

421
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,600
but can we focus on
the mission for a second, please?

422
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,700
Yes, Charles.

423
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,800
All right, the third prong.

424
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,200
The woman is an absolute Francophile.

425
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,300
Just the mention of St. Tropez
makes her woozy.

426
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,600
I hate to keep bothering you,
but you look so familiar.

427
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,000
Perhaps we met in St. Tropez.

428
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,000
At the Intercontinental.

429
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
??

430
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Antoine the piano player is best
in Europe, don't you agree?

431
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, I'm a big, big fan of Antoine's.

432
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,500
Wouldn't miss him for the world.

433
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,000
Antoine has been dead for six years.

434
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,800
Ah, poor Antoine. That's tragic.

435
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,400
That is a shame.
No one ever called.

436
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,400
But you prefer the new
piano player Marcel.

437
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,900
For my money though,
I prefer Marcel.

438
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,000
Better solos, longer jams,
just more of an accomplished pianist,

439
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
but maybe that's just me.

440
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
I have to agree.

441
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Barkeep, a refill for the lady, please.

442
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,300
To Antoine.

443
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,700
May he rest in peace.

444
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,700
Are you prepared for an evening
of intense seduction?

445
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Can't wait.

446
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
This is very sweet.
What did you do?

447
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,500
Patience, babe.

448
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,200
First, some tunes.

449
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,700
I'm taking it old-school.

450
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,300
Does the eighth grade lunchroom
ring any bells?

451
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,200
??Richard Marx,
"Repeat Offender."

452
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,300
Okay.

453
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,500
Next, a little something
for the sweet tooth.

454
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Your favorite dessert.

455
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Seriously, babe, what
would you do for a Klondike bar?

456
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,600
I guess we'll find that out later.

457
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
Not much.

458
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,900
And finally,
for the evening's entertainment,

459
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,600
your favorite all-time movie.

460
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
<i>Casablanca.</i>

461
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,800
<i>No. Sister Act.</i>

462
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,000
Honey, why, out of
all the movies in the world,

463
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,700
<i>would Sister Act be my favorite?</i>

464
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,900
Morgan said he sat behind you
in the theater,

465
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,400
and you were hysterical
the whole time.

466
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,700
I have no recollection of that.

467
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,200
You consulted Morgan for
an evening of intense seduction?

468
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,300
Technically, he has known you longer.

469
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,800
Okay. You know what?

470
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Just for future reference,
my favorite dessert is pecan pie.

471
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
Well, that's what I said.

472
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
Hey, wait, where you going?

473
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,600
I have to be up at 5:00 a.m.

474
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,300
What about our date?

475
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,500
Well, why don't you call Morgan,

476
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,100
since evidently you planned
his favorite evening.

477
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,900
Okay?

478
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,100
That furry little bastard.

479
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,400
So how long have you
and Charles been cavorting?

480
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
You mean, how long
have we been working together?

481
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,900
??Don't play coy.

482
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,200
You have feelings for him.

483
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,800
I mean, real, non-spy emotions.

484
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,100
Don't be ridiculous. What, because
I'm protective of him as an asset?

485
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,400
No. The way you kissed him.

486
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,300
I think you've had too much to drink.

487
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,500
No such thing.

488
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,800
That's real professional.
Look at what you did!

489
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,900
I know. That's expensive gin.

490
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,400
Itchy ear there.

491
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,000
So actually, it was invented
by a Hungarian baker

492
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,800
to commemorate the defeat
of the Turks.

493
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,500
And that is the true history
behind the croissant.

494
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,200
That's just a little
pastry trivia for you.

495
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,400
You are a fountain of
information, Mr. Carmichael.

496
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,100
Well...

497
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
<i>Quand etiez vous a Paris
pour la derniere fois?</i>

498
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,300
??

499
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,100
<i>Enchante.</i>

500
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,400
And what bands are you into?

501
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,500
If you'd just admit I'm right,
we could move on.

502
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,800
Anything you perceived is me
wanting him to think I like him.

503
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,000
I assure you,
I have no feelings for Chuck.

504
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
He is just an asset.

505
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,600
Okay, we're back up.
Can you hear us?

506
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,400
Good night, Mr. Carmichael.

507
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,500
Mission failed.
Black widow's on the move.

508
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,100
Great. You know,
I hope you're happy.

509
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,700
I told you, he's an analyst, not a spy!

510
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,800
Way to go, Casanova.

511
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
You're going to have the
Intersect in your head forever.

512
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Okay, everybody, let's pack it up.

513
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,700
Roan, what is the fourth prong
of the famous assault?

514
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,500
The mission is over, Charles.
It's too dangerous.

515
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,800
You're not ready for this.

516
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,200
I'm ready. What is it?

517
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,800
Be a bastard.

518
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,300
When you say bastard, you mean...?

519
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,400
- I mean not you, Chuck.
- ??

520
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,900
Not sensitive or caring or sweet.
Be everything you're not.

521
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,800
Be Carmichael.

522
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
- Hey, Missy?
- Don't call her missy.

523
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,100
Yes, Mr. Carmichael?

524
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,500
I just want to tell you,
you're a fool.

525
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Excuse me?

526
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,100
No, I don't think I will.

527
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,900
See, you're heading up to your room
right now to get ready for bed.

528
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,400
Floss, creams,
maybe watch a little TV.

529
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,200
And then just before
you drift off to sleep,

530
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,900
you're going to have
one final, terrifying thought.

531
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Really? What's that?

532
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,700
That you passed up an evening
with the greatest lover you'll ever know.

533
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
And who might that be?

534
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,500
Oh, you're looking at him, sister.

535
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,600
A man trained in the art of seduction.

536
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,800
A man who has traveled the world,

537
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,000
sampling women of every
different culture and creed.

538
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,400
So I will offer one final time
before boarding my jet

539
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,200
and heading off to an undisclosed
rendezvous, of which I am already late.

540
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Can I buy you a club soda?

541
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,100
No, thank you.

542
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,900
Okay, I just thought I'd ask.
Have a good night.

543
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,400
But you can take me up to my room
and make mad, passionate sex to me.

544
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,700
I've still got it.

545
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,000
Make yourself a drink, Mr. Carmichael.

546
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
I'm going to slip into something...

547
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,600
...a little bit more comfortable.

548
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah, do that.
Take your time, doll.

549
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,200
I'll just, uh, be here.

550
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,700
Where the hell are you guys?

551
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,800
You worked too quick, stallion.
We didn't have time to set up.

552
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
It's okay, Chuck.
We're on our way.

553
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,500
Did you flash on anything?

554
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,700
Abort mission! Abort mission!
Abort mission!

555
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,000
Gentleman.

556
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,400
You secure this area.

557
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,600
Ms. Banacheck and I are going
to need some privacy.

558
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,000
If the hotel room is rockin', then...

559
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,800
we're probably having sex.

560
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Get me out of here right now.

561
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,000
Charles, don't worry. Roan Montgomery
will get you out of this.

562
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I've been in worse situations.

563
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,700
Did I ever tell you
about the time in Thailand

564
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,700
with the king's daughter
up on the palace roof...

565
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,700
No, you failed to mention it.
How do I get out of here right now?

566
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,300
I want you to go out on the balcony.

567
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay, now what?

568
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,800
I want you to take a bedsheet,
tie it around your waist,

569
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,600
climb up on the railing,
and leap off the ledge.

570
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,000
Are you out of your mind?!
I'm not a real spy.

571
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,300
I don't leap!

572
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
There you are.

573
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,100
It's a little chilly out there, hmm?

574
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,900
No, not at all.
No, it's quite pleasant tonight.

575
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,500
Come on.

576
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,900
- Why so shy, hmm?
- Well, uh, um...

577
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,200
uh, well, 'cause...
'cause we just kind of met,

578
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,300
and, uh, kind of seeing
someone right now.

579
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,200
I'm going to do things to you.

580
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,000
you never,
never-never dreamed possible.

581
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, I have a very vivid imagination.

582
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,000
Hello, Roan.

583
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,100
You shouldn't have sent a boy
to do a man's job.

584
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,100
Get out of there! Now!

585
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
No-no, wait, wait!
Wait, wait,wait. Why would you...

586
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,100
oh, my God, that's a huge knife!

587
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,600
Look, you don't want to do this.
??

588
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
I'm a young guy...??

589
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,000
Don't beg for you life, Mr. Carmichael.

590
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,500
You have nothing to offer.

591
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,400
Well, I have this.

592
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,300
Roan, how did Thailand work again?

593
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,000
Roan?!

594
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,900
Roan!

595
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,300
Happy anniversary, honey.

596
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,800
Pervert!

597
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
No!

598
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,100
To a night of infinite possibilities.

599
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Sorry to interrupt.
Enjoy your night.

600
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,600
??
Please tell me somebody saw that.

601
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,500
Leaped from the balcony,
lands with a flourish.

602
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
And the Russian judge gives it a 9.4.

603
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,400
Oh, and by the way I have a little thing
called the Cipher if anyone's interested.

604
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Yes, Mr. Carmichael, I'm very interested.

605
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,800
There could be more.
We need to get out of here.

606
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,200
If you ever want to see
your fellow agents alive again,

607
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,100
meet me tomorrow with the Cipher.

608
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,700
6th and Alameda, 10:00 p.m.

609
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,700
Come alone.

610
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,400
Roan?

611
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,800
Roan?

612
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,800
<i>Why are we here so late?</i>

613
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,100
If you're not going to respect me...

614
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,100
you will fear me.

615
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,400
May I present...

616
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,600
The wheel of misfortune.

617
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,500
We had a version of this in my home
when I was growing up. It is...

618
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,100
very effective.

619
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,000
Now, my pretty, pretty staff...

620
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,800
I shall choose one of you
to christen the wheel.

621
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,600
Mr. Grimes.

622
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,800
He's not spinning.

623
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
Hold on a second, baby.

624
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,600
I'll spin.

625
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
I got this.

626
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,600
It's all good, guys.

627
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
??

628
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,900
You've got to be kidding me.
That's, that's just my luck.

629
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,000
You can't fire him.

630
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Anna, it's not me.
The wheel has spoken.

631
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,900
I would love to help,
but it's out of my hands.

632
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,000
Fine, if he's fired, I quit.

633
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,300
that's your choice then.

634
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,600
If Anna leaves,
I have to follow my heart.

635
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,700
I told you, you've got no shot.

636
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,600
Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey, stay here!

637
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,100
Without Jeff, this place blows.

638
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,900
What?!

639
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,500
Okay, fine! Fine! Go!

640
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,700
Go! Who needs you?

641
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,200
You're all fired!
You're all fired!

642
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,900
Do I have your attention now?

643
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,400
Do I have your attention now?!

644
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,600
You know, she's going to kill them.

645
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to take my chances then.

646
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,200
But I can't save them alone.

647
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,400
I need your help, Roan.

648
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,900
They knew what
they were getting into.

649
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,100
That's the game we play.

650
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
If you show up,

651
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,600
there will be three dead agents
instead of just two.

652
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,800
What, so that's it?

653
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,700
What happened to being
the world's greatest spy?

654
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,400
That was a long time ago.

655
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,500
Roan Montgomery is not the man
you see before you.

656
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,000
My life may be boring and cowardly,

657
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,300
but I'm alive.

658
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,700
That's more than most
in my line of work can claim.

659
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,700
But you're a legend, Roan.
Don't you understand that?

660
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,300
So how can you just sit there
and watch them die?

661
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Because I'm not in love
with one of the agents.

662
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm not...

663
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,000
I care about them.
I care about both of them.

664
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,200
Besides, we heard what she said. Okay?

665
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,700
To her, I'm just an asset.

666
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,300
No, you're not.

667
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,400
Trust me.

668
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,500
The lady doth protest too much.

669
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
But, Charles,

670
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,700
you have to ask yourself,

671
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,900
is she worth dying for?

672
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Yes.

673
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,400
Poor boy.

674
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,600
Lesson number one of being a spy:

675
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,800
never fall in love.

676
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,000
Well, then, I guess I'm not much of a spy.

677
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,800
And you're not much of a legend.

678
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,200
Listen to me very carefully.
I'm trying to reach General Beckman.

679
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,800
My name is Chuck Bartowski.

680
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,400
What do you mean I'm not listed?
Look, I'm a spy, all right?

681
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,600
Try my alias,
Charles Carmichael.

682
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm trying to contact General Beckman.

683
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,500
I need to speak with her before tonight.

684
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,000
Nothing?
Yeah, of course nothing.

685
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,700
Just have General Beckman
call me as soon as possible.

686
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,200
All right, it's an emergency.

687
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,100
Morning.

688
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,900
Oh, hey, Chuck.

689
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,000
- What's going on?
- Some trouble on the home front.

690
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,600
I totally screwed up.

691
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Went to Morgan for romance advice.

692
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,900
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's never a great policy.

693
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,700
??Yeah.

694
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,800
I've got to do something
to make this up to your sis.

695
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,400
What are you thinking about doing?

696
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,000
What I should've done last night.

697
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Cover this place in rose petals,

698
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,900
roaring fire, simple candlelit dinner,
pecan pie.

699
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,500
Maybe give her a foot massage
in the tub.

700
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,600
That's a natural place,
I think, to stop giving me details.

701
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,500
So why don't you?

702
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,400
Well, when, you know?

703
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,200
I've got to be at work
in like 20 minutes.

704
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,900
Got a 5:00 a.m. call tomorrow.

705
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,300
I'll do it.
I just hope I'm not too late.

706
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,200
??Charles.

707
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,100
Where is everybody?

708
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,500
Oh, you mean your coworkers?

709
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,200
Sure.

710
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,700
Yeah, we had little
a disagreement last night, Charles,

711
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,900
and some things needed to be done.

712
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,800
I fired the majority of the staff.

713
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,500
You what?!

714
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,100
I'm dead! I'm dead!
When Big Mike gets here,

715
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,300
he's going to see
there's no one in the store,

716
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,000
then he's going to fire me.
Charles, you've got to help me, man.

717
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,700
- How can I help you?
- Ask them to come back to work.

718
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,700
Why don't you??

719
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,200
'Cause then they won't fear me!??

720
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,500
Michael! Michael!

721
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,200
- So nice to see you, sir.
- Gentlemen.

722
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,600
Something amiss, Patel?

723
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,500
Morgan's on an errand,
Anna's in the stockroom...

724
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,600
- I mean your vest.
- Huh? Oh, yeah.

725
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
It's in my locker.
I was going to change right now.

726
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,100
And the manager's only donuts?

727
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,300
They're on your desk, sir.

728
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,400
Tight ship you're running, Patel.

729
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,300
Gentlemen.

730
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,600
Maybe he won't ever notice.

731
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,500
Depends on how long it takes him
to eat a box of donuts.

732
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Right.??

733
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,800
Thank you for coming.

734
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:58,800
What I didn't mention last night was
that everybody gets one practice spin.

735
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,600
So in all fairness, I got to
give Morgan here another shot, okay?

736
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,900
Here we go, come on now.

737
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,000
No one is spinning the wheel.

738
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You want us back,

739
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
you're going to have to make
some changes around here.

740
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,200
Okay. Okay.

741
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,100
Labor negotiations are part
of the process. Thoughts, musings?

742
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,300
We want two-hour lunch breaks.

743
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,200
No way.

744
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,700
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.

745
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,600
You got it, you got it.
You drive a hard bargain.

746
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,300
What else?

747
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,400
Unlimited bathroom time
for both resting and relaxation.

748
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,200
- Done.
- And you spin the wheel.

749
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,100
Anna, Anna,
I don't think that's necessary.

750
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,000
We were getting...

751
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,200
We're doing well here.
I don't think that I...

752
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
Live by the sword,
die by the sword.

753
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,000
You don't even know what that means.

754
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,400
- Yeah, diaper station duty!
- Baby needs wipe. Baby needs wipe.

755
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,300
Nice, nicely done.

756
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,600
Oh, yeah, you just go ahead
and bring that up to the front.

757
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,500
Mr. Bartowski.

758
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,100
Lovely cover
they've got you working.

759
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,600
Perhaps you would like to elaborate on
what you meant last night by "legend."

760
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,700
I meant what I said. You were great. Once.

761
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,000
Now, are you here to help,
or are you just browsing?

762
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,200
I suppose that depends on
what your plan is for tonight.

763
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,600
My plan is to show up
at the meeting spot

764
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,900
and exchange the Cipher
for Casey and Sarah.

765
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
You're determined to risk
your life for these people?

766
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,500
They do it for me.

767
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,100
Then perhaps we should
revise your plan.

768
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,400
Come up with something
that doesn't get us all killed.

769
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
I'm open to that.

770
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,100
I have a package for Sasha Banacheck.

771
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
You need to sign.

772
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,100
Hello?

773
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,800
All right, here's how
this is going to go down.

774
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,900
You want the Cipher,
you play by my rules.

775
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,400
Meet me at 9000 Burbank Boulevard
and bring the hostages.

776
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,600
It's her.

777
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Answer it.

778
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,400
Hello?

779
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,600
Oh, sorry, yeah.

780
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,200
You're just going to want
to take the 5 North.

781
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,600
That's probably the easiest.
You, you...

782
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,700
Burbank Boulevard exit, you're
going to make a left at the light.

783
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,200
Sorry, just...
you can find it.

784
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,800
Greetings!

785
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,300
I see you found your way.

786
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,600
Hope traffic wasn't too bad.

787
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,000
As you can see, I have the Cipher.

788
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,600
Once my friends are safely out
of the store,

789
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,000
I'll tell you where to find it.

790
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,400
It's been a pleasure
working with you,

791
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,800
and I wish you luck
in all your future enterprises.

792
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,100
Remember, we'll always have Paris.

793
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,900
Well...

794
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,500
now that your savior is trapped
with the Cipher,

795
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,300
I no longer need hostages.

796
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,000
So, good-bye.

797
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,900
I...

798
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
wouldn't do that if I were you.

799
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,900
Roan.

800
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Hello, Sasha.

801
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,700
I should have killed you years ago.

802
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,200
Yes. Probably.

803
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,800
Would you please drop your guns?

804
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,100
Who the hell is that?

805
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,600
That is Roan Montgomery.

806
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,100
Stand back, Roan...

807
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,600
...or I'll kill her.

808
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,000
No, no, no, no.

809
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,500
Charles. Where are you?

810
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,500
I'm on the roof.

811
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,600
Charles, remember Thailand?

812
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,800
This is not time
for one of your stories, Roan.

813
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,700
Remember Thailand!

814
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

815
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,100
you were on the palace roof
and you tied a bedsheet to...

816
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
No. No, no, no, no, no.

817
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,600
Charles, time to be a spy.

818
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,400
I'm not. I'm not a spy.

819
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,900
Bring me the Cipher right now
or I'll kill her!

820
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,600
I guess you got to die sometime.

821
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,700
It'd just be nice if it wasn't today.

822
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Sarah!

823
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,400
Chuck?

824
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,200
Chuck?

825
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,600
Are you okay?

826
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,900
I'm fine. I'm fine.
How are you?

827
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,800
I'm fine.

828
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Now, that's what I call a spy.

829
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,100
I ain't new.

830
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,900
Excellent work, team.

831
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,200
Thanks to your efforts,
we have the Cipher.

832
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,900
General, you should know that
Chuck was invaluable on this mission.

833
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,000
He also risked his life
several times to save ours.

834
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,800
Your country thanks you, Chuck.

835
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,700
Hopefully, we can now
rebuild the Intersect

836
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,100
and this nightmare
can be over for you.

837
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,500
Have a nice day.

838
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,200
Wait!

839
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,900
Actually, while I appreciate
all of your kind words,

840
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,300
if we're going to continue
to coexist happily,

841
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,600
I think that the government needs
to start pulling their weight around here.

842
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,300
What did you have in mind, Chuck?

843
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,300
<i>Ellie, I just want to apologize again.</i>

844
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,400
I know I may seem like Mr. Smooth,

845
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,400
but the truth is,
I don't have a million moves.

846
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,800
All I know is I love you.

847
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,700
I don't need moves, Devon.

848
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,900
Just the fact that
you're trying is enough.

849
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,900
Is that pecan pie?

850
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,400
I can't believe I fell for that!
You're the sweetest man...

851
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,900
No biggie, babe.

852
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,700
Well, be sure
and thank the CIA for me.

853
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
It's our pleasure.

854
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,200
I suppose I should thank you
for saving my life.

855
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,800
Oh, you've done it
for me a time or two.

856
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,100
I'm probably still in debt.

857
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,400
??that was pretty impressive.

858
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,800
Right?

859
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,900
I mean, come on.

860
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,000
I-I know I'm just an asset,

861
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,500
but, between the two of us,

862
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
I mean, have you ever seen anyone
do something like that before?

863
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,400
I think it's safe to say, Chuck,

864
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,300
that I've never seen anyone
quite like you.

865
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,300
Well, Agent Casey,

866
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,600
thanks for the accommodations.

867
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,400
Agent Montgomery.

868
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,100
The reason I failed you twice

869
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,200
was that your partner
at the time was too pretty to pass.

870
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,900
Should have failed her
a few more times.

871
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,100
Should have known.

872
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,000
<i>Adieu,</i> Agent Walker.

873
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,700
It was a real pleasure,
Agent Montgomery.

874
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,900
Well, I'll, um...
I'll see you later, Chuck.

875
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,500
Let her go.

876
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,300
A great man once said it will give her
the illusion of being pursued.

877
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,200
You trust me?

878
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,700
- Yeah.
- Good.

879
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,400
Do you own a white dinner jacket?

880
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,700
- No.
- Rent one.

881
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,400
Tonight you will show up
with a bottle of Ch‚teau Margaux,

882
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,400
the dinner jacket, and a single red rose,

883
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,100
known in several countries
as the Montgomery.

884
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,400
Good-bye, Charles.

885
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,900
Good-bye, Roan.

886
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,000
Hello, Diane.

887
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,400
Yeah, on my way to the airport.

888
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,400
Should be at Dulles by the morning.

889
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Chuck!

890
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,800
Hi.

891
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,800
Hello, Chuck.

892
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,900
- Bryce?
- Miss me?
