00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,869
I need an EMT in here now.

Car 39 requesting EMT.

13
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:26,047
Come on, now.
Let her through.
Let her through.

14
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:28,849
- Okay.
- Help me with this table.
Give her some room.

15
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,160
We've got paramedics on the way.
You're going to the hospital.

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,596
You're going to be okay.

17
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,827
We still haven't celebrated
my birthday, Pendrill.

18
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,927
I'm not going to let you
off the hook like this.

Let 'em through.
Let 'em through, please.

to be intubated immediately.

and he's not gonna die.

Sit down.

24
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,274
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:27,279
How did they know?

26
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:29,781
When you talked
to your girlfriend,
what did you say?

27
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:35,019
- Did you tell her
you were in D.C.?
- No.

28
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,113
Then there's someone inside.

29
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,956
- [Man]...three, lift.
- [Indistinct]

30
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:01,844
- What happened?
Who shot Pendrill?
- I don't know.

31
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:04,247
I got a call
about a federal witness
being transferred.

32
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:08,879
It's Sergeant Louis Frish.
He was the intended target.

33
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:11,219
There was supposed to be
a federal marshal here...

34
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:14,088
to put the sergeant
into protective custody.

35
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:16,685
- That order was countermanded.
- By whom?

36
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:20,391
- Louis Frish is being
put under military arrest.
- Military arrest?

37
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:24,369
For suspicion of murder
and providing false testimony
in a federal investigation.

38
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:27,065
He has testimony that
is damaging to the military.

39
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,371
His life is in danger.
He is not going anywhere.

40
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:34,504
The order to arrest this man
came out of the Office of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

41
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,947
who have also issued
a recommendation
on Agent Mulder.

42
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:38,985
For what?

43
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:42,044
Agent Mulder's also been put
under military arrest...

44
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:44,283
on charges of interference
with a military investigation...

45
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:46,484
into a crash
of a commercial airliner.

46
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,653
The military is responsible
for the downing of that plane.

47
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:53,199
They are admitting as much.

48
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,267
Sergeant Frish's story
is not the one they're telling.

49
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,803
What is their story?

50
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:17,446
I have a responsibility
for the safety of the agents
under my supervision.

51
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:20,025
I'm not going to put
another agent's life in jeopardy...

52
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:23,562
just to keep her
out in the field.

53
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,155
I'm fine.

54
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:29,793
I suggest you make sure of that
when you go to the hospital
with Agent Pendrill.

55
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,384
- I came to talk to you.
- About what?

56
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:53,426
A big ol' misunderstanding?

57
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:58,623
According to the military,
there was no misunderstanding.

58
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:01,292
So all of the sudden
they just decide
to take responsibility...

59
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,562
for the crash of Flight 549?

60
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:06,628
They had no choice.
Not in light of all the facts
that have come out.

61
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:09,766
Facts? Have you heard
their cover story:

62
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:12,812
that the control tower
gave bad coordinates
to a fighter pilot...

63
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,815
causing it to collide with Flight 549
over military airspace?

64
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:20,114
They allowed me
to listen to the recordings.

65
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,882
If you believe
in the coordinates
that Sergeant Frish...

66
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,890
gave to the fighter pilot...

67
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:28,085
were the exact path
that549 was on.

68
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,128
Now, they would indicate
that Sergeant Frish
and his co-controller...

69
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:34,292
could not have seen
Flight 549 in the airspace
until it was too late.

70
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,632
So they're saying
the tower put those jets
on a collision course.

71
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:41,572
Yes. And that they were
the only two aircraft
on the radar screen.

72
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:46,101
Realizing his guilt,
Sergeant Frish's fellow
officer put a gun to his head.

73
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:51,139
According to the air force,
Sergeant Frish lied
to save himself.

74
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:54,550
When he found out
that his fellow officer
committed suicide,

75
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,351
he came to us
to blame the military.

76
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:00,483
That's why they pursued him,
to bring him to justice.

77
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:03,153
And they could conveniently
lay the blame on a dead man.

78
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,458
Yes.

79
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:10,464
This, uh, second plane,

80
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:12,471
they say it's
a military fighter?

81
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,066
It was an F-1 5 Eagle, according
to an air force spokesman.

82
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,576
You believe that story, Scully?

83
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,507
I don't know what to believe.

84
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,583
Do you believe I got this
from an F-1 5 Eagle?

85
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:29,747
Those look like radiation burns.
Where did you get that?

86
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:31,950
At the second crash site...

87
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:34,959
in about 50 feet of water
at the bottom of Sacandaga Lake.

88
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,189
- You found it?
- Mm-hmm. I followed
a trail of bubbles...

89
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:40,858
down to a wreckage that didn't
look like anything that might
take off from an air force base.

90
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:42,765
What was it?

91
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:45,862
What collided with Flight 549
was a UFO...

92
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:49,272
shot down by the military,
taking the passenger plane
right along with it.

93
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:52,178
Except it can't be proven.

94
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,167
Except it can't be proven.

95
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:57,405
- Why not?
- Because they haven't been able
to find any physical evidence...

96
00:08:57,483 --> 00:09:00,043
that Flight 549
was involved in a collision.

97
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:04,021
- According to who?
- Mike Malar, the I.I.C., the man
running the investigation.

98
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,024
- How do you know he's not lying?
- I don't.

99
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:09,186
He seems to be the one man
who truly wants to figure out
what downed that plane,

100
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:12,561
and who came to me
with information
he had no reason to share.

101
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:14,566
What information?

102
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,795
He found Sharon Graffia
wandering in a daze
at the crash site...

103
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:21,340
the night we left
after seeing lights
over the area.

104
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:23,671
- Max Fennig's sister.
- That's another thing, Mulder.

105
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:27,645
- She's not Max Fennig's sister.
- Well, who is she?

106
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,773
She's an unemployed
aeronautical engineer...

107
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:32,409
who spent time in and out
of mental institutions.

108
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,419
That's where she met Max.

109
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:37,285
- Why would she lie?
- I don't know.

110
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:42,589
All I know is that this plane
seems to be killing people...

111
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,721
as it sits there
on the ground.

112
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:49,466
Mulder,
Agent Pendrill is dead.

113
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:57,369
- How?
- Shot in an attempt
on Sergeant Frish in Washington.

114
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,115
He saved his life, Mulder,
and maybe mine.

115
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:07,619
All right, Scully.
Scully?

116
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,781
Mulder, what are
these people dying for?

117
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:15,988
- Is it for the truth or for the lies?
- It's gotta be for the truth.

118
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,928
If we owe them anything,
it's to make sure of that.

119
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:25,898
Excuse me, sir.
Max Fennig?

120
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,939
- He's over there.
- Thank you.

121
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,687
Remember this place?

122
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:48,557
I remember being amazed
at what some people will call home.

123
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:51,927
You have to admit, the man had
an enduring sense of style.

124
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:57,300
- Only Max Fennig and you would
appreciate living like this.
- [Laughs]

00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:18,113
I think you were actually
kindred spirits
in some deep, strange way.

128
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,625
What do you mean?

simple in
their creature comforts,

130

for the complexity of their passions.

131
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:29,164
Mm, beans and weenies.

132
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,736
What exactly are we looking for
here, Mulder?

133
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:34,671
Something to explain what
Max was doing on that plane.

134
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,675
What he was coming to show me
or tell me.

135
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:39,234
What makes you think
that he was coming to see you?

136
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:42,280
Max is the key to all this.

137
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,816
He knew that plane was in danger
even before it took off,

138
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:46,818
before it entered
military airspace.

139
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:49,480
Now, how would he know that,

140
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,489
and what would be worth
taking that risk?

141
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:06,365
Hi. Max here,

142
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:08,406
but of course.

143
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:11,102
This is, uh,
well, quite obviously my story,

144
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:13,975
since I'm telling it.

145
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:17,539
Anyway, um, for those of you
who know me already...

146
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:21,212
this is going to be ancient
history, but for the rest of you
this is--

147
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,881
well, what can I say--
the story of my life.

148
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:27,392
All I ever wanted in life
was to be left alone.

149
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,394
[ Scoffs ]
Don't we all.

150
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:34,229
Uh, so just my luck
that I'd eventually
become an alien abductee.

151
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,636
Now I'm never alone. Any minute
when I'm least expecting it--

152
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:43,300
And the worst part is
no one believes you.

153
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:46,344
Oh, well, almost no one.

154
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:51,714
So, I've devoted my life
to providing all you
disbelievers with proof.

155
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:56,585
Proof that
there are extraterrestrial,
biological entities right now...

156
00:12:56,656 --> 00:13:00,854
visiting our planet
in alien ships for purposes
of a troubling agenda...

157
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:04,021
known only to certain members
of government, the FBI...

158
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:07,624
and certain high-ranking members
of the military industrial
community...

159
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,362
who have recovered
some of these very craft.

160
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,804
Not that they’d ever
admit to it publicly, of course.

161
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:19,243
Nor would they admit
that they have salvaged
some of this alien technology...

162
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:21,746
and are using it
in military applications.

163
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:24,510
No, that would be un-American.
And they won't admit it until...

164
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:29,988
someone confronts them
with irrefutable,
undeniable proof.

165

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,048
Max would have
wanted it that way.

494
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:21,057
You lost somebody
very close to you.

495
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,025
So did you.

496
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:49,244
You thinking
about Pendrill?

497
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,120
I realized I didn't even
know his first name.

498
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:58,954
I actually
was thinking about, uh,

499
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,056
this gift that you gave me
for my birthday.

500
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:06,365
You never got to tell me
why you gave it to me
or what it means.

501
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:09,406
But I think I know.

502
00:42:11,976 --> 00:42:16,845
I think that you appreciated
that there are extraordinary
men and women...

503
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:20,247
and extraordinary moments...

504
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,516
when history leaps forward
on the backs
of these individuals.

505
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:29,583
That what can be imagined
can be achieved.

506
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,561
That you must dare to dream.

507
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,397
But that there's no substitute
for perseverance and hard work...

508
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:39,902
and teamwork.

509
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:43,429
Because no one gets there alone.

510
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:48,909
And that while we commemorate
the-the greatness of these events...

511
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,914
and the individuals
who achieve them,

512
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:54,349
we cannot forget
the sacrifice of those...

513
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:57,854
who make these achievements
and leaps possible.

514
00:43:00,758 --> 00:43:03,522
I just thought it was
a pretty cool key chain.

515
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
