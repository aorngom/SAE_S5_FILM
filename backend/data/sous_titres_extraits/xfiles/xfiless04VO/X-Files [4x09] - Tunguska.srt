so help me God.

- I would like to read
from a prepared statement.
- You may do so.

to become an F.B.I. agent
four years ago...

"because I believed
in this country,

"because I wanted
to uphold its laws,
to punish the guilty...

the innocent.

- that it is no longer possible--"
- Agent Scully--

I would like to finish.

of Agent Mulder ?

- I respectfully decline to answer
that question, sir.
- Ms. Scully--

- You cannot refuse to answer.
- Because I believe answering
that question...

26

could endanger
Agent Mulder's life.

Are you tendering
your resignation, Agent Scully ?

Is that what
you're trying to say ?

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,240
No, sir.
What I am saying...

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,280
is that there is
a culture of lawlessness...

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,120
that has prevented me
from doing my job.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,840
That the real target
of this committee's investigation...

an idea, don’t you ?

description of those

Beyond adding evidence
to the debate...

it's relatively worthless.

fossilized remains, Dr. Sacks ?

I'm able to take a core sample.

advise you, Mr. Skinner...

211

that withholding information on
matters of national security...

212

advised, as a friend.

on a similar visa

226
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,160
He was coming from
Russian Georgia, carrying
some kind of toxic soil sample.

227
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,320
- Toxic ?
- Yes, which leads me to believe...

we intercepted are answers...

beyond the existence
of extraterrestrial life,

230

even beyond the conspiracy
to cover up that existence.

231
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,280

fossils of what is believed
to be alien bacteria,

is under intense debate.
