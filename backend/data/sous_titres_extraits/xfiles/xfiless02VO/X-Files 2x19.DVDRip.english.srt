00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,271
<i>(men shouting)</i>

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,072
- This is mutiny!
- No, sir, it's survival.

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,600
They'll come for us. They're sendin' help.

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,195
When they get here, it'll be too late.
It may already be too late.

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,350
Don't do this.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,908
That's an order!

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,111
Lieutenant Harper!

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,678
Shoot me if you want, Captain Barclay,
but I'm not winding up like the others.

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,271
Cast off!

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,671
Hit me.

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,351
<i>(beeping)</i>

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,474
- It looks like she's just driftin' out there.
- Mm. We're heading straight for her.

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,231
This is the <i>Lisette.</i> Canadian
fishing vessel CV 233. Please identify.

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,508
This is the <i>Lisette.</i> Come in, please.

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,634
Cut the engines and meet me up on deck.

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,511
Hello out there!

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,432
Hey!

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,356
We're throwin' you a line!
Grab it - we'll pull you in.

19
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,997
Is everybody all right? Are there any injured...

20
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,473
Thanks for comin'.

21
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,757
- What's so urgent?
- I didn't wanna waste any time.

22
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,436
A navy destroyer escort, the <i>USS Ardent,</i>
has been missing in the Atlantic for 42 hours.

23
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,796
- Missing?
- No radio contact, no distress signals.

24
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,269
Search planes haven't picked up anything.

25
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,673
- You're saying a ship and its crew vanished?
- That's what it looked like... until last night.

26
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,992
- A trawler picked up 18 survivors.
- They must have reported what happened.

27
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,153
Only one survivor is still alive.
He's in the ICU under heavy security.

28
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,036
- What is wrong with him?
- That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,551
They won't let me in, but your medical
background gets you a clearance code.

30
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,030
I want your opinion.
His name is Lieutenant Richard Harper.

31
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,476
- But, Mulder...
- Meet me at my office when you're finished.

32
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,551
Thank you.

33
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,830
Excuse me.
Is this Lieutenant Richard Harper?

34
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,480
That's what his wristband says.

35
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,708
- He's been identified?
- All military personnel are fingerprinted.

36
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,238
- Those records were crosschecked.
- Then I think there's been a mistake here.

37
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,957
According to this report,
Lieutenant Harper is 28.

38
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,550
Why hasn't a systemic workup been run?

39
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,237
I wasn't aware that my decisions required
your approval. I'm in charge of this patient.

40
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,311
Let me see your clearance.

41
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,234
What's going on here? How can you
explain what happened to this man?

42
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,788
This clearance code is invalid.

43
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,668
Where'd you get this? Who are you?

44
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,948
I am a medical doctor. I'd like to see
the autopsy reports on the victims.

45
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,717
I haven't time for this. Give me my patient's
chart and leave, before I have you removed.

46
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,878
- Something strange is going on.
- Did they let you see Lieutenant Harper?

47
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,032
I saw somebody,
but whether it was the lieutenant...

48
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,796
- What do you mean?
- He looked about 90. Off by half a century.

49
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,917
- You don't seem surprised.
- I wanna show you something.

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,639
This was the <i>Ardent's</i> course
when she disappeared.

51
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,554
I've tracked points of departure
and destination for each X-File.

52
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,155
On December 121949
a Royal Navy battleship disappeared...

53
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,789
...between Leeds and Cape Perry. The sea was
calm, the weather sunny.

54
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,758
In 1963, at the height of
the Cuban Missile Crisis...

55
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,312
...a Soviet fleet left from here for Havana.
All six vessels vanished without a trace.

56
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,509
I counted nine unexplained disappearances.
Each passed through here: The 65th parallel.

57
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,990
- Another Bermuda Triangle?
- More like a wrinkle in time...

58
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,277
...if Lieutenant Harper is any indication.

59
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,433
- Wrinkle in time? Wh...
- Heard about the Philadelphia Experiment?

60
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,750
It was a programme during World War Two
to render battleships invisible to radar.

61
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,470
But it was discontinued and most of the
scientists were relocated to Los Alamos.

62
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,916
Except none of them
ever made it to Los Alamos.

63
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,549
- Where were they sent?
- Roswell, New Mexico.

64
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,835
Are you suggesting that
the experiment used alien technology?

65
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,515
Nine months after the alleged crash
of a UFO in Roswell...

66
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,276
...the <i>USS Eldridge</i> disappeared altogether
from the Philadelphia navy yard...

67
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,796
...to reappear minutes later
miles away in Norfolk, Virginia.

68
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,870
That's not possible, not without
defying laws of time and space.

69
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,636
Those physicists may have been
trying to manipulate wormholes on Earth.

70
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,951
- Wormholes?
- Portals where matter interfaces with time...

71
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,474
...at a decelerated or accelerated rate.

72
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,711
I bet the military never stopped
the work it began 50 years ago.

73
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,436
- That's what you think happened to Harper?
- I'll know soon enough.

74
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,479
- I'm booked on an 8.30 flight to Norway.
- Have you let Skinner in on this?

75
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,078
I've given myself a 24-hour head start before
I give him my report. I want this one myself.

76
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,150
I'm going with you.

77
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,152
If that really was Lieutenant Harper,
I wanna know what happened to him.

78
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,872
<i>Nei, nei, det er altfor farlig.</i>

79
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,350
0 for 5.

80
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,113
What is it, Mulder? Why are they so afraid?

81
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,878
My father spent the better part
of his life at sea.

82
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,430
He had a healthy respect for the ocean,
but he never feared it.

83
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,750
I see fear in these men's eyes.

84
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,389
Brundtland couldn't have
taken you up there anyway.

85
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,558
A ship has to be classified ice class
before it can even go past the Lofoten Basin.

86
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,519
My name is Trondheim. Henry Trondheim.

87
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,636
The ship you want is the Zeal.

88
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,111
It's a 50-ton trawler
with a double hull. It's my ship.

89
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,192
- You're American.
- I was born and raised in Pensacola.

90
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,636
I ran a charter business there.
I got fed up with tourists.

91
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,712
How do you feel about the sea
north of Beerenberg?

92
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,234
This time of year, it'd be ten hours each way.

93
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,914
- So you've been there?
- A few times.

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,195
Got some of my best hauls out of there.

95
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,912
- Why is everyone else so afraid to go there?
- Well, legends. They grew up on stories.

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,797
What stories?

97
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,156
A huge stone came out of the sky,
crashed into the pack ice.

98
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,549
- A meteorite?
- An evil god.

99
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,550
They worship it by... stayin' away.

100
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,439
So... exactly what is it that
you're lookin' for up there?

101
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,229
A number of things.

102
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,952
How good are you?

103
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,556
About as good as you're going to get,
considering no one else will take you there.

104
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,111
- When can we leave?
- As soon as we shake on a price.

105
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,111
<i>(beeping)</i>

106
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,994
<i>(door opens)</i>

107
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,436
- Feeling any better?
- Oh... Lucky you inherited your father's legs.

108
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,988
- What?
- His sea legs.

109
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,311
It's been 12 hours.
You said it'd take ten. What's goin' on?

110
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,312
I told you before. The visibility is lousy.

111
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,271
I've never seen it this thick.

112
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,115
- How much longer till we get there?
- Well, we're right where you wanna be.

113
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,272
I even think we've got
what you're looking for.

114
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,636
Except one minute it's in front of us,
and the next it's not.

115
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,314
Like something's messing with my radar.

116
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,835
And my navigation system.

117
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,629
- I can't explain it.
- <i>Kaptein! Pass på!</i>

118
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,990
We're gonna hit!

119
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,720
Halvorsen, check the hull for damage.

120
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,749
<i>(Trondheim)</i> I don't get it.
<i>This</i> is what you're lookin' for?

121
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,870
<i>(Mulder)</i> It's the <i>USS Ardent.</i>
It's a destroyer escort.

122
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,199
All right.

123
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,475
What do <i>you</i> want with it, anyway?

124
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,675
It's a ghost ship.

125
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,754
I mean, look at all this corrosion. No one's
been aboard this vessel in 20, 30 years.

126
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,751
Scully.

127
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,074
Let's check the crew quarters first.

128
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,877
Mulder.

129
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,393
They almost look mummified.

130
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,517
Hm. Like they've been dead
a very long time.

131
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,511
Except for this strange residue.

132
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,999
<i>(engine starts)</i>

133
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,071
- What was that?
- An engine.

134
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,310
It's... my ship!

135
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,750
- No! That's my ship!
- Hey!

136
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,189
- Somebody's taken my ship!
- Hey!

137
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,953
<i>(Trondheim)</i> Hey!

138
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,473
- That's my ship!
- Trondheim!

139
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,597
No.

140
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,118
All right. Try it again.

141
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,760
<i>(flicks switch)</i> No.

142
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,831
What is it?

143
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,959
It's caked with the same residue
that's covering everything.

144
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,998
So we can't even send a distress signal.

145
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,917
The engine's so corroded you can't even tell
what it is. I've never seen anything like it.

146
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,312
Halvorsen's trying to salvage some parts,
but basically we are dead in the water.

147
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,951
The radio's dead, too.

148
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,710
Somebody's not tellin' me
what's goin' on here.

149
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,233
Now, look, that ship was notjust
my livelihood, that was my life!

150
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,914
I have a right to some straight answers!

151
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,993
What we're seeing here may be
the result of a military experiment.

152
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,479
Military experiment?

153
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,269
A time bend, where matter moves
through time at an accelerated rate.

154
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,352
- Tell me in English.
- Time may be speeding up.

155
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,708
Right. That's almost as crazy as Halvorsen's
"There's a rock that comes from the sky..."

156
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,075
This ship was launched in 1991.

157
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,359
I don't know how else to explain the extent
of the corrosion or the decay of the bodies.

158
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,193
You're not buyin' any of this, are ya?

159
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,475
- <i>(bang)</i>
- <i>(Halvorsen)</i> Agh!

160
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,511
<i>(door creaks)</i>

161
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,394
<i>(tapping)</i>

162
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,631
Oh, God.

163
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,354
- What happened?
- His skull's been fractured.

164
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,795
<i>(Trondheim)</i> Who's that?

165
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,189
- Halvorsen!
- <i>(bang)</i>

166
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,512
<i>(clanking)</i>

167
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,310
Who are you?

168
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,516
Captain Barclay...

169
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,115
...commanding officer, <i>USS Ardent.</i>

170
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,311
There you go.

171
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,270
Captain Barclay... according to your log,
after the navigation system failed...

172
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,909
...several of your crew members
saw something in the sea.

173
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,991
A growing light.

174
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,951
It-it came up through the fog
in the middle of the night.

175
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,996
Like it was on fire.

176
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,509
- Any idea what it might have been?
- Power loss.

177
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,196
Everythin' stopped.

178
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,111
Everythin'.

179
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,634
Even the sea.

180
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,836
Even the wind.

181
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,798
Then the ship, my ship, she began to bleed.

182
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,838
From the hull, through the rivet seams.

183
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,395
He's a drunkard.

184
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,675
He's a drunkard!

185
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,516
And he killed Halvorsen.

186
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,956
To hell with him!
I don't have to listen to his lies.

187
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,998
I'm no liar. It happened.

188
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,880
First to some of my men, then to all of 'em.

189
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,029
<i>(Scully)</i> What happened?

190
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,515
Time got lost.

191
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,714
<i>(wheezes)</i>

192
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,195
It's OK, Captain. You can take it easy.

193
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,477
We're gonna do
whatever we can to help you out.

194
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,796
What can you do?

195
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,950
You can't do anythin'.

196
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,508
I'm 35 years old.

197
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,552
- There's no way he killed Halvorsen.
- I agree.

198
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,757
The blow was delivered
with considerable strength...

199
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,593
...and he can't even
hold a glass with two hands.

200
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,672
That means there's somebody else on board.

201
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,515
You were a good first mate.

202
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,592
You left me alone and you did yourjob.

203
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,115
It's a shame this had to
happen to you so young.

204
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,629
<i>Gud være med deg.</i>

205
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,677
<i>(Mulder)</i> Put it down! Put down the pipe!

206
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,591
Put it down!

207
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,431
<i>(pipe clatters)</i>

208
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,791
<i>(kicks pipe)</i>

209
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,516
- I could kill you...
- <i>(Mulder)</i> Back off!

210
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,354
- He killed Halvorsen!
- He may help us figure out what happened.

211
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,352
Look at him! He hasn't aged. Back off!

212
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,916
His name's Olafsson.

213
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,992
- You know him?
- Everybody in Tildeskan knows him.

214
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,072
He's a pirate whaler. He's a wanted criminal.

215
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,158
He supplies whales to the Japanese
black market. Blues, belugas, sperm.

216
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,037
Ask him how he got here.

217
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,032
<i>Hvordan kom du hit?</i>

218
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,192
<i>Gå til helvete.</i>

219
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,271
I don't need a translator for that.

220
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,239
We'll question him later.
I don't wanna leave Scully alone.

221
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,472
- Get in the hull!
- I think we found who killed Halvorsen.

222
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,518
He'd have killed me too
if it wasn't for Mulder.

223
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,388
The log says four Norwegians
were picked up when their vessel sank.

224
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,195
I guarantee Olafsson's men
took my boat and left him stranded.

225
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,840
It's just like them to slit each other's throats.

226
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,673
We should ask the captain
some more questions.

227
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,274
Captain Barclay's dead.

228
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,239
I don't know how it happened.
It was just in the last 15 minutes.

229
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,588
It's just like those men below.

230
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,231
It's more than rapid ageing, Mulder.
It's as if he's turning into a pillar of salt.

231
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,439
- Is that what the substance is?
- It seems to be crystalline, but beyond that...

232
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,271
We're all tired.

233
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,956
Let's stow the captain's body.
Tie up Olafsson so we can all get some rest.

234
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,752
I'll take first watch, in case he's not alone.

235
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,951
<i>(beeping)</i>

236
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,351
- Scully?
- Hm?

237
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,595
I just fell asleep.

238
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,673
- You want a few more minutes?
- <i>(clears throat)</i> No, I'm up.

239
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,551
Scully!

240
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,029
Mulder, what happened to you?

241
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,517
<i>(Scully)</i> Time acceleration
is an equation, Mulder. A theory.

242
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,592
Then theoretically it's possible.
What else could it be?

243
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,069
<i>(Scully)</i> Whatever it is, it isn't a time warp.

244
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,755
None of us has observed
the phenomena recorded in the ship's log.

245
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,472
- No evidence indicates this is a time warp.
- We're evidence! We're ageing by the minute!

246
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,394
If this is rapid-ageing phenomena,
why hasn't our hair greyed?

247
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,869
Then what about him? Huh?

248
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,109
What about him? Why isn't <i>he</i> getting old?

249
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,358
<i>Hvorfor blir du ikke gammel?</i>

250
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,513
- Relax, Trondheim. Save your energy...
- I don't have to listen to you!

251
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,912
- It's because of <i>you</i> that we got into this.
- Nobody twisted your arm.

252
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,753
I signed on to bring you <i>here.</i>

253
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,831
Not to die.

254
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,515
- What do you know about free radicals?
- Is this a quiz?

255
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,834
They're highly reactive chemicals
containing extra electrons.

256
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,596
They can attack DNA. They can cause our
body tissue and cell membranes to oxidise.

257
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,839
- Grow old, you mean.
- It's the prevailing theory on how we age.

258
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,190
- Something is triggering that reaction in us?
- This is just a theory...

259
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,796
...but what if this ship is drifting towards
another metallic source, like a meteor?

260
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,391
Maybe it's deep in the ocean
or embedded into an iceberg.

261
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,519
But the two could be acting
as positive and negative terminals...

262
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,672
...with the ocean itself
being a kind of giant battery.

263
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,833
That electromagnetic energy
could be exciting the free radicals...

264
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,471
...and effectively oxidising
every piece of matter in its field.

265
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,429
Makes sense, Scully. The organic equivalent
to rust would be rapid premature senescence.

266
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,317
What the hell?

267
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,397
Captain Barclay said the ship was bleeding.

268
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,309
It's not blood, Scully.

269
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,391
It's rust.

270
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,433
Trondheim, you keep an eye on Olafsson.

271
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,157
- Where are you going?
- Mulder... where <i>are</i> we going?

272
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,392
I'm not sure yet, but we don't
have much time to get there.

273
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,635
D'you see this yellow pipe?
It's the only one that hasn't corroded through.

274
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,391
<i>(squeaking)</i>

275
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,354
<i>(Mulder)</i> Olafsson and his men.

276
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,069
Why would they hole up here?

277
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,673
This is the only drinkable water on the ship.

278
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,070
We were both wrong, Scully. It's the water.

279
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,357
- All the other water's been contaminated.
- How?

280
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,237
Something must have got into the
desalination tanks, where the water is stored.

281
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,279
But the water in the sewage system
is recycled. It doesn't come from the sea.

282
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,672
If you're right, then Captain Barclay's
drinking binge is what kept him alive.

283
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,150
And the water from this tank
will do the same for us.

284
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,031
But it doesn't sound like
there's very much left.

285
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,351
<i>(slurping)</i>

286
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,790
You were supposed to watch him.

287
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,991
I feel pretty bad about it.

288
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,355
I shouldn't have dozed off.

289
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,390
What do you want me to say? He's gone.

290
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,995
- I wanna know what happened!
- I can ask the same of you. You tied him up.

291
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,833
There's nothing wrong with my knot!
This was severed.

292
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,357
I don't like being interrogated.
I don't owe you any explanations.

293
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,991
- Trondheim!
- Let go of me.

294
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,360
Look, we have a lot of work to do here.

295
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,352
I'll need blood and urine samples
from both of you.

296
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,078
- What for?
- We found out what caused the ageing.

297
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,079
What is it now?
The two of you are full of theories.

298
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,759
First it's one thing, then another.
By the time you figure it out, we'll be dead.

299
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,039
Something got into the desal tanks, but
the water in the sewage system is untainted.

300
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,875
It kept Olafsson alive this long.
Maybe it'll slow the process in us.

301
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,554
This is good news, isn't it?

302
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,672
So what happens now?

303
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,870
<i>(Scully) It has been 18 hours, 45 minutes</i>
<i>since the onset of symptoms.</i>

304
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,149
<i>Rudimentary blood tests revealed impossibly</i>
<i>high concentrations of sodium chloride: Salt.</i>

305
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,071
<i>Though the contaminated water</i>
<i>itself is not saline...</i>

306
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,871
<i>... it appears to catalyse existing body fluids,</i>
<i>causing massive and rapid cellular damage.</i>

307
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,788
<i>The untainted water slowed the degenerative</i>
<i>progression in Trondheim and me.</i>

308
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,519
<i>But Mulder has fared less well.</i>

309
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,513
<i>Perhaps because of the dehydration</i>
<i>he suffered on the way here.</i>

310
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,478
I think I just lapped George Burns.

311
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,875
I'll be right back.

312
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,032
If you've got something to say, say it,
but don't hover behind me like that.

313
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,318
- The water isn't helping him.
- Then maybe we should double his ration.

314
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,269
- What for? A lake of water won't help him.
- We don't know that for sure.

315
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,910
- Not yet.
- Look at him!

316
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,635
- We've wasted too much water on him.
- Who are you to decide?

317
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,157
You don't have to be a doctor
to see that... he isn't gonna make it.

318
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,835
But you and me, Scully...

319
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,470
...you and me, we'd better
start lookin' out for ourselves.

320
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,553
<i>Mulder's urinalysis continues</i>
<i>to indicate his kidneys'failure...</i>

321
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,474
<i>... to excrete the substance</i>
<i>I'm calling "heavy salt".</i>

322
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:09,556
<i>Whether the untainted water from the sewage</i>
<i>system is even helping him at all is unclear.</i>

323
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,031
<i>What does remain clear to me...</i>
<i>is that I can't give up trying.</i>

324
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,351

327
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,910
Trondheim!

328
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,717
- What are you doing?
- Listen to this.

329
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,232
<i>(water trickling)</i>

330
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,551
You know what that is? It's a funeral bell.

331
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,916
There's only a few gallons left. Maybe less.

332
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,670
There's enough to keep us
all alive for a few more days.

333
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,275
Or one of us alive long enough to be rescued.

334
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,594
Don't come any closer.

335
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,148
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

336
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,353
Trondheim... listen to me.

337
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,393
The navy knows where we are. They know
these coordinates and they'll be here soon.

338
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,918
- So why don't we go back to the mess hall...
- Why don't you just shoot me?

339
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,470
If you think that I'm gonna
let Mulder have another drop!

340
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,757
Trondheim!

341
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,599
Trondheim!

342
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,314
You're almost out of pages.

343
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,868
It's good you kept a record.

344
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,798
Trondheim's locked himself
in the sewage hold.

345
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,793
He's back-flushed all the water
and he's keeping it for himself.

346
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,029
I looked everywhere...

347
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,680
...and this is all I could find.

348
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,433
It's sardine juice, half a dozen lemons...

349
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,115
...and, uh... the water from a snow globe.

350
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,909
- It's not Evian, but...
- You go ahead and drink it.

351
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,789
- No, Mulder.
- It's the only logical choice. You're a woman.

352
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,911
Your life expectancy is greater and your
body retains more water and fatty tissues.

353
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,877
More reason for you to drink it.

354
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,078
You'll have a much greater chance
of surviving until help comes.

355
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,355
- Don't do this, Mulder.
- Don't... don't be so stubborn, Scully.

356
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,715
You know I'm right.

357
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,919
Well, there isn't much liquid
to make a difference anyway.

358
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,275
There might be.

359
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,678
No.

360
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,228
<i>(groaning)</i>

361
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,391
What was that?

362
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,274
The outer hull must have finally corroded
through, which means we're taking on water.

363
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,077
Mulder...

364
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,151
...the water.

365
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,318
<i>(banging and rumbling)</i>

366
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,351
<i>(screaming)</i>

367
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,955
I can't open the door!

368
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,632
Help!

369
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,029
Help me!

370
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,629
Help me! Help! Help!

371
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,994
<i>(bangs on door)</i> Help me!

372
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,878
Help me! Oh... Oh...

373
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,314
I always thought when I got older
I'd maybe take a cruise somewhere.

374
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,789
But this isn't exactly what I had in mind.

375
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,030
The service on this ship is terrible, Scully.

376
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,955
It's not fair.

377
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,715
It's not our time.

378
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,551
We still have work to do.

379
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,077
Mulder...

380
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,560
...when they found me...

381
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,670
...after the doctors and
even my family had given up...

382
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,358
...I experienced something
I never told you about.

383
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,278
Even now it's hard to find the words.

384
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,874
But there's one thing I'm certain of.

385
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,473
As certain as I am of this life.

386
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,194
We have nothing to fear when it's over.

387
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,551
I'm so tired.

388
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,830
You should sleep.

389
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,911
<i>Agent Fox Mulder lost consciousness at</i>
<i>approximately 4.30 this morning, 12 March.</i>

390
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,560
<i>There is nothing more I can do for him.</i>

391
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,437
<i>Or for myself.</i>

392
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,152
<i>Supplies are exhausted. No food</i>
<i>or liquid consumed for over 24 hours.</i>

393
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,837
<i>The outer hull most probably flooded, though</i>
<i>for now the inner hull is supporting the ship.</i>

394
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,392
<i>Among Halvorsen's belongings</i>
<i>I found a children's book of Norse legends.</i>

395
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,268
<i>From what I can tell,</i>
<i>the pictures show the end of the world.</i>

396
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,876
<i>Not in a sudden firestorm of damnation,</i>
<i>as the Bible teaches us...</i>

397
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,112
<i>... but in a slow-covering blanket of snow.</i>

398
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,398
<i>First the moon and the stars</i>
<i>will be lost in a dense, white fog.</i>

399
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,359
<i>Then the rivers and the lakes</i>
<i>and the sea will freeze over.</i>

400
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,639
<i>And finally, a wolf named Skoll</i>
<i>will open his jaws and eat the sun...</i>

401
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,470
<i>... sending the world into an everlasting night.</i>

402
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,958
<i>I think I hear the wolf at the door.</i>

403
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,116
Agent Scully?

404
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,395
Agent Scully, can you hear me?

405
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,596
Mm, yeah.

406
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,875
It's been 36 hours since your rescue.

407
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,157
I've got you on dialysis with a high-flux filter.

408
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,548
You're obviously responding well.

409
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,518
Your electrolytes
are almost back to normal...

410
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,478
...and your fluid status has been corrected.

411
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,910
Mulder? Where is he?

412
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,429
His endocrine system
was more compromised than yours.

413
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,832
Frankly, we didn't think that he'd make it.
Until we discovered this.

414
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,799
Based on your notes, we're giving him
synthetic hormones, which seem to work.

415
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,670
Whatever caused this is still out there.
I have to talk to a naval liaison.

416
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,833
- We have to salvage the ship...
- Agent Scully, the ship was taking on water.

417
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,310
It sank less than an hour
after you were rescued.
