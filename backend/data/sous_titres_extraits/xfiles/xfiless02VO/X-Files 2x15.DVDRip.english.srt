<i>(baby grizzling)</i>

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,231
Your turn.

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,951
<i>(baby crying)</i>

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,871
Jack?

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,232
<i>(Jack vomiting)</i>

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,038
Honey?

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,588
Are you still feeling sick?

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,238
What's the matter with you?
Can't you hear the baby is crying?

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,788
<i>(baby bawling)</i>

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,274
How about some cereal, honey?

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,838
You were having those awful
dreams again last night.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,560
I didn't sleep long enough to be dreaming.

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,713
I want you to go to the doctor.
Find out what's wrong.

14
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,199
- Will you do that?
- I'd just like to eat my breakfast in peace!

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,074
Do you think that's possible?

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,672
<i>(baby starts crying)</i>

17
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,878
Jack! What is it?!

18
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,395
Private John McAlpin.
One of the few, the proud, but dead.

19
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,472
He wrapped his car around a tree.
He died on impact.

20
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,472
Drug and alcohol tests came back negative.

21
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,791
The car shows no evidence
of mechanical failure.

22
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,590
The military is calling it a suicide.
It's the second one in as many weeks.

23
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,276
- Both at the same base?
- Yeah, except it's not exactly a base.

24
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,518
The Marines were stationed at the
Folkstone Processing Center, North Carolina.

25
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,876
More than 12,000 refugees waiting
for asylum from Uncle Sam.

26
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,476
- Wasn't there a riot there a month ago?
- Yeah. A ten-year-old boy was killed.

27
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,155
- Details of his death were never released.
- Why did the military contact us?

28
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,631
They didn't. Mrs McAlpin
contacted the Bureau...

29
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,679
...when the military refused to investigate
her husband's death further.

30
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,069
She doesn't believe it was suicide.

31
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,673
There.

32
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,513
This is the tree that stopped
Private McAlpin's car.

33
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,389
The state police reported
there was graffiti on the bark.

34
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,274
Looks like some kind of ritual symbol.

35
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,830
Most of the refugees at Folkstone are Haitian.

36
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,235
Mrs McAlpin believes voodoo
was behind her husband's death?

37
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,474
Mrs McAlpin doesn't believe her husband
killed himself. She wants to know who did.

38
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,029
Jack used to tell these jokes.

39
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,358
Well, they were pretty dumb, I guess.

40
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,318
But the way he told them
always made me laugh.

41
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,515
Then he got transferred to the camp,
and nothing was very funny any more.

42
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,593
Did he ever discuss what went on there?
What his duties included?

43
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,354
No. He'd just come home angry.

44
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,431
Mostly at himself, though sometimes
he'd turn it on Luke and me.

45
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,830
Was he ever treated for depression or stress?

46
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,675
No. I tried getting him to talk
to someone... even our minister.

47
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,036
But Jack believed in dealing
with his own problems.

48
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,270
Did he believe in voodoo?

49
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,150
The Marines, his family and football
sums up everything Jack believed in.

50
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,232
So when did you first think that his death
involved something out of the ordinary?

51
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,073
One of the boys in his squad...
told me what they found at the accident.

52
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,270
And he said it was some
kind of voodoo curse.

53
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,639
The same one they found on the stool
that Puerto Rican boy used to hang himself.

54
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,951
- Who told you that?
- Harry Dunham.

55
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,672
He's from New Orleans, so he's
superstitious about that type of thing.

56
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,909
What about you?

57
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,633
My husband had just died, so I didn't
give it much thought either way.

58
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,679
Not until Luke dug this up out of his
sandbox.

59
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,032
I know it sounds crazy,
me worrying about all this.

60
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,909
The truth is I'm scared.

61
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,589
I'm scared for my child...

62
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,629
...and I just don't know what to do any more.

63
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,318
It's down there on the right, sir.

64
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,074
<i>(man speaks Haitian)</i>

65
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,835
<i>Va tu! Va tu!</i> Go! Go! Go away!
Get out of here! Go! Go!

66
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,070
Away! Go! Go!

67
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,833
He's crazy. Too much rum.

68
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,798
For such a pretty lady,
it is dangerous out here.

69
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,792
You need something <i>pour vous garder.</i>

70
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,070
For protection.

71
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,277
- Your lucky charm.
- Come on, Mulder.

72
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,157
- How much?
- Five. I mean ten.

73
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,549
I'll give you five.

74
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,797
- OK.
- Let's go, Mulder.

75
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,873
You should always carry protection.
There you go.

76
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,795
I'm still not clearjust what it is
you're investigating here.

77
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,714
Two of your men have died in two weeks,
allegedly of self-inflicted injuries.

78
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,519
I've taken every measure
to see it doesn't happen again.

79
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,118
I've even flown in the 528th Combat Stress
Control Detachment from Camp Lejeune.

80
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,714
But your soldiers aren't in combat.

81
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,189
What we're dealing with here is worse.

82
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,713
How so?

83
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,553
We're soldiers. We're not prison guards.

84
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,837
We're policing a hostile
population of foreigners...

85
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,675
...without the resources to feed or house
them. There are bound to be some conflicts.

86
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,832
So your men bear the brunt
of the refugees' frustration?

87
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,878
It's hatred, plain and simple.

88
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,951
They hate us.

89
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,269
And all I can do is... see that they're
processed as efficiently as possible.

90
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,832
Colonel Wharton, a, uh... certain ritual sign
was found at the scene of both deaths.

91
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,196
- Is there anything you can tell us about that?
- Not much.

92
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,397
Apparently it's some sort of voodoo marking.

93
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,916
But you haven't investigated it
as a possibility?

94
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,434
Possibility of what?

95
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,350
All I know is voodoo caused
a riot in my camp.

96
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,313
One night they held some secret ceremony.
The next day all hell broke loose.

97
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,949
We understand a refugee
was killed. A young boy.

98
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,918
No one felt that tragedy more deeply than me.

99
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,232
I was able to isolate the one responsible
for instigating all the trouble.

100
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,036
- Who would that be?
- His name is Bauvais. Pierre Bauvais.

101
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,668
- Thinks he's some kind of revolutionary.
- Do you think we could speak with him?

102
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,196
If you don't mind listening to
his laundry list of complaints.

103
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,195
I'd also like to examine Private McAlpin's
body. I have a signed consent from his wife.

104
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,637
Private Dunham will help you both
with whatever you need.

105
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,358
Cause of death was no great mystery.
That boy was doing 60 when he hit the tree.

106
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,752
- So they pronounced him at the scene?
- His head was hanging like a broken peony.

107
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,434
And he had no cardiac functioning.

108
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,833
I saw no reason to conduct an autopsy then
and I still don't. You can see for yourself.

109
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,109
What kind of a sickjoke is this?

110
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,078
Jackson! Who the hell's been in here?

111
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,597
Someone's tampered with McAlpin's
body, and I wanna know who!

112
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,156
- You're Harry Dunham.
- Yes, sir.

113
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,151
You knew Private McAlpin.

114
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,789
His wife said you were friends.

115
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,396
We were in the same squad.

116
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,472
Any idea why he might've killed himself?

117
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,311
I can't say, sir.

118
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,955
Can't say, or you won't say?

119
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,233
I'll be right here if you need me.

120
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,596
My name is Mulder. I'm with the FBI.

121
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,476
I was hoping you could answer questions
about the Marines who took their own lives.

122
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,430
It is a terrible shame.

123
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,072
I'm not convinced it's as simple as that.

124
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,119
You do not believe <i>I was</i>
involved in this, do you?

125
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,470
How could I be...

126
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,597
...when they keep me locked up in here.

127
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,910
You tell me.

128
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,232
These photographs were taken
at the sites of both deaths.

129
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,392
The shell was found buried under
one of the soldiers' homes.

130
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,274
Can you tell me about the symbol?

131
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,917
Why?

132
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,037
What do you expect to learn from this?

133
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,156
Just the truth.

134
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,119
One of the Marines left behind a wife.
She's too frightened to even mourn.

135
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,794
She deserves some peace of mind.

136
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,479
It is the <i>loco-miroir...</i>

137
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,431
...the crossroads between the two worlds.

138
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,436
The mirror in which a man
must confront his true self.

139
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,993
These... Marines...

140
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,240
...maybe they did not like what they saw.

141
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,236
Colonel Wharton says you
incited the riot last month.

142
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,712
My country was born on the blood of slaves.

143
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,478
Freedom is our most sacred legacy.

144
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,632
Does that mean you'd kill to preserve it?

145
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,914
Wharton will not let us return home.

146
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,389
Which is all we ask.

147
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,040
Mulder, I need to speak with you.

148
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,033
She's come to tell you... the Marine is gone.

149
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,517
- How did <i>you</i> know?
- It's the spirits.

150
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,710
<i>Loa</i> have warned you.

151
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,154
Somebody stole McAlpin's body
and replaced it with a dog's corpse.

152
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,118
<i>(Bauvais)</i> They will only warn you once.

153
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,837
After that, no magic can save you.

154
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,919
Come on, Scully. Let's go.

155
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,234
What do you think happened
to Private McAlpin?

156
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,993
Bauvais must've switched the bodies.

157
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,358
- But he's been confined for the last month.
- Then he had somebody else do it.

158
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,115
You said there was no evidence.
And security's impossible to breach.

159
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,919
Whoever did it was clever and thorough.

160
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,276
I wasn't suggesting that
some kind of spirit did it.

161
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,234
Well, just in case,
I believe in covering my bases.

162
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,869
Mulder, voodoo only works
by instilling fear in its believers.

163
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,713
You saw how Bauvais tried to intimidate me.

164
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,395
I'll admit the power of suggestion
is considerable, but...

165
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,552
...this is no more magic
than a pair of fuzzy dice.

166
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,468
Scully, look out!

167
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,314
Hey!

168
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,752
Private McAlpin?

169
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,074
He's non-verbal... non-responsive
to voice, touch or pain.

170
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,631
The neurologists suspect he suffered a
severe concussion, resulting in amnesia.

171
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,474
A plausible diagnosis. Only I'm more
interested in how he came back to life.

172
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,630
Well, obviously, he never left.

173
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,748
Dr Foyle made a gross mistake
when he signed the death certificate.

174
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,832
- Did you get a copy of the blood test?
- Yeah.

175
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,676
Electrolytes, white and red
counts are all normal.

176
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,478
Except this is strange.

177
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,031
The lab detected trace levels
of tetrodotoxin in his blood.

178
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,148
That's a poison found in the reproductive
organs of puffer fish, a Japanese delicacy.

179
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,518
Only I get the feeling that Private McAlpin
didn't frequent many sushi bars.

180
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,479
- You have a theory how it got in his blood?
- What do you know about zombies?

181
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,712
I hope you don't tell Robin McAlpin
that she married one.

182
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,156
In 1982 a Harvard ethnobotanist
named Wade Davis...

183
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,199
...did extensive field research in Haiti
on the zombification phenomenon.

184
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,319
He analysed several samples of zombie
powder prepared by voodoo priests.

185
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,553
- He found tetrodotoxin in all of them.
- Mulder, it's a lethal poison.

186
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,714
Small doses can depress cardiorespiratory
activities to such a low level...

187
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,109
...that the victim appears clinically dead.

188
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,715
- Zombie or not, Jack McAlpin is alive.
- Exactly.

189
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,477
Which is what makes me wonder about the
other Marine who allegedly killed himself.

190
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,478
Why would they bury Private Guttierez here?

191
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,118
<i>(growling)</i>

192
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,039
<i>(barking)</i>

193
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,519
<i>(growling)</i>

194
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,716
They beat you to it.

195
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,554
You're the FBI, aren't ya?

196
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,272
Yeah.

197
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,911
We've arranged to exhume
the body of Manuel Guttierez.

198
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,116
I prepared the dig as soon as
I got the order, but it's too late.

199
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,749
- Too late?
- Yeah, the body snatchers got there first.

200
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,312
I caught 'em a few times right in the act,
but... it's gettin' I can't keep up any more.

201
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,153
That's, uh... why I got this.

202
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,277
Don't the police intervene?

203
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,750
They got their hands full
just tryin' to protect the living.

204
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,389
I'm all these people have
to preserve their rest.

205
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,392
These body snatchers,
what do they do with the bodies?

206
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,040
- They sell 'em.
- To who?

207
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,910
Well, it varies. When the local medical
school ran short of cadavers...

208
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,151
...rumour had it that the
snatchers got $200 a head.

209
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,755
But mostly it's the voodoo
types who do the buying.

210
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,956
A lot of folks in these parts go in for that...

211
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,112
...with the medicines and the potions and...

212
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,031
Here we are.

213
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,669
Look at that. They dug him up
right under my nose.

214
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,957
How's he supposed to rest in peace like this?

215
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,958
They can do what they like
with the pigs and the chickens.

216
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,429
But this is a desecration.

217
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,158
This is uncool.

218
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,231
Mulder...

219
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,430
Look at that. See what I'm talking about?

220
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,429
Let us take care of this.

221
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,312
Knock yourselves out.

222
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,958
Hey!

223
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,871
Let me be! I didn't do nothing!
What did I do?!

224
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,190
- Maybe you can tell us.
- Let me be!

225
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,589
<i>(croaking)</i>

226
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,193
Maybe I should kiss a few
and find out if one is Guttierez.

227
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,516
Fresh bones. They pay good.

228
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,870
But I go there for the frogs.
You find the best frogs at the cemetery.

229
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,109
How do you get out of the camp?

230
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,956
I go and then I come back.

231
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,868
What about your parents?
Are your parents at the camp?

232
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,349
What about a name?

233
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,236
Chester Bonaparte.

234
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,598
- What do you do with the frogs, Chester?
- For each one I catch I get 50 cents.

235
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,879
- From who? Who pays you for them?
- Bauvais. His magic is the most strong.

236
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,634
He even made my fries disappear!

237
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,959
You know, Chester, I got magic, too.
And I bet I can make your fries reappear.

238
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,639
<i>Merci.</i>

239
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,508
Mulder, certain frog species secrete
a substance called bufotoxin.

240
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,195
It's chemically similar to what
was in Private McAlpin's blood.

241
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,078
We should ask Bauvais what
he's doing with those frogs.

242
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,596
I didn't want to say anything,
but I think we're being followed.

243
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,070
There's a grey four-door sedan
in the parking lot.

244
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,195
Keep an eye on Chester.

245
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,471
Out of the car, Private!

246
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,791
- You've been following us.
- I had to warn you.

247
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,916
You didn't seem interested before.

248
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,675
I couldn't talk then, not with
Colonel Wharton so close by.

249
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,035
And not with him right there.

250
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,150
Chester? He's just a little boy.

251
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,231
No, sir, he is not.

252
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,439
- What's going on?
- He was about to tell us why we're in danger.

253
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,751
You're putting yourselves into
something you don't understand.

254
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,068
But you do.

255
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,551
Bauvais warned him. He told the colonel
he'd take his men one by one unless...

256
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,757
Unless what?

257
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,516
Unless the colonel let his people
go back to Haiti. But the colonel...

258
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,956
...he just had us turn up the heat
on all them beatings.

259
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,830
- Colonel Wharton sanctioned beatings?
- He ordered it. And worse.

260
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,273
The things he is making us
do to those people!

261
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,749
Why hasn't anybody filed a complaint?

262
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,999
None of us feel good about it, ma'am,
but you don'tjoin the Marines to feel good.

263
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,514
You said Bauvais threatened
the colonel's men.

264
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,751
He said... he'd take their souls.

265
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,632
And you believe he can do that?

266
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,474
Jack was my friend.
Look what happened to him.

267
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,112
We don't know what happened to him. But
there is an explanation for his condition.

268
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,399
Back home, an associate of
my daddy's, Clyde Jessamin...

269
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,790
...once crossed a man on
some kind of real-estate deal.

270
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,353
Jessamin's daughter took ill with somethin'
the doctors couldn't make heads or tails of.

271
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,194
All they could do was shoot her full
of morphine, the pain was so bad.

272
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,558
She died, five minutes past
midnight, on her weddin' day.

273
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,279
And when they did an autopsy
to try and figure it out...

274
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,912
...all they could find was a bunch of snakes
squirming around inside her belly.

275
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,198
- Sounds like an old wives' tale.
- No, ma'am. It's not.

276
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,952
You see...

277
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,237
...I'm the one who was supposed to marry her.

278
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,319
- Think he's telling the truth?
- Until I can figure out why he'd lie, yeah.

279
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,678
He's superstitious, and superstition
breeds fear. It's what voodoo is all about.

280
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,513
It's as irrational as avoiding
a crack in the sidewalk.

281
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,319
Why would he be trying to avoid Chester?

282
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,111
Chester!

283
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,432
Chester!

284
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,511
Wait a second!

285
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,751
Chester!

286
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,395
Stop! I'm not gonna hurt you!

287
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,239
Chester!

288
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,112
It's OK, I'll get him.

289
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,351
Chester!

290
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,718
Chester?

291
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,037
<i>(cat miaows)</i>

292
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,074
- Can I get you anything else, sir?
- <i>(knock at door)</i>

293
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,071
Just get the door.

294
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,878
- I'm sorry, I'm having my breakfast.
- That's all right, we already ate.

295
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,432
I understand you obtained a court order
yesterday to exhume Private Guttierez.

296
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,475
That's right.

297
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,199
I've filed a complaint with
the Justice Department.

298
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,273
His body was missing.
Stolen from his coffin, apparently.

299
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,114
Now you see what we're facing here.

300
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,198
What barbaric religion
would desecrate a grave?

301
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,635
We suspect it was an act of retaliation.

302
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,993
Retaliation?

303
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,029
- For your mistreatment of the detainees.
- What the hell are you talkin' about?

304
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,832
Physical abuse of political refugees is a
prosecutable crime under international law.

305
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,038
It's Bauvais, isn't it? He's the one
you're gettin' this garbage from.

306
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,799
Look...

307
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,079
...nobody ever said this was a hotel,
but it's hardly a concentration camp.

308
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,518
- Then there is no policy of harassment?
- It's my men who are being harassed.

309
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,955
The UN, the relief organisations...

310
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:33,275
...they're all so busy protecting the rights of
refugees, nobody's looking out for my men!

311
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,195
Well, we'll let you finish.
Don't want your breakfast to get cold.

312
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,751
Wharton's left these people no choice but to
fight back with the only weapon they have.

313
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,150
There's a big difference between
nasty looks and raising the dead.

314
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,356
Not according to Private Dunham.

315
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,589
Agh!

316
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,671
What?

317
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,237
More scare tactics.

318
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,359
- Let me see that.
- Oh, it's nothing.

319
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,914
I don't think he's in any condition to talk.

320
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,390
That's right, Private, you don't think.
You follow orders.

321
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,948
- But, sir...
- Dismissed!

322
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,151
<i>Ouvri barrière pou moi.</i>

323
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,068
I want the secret.

324
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,070
Maybe you should tell me now,
while you can still talk.

325
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,515
<i>Ma vie nan mains Bon Dieu.</i>

326
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,830
No, Papaloi.

327
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,273
Your life is in my hands.

328
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,195
I was surprised to get your card.

329
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,751
I'd assumed our last contact...

330
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,479
...would be our last.

331
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,118
Why are you here?

332
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,033
Your investigation is faltering, Agent Mulder.

333
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,157
We've got a renegade Marine
violating human rights...

334
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,709
These people have no rights.

335
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,314
In 24 hours, all access to Folkstone
will be restricted to military personnel.

336
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,075
- No press. No third-party monitoring.
- What about Scully and me?

337
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,153
You'll be called back to Washington
on a priority matter.

338
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,870
They're making the camp invisible. Why?

339
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,478
In case you haven't noticed, Agent Mulder,
the Statue of Liberty is on vacation.

340
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,314
The new mandate says if you're
not a citizen, you'd better keep out.

341
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,154
Well, why hold 'em up?
Why notjust repatriate them?

342
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,790
During our most recent involvement in Haiti,
three US soldiers took their own lives.

343
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,599
Two were under
Colonel Wharton's command.

344
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,270
Are you saying the military is
sanctioning Wharton's revenge?

345
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,512
These are innocent civilians. Some people
in Congress might have a problem with that.

346
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,637
By the time they get a committee together...

347
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,269
...it'll be as if none of this ever happened.

348
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,074
No, I've been on hold for half an hour.
I'm trying to locate a Private Dunham.

349
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,471
Yeah.

350
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,151
Yeah.

351
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,273
Thanks.

352
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,515
Mulder, I just got through
to Dunham's barracks.

353
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,877
Mulder?

354
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,189
Your door's unlocked.

355
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,271
<i>(running water)</i>

356
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,037
Mulder, listen to this.
Dunham's been AWOL since last night...

357
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,998
Mulder?

358
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,911
Oh, God!

359
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,392
- Scully?
- Yeah.

360
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,677
I found him wandering around
outside. You all right?

361
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,478
Yeah.

362
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,076
It's Dunham.

363
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,671
When I found him...

364
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,315
...he had this in his hand.

365
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,753
- Do you recall leaving the hospital?
- I don't recall much of anything.

366
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,318
Except... feeling real heavy.

367
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,439
Like... like I'm asleep and I can't wake up.

368
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,958
<i>(Mulder)</i> Do you remember
killing Private Dunham?

369
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,068
All I remember is being there,
seeing him in all that blood.

370
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,192
Why did you sign the confession?

371
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,194
The private asked and I apprised him
of what you found at the crime scene.

372
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,560
Who else might it have been?

373
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,471
Colonel...

374
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,154
...can we have a word outside?

375
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,750
What exactly did you tell him?

376
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,718
If you're suggesting that
I coerced Private McAlpin...

377
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,758
I need to know that he signed
that confession voluntarily.

378
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,717
Of course he did.

379
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,357
Since his reappearance, has Private McAlpin
had any contact with Bauvais?

380
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,237
Not to my knowledge.

381
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,279
- We'd still like to speak with Bauvais.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

382
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,112
- Why?
- Because he's dead.

383
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,474
Last night he... cut his wrists
with a bed spring.

384
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,389
I'll have the report sent to your motel,
along with the private's confession.

385
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,315
Since matters are being handled internally,
I'll assume your business here is finished.

386
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,918
What's wrong?

387
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,992
- I'm fine. It's just a headache.
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

388
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,674
Mulder.

389
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,834
OK, Mrs McAlpin. We'll be 15 minutes.

390
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,034
First I thought I lost him.

391
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,228
As if that wasn't hard enough to deal with!

392
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,916
- Now they're saying he's killed Harry.
- He said it himself. He signed the confession.

393
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,471
I don't care. It doesn't make sense.
Jack and Harry were friends.

394
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,838
Mrs McAlpin, you said Private Dunham
came here last night. What did he want?

395
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,911
He was on his way to see you.

396
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,674
- For what reason?
- He wouldn't tell me.

397
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,078
He said if anything happened to him...

398
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,989
...I should give this to you.

399
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,229
He told me not to open it.

400
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,151
- <i>(Luke cries out)</i>
- Luke's been in a mood since all this started.

401
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,232
It's almost like he knows what's going on.

402
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,634
- <i>(Luke crying)</i>
- I'll be right back.

403
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,638
It's OK, honey. I'm coming.

404
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,038
That's Bauvais.

405
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,918
And Wharton?

406
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,310
They must've known each other
when Wharton served in Haiti.

407
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,356
When in Rome...

408
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,157
Mulder...

409
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,915
Dunham and Guttierez both filed
complaints against Colonel Wharton.

410
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,276
They both cited incidents
of abuse: Dates, times...

411
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,998
Scully...

412
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,830
...Iook at this.

413
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,274
Check out the name on the dog tags.

414
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,276
Come with me, please.

415
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,113
Take the light out of my eyes.

416
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,071
- Where's Wharton?
- You'll find out soon enough.

417
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,470
He killed Bauvais. If you know about it,
you're an accessory to murder.

418
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,357
Shut up!

419
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,357
Bauvais got what he deserved. After
what he did to McAlpin and Guttierez...

420
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,989
- It wasn't Bauvais.
- What are you talking about?

421
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,234
Those men were about to testify against
Wharton, so he stopped them before they did.

422
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,312
If you don't believe us, look in the trunk.

423
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,312
This is what's left of Private Guttierez.

424
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,034
Now where's Bauvais' body?

425
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,716
We buried him...

426
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,791
...this afternoon...

427
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,434
...in the municipal graveyard.

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,559
- What is it, Scully?
- I'm all right.

433
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,159
- You don't look all right.
- No, I'm... I'm fine. I'll catch up with you.

434
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,231
Just go get Wharton.

435
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,233

I don't know.

454
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,480
He's dead.

455
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,869
Did you kill him?

456
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,194
It was Bauvais.

457
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,353
Here's the passenger manifest you asked for.

458
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,792
They're petitioning to have
Bauvais returned to Haiti.

459
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,155
Too bad it has to be in a box.

460

- Is this a complete list?
- As far as I know.

461
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,791
- There was a boy. Chester Bonaparte.
- Sure, Chester. Poor kid.

462
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,553
