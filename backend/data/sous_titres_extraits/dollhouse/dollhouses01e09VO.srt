1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,950
previously on dollhouse:

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,340
- His last engagement was with miss lonely hearts.
- So? That shouldn't matter.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,120
I've cautioned against repeated
imprints in the same doll.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,590
there are three flowers in a
vase, the third flower is yellow.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,880
And our sleeper active
performed perfectly.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,120
Were you gonna say anything?

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,880
I just need to get away.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,320
The dollhouse is real.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,940
They know you're after them.
That's why they sent me.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,190
We have a person inside.

11
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,600
what's happening?

12
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,660
She made a mistake. Now she's sad.

13
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,770
Everyone thinks it's about the pain.

14
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,970
It's not about the
pain. It's about trust.

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,010
Handing yourself over fully d
completely to another human being.

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,950
There's nothing more beautiful
than letting go like that.

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,790
In my experience, that kind
of trust always leads to pain.

18
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,980
Then maybe you need a session in my
dungeon so I can show you otherwise.

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,810
Thanks. I think I'll pass.

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,120
Don't be so vanilla. You can trust me.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,120
I've already shown that I trust you.

22
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,920
I got in the van, didn't I?

23
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,560
You sure that was a wise decision?

24
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,470
I have a good feeling about
you, and I've got the whip.

25
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,450
if you reconsider, I have an
opening after my treatment.

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,600
Don't even start.

27
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,000
I've got him on another
lonely hearts engagement.

28
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,130
- What's that make, nine?
- Ten.

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,990
How pathetic is that old bag?

30
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,470
Ramirez pretends to be jaded but she's got
a secret stash of bodice rippers in the van.

31
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,720
- I've seen it.
- Not true.

32
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,430
She wants to be kidnapped by a pirate.

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,420
I know a guy...

34
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,270
well, if i weren't madly in love with
katherine, I'd shanghai you myself.

35
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,190
I'd take s and m
barbie over him any day.

36
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,880
Come on. Your geriatric princess awaits.

37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,170
It's love. Show some respect.

38
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,460
Sometimes it is about the pain.

39
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,040
hi, echo. How are you?

40
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,030
Did I fall asleep?

41
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,260
For a little while.

42
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,880
Shall I go now?

43
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,870
If you like.

44
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,320
okay, oh!

45
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,440
ivy, babe, the post-imprint
script may seem inconsequential,

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,860
but it's the first thing an
active hears after a memory wipe.

47
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,170
It's got to be pleasant.

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,540
- Not so...
- out of the chair, echo.

49
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,440
- That.
- You're behind schedule.

50
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,130
Somebody's a grumpeteer today.

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,140
What's the holdup?

52
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,620
You remember how saunders little drill
ended with a bullet in my computer?

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,370
Guess what that does?

54
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,620
It slows down the schedule.

55
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,820
Fix it.

56
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,910
You need to get to your
appointment with dr. Saunders.

57
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,010
Aside from topher being topher,
everything's under control.

58
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,310
And I'll expect you to keep
it that way while I'm gone.

59
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,600
Did rossum tell you why
they're calling you in?

60
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,400
Considering our recent track record,

61
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,980
I'm sure they nt to pat me on the head and tell
me I've been running a crackerjack operation.

62
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,180
Maybe there'll be cake.

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,580
Ma'am, none of these
incidents were your fault.

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,890
On the contrary, mr. Dominic, everything
that happens under this roof is my fault.

65
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,060
And for the next 48 hours, it yours.

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,600
Hello, november.

67
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,760
Hello, echo. How are you today?

68
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,490
I'm going to dr. Saunders.

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,540
E's nice.

70
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,220
November, it's time for your treatment.

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,370
Take a deep breath for me, please.

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,370
Any permanent damage?

73
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,470
These exams are private.

74
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,450
Her last engagement
seemed unnecessarily rough.

75
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,500
She was a dominatrix. I
think that's the point.

76
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,660
I prefer engagements
that aren't about some...

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,850
deep, dark sexual need?

78
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,960
You really think it has
anything to do with need?

79
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,810
Sometimes, yes.

80
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,730
Having a desire you're afraid or ashamed
of expressing can be terribly debilitating.

81
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,690
Look how many same-sex engagements
we're called for, even today.

82
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,730
And sadomasochism isn't anything like...

83
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,110
I know. It's all about trust.

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,190
But what if the client has the whip?

85
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Mm, you don't send the
actives to be submissives.

86
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,110
Man, you got the pitch down.

87
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,070
You should fill in for dewitt.

88
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,170
I believe the system is
flawed, maybe irreparably,

89
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,490
but maybe not for the
same reasons you do.

90
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,980
Echo, you're all done here.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,310
You can go now.

92
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,060
Boyd!

93
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,780
In about two minutes, I'm
gonna make a call to dewitt.

94
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,440
If you were to do something,
maybe get some air, maybe run,

95
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,450
I wouldn't know that you had done that.

96
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,950
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

97
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,970
You don't?

98
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,590
I found this in the chair.

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,900
And?

100
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,420
This chip let someone access
the primary imprint protocol,

101
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,210
which means they could
have altered my imprints.

102
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,580
I make a cheerleader, they make
a cheerleader that shoots people.

103
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,950
Or an assassin that does cheers.

104
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,890
Or any active, any time, with
a parameter we don't know about!

105
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,340
We have a spy?

106
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,540
Inside the dollhouse.

107
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,600
And you think it's me?
You think I'm the spy?

108
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,160
Not in a bad way.

109
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,160
If they find out that you talked to me
before you called dewitt, they'll fry you.

110
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,880
Yeah, I didn't really
think that through.

111
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,380
Thank you.

112
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,980
Hey, I'm boned anyway.

113
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,920
I call dewitt, she's going to take it out on
dominic, and who's dominic gonna take it out on?

114
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,510
Now echo's drawing attention to us!

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,110
Where do I know her from?

116
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,950
Maybe you should go to art class.

117
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,600
- And maybe you should call dewitt.
- Yeah.

118
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,070
echo, are you finished with your tree?

119
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,040
Put the entire house on lockdown.

120
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,200
No one comes or goes
without my authorization.

121
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,020
No land lines, no cell
phones or network connections.

122
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,270
you. Come on. You're
getting a treatment.

123
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,980
- That's not happy!
- Is everything a joke to you?

124
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,760
You allowed a security breach
to develop on your turf.

125
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,010
You're supposed to make sure everybody
who works here is on our side.

126
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,290
- Who has access to the lab?
- The short list?

127
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,250
dewitt, boyd, uh, ramirez, saunders.

128
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,780
When I was in the agency, you know what
I'd do toomeone who exposed us like that?

129
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,420
I'd kill him.

130
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,300
everyone's unppy today.

131
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,570
somebody put her tiny
little thinking cap on.

132
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,720
He was mean to you.

133
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,770
Were you not your best?

134
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,320
If it hadn't been for me, there'd
still be a security breach.

135
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,380
You'd think the security
head would recognize that.

136
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,450
Typical middle
- management hack.

137
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,470
He's mad at me for not
discovering it before it happened.

138
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,220
But, uh, I'm not a counterintelligence
agent, so I can't catch a spy.

139
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,090
And you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

140
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,500
I can help you.

141
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,280
Why would you want to?

142
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,660
Why wouldn't I?

143
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,470
did I just lose an argument to a doll?

144
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,330
Okay, um... thanks, but you can't help.

145
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,710
You make people different.

146
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,300
You can make me help.

********

151
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,500
hello, mellie. How do you feel?

152
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm jet-lagged. It's the
last time I take the red-eye.

153
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,250
And in an emergency exit
row behind a crying baby.

154
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,840
So, we good to go?

155
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,840
Hang on. Let me double-check the
primary protocol just to be sure it took.

156
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,610
Where do I know her from?

157
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,650
Come on. The airport shuttle's
waiting to take you home.

158
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,140
Mellie? I heard something in...

159
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,410
in the hallway, where your
neighbors walk to their apartments?

160
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,530
I didn't know you were
coming back so soon.

161
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,190
- Surprise.
- It's not safe to talk out here.

162
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,520
I guess the neighborhood
went to crap while I was gone.

163
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,980
Not the neighborhood. My apartment.

164
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,150
The dollhouse had it
bugged. Video and audio.

165
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,430
Took a while for me to figure it out, but
I found a transmitter in the ventilation.

166
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,120
I should search your apartment.

167
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,640
I'm surprised you didn'T.

168
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,850
Well, I was going to
let myself in, but...

169
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,810
no. No, it's okay.

170
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,540
You should cheI'm just going to
stay here,where I'm safe from the...

171
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,560
dollhouse.

172
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,030
I guess you didn'tiss me that much.

173
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,230
The dollhouse is way bigger
than I ever thought it was.

174
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,200
Every time I look deeper, I find
more clients, larger amounts of money

175
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,190
and a web of financial and political
connections all over the world to corporations,

176
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,600
the government, even inside the fbi.

177
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,020
I take it you haven't
gotten your badge back.

178
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,870
But that's just scratching the
surface-- I discovered something else.

179
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,830
I think that the
dollhouse is underground.

180
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,920
Didn't we know that? Supersecret
underground organization?

181
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,280
Not underground like it's a secret.

182
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,400
Underground like it's
somewhere beneath los angeles.

183
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,790
Yeah, you didn't come
back to listen to this.

184
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,570
I came back to see you.

185
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,010
I'm sorry. It's just...

186
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,300
you should go back to your mother'S.

187
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,970
I can'T.Aside from the obvious reasons,

188
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,590
like she lives in iowa and likes toet
mup with losers I dated in high school,

189
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,720
I realized that I was
running away from my life.

190
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,740
I'm giving you an out.

191
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,140
You can walk out that door.

192
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,300
I'm pretty sure I can't even unlock it.

193
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,240
I'm serious. I can't sleep.

194
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,020
The only thing I think about is
finding this place, and sometimes,

195
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,180
I don't even know why
I'm after it anymore.

196
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,480
That's why you need someone
to help you stay grounded.

197
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,790
How are you going to do that?

198
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,850
Let's start with getting
you in sho thewer.

199
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,660
too much? Too fast?

200
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,090
do I smell that bad?

201
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,230
I have a message for you
from inside the dollhouse.

202
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,680
- That's not funny.
- My name is november.

203
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,380
Mellie. Your name is mellie.

204
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,280
We knew this would be
hard for you to hear.

205
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,940
If you're pissed because I'm still
investigating the dollhouse...

206
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,490
- this body belongs to a doll.
- Just tell me. Don't do this.

207
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,180
I'm sorry we had to deliver the
news to you like this, in this body,

208
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,480
but the dollhouse has likely discovered that
we've been placing messages in their imprints.

209
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,480
And this is the only way we
could get the message to you.

210
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,030
They did this to you.

211
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,010
They did this long before you met me.

212
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,770
They've been using this body
to spy on you for months.

213
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,940
The only reason mellie
exists is because of you.

214
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,140
Aren't I special?

215
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,360
Now that you've removed their surveillance,
they're going to rely on her re.

216
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,580
Don't tell her anything
about the investigation.

217
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,420
It will get back to the dollhouse.

218
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,720
That's why you--
she-- came back.

219
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,430
Now you understand how
dangerous their technology is.

220
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,810
I slept with her.

221
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,680
I should have known.

222
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,470
You can't tell mellie about this.

223
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,420
If the dollhouse knows you
know, they will kill you.

224
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,490
And they'll make mellie do it.

225
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,970
Mellie couldn'T.

226
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,970
She's not a regular
doll. She's a sleeper.

227
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,550
With the flip of a switch, the
dollhouse can turn her into a killer.

228
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,040
- If our person inside has been captured,
- wait.

229
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,610
This is the last time you'll
hear from us through a doll.

230
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,180
You can't tear apart my life
and not give me anything.

231
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,330
Where is the dollhouse located?

232
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,460
You need to investigate why it exists.

233
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,090
Is it underground? Am
I on the right track?

234
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,580
The dollhouse deals in fantasy,
but that is not their purpose.

235
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,710
Investigate their purpose.

236
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,720
- We will find other ways to contact you.
- Who? Who sent you?

237
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,090
I'm not imprinted with information
you're not supposed to have.

238
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,080
- Tell me who!
- Remember, you can't tell her.

239
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,290
- You must maintain the relation
- Wait!

240
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,940
Paul, what's wrong?

241
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,500
Nothing.

242
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,840
Then why aren't you kissing me?

243
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,050


244
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,390
my men have been trying to reach
dewitt. She's still not picking up.

245
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,830
She going to be able to pull it f?

246
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,850
I threw my best secret
agent parts into the build.

247
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,790
The gps on dewitt's cell transmitter
isn't registering, either.

248
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,540
Anything happened to dewitt...

249
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,490
think happy thoughts.

250
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,460
- That's not happy.
- Is everything a joke to you?

251
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,260
Notice I'm not laughing.

252
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,000
You need me to take care of this?

253
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,490
You allowed a security breach
to develop on your turf.

254
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,690
Not my department, mr. Head of security.

255
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,330
You leave these doors wide open,
computers on, chair running.

256
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,430
It's your job to make sure everybody
that works here is on our side.

257
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,010
- Who has access to the lab?
- The shortlist?

258
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,630
dewitt, boyd, ramirez, saunders, ivy,
any number of handlers or attendants.

259
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,440
and the occasional doll wanders up here.

260
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,320
Then there's that janitorial staff.

261
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,310
What's going to happen when
the boss lady comes back?

262
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,860
Her wrath is going to rain down on me.

263
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,970
And then I'm coming after you. Let's go.

264
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,400
When I worked at the agency, you know what
I'd do to someone who exposed us like that?

265
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,260
I'd kill him.

266
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,810
Who is our target?

267
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,040
We found nsa tech in our equipment.

268
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,100
Dewitt's known they've been sniffing
around the dollhouse for years.

269
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,270
Getting access to their files is
our best shot at finding the spy.

270
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,390
Tall order.

271
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,180
- Oh, if you don tnk you can pull it off...
- I didn't say that.

272
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,990
I just want you to appreciate how
awesome I'm going to be when I deliver.

273
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,910
Topher broke their rsa encryption,
but only for the internal network.

274
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,500
- Which means you need me to get inside their building.
- Yeah.

275
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,600
Where could a girl get
changed around here?

276
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,250
Excuse me. Can I borrow a pen?

277
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,110
Never mind.

278
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,130
Found one.

279
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,960
- 3q
- 3q

280
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,540
don't worry. It's taken care of.

281
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,630
enter your private
key. You know the drill.

282
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,440
20 minutes. Nothing goes
in, nothing comes out.

283
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,440
your card will unlock the
files you're cleared to see.

284
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,180
excuse me, ma'am.

285
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,350
I'm going to have to ask
you to step over here.

286
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,250
- Did I leave something in there?
- Hold out your arms.

287
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,380
Mossad doesn't even double-tag.

288
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,460
Security alert.

289
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:28,740
all employees return to designated
scif areas for level one security sweep.

290
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,070
security alert.

291
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:37,350
All employees return to designated
scif areas for level one security sweep.

292
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,070
sorry, ms. Sato. We're moving everyone
from scif offices down to the central lobby.

293
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,570
- Just give me a sec.
- All right.

294
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,630
Security alert.

295
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,850
all employees return to designated
scif areas for level one security sweep.

296
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,340
I need a roof extraction,
north end of the building.

297
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,370
Correction, extraction on the South end

298
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,130
There she goes.

299
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,550
Chopper coming in

300
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,040
Hurry! they are closing in

301
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,520


302
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,880
- Good morning.
- Welcome back, roger.

303
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,250
Katherine's looking
forward to seeing you.

304
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,310
- May we go now?
- Of course.

305
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,020
Have you been futzing around with the
equipment? It's been running s-l-o-W.

306
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,470
Um, I just got here.

307
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,540
It's probably all the wires you
crossed to get things working again.

308
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,970
Be nice. I think she likes you.

309
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,440
Your lady awaits.

310
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,140
don't even start. They've got him
on another lonely hearts engagement.

311
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,220
- What's that make, nine?
- Ten.

312
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,590
How pathetic is that old bag?

313
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,850
Well, thank you for the ride.

314
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,150
See you at the end of the weekend.

315
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,310
Have fun, roger.

316
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,760
And stay out of trouble.

317
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,080
I promise nothing.

318
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,040
oh, thank you.

319
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,070
Did I tell you these
are my favorites oh.

320
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,600
They're so hard to
find this time of year.

321
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,100
Just for you, my dear.

322
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,690
Katherine.

323
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,420
is this your work?

324
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,610
Hmm, "topher." Is that a name?

325
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,140
They think I'm headquarters.

326
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,330
It could be very urgent, or it could be topher
calling to tell me that his sweater's itchy.

327
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:41,130
Well, I could give it back-- or I could
drop it and let the sharks talk to their own.

328
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,730
It's up to you.

329
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,620
Well, it is a very slippery phone.

330
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,250
I have complained about that a lot.

331
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,890
Oh, really? I hadn'T...

332
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,490
that was probably a very
bad thing that jushappened.

333
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,900
Accidents--
what can be done?

334
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,500
You're trying so hard to relax.

335
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,390
Which makes me wonder why
you're trying so hard to relax.

336
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,210
Am I that transparent?

337
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,320
No, but I have x-ray eyes.

338
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,270
It's been very rocky at work.

339
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,140
Hmm, the dollhouse.

340
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,450
It's hard for me to even wrap
my mind around it. Bizarre.

341
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:32,510
I used to head a division that grew
replacement organs out of stem cells.

342
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,070
- I could tell people what I did for a living.
- And now?

343
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,580
You've told me what you do.

344
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,030
Isn't it just helping lonely people?

345
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,920
Pathetic, self-deluding souls.

346
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,590
Now, katherine... shall
we take this elsewhere?

347
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,320
Touch?

348
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,220
Not bad. You almost had me there.

349
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,820
Not good either. One
more point and you win.

350
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,670
Is that all?

351
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,820
roger?

352
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,760
This is what you wanted or
you wouldn't have cut me.

353
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,310
You have had a rough day at work.

354
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,570
you are perfection.

355
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,110
If I could make a woman, I'd make you.

356
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,290
Really?

357
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,890
Yes. In fact, if I were
one of your clients,

358
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,730
I would order one of you with a
spare for when you're in the shop.

359
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,990
what, katherine?

360
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,950
- You're not seriously considering what I said?
- No.

361
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,740
I'm not suggesting you become a client.

362
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,800
- I think the universe might collapse under that one.
- Good.

363
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,360
Because I don't want an ersatz you.

364
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,590
I want the real you.

365
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,860
And I want the real you.

366
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,150
It's ironic. Sometimes I think you're
the most real person I've ever met.

367
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,800
That's not irony. No
one gets that right.

368
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,730
Everyone has their first date.

369
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,440
And the object is to hide your flaws.

370
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,750
And then you're in a relationship, and
it's all about hiding your disappointment.

371
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,830
Then once you're married,
it's about hiding your sins.

372
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,060
Katherine-- mistress
of e dark observation.

373
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,100
but with you, there's no
reason to hide anything. Real.

374
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,140
Let's run away together.

375
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:48,580
cash in everything we own, and buy
a bar on the beach in roratonga.

376
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,130
And buy extra phones just
to drop them in the water.

377
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,710
And we'd never own clocks or computers

378
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,490
or sexy businesswoman shoes.

379
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,510
I'm keeping my sexy businesswoman shoes.

380
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,310
And there'd be no clocks in
the bar, only cool local beers,

381
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,420
and dogs that wander in
from playing on the beach.

382
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,080
It could be the weekend all the time.

383
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,710
just forget it.

384
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,620
It can't happen.

385
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,940
Why not? What's wrong?

386
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,740
Something about you? Something about me?

387
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,450
You aren'T...

388
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,590
I'm not who you need?

389
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,600
Oh, no.

390
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,220
You're exactly who I need.

391
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,990
We just can't have that.

392
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,500
You have to trust me.

393
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,260
I do.

394
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,000
I trust you... completely.

395
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,370
darling, what happened?

396
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,260
I've been out for hours.

397
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,870
What happened?

398
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,000


399
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,220
I need copies of personnel records,

400
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,920
security logs for the past three
months and access to your mainframe.

401
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,710
Anything else?

402
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,610
Yeah, some clothes. I can't
catch a spy in my pajamas.

403
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,560
I need to interrogate all
the people on this list-- now.

404
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,600
Who the hell are you?

405
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,300
I made her a spy hunter.
You know, hunt the spy.

406
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,340
It's being handled
as we speak by sierra.

407
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,560
I know, but echo came
in and... she thought...

408
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,300
I thought she could help.

409
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,720
If you let me speak to
the people on this list,

410
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,210
I'll uncover the spy before
your field agent returns.

411
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,700
What are her parameters?

412
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,520
She readanbody lguage, knows
advanced interrogation techniques

413
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,500
and she's rockin' a
little sherlock holmes.

414
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,690
Give me the list.

415
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,270
I want to start with him.

416
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:05,390
Uh, I'm not the spy. I
discovered the spy. Remember?

417
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,160
The spy was operating under my nose.

418
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:14,240
Which means you're either dangerously incompetent
or you're trying to throw us off your trail.

419
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,470
I'm sorry I ever doubted
your programming skills.

420
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,890
Why are you at the dollhouse?

421
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,970
kind of a no-brainer.

422
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,930
I'm in neuroplastic heaven.

423
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:37,890
I'm doing work my grad school
professors haven't even dreamed of yet.

424
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,120
I mean, I don't want to brag...

425
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,730
okay, I want to brag.

426
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,860
I'm kind of a genius.

427
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,250
Do you really think I'm
incompetent, or are you--

428
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,220
you're just saying that to
appease big bad laurence?

429
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,530
So it matters what other
people think about you?

430
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,510
Yeah. I spent eight years studying
the intricacies of the human brain

431
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,730
and what do I get to do when I graduate?

432
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,200
Get snacks for topher, or get yelled
at when i try to do something more.

433
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,500
My talents go beyond asking whether
he wants chocolate chip or oatmeal.

434
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,450
Which I do very well, thank you,

435
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,160
but I probably know enough about
the imprint equipment to rip it down

436
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,290
and reassemble it without
topher ever knowing.

437
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,760
Well, that didn't sound good, did it?

438
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,020
I'm not trying to incriminate you.

439
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,830
I'm just trying to nail down
your feelings about the dollhouse.

440
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,440
We're pimps and killers.

441
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:37,120
But in a philanthropic way.

442
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,040
Can I go now?

443
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:45,600
I don't know why I
trust you... but I do.

444
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,900
I must have one of those faces.

445
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,890
I'm looking at the security
logs since the alpha incident.

446
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,430
When was the last time
you left the dollhouse?

447
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,510
I feel like I can better
serve the actives if I'm here.

448
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,820
24-seven?

449
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,470
Engagements run around the clock.

450
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,740
You never know when there's
going to be an emergency.

451
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,200
I don't doubt your intentions,

452
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:15,740
but such intense focus on your work can
leave other parts of your life empty--

453
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,370
and open to exploitation.

454
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,370
Do you have friends
outside the dollhouse?

455
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,130
Yeah.

456
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,010
You lose.

457
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:39,970
Sierra's been safely extracted--
barely-- and she has the mole's identity.

458
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,580
No, wait. Wait, no. You don't
understand. I didn't do anything.

459
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,770
- Why would I spy on the doll...
- I don't care why.

460
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,260
We'll get that from you when
dewitt has me torture you.

461
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,060
Then you'll tell us everything.

462
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,500
And then dewitt will
send you to the attic.

463
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,030
Do you know what happens in the attic?

464
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,110
It's a mental suck.

465
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,450
You know that feeling you get when A...

466
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,550
a name is on the tip of your
tongue, but you can't say it?

467
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,810
It's like that, but with
every thought you never have.

468
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,430
I am not the spy. You believe me, right?

469
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,720
You take her to theng roldioom.

470
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,980
How long?

471
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,830
Until dewitt gets back.

472
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,810
How long do you think
you can keep this up?

473
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,770
Excuse me?

474
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,610
You work for the nsa.

475
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,180
You have a file that says she's the one.

476
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,390
Oh, oh, what, is-is her body
language telling you she's innocent?

477
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,200
No, her language language is
telling you she's innocent.

478
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,830
Your body language is
telling me something.

479
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,430
When you got word that sierra had
been extracted with the spy's identity,

480
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,800
everyone in this room got tense.

481
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,430
Who? Who betrayed us? Who's the spy?

482
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,350
But you... you got loose.

483
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:07,820
Your body breathed a big,
subconscious sigh of relief. Why?

484
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,900
Because you alady knew that
file would implicate ivy.

485
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,070
You expect anyone to
buy this pseudo-science?

486
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,490
They don't have to.

487
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,030
There was a phone call made to the
national security agency after the lockdown.

488
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,700
You warned the nsa sierra was coming so that
they could plant this file for her to find.

489
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,180
You wanted us to blame ivy so
that you could continue to operate.

490
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,640
I couldn't have made the
call. The phones were shut off.

491
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,810
In the dollhouse. Not in this office.

492
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,070
Okay, I think it's
time for her treatment.

493
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,330
Proof is in the logs.

494
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,690
Yeah, and anyone could
have snuck in here.

495
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,600
You're right.

496
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,600
That's why I've let this conversation
continue as long as it has.

497
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,690
I needed one more sign
to confirm my suspicion.

498
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,520
And what sign would that be?

499
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,910
20 seconds ago you have snapped Charles

500
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,180
This is the dollhouse. You
know how far they reach.

501
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,640
There's no way you're
getting away with this.

502
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,430
you haven't figured it out?
Use your deductive skills.

503
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,470
You're a doll.

504
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,700
A broken doll who's
gone off mission before.

505
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,560
Now, when dewitt asks
me to explain myself...

506
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,150
you'll tell her I
went off mission again.

507
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,980
And I had no choice but to kill you.

508
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,130
- and topher and ivy?
- Collateral damage.

509
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,640
I'd say I'm covered.

510
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,470
Shouldn't we help?

511
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,680
Yeah. I helped when I imprinted her
with kung fu skills, but be my guest.

512
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,860
You're dangerous.

513
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,470
If it were up to me, you'd have
been in the ground a long time ago.

514
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,970
You tried to kill me before.

515
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,470
You're another alpha waiting to happen.

516
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,980
I'm not broken.

517
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,770
I trusted you with a gift, mr. Dominic.

518
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,980
The dollhouse is not a gift.

519
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,610
I think the countless people we've
helped would disagree with you.

520
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,360
How about the countless
people you've hurt?

521
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,940
- Name one.
- Her.

522
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:01,920
Funny... coming from the man
who tried to kill her. Twice.

523
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,400
Why did you want to
bring down the dollhouse?

524
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,020
What can the nsa do
with it that we can't?

525
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,480
I wasn't sent to bring you down.

526
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,780
I was sent to make sure you
didn't bring yourself down.

527
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,210
If it weren't for me, paul ballard
would have found you already.

528
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,990
I never lied to you about
my methods or my priorities.

529
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,850
You lied about your intentions.

530
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,960
Do you know what the world will be like when
rossum lets the dollhouse slip from its grasp?

531
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,570
The technology needs to be
reigned in and controlled.

532
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,760
By a clandestine organization
with little government oversight?

533
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,920
It's embarrassing how naive you are.

534
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,270
You believe in the
dollhouse and its mission?

535
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,330
Just like you believed in me. And look
how that played out. You were wrong.

536
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,870
Get what you can out of him about the nsa,
and have topher prep him for the attic.

537
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,450
That's it, miss dewitt?

538
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,090
You're signing my death warrant
like it was a business transaction?

539
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,630
It is.

540
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,600
The agency will figure it out
and they'll come looking for me.

541
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,910
And when they do...

542
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,070
you'll tell them everything's fine,
and then we'll put you back in your box.

543
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,340
What?

544
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,950
Did you think I'd show you mercy?

545
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,300
Or rage?

546
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,410
Three years by side.

547
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,260
I think you know me better than that.

548
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,290
You are a piece of work.

549
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,000
So they tell me. Good-bye.

550
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,180
What's in store for you-- you
don't have much to smile about.

551
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,600
After you beat me to a pulp,
they're going to erase me.

552
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,770
But first, they're going to erase you.

553
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:33,480
I can take care of myself.

554
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,230
I know. That's why I'm smiling.

555
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,940
'Cause one day, you'll be erasing them.

556
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,350
And even after all this, they
still won't see it coming.

557
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,080
Sooner or later, everybody gets theirs.

558
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,080
- don't let him...
- stop him.

559
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,910
get on with it.

560
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,210
Neuromods set for chemical saturation.

561
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:43,180
Neuromuscular tolitars in place.

562
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,550
Ltp de-potentiated.

563
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,750
Phertrans mag primed.

564
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,900
We're ready.

565
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,310
Do it.

566
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,090
the, uh, unabridged laurence dominic.

567
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,040
Lose it in the archives. I trust
his body is on the way to the atti

568
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:44,420
bleeding.Blood. Uh, coagulating.
You should see dr. Saunders.

569
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,290
How did I not see this coming?

570
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,830
- No one did.
- Yes.

571
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,360
You saw enough to imprint
echo as an investigator.

572
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,300
Yeah, about that.

573
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,770
Unless you are about to give me a better parking
space, I can't take all the credit for that.

574
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,800
- Ivy?
- Echo.

575
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,550
She came to me and
asked me to imprint her.

576
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,610
Dominic had her in his
crosshairs for months.

577
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,770
She took out her biggest threat.

578
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,560
She's still evolving.

579
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,920
Saunders's wish fulfillment
exercise didn't fulfill anything.

580
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,610
She's protecting herself.

581
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,480
- Do you want me to wipe her again?
- No.

582
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:36,500
She just saved the
dollhouse. Keep an eye on her.

583
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,300
Echo might be useful to us in
ways we haven't yet realized.

584
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,280
Oh, I almost forgot. Um,
shelf the roger imprint.

585
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:49,650
Miss lonely hearts phoned and said
she no longer requires his services.

586
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:53,630
Some hunky octogenarian
sweep her off heLker?

587
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,020
nothing so dramatic.

588
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,620
She finally realized the
indiscretion was unwise.

589
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,030
This would have been easier
if you had taken an anesthetic.

590
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,330
It's nothing.

591
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,070
No, just a gunshot wound.

592
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,980
I know you were close to mr. Dominic.

593
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:47,370
He was an employee with
whom I worked closely.

594
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,820
There's a difference.

595
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,760
It's okay to feel so thing.

596
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,040
That would imply I'd lost something.

597
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,940
Didn't you?

598
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,120
Nothing I can't live without.

599
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,310
Ms.Dewitt?

600
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,500
I ran a full security sweep.

601
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,850
New background checks on all
employees are in the works,

602
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,650
but right now it looks like this
didn't go any further than dominic.

603
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,900
Congratulations, mr. Langton.

604
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,290
For what?

605
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,050
For becoming our new head of security.

606
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,270
I appreciate the offer, but
I'd prefer to stay with echo.

607
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,860
I need to take care of her.

608
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,590
Apparently, you don'T.

609
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,490
It seems she's the
one taking care of us.

610
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,530
Echo, I'd like you to
meet your new handler.

611
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,990
His name is travis. Go ahead.

612
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,150
Everything's going to be all right.

613
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,850
Now that you're here.

614
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,840
Do you trust me?

615
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,200
Do you trust me?

616
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,120
With my life.
