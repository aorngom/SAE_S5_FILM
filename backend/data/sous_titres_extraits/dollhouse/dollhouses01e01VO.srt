1
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,617
Nothing is what
it appears to be.

2
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,871
It seems pretty clear to me.

3
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,173
Because you're only seeing
part of it.

4
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:26,743
I'm talking about

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,745
a clean slate.

6
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:31,514
You ever try and clean
an actual slate?

7
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:34,017
You always see
what was on it before.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,404
Are you volunteering...
I don't have

9
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,772
a choice, do I?

10
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:42,742
How did it
get this far?

11
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,062
Caroline,

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,731
actions have consequences.

13
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,334
Oh, God, you're loving this,
aren't you?

14
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,269
I'm sorry you don't understand
what I'm offering here.

15
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,123
But what we do helps people.

16
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,611
If you become a part of that,
it can help you.

17
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,547
Right.

18
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:06,666
You're just looking out for me.

19
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,901
Perhaps better than you have.

20
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,322
We can take care

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,658
of this mess.

22
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:17,760
After your
five-year term,

23
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,128
you will be free to...

24
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:20,396
I don't deserve this.

25
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:22,198
I was just trying
to make a difference,

26
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,200
trying to...

27
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,002
take my place in the world,
you know,

28
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,171
like she always said,
and now I'm...

29
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,162
I know.

30
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,016
I know.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,552
Actions have consequences.

32
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,294
What if they didn't?

33
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,615
Happy birthday, man.

34
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,283
No way.

35
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:05,451
No way.

36
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,452
You cheated.

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,453
How did l cheat?

38
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,454
You did something

39
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:09,589
that will prove
to have been cheating.

40
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,923
This isn't over.

41
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:13,392
Oh, my God, you
are a sore loser.

42
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,794
Oh, I wouldn't know...
I've never lost.

43
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:15,928
That's okay,
the first time,

44
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:17,096
you're always just
a little bit sore.

45
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,097
Oh, wow, that's funny,

46
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:20,016
coming from a cheater
who is also

47
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,217
a little bitch.

48
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,885
You sure you
didn't let me win?

49
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,137
Two out of three.

50
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,339
Nah.
Huh?

51
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,990
Let's just dance.

52
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:14,153
You having
a good time?

53
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:15,571
The best.

54
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,822
Listen, uh,
I know

55
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:19,191
at the beginning of the weekend,
we said no strings.

56
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,662
We also said no ropes,
and look how long that lasted.

57
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,615
Yeah, I remember.

58
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,850
I remember it all.

59
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,869
I always will.

60
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,170
What, like I'd forget?

61
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,456
You think this
is a normal weekend for me?

62
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,409
Maybe?

63
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,880
I had no idea you
were a moron.

64
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:43,099
Look, it's... it's
little, it's stupid,

65
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,134
but...

66
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,919
I want you
to have it.

67
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:55,077
You're an amazing guy, Matt.

68
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,950
When you say it,
I almost believe.

69
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,754
Thank you.

70
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:06,289
For everything.

71
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:21,654
It's getting late.

72
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,940
You're not getting out
of another dance.

73
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,492
Of course not.

74
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,928
I'm just gonna
go grab a drink.

75
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,780
Okay.

76
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:18,694
You ready for
your treatment?

77
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,979
I think it's time.

78
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,816
Did you have
a nice time?

79
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:27,703
I met a guy.

80
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,143
Dude, where's
your friend?

81
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,978
It's time for
her to go.

82
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,413
Had to get to
her carriage

83
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,848
before it turned
into a pumpkin.

84
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,915
What?

85
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,717
Stroke of midnight.

86
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:43,135
Midnight?

87
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,837
The end of the ball.

88
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:47,573
Dude, it...
it's like 5:00.

89
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,318
Hey, you think
you could take me

90
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,904
back to the party
after my treatment?

91
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,190
I'll wait right here.

92
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:05,758
You're good people.

93
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,512
Right.

94
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,284
Maybe I shouldn't
go back.

95
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,787
The last thing I want
to be is clingy,

96
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:19,622
but you know
when you just...

97
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,341
you meet someone
and... you know?

98
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,376
If I'm wrong,
I'll know.

99
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,595
I mean, Matt can't lie
to save his life.

100
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,798
If he gives me that
look, I'll walk away.

101
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,800
But I don't know, I think...

102
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,601
he feels it, too.

103
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,305
I think I found
something real.

104
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,057
I'm glad.

105
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:40,142
This is gonna pinch a bit.

106
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,947
<i>You have a nice time?</i>

107
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,532
I met a guy.

108
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,952
I want you to have it.

109
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,907
You ready to be
a sad second place, man?

110
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,345
No obligations.

111
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,679
Really?

112
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,997
No pressure.

113
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,999
It's just an
experiment.

114
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,868
How much fun can we
have in three days?

115
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:21,417
Hello, Echo.

116
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,419
How are you feeling?

117
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,588
Did I fall asleep?

118
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,923
For a little while.

119
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,176
Shall I go now?

120
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,044
If you like.

121
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,973
Everything go all
right with the wipe?

122
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:03,893
Why don't you just ask Echo?

123
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,895
Oh, that's right.

124
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:07,263
Because she can't remember.

125
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,334
Of course, it went all right.

126
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,103
Imprint's gone.

127
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,422
The new moon has made her
a virgin again.

128
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,757
Is there some reason
it shouldn't have?

129
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,593
Something happen
during the engagement?

130
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,062
I think she finally met
the right guy.

131
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,414
You're so jaded,

132
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,217
and at such a middle age.

133
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,252
She had fun, right?

134
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,454
She thought so.

135
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:34,023
There's nothing good or bad,

136
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,259
but thinking makes it so,
man friend.

137
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,446
We gave two people
a perfect weekend together.

138
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,098
We're great humanitarians.

139
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,017
Who would spend their lives
in jail

140
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:47,319
if anyone ever found this place.

141
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:53,409
We're also
misunderstood...

142
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,661
which great humanitarians
often are.

143
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,113
Look at Echo.

144
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,701
Not a care
in the world.

145
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:04,286
She's living
the dream.

146
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,338
Whose dream?

147
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,357
Who's next?

148
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:12,628
<i>
I don't understand.</i>

149
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,796
You don't have to understand.

150
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,331
You just have to do
as I tell you.

151
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,799
They'll find out, you know.

152
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,284
And why should I
care about that?

153
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:19,935
They'll laugh at me.

154
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,220
Everybody watches it.

155
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,672
It's all they talk about.

156
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,441
That's 'cause their
brains are melting,

157
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:27,543
and that reality crap
is the reason why.

158
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:29,194
I finished my homework.

159
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,446
Well, if you finished

160
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,314
your homework,
you should get a present.

161
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,565
How about...

162
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:34,850
Knowledge.

163
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:35,951
I hate you.

164
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,369
You have that right.

165
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,156
Why are we stopping?

166
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:45,227
You know I could watch it,
and you'd never know.

167
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:47,246
Yeah, well,
I'd see it all over your face

168
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,564
even when you were sleeping.

169
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:50,799
Some kind of roadblock.

170
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,836
I got to go.

171
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,388
And I'll know.

172
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,626
Tyrant.

173
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:51,792
She's completely helpless.

174
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,995
I mean, she's 12 years old,
just a kid.

175
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:56,580
How much are they demanding?

176
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:57,747
Five million.

177
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,332
And you'll pay it.

178
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:03,336
Thanks.

179
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:10,644
In Mexico, kidnapping
is a thriving business,

180
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:11,928
which is part of why

181
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:13,480
we live here
when my factories are there.

182
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:15,148
But if you pay,
there's a better chance...

183
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,316
Have you contacted
the police?

184
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:18,919
I was instructed not to.

185
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:20,403
They're useless, anyway.

186
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:24,991
I need this
to go smoothly.

187
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,693
I need Davina to be okay.

188
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,295
Mr. Crestejo, you're
a valued client.

189
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:29,496
We will of course

190
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:32,098
provide what you need.

191
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:34,367
But there is a risk
factor involved.

192
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:35,869
I don't want Rambo.

193
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:38,438
I want a negotiator.

194
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,440
This goes like clockwork,
you understand?

195
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:41,842
That's who I need.

196
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:45,245
Clockwork.

197
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:46,913
Well,

198
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:48,181
our Actives are not robots,

199
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,784
but I think
we can make this work for you.

200
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:53,670
Mr. Dominic will discuss
the security details with you,

201
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:56,606
and you can enter the rest
into the confessional.

202
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:59,192
Please remember,

203
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,695
the Active won't know
they came from here.

204
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:03,663
Any discussion of this place
will only confuse them,

205
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:06,633
and possibly send
them right back.

206
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:10,804
I know how important
it is that not happen.

207
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:13,673
Yes.

208
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:16,126
Thank you.

209
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:21,131
I'm terribly sorry
for all this.

210
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:24,034
We will help.

211
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:35,395
Ow!

212
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,347
Yeah, this feels
very tight.

213
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:40,150
I think you fell on it
with something heavy.

214
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:42,269
I don't remember.

215
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,522
Well, it's gonna be fine.

216
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:47,607
And your blood work

217
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,859
and internals
are all shipshape.

218
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:54,531
I'll just ask one of the
staff to work on that knee.

219
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:59,486
Would you like a massage?

220
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:01,488
They're relaxing.

221
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:03,423
Yes.

222
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:04,925
I'll set that up.

223
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:06,326
I don't remember

224
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:08,094
what fell on me.

225
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:11,531
Does that bother you?

226
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,500
Should it?

227
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:16,703
We'll look after you.

228
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:19,990
Does someone
look after you?

229
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:22,509
Why don't you wait in
the massage area, and

230
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:24,728
I'll call for someone
to work on that knee.

231
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,007
She's not asleep.

232
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:31,344
Oh. What...?
Just keep mapping
the tissue.

233
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:37,233
Hey, Echo.

234
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:39,119
What are you doing here?

235
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:40,720
She hurts.

236
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,722
She does.

237
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,557
That's because

238
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,409
it's her first time,

239
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,831
and, uh, we have to do
more extensive work on her.

240
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,400
Work?

241
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,235
We're making her better.

242
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:57,353
In a little while,
she'll be strong

243
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,456
and happy,

244
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:02,425
and she'll forget
all about this

245
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:04,427
and you...

246
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:06,529
will have a new friend
living with you.

247
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,131
Her name is Sierra.

248
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:10,967
Sierra.

249
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:12,168
Mm-hmm.

250
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,187
Aren't you supposed

251
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:17,157
to be getting your physical
with Dr. Saunders far

252
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:18,525
from here right now?

253
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:20,643
We're ready
for your massage, Echo.

254
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,384
Something fell on me.

255
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:30,620
I bet it was something great.

256
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:46,753
<i>
Agent Ballard, you were
assigned to case designate</i>

257
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:48,671
<i>Dollhouse over 14 months ago.</i>

258
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:51,174
<i>How would you describe
your progress to date?</i>

259
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:53,810
Slow.

260
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:56,146
I'm actually very impressed
by what I see here.

261
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:58,765
You've physically
threatened a senator,

262
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,733
<i>disrupted a seven-year</i>

263
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:03,353
human trafficking
investigation,
been arrested

264
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:05,271
<i>for trespassing
on Prince Amoudi's yacht.</i>

265
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,274
The only legal action
you've successfully

266
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:10,493
followed through
on is your divorce.

267
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,847
Paul, let me ask you.

268
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:17,217
After all this, do you think
the Dollhouse really exists?

269
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:18,618
I know it does.

270
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:19,886
You've seen it then?

271
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:22,288
You could, like,
take us on a tour?

272
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:23,356
Look, we all know

273
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:25,558
this assignment is a joke.

274
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,994
If it's a joke,
then pull me off it.

275
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:29,996
Except you can't,

276
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:32,899
because someone bigger than you
thinks it isn't a joke.

277
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,067
I'm a billionaire.

278
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,602
I can hire anybody
for anything.

279
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:37,670
And I'm gonna go to an
illegal organization

280
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:39,706
and have them build
me, program me, what,

281
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:41,574
the perfect date?

282
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,127
Confessor, assassin,
dominatrix, omelet chef?

283
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:47,030
<i>I'm paying a million dollars
for that?</i>

284
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:48,364
I can get that.

285
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,316
I have everything I want.

286
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,118
Nobody has everything they want.

287
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:53,887
It's a survival pattern.

288
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:56,322
You get what you want,
you want something else.

289
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,459
If you have everything,
you want something else.

290
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:02,362
<i>Something more extreme,
something more specific.</i>

291
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:04,631
Something perfect.

292
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:07,000
Put it like that,
it doesn't sound so bad.

293
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:08,535
The only way
to imprint

294
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:10,036
a human being
with a new personality...

295
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:11,604
Which we've yet
to prove possible.

296
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:13,606
...is to remove their own.

297
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:15,241
Completely.

298
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:16,809
We're talking about people
walking around

299
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:18,545
who may as well
have been murdered.

300
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,113
Which to me sounds pretty bad.

301
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,981
Is that why you
interfered with
the Russians?

302
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:23,249
The Borodin case?

303
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:24,851
They're the top of the heap
in human trafficking.

304
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,069
If people are disappearing...

305
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:29,189
That is an ongoing
investigation!

306
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,139
All right?

307
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:32,242
We have a
chance to dry up

308
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:34,994
a major pipeline of girls being
smuggled into this country,

309
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:36,829
and you do not jeopardize that

310
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:38,765
for a fairy tale!

311
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:42,585
<i>You will stay out
of everyone's way,</i>

312
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,721
<i>and you will stop pissing off</i>

313
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:48,124
<i>powerful public figures
without any evidence!</i>

314
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:53,796
You've been out of line, Paul.

315
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:55,531
You have to back off.

316
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:57,817
You need to keep away
from the Borodin case.

317
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,452
Do you understand?

318
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,604
Are you able to back off?

319
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:21,424
That won't be a problem... sir.

320
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:34,754
Hello, Echo.

321
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:38,391
Would you sit down, please?

322
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,515
<i>
The situation is a kidnap
and ransom,</i>

323
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,652
<i>12 year-old girl
named Davina Crestejo.</i>

324
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,887
The girl's supposed
to be exchanged

325
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:10,807
for $5 million, which her father
is willing to pay.

326
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,692
And we are going to help him
do that.

327
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Kidnapper's Latino,

328
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:15,361
probably Mexican,

329
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,847
refers to himself
as "Mr. Sunshine."

330
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,599
This is a high risk engagement
so you'll have

331
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,850
both eyes
and ears this time.

332
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:21,801
Audio off a wire,

333
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,303
and we'll tap you
into his security vid

334
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:25,121
on the house and grounds.

335
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,272
Anything goes wrong,

336
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,007
or feels wrong,

337
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:29,742
you extract Echo immediately.

338
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,512
Her purpose is to facilitate
the exchange,

339
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,281
nothing more.

340
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:37,750
No one is to be brought
to justice.

341
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:39,752
We'll skip
any ex-cop

342
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,354
heroics, if you don't mind.

343
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:43,589
Not a problem.

344
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:45,625
My only priority...
Is Echo.

345
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,694
Good.

346
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,712
So,

347
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,597
who does she think she is?

348
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:02,225
Gabriel Crestejo?

349
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:05,261
I'm sorry, who are you?

350
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,512
You asked for me.

351
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:08,431
I'm here to help.

352
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:13,398
Our mutual friend
referred me.

353
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,517
I'm sure he did.

354
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:17,519
I'm a little surprised,
though, that he sent you.

355
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:19,321
I'm good with people.

356
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:21,189
I put them at
their ease.

357
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:22,824
In my experience,

358
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:24,910
a beautiful woman never
puts anyone at their ease.

359
00:21:24,977 --> 00:21:26,778
Fatherly types do that.

360
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:27,829
They're warm and comforting,

361
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:29,281
make people feel safe.

362
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:31,416
A beautiful woman

363
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,085
distracts people,
makes them nervous,

364
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,170
or jealous.

365
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:37,222
I can't afford that.

366
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,306
Not with what's at stake here.

367
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:40,792
I think our friend
sent the wrong person.

368
00:21:41,878 --> 00:21:43,261
Fatherly types.

369
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:45,330
Like Edward James Almos.

370
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:47,032
I hope there's no offense.

371
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:49,935
None taken, and I'm not leaving.

372
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:51,887
You can hire
someone else,

373
00:21:52,055 --> 00:21:53,638
give them my fee,
but I'm the one

374
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:55,774
best qualified to
save your daughter.

375
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:57,509
I've been doing this
my whole life.

376
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:58,694
Just this.

377
00:21:58,661 --> 00:21:59,728
You want people

378
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:01,229
to feel comforted?

379
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:02,481
We're past that.

380
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:05,083
These men are stone
professionals.

381
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:08,153
They took her from
your house.

382
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:11,156
Not on the way home from school,
or in the park...

383
00:22:11,324 --> 00:22:12,991
they came inside your house,

384
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:15,060
your seriously
fortified house,

385
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:16,478
in order to tell you

386
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:18,497
that they could.

387
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:27,839
I've dealt with
the others...

388
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,891
amateurs, men with a grudge,

389
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:31,810
or an urge.

390
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:34,763
You want a
professional,

391
00:22:34,814 --> 00:22:36,248
a man who knows the business.

392
00:22:36,215 --> 00:22:38,383
Knows how high the stakes
should or shouldn't go.

393
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:41,319
The percentage of successful
negotiations goes way up.

394
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:43,255
And what's the
percentage?

395
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,023
Not a hundred.

396
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:46,491
Is her room in here?

397
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:48,059
I'll show you.

398
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:49,778
We haven't touched anything.

399
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:51,396
Glasses, Topher?

400
00:22:51,464 --> 00:22:52,748
She's nearsighted.

401
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:54,566
Is that supposed to make people
take her seriously?

402
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:55,751
Like the librarian thing

403
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,202
is gonna hide the fact
that she's...

404
00:22:57,286 --> 00:22:58,703
Am I speaking Urdu?

405
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:00,405
She's nearsighted, Boyd.

406
00:23:00,373 --> 00:23:01,873
You can mess up her eyesight?

407
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:04,509
I can mess up the neural
connections to her eyesight.

408
00:23:04,594 --> 00:23:07,295
Make her brain process
the information it gets

409
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,297
any way I want.

410
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,866
As, for example, blurry.

411
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,050
But why would you?

412
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:14,186
Why handicap her
in a job like this?

413
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,555
You see someone
running

414
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:17,722
incredibly fast,

415
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,974
the first thing
you gotta ask is,

416
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,559
are they running
to something,

417
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:22,277
or are they running
from something?

418
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:25,280
And the answer is
always both.

419
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:27,666
So these personality
imprints...

420
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:29,734
they come from scans
of real people.

421
00:23:29,902 --> 00:23:31,787
Now, I can create
amalgams

422
00:23:31,821 --> 00:23:34,739
of those personalities,
pieces from here or there,

423
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:38,493
but it's not a greatest hits;
it's a whole person.

424
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:41,913
Achievement is balanced
by fault,

425
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:44,082
by... a lack.

426
00:23:46,002 --> 00:23:48,637
Can't have one
without the other.

427
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,906
Everyone who excels

428
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:52,808
is overcompensating.

429
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:55,026
Running from something.

430
00:23:55,094 --> 00:23:56,862
Hiding
from something.

431
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:57,979
The past?

432
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:00,015
Sometimes.

433
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,083
So what's in the past
that you gave Echo?

434
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:03,485
That's her business, Boyd.

435
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,487
She's right for the job.

436
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:08,139
She's spent her life profiling

437
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,808
and negotiating with kidnappers.

438
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:12,844
That's the person they needed,
so that's who Echo is.

439
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:14,462
The expert.

440
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,814
Who's nearsighted.

441
00:24:15,882 --> 00:24:18,550
She also has asthma.

442
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:31,613
What took you so long?

443
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:33,048
Is this Mr. Sunshine?

444
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,316
Where is Gabriel?

445
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:35,517
He's right here.

446
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,168
My name is Eleanor Penn.

447
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:39,004
And I'll be handling
the transaction.

448
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:41,973
I told him no cops!

449
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:44,025
Put Gabriel on,

450
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,794
I'm gonna cut his little girl

451
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:46,845
so he can hear.

452
00:24:46,913 --> 00:24:47,913
He can hear.

453
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,397
I am not a cop.

454
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:50,515
I'm not FBI.

455
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:53,151
And I have no interest
in justice.

456
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,921
I'm here only to facilitate
a private transaction

457
00:24:55,988 --> 00:24:57,939
and make sure no one is hurt
during it.

458
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:00,458
No, you're a federale...
you think I'm stupid?

459
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:02,327
I think you knew Gabriel
wouldn't call the authorities

460
00:25:02,395 --> 00:25:03,845
if you took Davina.
Which was not stupid.

461
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:07,415
But Gabriel can't
do this alone.

462
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:09,150
He's afraid, and angry,

463
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:11,836
and he knows those emotions
are of no use right now.

464
00:25:11,754 --> 00:25:13,088
So you'll deal with me.

465
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:15,106
And everybody will get
what they want.

466
00:25:15,274 --> 00:25:16,791
You may call me Miss Penn.

467
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:18,360
I may?

468
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:21,062
I call you Miss?

469
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,064
I think I call you Ellie,

470
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:24,900
since we're becoming
such good friends.

471
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,351
I will not answer to Ellie.

472
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:27,802
You may call me Miss Penn.

473
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,904
Oh,

474
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:31,640
so you're the schoolteacher now,
huh?

475
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:33,875
What, you gonna rap my knuckles
if I'm bad?

476
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:35,610
It's unlikely.

477
00:25:35,645 --> 00:25:37,128
You telling me
how it's gonna be?!

478
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:39,981
<i>Al diablo contigo y to nombre!</i>

479
00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:41,299
I have the girl, okay?

480
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:42,584
I make all the rules.

481
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:43,551
You want $5 million?

482
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,586
That's right.

483
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:45,587
Let's make it eight.

484
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:46,655
What?

485
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:47,756
8 million.

486
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,790
That's two million apiece.

487
00:25:48,874 --> 00:25:49,841
Call back in 40 minutes

488
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:51,309
and let Davina talk
to her father.

489
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:52,460
There's no way
you're just gonna

490
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:53,795
give me an extra three mil...

491
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:58,199
You have the money.

492
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:03,338
It would have been polite
to ask.

493
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:06,024
They have to get used
to doing it my way.

494
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:08,143
Right now, they're getting
very used to it.

495
00:26:08,294 --> 00:26:10,178
Or they think she's
messing with them.

496
00:26:10,246 --> 00:26:11,246
I am.

497
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:12,781
But you'll give
them the money.

498
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,266
You have to get used
to doing things my way, too.

499
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:20,455
The last time
a family's head

500
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:21,389
of security let

501
00:26:21,557 --> 00:26:22,657
their daughter
get kidnapped,

502
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,392
she was recovered in three days.

503
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,994
His body never was.

504
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:27,329
Speak out of turn again

505
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:29,347
and I will scold you.

506
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:32,250
How'd you know there
was four of them?

507
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:34,069
You said, "2 million apiece."

508
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:35,103
Guy didn't blink.

509
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:36,838
You heard him not blink?

510
00:26:37,006 --> 00:26:38,807
Four's

511
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:40,675
the median number
in these cases.

512
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,211
Three guys with ambition,
one with information.

513
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,780
What more can you tell
me about them?

514
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:48,883
I'll tell you when it's useful
for you to know it.

515
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:50,819
They better put her on.

516
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:53,521
They will.

517
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:55,490
In 38 minutes.

518
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:00,428
You're the boss, Ellie.

519
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:03,965
Miss Penn.

520
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:11,506
What, you don't
believe me?

521
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,059
This immigration guy,
he's patting me down,

522
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:15,427
he's feeling me up,

523
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:17,062
he's starting to get
very personal, right?

524
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:18,296
I tell him he should

525
00:27:18,364 --> 00:27:19,798
buy me a drink,
tell me I'm pretty,

526
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:21,132
he wants to grope me like that.

527
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,118
Oh, you're a talker, new guy.

528
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:25,053
It's Lubov. Uh, Velnik
asked me to come,

529
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:26,404
give Mr. Borodin
my respects.

530
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:27,555
I like a talker.

531
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,391
Immigration, he doesn't

532
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:30,375
even crack a smile.

533
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,610
Then out comes the
rubber glove.

534
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:34,379
I'm serious.

535
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:36,031
Loomis,

536
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:39,067
I got a name for you.

537
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:44,389
Hello.

538
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:45,790
You got $8 million for us?

539
00:27:45,758 --> 00:27:46,725
That's right.

540
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:48,727
If it's that easy,

541
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:51,029
I think we gonna make it
an even ten.

542
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:53,431
What-What are you doing?

543
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:01,740
You hang up on me again,
I chop her up right now!

544
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:03,074
And I'll use her for bait!

545
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:05,076
Is Davina ready
to talk to her father?

546
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:06,778
You got one minute.

547
00:28:09,682 --> 00:28:11,015
<i>Papi?</i>

548
00:28:11,183 --> 00:28:12,567
<i>I'm scared.
Mija...</i>

549
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:14,069
<i>Mija, I'm right here.</i>

550
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:15,737
<i>Papi, I'm sorry.</i>

551
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,439
<i>No, no, no, mija,
it's not like that.</i>

552
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:19,808
You just do as the men say,
I'm gonna bring you home.

553
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,810
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

554
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:24,045
I'm scared.

555
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:25,613
All they want is money.

556
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:27,615
They yell at me.

557
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:28,883
Except the one with the mask,

558
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:31,252
he doesn't talk.

559
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,755
It's dark in the room,

560
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:35,757
but I can hear the...
Davina,

561
00:28:35,724 --> 00:28:36,925
I'm a friend of
your father's.

562
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,059
I need to know

563
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:39,227
if they're hutting you.

564
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:41,129
Not much.

565
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,997
Did they feed you?
But they push me around.

566
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:45,133
A little.

567
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:47,569
And they wouldn't let me use
the bathroom at first,

568
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:48,670
but then they did.

569
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:50,705
It's the small kind...

570
00:28:50,873 --> 00:28:52,140
Your father wants

571
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,208
to tell you something.

572
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,376
I, uh...

573
00:28:56,946 --> 00:29:00,715
I, uh, I want you
to be strong, Davina.

574
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:02,750
Remember that I love you

575
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:05,920
and I will never let anything
happen to you.

576
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:08,056
<i>
I love you, Papi.</i>

577
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:09,257
Please put the man

578
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:10,725
back on.

579
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:15,430
The money tomorrow.

580
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:17,565
I call you at noon
to tell you where.

581
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,567
Maybe.
And she'll be there.

582
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:22,303
There are only two ways
for this to go...

583
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:25,039
either everybody gets what
they want, or nobody does.

584
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:28,009
We will not pay
if she's not there.

585
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:34,766
You told me you're good
with people.

586
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,768
I misspoke.
I'm good at people.

587
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:38,603
She was trying
to tell me something!

588
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:40,605
And I needed
her not to.

589
00:29:40,689 --> 00:29:42,490
Suppose they figured out
what she was telling you

590
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:43,608
before you did?

591
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:45,243
Do you think this would
endear her to them?

592
00:29:45,277 --> 00:29:47,362
But if we could find her
before they do something...

593
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,414
And what, rush in
with tear gas?

594
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:51,199
These people don't
handle surprises well.

595
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,501
They get their money
or they dig a hole.

596
00:29:57,456 --> 00:29:58,706
You have to trust

597
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:01,092
that I have done this
many, many times.

598
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:08,183
I have to trust that...  right.

599
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,236
Yesterday, you weren't a nurse
or a clown in the circus.

600
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:12,737
What?

601
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:13,872
You're the best,

602
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,240
the best one
they could send.

603
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:16,374
Why is that?

604
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:17,909
What makes you
so good at this?

605
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:19,394
I don't have any hobbies.

606
00:30:19,478 --> 00:30:20,495
No, no, no.

607
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:21,696
You have to do better than that.

608
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:23,898
You have to make
me believe,

609
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:25,867
believe like you believe.

610
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:27,101
Who are you?

611
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:29,270
You want my résumé?

612
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:30,355
I studied psychology,

613
00:30:30,322 --> 00:30:32,490
forensic science,

614
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,993
profiling from former
instructors at Quantico.

615
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,661
Been licensed
seven years.

616
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:38,096
Handled over 12
negotiations.

617
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:39,797
Why, why, why?

618
00:30:39,765 --> 00:30:41,866
What made you

619
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:45,503
do all those amazing things?

620
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:48,072
Did something terrible happen
in your childhood?

621
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,924
Did horrible men come
and snatch you away?

622
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:52,293
Yes.

623
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:54,462
You were kidnapped.

624
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:57,999
When I was nine.

625
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:00,368
How long
did that...
Three months.

626
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:03,238
And they did
things to you.

627
00:31:04,773 --> 00:31:07,775
Unprofessional things.

628
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:09,794
Is this helping
you in some way?

629
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:12,814
You don't remember?

630
00:31:12,982 --> 00:31:14,949
Maybe it's all
made up.

631
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,987
There was one.

632
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:23,374
He got rid

633
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:25,860
of the others after they
were paid and...

634
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:27,161
All the terrible
memories

635
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:28,763
these men put
in your head.

636
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,967
Why would they do that?

637
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:35,019
Sometimes the bad things
just happen

638
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,638
and no one

639
00:31:36,805 --> 00:31:38,056
can protect you from them.

640
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,475
I'm okay.

641
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:43,645
I'm fine, I'm okay.

642
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:45,313
I'm sorry.

643
00:31:50,102 --> 00:31:51,135
Forget it.

644
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:53,738
I'd like to get some sleep.

645
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:55,840
We've got a long day tomorrow.

646
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:59,010
I'll have Maria
make you up a bed.

647
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:20,129
Don't move.

648
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:25,017
Hey, make sure the ladies
at my table

649
00:32:25,185 --> 00:32:26,285
have what they
need, huh?

650
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:27,936
The champagne never
stops flowing.

651
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:30,255
The good stuff.

652
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,840
For the first few
bottles, the good stuff.

653
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,459
After that, the
house is fine.

654
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:51,110
You're about to make
a very bad mistake.

655
00:32:53,313 --> 00:32:54,797
Dollhouse.

656
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,331
What?

657
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,483
Dollhouse.

658
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,617
Say it.

659
00:32:58,585 --> 00:32:59,651
Dollhouse.

660
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:00,686
Say it again.

661
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:02,154
Your brains are...

662
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:03,372
Okay, dollhouse.

663
00:33:03,406 --> 00:33:05,157
Doll freaking house.

664
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:06,558
I'll keep saying it...
it's fun to say.

665
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,393
Dollhouse, dollhouse,
dollhouse, dollhouse.

666
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:11,563
You see the Borodins,
you say it some more.

667
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:13,599
You think you want to mess
with the Borodins?

668
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,969
No, but they
supply girls,

669
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:19,238
some of them
very high-end,

670
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,006
to fine, upstanding
clients.

671
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:23,475
There's one client
I'm interested in.

672
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:24,910
Find out who's connected

673
00:33:24,978 --> 00:33:26,745
to the Dollhouse, the
Borodins won't be touched,

674
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,548
and you'll never see me again.

675
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:31,233
I haven't seen you yet.

676
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,721
You will.

677
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,707
Wash your hands.

678
00:33:40,426 --> 00:33:42,127
And your shoes.

679
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:15,944
<i>You look better than
on the phone, chica.</i>

680
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:17,346
It's still Miss Penn.

681
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,231
<i>Me disculpo.</i>

682
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:22,167
The money.

683
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:23,468
Please.

684
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:25,370
This is not your first time.

685
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:29,958
Let's go.

686
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:31,293
Come on, let's
go, let's go.

687
00:34:34,464 --> 00:34:35,497
Davina!

688
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:37,299
<i>Davina, mi hija,
it's okay.</i>

689
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:38,867
Papi's here.

690
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,470
Okay... now you show.

691
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:02,207
We take that
on the boat.

692
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:03,692
Your daughter
steps off.

693
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,460
You don't move
towards her

694
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:06,962
until we are away.

695
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:14,536
Whoa... whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa whoa.

696
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,938
Hey, Boyd, what's going on?

697
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:17,639
We're good so far.

698
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:18,907
No, no, Echo's not good.

699
00:35:18,975 --> 00:35:21,360
Something's not good,
and Echo knows it.

700
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:29,518
This is maybe your first time.

701
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:30,986
It's just a condition...
we're not making trouble.

702
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,888
Are you trying
to blow this?

703
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:34,690
Don't let them on the boat.

704
00:35:36,993 --> 00:35:38,860
You said that's
the way it is.

705
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,280
They're not gonna give her back.

706
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:46,535
He's not gonna give her back.

707
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:48,253
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

708
00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:50,505
She gets off first.
Get the hell back.

709
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:51,707
You give me my daughter!

710
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:00,582
We need an ambulance.

711
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,767
The client is shot.

712
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:02,985
Extract the Active.

713
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:04,136
Do it now.

714
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:17,232
Is it bigger
than your thumb?

715
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:19,601
Echo.
Is it... is it bigger
than your thumb?

716
00:36:19,669 --> 00:36:21,320
Miss Penn, look at me.

717
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:23,071
You can't fight a ghost.

718
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:27,125
You ready for your treatment?

719
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,745
You can't fight a ghost.

720
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:41,567
It's so dark.

721
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:42,902
Of course it's dark.

722
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,271
It's better.

723
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,907
You don't see,
you don't make a sound.

724
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,742
You forget his face.

725
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,244
Whose face?

726
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:54,514
He's all thumbs.

727
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,583
What happened on the dock?

728
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,418
What went wrong?

729
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:01,521
He doesn't give them back.

730
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,325
Who, the man in the mask?

731
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:09,162
He's old now.

732
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,563
He's the same age.

733
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:12,165
I am proportionately similar

734
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:13,866
to a girl, a small girl.

735
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,470
The older man.

736
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:19,839
You know him.

737
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,008
He's the one
that took you.

738
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:23,142
They never
found him.

739
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,211
He said he
was a ghost.

740
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:28,714
You can't fight a ghost...

741
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:31,217
but he was heavy,

742
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:32,518
the weight of him.

743
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:34,887
Ghosts aren't heavy.

744
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:37,757
Ghosts are sheets
with holes cut out.

745
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,125
He took you away.

746
00:37:43,947 --> 00:37:45,498
And now...

747
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:47,033
It's unprofessional.

748
00:37:47,117 --> 00:37:48,951
He's taken Davina.

749
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:54,907
She's proportionately similar
to a girl.

750
00:37:57,244 --> 00:38:00,146
He won't touch her until he's
taken care of the others.

751
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:01,364
The other two men?

752
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:03,699
They'll be dividing the money

753
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:06,168
and make sure there's
no tracers, no dye pack.

754
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:07,253
They'll get excited.

755
00:38:07,404 --> 00:38:09,055
They won't see him coming.

756
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:10,223
Six hours.

757
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,340
Before he
kills them?

758
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:12,225
And takes her away.

759
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:14,126
On the boat?

760
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,344
It's been seen.

761
00:38:15,262 --> 00:38:17,096
They were planning
to beach it anyway.

762
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:19,649
It's a Houlberd,
30-footer.

763
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:21,817
It's got a decent range.

764
00:38:21,902 --> 00:38:23,619
And it was riding high.
They haven't

765
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:24,887
bothered to fuel it...  good.

766
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:27,390
Let's place them
anywhere from here...

767
00:38:27,357 --> 00:38:28,374
to here.

768
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:29,475
Still a lot of choices.

769
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,727
I'm missing something.

770
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:35,398
The man an the phone...
what did he say?

771
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:36,565
The mask.

772
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:37,917
Only one man wore a mask.

773
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,185
Because she
knows him.

774
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:40,386
He doesn't just
have information.

775
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:41,354
He's in her life.

776
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:43,389
We find him,
we find the ghost.

777
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:46,058
How does she know him?

778
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,628
Something
the other one said.

779
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:58,821
We need to do my treatment now,
and we need to do it fast.

780
00:38:58,889 --> 00:38:59,889
Miss Penn...

781
00:39:00,023 --> 00:39:01,190
Come on, Langton.

782
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:02,591
A client's in critical,
weapon's discharged.

783
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,460
You think I'm gonna
let you hold her hand

784
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,028
while Topher
scrubs her?
Two minutes.

785
00:39:06,063 --> 00:39:08,481
You have any idea of the crap
that's raining down on us?

786
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:10,283
Handler intervention triggers
an immediate debriefing

787
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,385
- to make sure that we weren't exposed.
- We're close.

788
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:14,603
As soon as I finish
my treatment,

789
00:39:14,671 --> 00:39:15,738
we'll find her.

790
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:17,290
He won't do this again.

791
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:20,960
I need to talk
to DeWitt.

792
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:22,461
You need to tell me
everything

793
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,213
that went down today.

794
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:25,481
It wasn't a glitch.

795
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,216
The imprint was rock solid.

796
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:29,051
There was a weird spike
last night,

797
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:32,505
but what happened at the dock
happened to Eleanor Penn.

798
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:35,675
Or the people
we made her out of.

799
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:38,561
I need you
to do this quickly.

800
00:39:38,528 --> 00:39:40,780
I live to serve.

801
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:48,404
Barging in here
isn't going

802
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:49,989
to help your situation,
Mr. Langton.

803
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:51,540
Echo can find
the Crestejo girl.

804
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:52,758
I'm sorry.

805
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:54,026
He's faster
than you'd think.

806
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:55,695
You cannot wipe
her right now.

807
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:57,963
I can do any damn thing
I see fit.

808
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:59,665
Echo botched the engagement.

809
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:00,933
She jeopardized

810
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:01,167
this entire operation.

811
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:06,272
of an abused girl,

812
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,774
and you put her face to face
with her abuser.

813
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:10,676
She recognized one
of her kidnappers.

814
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:12,845
And she can find him again.
She's the only one who can.

815
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:14,513
Ma'am, we need to distance
ourselves from this.

816
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:16,182
We don't know
if the client's going to live.

817
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:17,516
This is becoming news.

818
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,791
I'm sorry, Mr. Langton,

819
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,793
but this is complicated.

820
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:28,894
No, it isn't.

821
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:30,463
Echo's in pain,
but she's

822
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,732
the right girl for the job,
and she knows the territory.

823
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:35,101
She can find Davina before
that man lays a finger on her.

824
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:36,769
You wipe her,
you've lost all of that.

825
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,571
We do not have a client!

826
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:40,740
We have a mission!

827
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:50,433
We prefer to call
them engagements.

828
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,568
You have not
been here

829
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:55,304
as long as some
of the others,

830
00:40:55,272 --> 00:40:57,740
so I will overlook the error.

831
00:40:57,908 --> 00:40:59,775
I've been here long enough
to know that you like

832
00:40:59,843 --> 00:41:01,510
to tell yourself
what we do helps people.

833
00:41:03,313 --> 00:41:05,514
Let Echo help this girl.

834
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:20,079
Where are my glasses?

835
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:24,417
I know how to find her.

836
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:28,042
It was the first call.

837
00:41:28,126 --> 00:41:29,910
The kidnapper said, "You're
the schoolteacher now."

838
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:31,128
He stressed you're,

839
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:33,230
like there's already
a teacher in the mix.

840
00:41:33,398 --> 00:41:34,732
The one in the mask.

841
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:36,033
Check her school.

842
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:37,501
See who's missing.

843
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:38,635
He's been close to her.

844
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,887
He's probably not Latino.

845
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:41,355
Ms. Penn,
I'm Lawrence Dominic.

846
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:42,506
Security contractor.

847
00:41:42,691 --> 00:41:44,692
Yes, ma'am.
I have a chopper standing by.

848
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:46,794
I'll need a radio contact
while we're en route.

849
00:41:46,861 --> 00:41:48,529
That'll be Mr. Langton.
He's staying here.

850
00:41:48,563 --> 00:41:50,280
She needs backup.
Not from you.

851
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:51,765
I'm her handler.

852
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,884
Miss DeWitt will decide
what you are.

853
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:03,577
James Shepherd,
Caucasian male, 33.

854
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:05,579
Out sick 12 consecutive days.

855
00:42:05,764 --> 00:42:07,598
Has a sister
with an isolated house

856
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:09,299
six miles from the dock.

857
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:12,636
I'm going to need a clean and
quiet touchdown with zero chance

858
00:42:12,604 --> 00:42:14,555
they'll see
or heaeaour approach.

859
00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:15,973
With respect, the last time
you went head to head

860
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:17,091
with these people, you folded.

861
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:18,308
My man's fully...

862
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:19,676
Your man gives me ten minutes,

863
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:21,378
or Davina will die.

864
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,820
<i>
How is she?</i>

865
00:42:46,888 --> 00:42:49,022
See the blue areas?

866
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,891
That's fear.

867
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:52,092
It all looks blue.

868
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,344
That's where
I'm going with this.

869
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:56,096
Uh, the persona we developed?

870
00:42:56,264 --> 00:42:57,765
Bunch of different people.
Yeah.

871
00:42:57,932 --> 00:43:01,118
And one of them was abused
by the guy she ran into.

872
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:03,320
I know.
Yeah, I looked her up.

873
00:43:03,388 --> 00:43:05,622
She killed herself.

874
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,024
Last year.

875
00:43:09,611 --> 00:43:11,612
She never got away from him.

876
00:43:13,948 --> 00:43:16,033
What are we playing at?

877
00:43:28,797 --> 00:43:30,864
It's the woman.
What?

878
00:43:30,832 --> 00:43:32,099
From the drop?

879
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:33,383
Damn it!

880
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:34,885
Who else? You see anyone else?

881
00:43:34,853 --> 00:43:36,153
I'm alone.

882
00:43:37,689 --> 00:43:39,256
Please open the door.

883
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:41,725
Don't do it, man.

884
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:45,612
Listen to me.

885
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,268
Who knows
where we are?

886
00:43:53,271 --> 00:43:55,405
Everyone's going to know
very soon, Mr. Shepherd.

887
00:43:56,941 --> 00:43:58,142
You left a wide trail,

888
00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:00,177
but that's not your problem.

889
00:44:01,479 --> 00:44:03,147
He is.

890
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,750
Hell you on about?

891
00:44:06,718 --> 00:44:08,752
Soon as that money's counted,

892
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,338
he's going to kill both of you.

893
00:44:11,372 --> 00:44:13,223
You think we fall
for that crap?

894
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:15,976
Turn us on each other?

895
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:18,879
You tell us how long
till they come, you talk.

896
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:23,784
Or I find something
to stuff that mouth up.

897
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:26,303
I think
I'm a little old for you.

898
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:32,809
The man that shot
Mr. Crestejo is dead.

899
00:44:33,027 --> 00:44:34,144
You will be identified

900
00:44:34,312 --> 00:44:35,479
as the ringleader.

901
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,214
You two haven't killed anyone.

902
00:44:37,182 --> 00:44:39,049
You can let me leave
with Davina,

903
00:44:39,217 --> 00:44:40,851
and get out of the country

904
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:43,987
very rich men.

905
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:45,556
The girl's not here.

906
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:46,857
She's in the fridge.

907
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:48,525
You unplugged it

908
00:44:48,493 --> 00:44:50,160
and pulled out
the shelves.

909
00:44:50,328 --> 00:44:52,029
You had to rope it shut,
of course,

910
00:44:51,996 --> 00:44:54,031
'cause these days,
they don't lock.

911
00:44:56,668 --> 00:44:59,169
We were gonna tell people
where she was.

912
00:44:59,337 --> 00:45:00,370
You were gonna die.

913
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,540
'Cause there's something
this man wants

914
00:45:03,508 --> 00:45:05,008
even more
than eight million dollars.

915
00:45:05,076 --> 00:45:06,109
Shut your mouth!

916
00:45:06,277 --> 00:45:07,060
Hey!

917
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:10,013
Lady seems to know a lot.

918
00:45:11,382 --> 00:45:13,650
I know everything.

919
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:15,852
All the girls he kept,

920
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,021
till he was through with them.

921
00:45:19,357 --> 00:45:21,291
Till he got bored,

922
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,327
or just broke them down.

923
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:25,362
I even know

924
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,031
about the one
he dumped in the river

925
00:45:27,999 --> 00:45:30,867
before he was sure she was dead.

926
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:35,772
It's over.

927
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:39,993
You can't hurt me anymore.

928
00:45:44,399 --> 00:45:46,633
You can't fight a ghost.

929
00:46:03,618 --> 00:46:05,152
We're going now.

930
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:07,454
We'll be okay. Here.

931
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:16,680
Go now.

932
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:41,989
I told you to wait.

933
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:43,857
There were shots.

934
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:45,309
We made a call.

935
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:48,612
We were coming out.

936
00:46:48,696 --> 00:46:50,614
Is she injured?

937
00:46:50,665 --> 00:46:52,015
Are you hurt?

938
00:46:52,183 --> 00:46:53,283
Then get over it.

939
00:46:53,334 --> 00:46:54,451
The money's here.

940
00:46:54,502 --> 00:46:56,003
I want it bagged,
and our presence

941
00:46:56,037 --> 00:46:58,872
swept in three minutes.

942
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:02,926
You're okay.

943
00:47:03,011 --> 00:47:05,012
You're okay, okay?

944
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:08,181
You're free.

945
00:47:08,266 --> 00:47:10,434
You're free.

946
00:47:27,952 --> 00:47:29,903
<i>
It's a solid win, ma'am.</i>

947
00:47:29,987 --> 00:47:31,238
<i>The client's stabilized.</i>

948
00:47:31,322 --> 00:47:33,407
<i>We have the payment,
plus the eight million.</i>

949
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:36,209
<i>And both Actives
performed admirably.</i>

950
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:38,812
It nearly came
crashing down on us.

951
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,514
It was contained.

952
00:47:40,681 --> 00:47:42,149
Yeah.

953
00:47:42,216 --> 00:47:43,617
Yes.

954
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:46,119
Now tell me how we're
going to contain this.

955
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:15,532
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
get that thing out of my face.

956
00:48:15,716 --> 00:48:17,884
It's for the video yearbook.
Say hi to your mom.

957
00:48:18,052 --> 00:48:19,753
Okay. Hi, Mom! Are we done?

958
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,022
Is there someone you'd
like to say good-bye to?

959
00:48:24,225 --> 00:48:26,159
Ditra and Meg,
life without you

960
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:28,962
will be meaningless
and bleak, my dormies.

961
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,100
Oh, and the girls of Sigma Tau,
sisters forever.

962
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:35,786
Let's hope those venereal
diseases make you all sterile,

963
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:38,255
you snobby-ass pack of hos.

964
00:48:38,222 --> 00:48:39,656
Oh, that's definitely
going in.

965
00:48:39,724 --> 00:48:42,309
So, what are you planning
on doing after graduation?

966
00:48:42,393 --> 00:48:45,479
Yeah, I probably
should have thought about that.

967
00:48:47,598 --> 00:48:49,800
I'd like to take my place
in the world,

968
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:51,818
like Mrs. Dundee taught us.

969
00:48:51,886 --> 00:48:54,855
Global Recovery,
Doctors Without Borders.

970
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:58,125
The world is in need
of some serious saving.

971
00:48:58,159 --> 00:48:59,493
And I want to travel.

972
00:48:59,577 --> 00:49:01,995
Travel around the world
as I save it.

973
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,966
In a private jet
that I pilot and design.

974
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:11,037
Okay, go ahead and laugh,
yearbook monkey.

975
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:12,405
I know: I'm such a cliche.

976
00:49:12,473 --> 00:49:13,740
What can I say?

977
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,091
I want to do everything.

978
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:17,260
Is that too much to ask?

979
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:20,260
