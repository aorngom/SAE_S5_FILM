1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,426
Oh, my God. Come quick!
It's your sister Annabelle!

2
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:11,928
<i>I want to come home.</i>

3
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:14,368
Taking Annabelle...
That was never part of the deal.

4
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:18,142
You asked me to give you data to tell you
when we were running the experiment.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,519
- That's all.
- The deal is whatever we say it is.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,021
Annabelle is just insurance.

7
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,056
- What's that on his hand?
- That looks like a ring.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,109
A quantum entanglement device.

9
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,404
I'm Gabriel McDow. I told you that.
I definitely said that already.

10
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,491
- You have to remember things.
- Why have you been following me?

11
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:35,451
You're going the wrong way.

12
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,663
The futures I saw,
you're always with Lloyd.

13
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,082
You all know Fiona Banks, MI-6.

14
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:44,013
None of them had visions,
and now they're all dead.

15
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:46,018
"The blue hand. No limits. No fear."

16
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:48,571
- A death club?
- Slingerland. Am I saying that right?

17
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:51,300
It says here you taught American history
at South Fairfax high.

18
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,469
This conversation
has already been written.

19
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,388
Whatever you've all seen
is gonna happen.

20
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,705
<i>Now Celia's death was an accident.</i>

21
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,725
<i>It could've happened to anyone.</i>

22
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:02,270
What I saw doesn't have
to play out that way.

23
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,180
I found a way to change the game.

24
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:21,340
You do realize you're wearing
the same jacket you were wearing

25
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:23,664
when we broke ground
on the accelerator.

26
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:26,177
It was an accident, I suppose.

27
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,255
There are no accidents, Lloyd.

28
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:33,260
I detect some sublimated sentiment

29
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:34,802
bubbling to the surface.

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,941
This is a big deal for both of us.

31
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:40,930
We've been working
on tachyons for 12 years.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,998
This is our moment, Simon.

33
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:46,930
Go with it. Cheers.

34
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:47,858
Cheers.

35
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:52,297
God, I hope it all works.

36
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:56,115
We're simulating the big bang.
What could go wrong?

37
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,729
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

38
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:01,392
Sure. It's mum.

39
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:04,363
Hello.

40
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:09,823
What?

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,864
When?

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,141
Is Annabelle all right?

43
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:26,715
Just tell her
I'll be on the first flight home.

44
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:30,996
Okay, you, too. Bye.

45
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:37,784
My dad died.

46
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:43,412
<i>Activation in one minute.</i>

47
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,775
All right.

48
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:49,014
This experience was
designed by Dr. Campos,

49
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,712
who, unfortunately,
could not be with us on this day

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,971
when we recreate
the beginning of the universe.

51
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,185
Lloyd Simcoe, Dr. Campos' mentor,
the brain behind the brain.

52
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,639
This is Angie Tremont
from the "new science report."

53
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:02,957
A journalist?

54
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,935
It's all right. She's been cleared.

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,965
Sorry.

56
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,350
We have a rather strict
confidentiality protocol,

57
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,149
so we're a little wary of the press.

58
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,225
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Simcoe.

59
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,690
Dr. Myhill's been telling me
all about the project.

60
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:16,153
Your crowning glory.

61
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:17,978
It's been a team effort.

62
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,825
Gordon, the preliminary firings
have started.

63
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:23,158
The big moment.

64
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,078
Yes?

65
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:31,328
They're ready.

66
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:39,117
- <i>Activation commencing in 30 seconds.</i>
- Initiate. Here goes nothing.

67
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,018
Or everything.

68
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:46,676
<i>Activation commencing</i>

69
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,149
<i>in 20 seconds.</i>

70
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:58,350
<i>Activation commencing
in 10 seconds...</i>

71
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:31,493
The visions people had are really
only just possible futures.

72
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:34,125
The universe operates
within certain parameters,

73
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,166
but there is some flexibility.

74
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,406
With one week till the 29th,
Dr. Simcoe,

75
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,840
we are all still
wondering what to expect.

76
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,485
It's a well-known precept
in quantum physics

77
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,845
that observations shape reality.

78
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,413
<i>You're saying
that seeing our futures</i>

79
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,883
<i>may, in fact, change our futures.</i>

80
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:52,827
<i>That's the theory, yes.</i>

81
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,620
<i>But the future does have
a way of fighting back.</i>

82
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:57,663
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

83
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:00,943
<i>Small things may change,
but the forces of the universe</i>

84
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,769
<i>may be pushing us towards
the futures we have seen.</i>

85
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:05,075
<i>That's interesting.</i>

86
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:08,868
<i>And what about the people who learned
they were meant to die before the 29th</i>

87
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:11,495
<i>but lived past the fatal event?</i>

88
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,374
<i>Those people are the statistical
anomalies at the edge of the curve.</i>

89
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,052
<i>Should you still be worried?</i>

90
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,046
<i>Because it sounds like you're saying
the universe may course-correct,</i>

91
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:22,798
<i>that they might not have
escaped their fates after all.</i>

92
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,005
<i>Yes, that's possible.</i>

93
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,715
<i>So maybe a better word
for "course-correction"</i>

94
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,990
<i>is "destiny"?</i>

95
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:32,516
<i>I'm just a scientist, I'm not really
qualified to answer that question.</i>

96
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,518
<i>I'd like to welcome tonight's</i>

97
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,679
next guest, Celia Quinones.

98
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:39,899
Ms. Quinones is the young woman
whose future was changed

99
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,193
by the suicide of FBI
Agent Al Gough,

100
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,655
one of Dr. Simcoe's
"statistical anomalies."

101
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,155
Ms. Quinones,
take us through your experience.

102
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,408
<i>First, I would like to say again
to the family of Agent Gough</i>

103
00:06:52,604 --> 00:06:56,603
<i>how grateful my family and I
are for his actions.</i>

104
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:01,223
In the first weeks
after the blackout,

105
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:05,341
I heard that not having a vision meant
that I would be dead on April 29th.

106
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,495
<i>That must've been
terrifying for you.</i>

107
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,387
<i>When I discovered on
the mosaic Web site</i>

108
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,226
<i>that I would be hit by a car,</i>

109
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:12,807
<i>I lived in constant terror</i>

110
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,309
- that I might die at any moment.
- But you didn't.

111
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,938
I'm sure a lot of people have questions,
so let's open up the phone lines.

112
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,159
Muncie, Indiana, you're on the air.

113
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:22,967
<i>This question's for Dr. Simcoe.</i>

114
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:26,387
<i>Is it possible the blackout caused
permanent brain damage to anyone?</i>

115
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:29,414
There's no reason to believe so.

116
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,145
<i>People's lives have been ruined.
What if this happens again?</i>

117
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,579
It is critical
that people remain calm.

118
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,742
And I must repeat that...

119
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:41,544
no one's brain was damaged
in any way by the blackout itself.

120
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,462
<i>And let me reassure you</i>

121
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,268
<i>it is impossible...</i>

122
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:47,258
<i>that there could be
another blackout.</i>

123
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:49,385
I almost believe him myself.

124
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:52,722
Tell me again why we're not telling
people there's another blackout coming?

125
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,225
We don't know when it's gonna happen.
We tell people but don't say when?

126
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,686
The world will turn
into an armed camp.

127
00:07:58,854 --> 00:07:59,889
So, Celia,

128
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,409
you're confident
that your future has changed?

129
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,479
I'm still here.

130
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:08,802
The universe seems to have
a different plan for me.

131
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:12,627
Thank you for joining us today.
Any last words, Dr. Simcoe?

132
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:16,504
Come the 29th,

133
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:20,026
I believe that we will end up

134
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,335
where we're supposed to be.

135
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:23,920
"Supposed to be"?

136
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,963
That doesn't mean
we can't decide our fate.

137
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,925
<i>After the break,
we'll be talking to ***...</i>

138
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,844
<i>author of the award-winning book
"Teens and truth."</i>

139
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,847
<i>She's going to help us
figure how to talk about...</i>

140
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,057
Stop! Stop!

141
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,749
That's my sister!

142
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,774
Stop there!

143
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,234
Stop, Simon! Don't come
any closer or they'll kill me!

144
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,612
- Who?
- They're watching. They'll shoot me.

145
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,598
What?

146
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:51,773
What? Who?

147
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,909
- What do they want?
- They said they want you and the ring.

148
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,085
They got your message,
and they're sending one back.

149
00:08:58,275 --> 00:08:59,997
You have 12 hours,
or they'll kill me.

150
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,491
Please, Simon.

151
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:06,045
Give them what they want.
They were very specific.

152
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,291
You only have 12 hours to give them
the ring or they will kill me.

153
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,884
Get in the car. Just go.

154
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,553
- Annabelle, I'm not leaving you here.
- Get in the car.

155
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,806
Just go! Please, just go!

156
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:32,242
Let's go.
Now.

157
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,741
-= Blackout Team =-

158
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,869
Saison 1 - Épisode 19
-= Course Correction =-

159
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,598
Zampieron?

160
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:01,507
Tech wizard extraordinaire?

161
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:04,777
I'll take that as a "yes".

162
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,913
- License plate?
- You are good.

163
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,780
What I'd like to know
is whose car that belongs to.

164
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,790
Yeah, I can definitely do this.

165
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,664
Simple.
Just gotta run it by the head man.

166
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:20,828
That's the part of the process
I'd like you to omit.

167
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:23,239
No can do.

168
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,166
Name your price.

169
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:28,961
Anything?

170
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:39,847
How do you always know
when I'm here?

171
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:44,644
Stalking. Internet. Paid informants.
You know, the usual.

172
00:10:48,518 --> 00:10:49,899
I brought you a book.

173
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:53,402
It's one of my favorites,
and it helped me a lot with my mom.

174
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,846
I wish...

175
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:04,531
I wish you'd tell me when
you're getting chemo.

176
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:10,002
I don't want you
to feel obligated to come.

177
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:13,097
It's not an obligation.

178
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,069
LAPD called.

179
00:11:35,982 --> 00:11:38,065
Someone claiming to be MI6

180
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,229
used my name to get
access to a crime scene.

181
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:41,492
Hello, Demetri.

182
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,995
- You're looking well.
- You too, Fiona.

183
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,748
I'm guessing you didn't fly
all the way in from London

184
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,273
just 'cause you missed me.

185
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,879
Andrew Weeks was supposed to die
on march the 2nd from a drug allergy,

186
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,688
but he survived the date.

187
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:57,575
He made a big deal
out of it too, huh?

188
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,928
His wife heard him fall,
came running out and found him dead.

189
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,472
No sign of anyone coming
in or out the house.

190
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,851
If I'm living on borrowed time,
I might avoid a room full of guns.

191
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,519
Except he wasn't shot.

192
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,876
He was bleeding from
the mouth and nose,

193
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:13,274
so forensics
field-tested his coffee.

194
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:15,985
- It showed positive for warfarin.
- Rat poison?

195
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,554
That explains the bleeding.

196
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,156
I don't get it.

197
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:23,470
You got a room full of guns,

198
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,344
and you poison a guy. Why?

199
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:29,040
Weeks was supposed to die from
a drug allergy, not a gunshot wound.

200
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,137
The killer was trying
to get as close as possible

201
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:32,777
to the original cause of death.

202
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,760
That was in his papers.

203
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,812
These are directions to
a blue hand gathering.

204
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,703
That's why I'm here.
Four blue handers

205
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:41,010
dead in the L.A. area
in the last three weeks.

206
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,561
Each knew exactly how and when
they were supposed to die

207
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:45,299
but lived past their death date.

208
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:47,878
I was in Anaheim investigating
when I got word of this one.

209
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:50,227
You really think someone's trying
to knock off survivors?

210
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,229
It's just a hunch.

211
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,429
What was I supposed to say?

212
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,921
"Yes, there's gonna
be another blackout.

213
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,088
Sorry, we just can't tell you when."

214
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,025
So you said what you had to.

215
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,675
I mean, people are terrified.
You gave 'em hope.

216
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,702
No, what I gave them was a lie.

217
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:14,293
What would give people hope is if Simon
and I could crack this QED technology.

218
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,129
Then at least people wouldn't
black out in the first place.

219
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:20,275
What about that caller
who asked about brain damage?

220
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,835
I mean, I've never
even considered that.

221
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,218
No. If the blackout
could cause brain damage,

222
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:27,517
we would've picked up on it
a long time ago.

223
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:30,608
I know how much
this is weighing on you.

224
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,988
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

225
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:39,635
You already are.

226
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,373
You wanted to see me?

227
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:56,196
You may think
that promising a junior analyst

228
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,296
a weekend at the bunny ranch
will get him

229
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,172
to jeopardize his job, but it won't.

230
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,301
My sister ran away from home

231
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:04,594
after the blackout

232
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:06,809
I saw her this morning.

233
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:10,359
She was in a white van
with that license plate.

234
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,852
So you just figured you'd have
one of my agents help you out?

235
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,812
I have to find her.

236
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:17,636
We ran the plate.

237
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:20,610
Van was stolen two days ago
in San Francisco.

238
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:22,820
Traffic cam...

239
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,148
picked this up.

240
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:29,619
Now that's a nice story, Simon,
but how about the truth?

241
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:32,226
You wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

242
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:37,919
I was trying
to have her come with me.

243
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:42,214
The people she's with,
they have some sort of hold over her.

244
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,634
You're lying. She didn't run away.

245
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:45,885
She was kidnapped.

246
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,429
Look at her body language.
She's terrified.

247
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:52,642
- How long have you known?
- What are you talking about?

248
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,852
Don't play games with me.
This is your sister.

249
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,687
Exactly. My sister.

250
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:59,366
That's why I'll do anything
to find her.

251
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:02,648
That's what I'm afraid of.

252
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:05,939
Someone knows you feel this way,
they'll use it against you as leverage.

253
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:08,699
And considering what you know,
I'd say they could get a lot.

254
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,701
Are you suggesting
I've been compromised?

255
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,913
I don't know what you've been, but I do
know one thing: you've been lying.

256
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,001
And now you've put the entire
mosaic investigation in jeopardy.

257
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:41,065
What do you think?
Something in the ring's structure

258
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,150
has to be maintaining superposition.

259
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,656
It's keeping people awake, but how?

260
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:49,949
You're not listening.

261
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,690
"Maintaining superposition"
was what you said,

262
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:53,911
and I have no idea.

263
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,289
Do you want to focus a little?

264
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,309
We've done enough damage.
Maybe we can put something right.

265
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:02,174
Look, just because you feel guilty
about lying on the news

266
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:05,006
and want to save the world doesn't mean
that we can actually make it happen.

267
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,800
Yes, we can,
and it's not about feeling guilty.

268
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,677
No, it's about
preventing more deaths.

269
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,602
It's all Lloyd Simcoe's fault,
and now he can save the day.

270
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:14,855
It's a little messianic,
don't you think?

271
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,216
What are you talking about?

272
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:19,103
Millions of deaths.

273
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,705
It's an overwhelming concept.

274
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,025
Numbers like that,
you lose track of individuals.

275
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:25,526
They fall through the cracks.

276
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:28,529
- A single person doesn't even matter.
- Now you're losing me.

277
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:32,533
My sister.

278
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,577
Annabelle?
So what are you talking about?

279
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,818
She's been kidnapped.

280
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,665
- When?
- A few days after the blackout.

281
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,751
Why would anyone kidnap your sister?

282
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:44,959
- I have no idea.
- What do the police say?

283
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:47,632
The FBI are on it.
There's nothing more I can do.

284
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,694
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've helped.

285
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,177
Oh, yeah? How?

286
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:55,002
I don't know, but...
now I just feel useless.

287
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:56,515
It's not about you.

288
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,619
I had to deal with the situation
as best I could for Annabelle.

289
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:02,797
Now I'm sorry I didn't keep you
in the loop.

290
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:04,593
I've been kinda busy.

291
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:12,740
Why would he hide the fact
that his sister was kidnapped?

292
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,283
The polygraph's inconclusive.

293
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,479
You really think he's compromised?

294
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:19,043
There's nothing concrete, but...

295
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,864
I don't like this situation
any more than you do,

296
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:23,125
but we need Simon.

297
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,814
We'll look for his sister.

298
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:27,545
Find her, and find out
what they want from him.

299
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:33,491
I never thought
we'd be talking to this guy again.

300
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,660
Everyone, next week's reading

301
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,724
Schopenhauer.

302
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:46,023
Mr. Slingerland?

303
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:48,957
Agent Noh.

304
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:51,974
I'm so glad to see you again.

305
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:53,739
This is inspector Banks.

306
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,951
- I remember you, too.
- Mr. Slingerland.

307
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:58,395
What's going on?

308
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,331
Do you recognize this man?

309
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,127
That's Andrew. Andy Weeks.

310
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:09,005
I remember seeing him
at the blue hand gatherings.

311
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,799
That was a while ago.
I'm not really into that anymore.

312
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,759
- Why do you ask?
- He's dead.

313
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:17,013
How?

314
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,097
Murdered.

315
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:26,081
Poor Andy.

316
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,295
Guess he thought
he was in the clear.

317
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,865
But I suppose the universe has to,
balance itself.

318
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:37,199
Excuse me?

319
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,887
Life is energy, you see.

320
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,746
As each new life begins,
another ends.

321
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,373
And if you mess with that balance,
the universe pushes back.

322
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,418
Andy was a good guy. I'm sorry.

323
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,466
We need you to put together a list
of the blue handers who knew Mr. Weeks.

324
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:51,756
- Can you do that for us?
- Be happy to.

325
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,545
And you might want to be careful.

326
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,261
We think someone's killing the people
that lived past their death dates

327
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:58,387
people like you.

328
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:02,058
So you don't want me to go on television
and announce it to the world?

329
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,255
Just watch you back,
is what we're saying.

330
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,937
I will, agent Noh.

331
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,535
Gabriel's blood work came back.

332
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,091
So besides his feet,
everything seems okay.

333
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,485
The left foot looks good.
His right still looks pretty bad.

334
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,563
Okay, well, let's finish
up the antibiotics,

335
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:19,681
and we'll reevaluate tomorrow.

336
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,016
<i>Orderlies to admitting.</i>

337
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,115
Where's Charlie?

338
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,859
Hey, you!

339
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:28,382
Charlie's at school.

340
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:29,957
What are you doing here?

341
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,797
Occupational therapy,
which I completely forgot about.

342
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:35,466
Dylan was hoping to see you,

343
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,919
and...

344
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:38,719
so was I.

345
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:48,801
I knew it.

346
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,773
I saw it would happen.

347
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,149
- I knew it.
- Pardon?

348
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,610
You're supposed to be with Olivia.
Not the an other one.

349
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,843
Gabriel, let's go. Come on.
Back to bed.

350
00:19:56,968 --> 00:19:58,698
- My shoes.
- Your shoes didn't fit.

351
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,800
- Your feet were bleeding.
- I liked those shoes.

352
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:03,225
We'll get you some more shoes.
We will. Let's go.

353
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,704
<i>Lloyd and Olivia sitting in a tree</i>

354
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,331
I'll explain later.

355
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,701
- Let's go?
- Okay.

356
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:09,625
Let's go.

357
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,360
Inside. Gabe, we're gonna do this.
Let's go.

358
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:13,610
So good.

359
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:15,961
So good that you're together
with Lloyd now.

360
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:18,365
- No, we're not together.
- You are now. It's so good.

361
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,892
You know what? We're not,
we're not together, Gabe. We're just...

362
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:22,605
That's complicated.
We're...

363
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,770
You're the best thing
since sliced bread. Yes?

364
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:28,386
- The best thing since sliced bread.
- In you go.

365
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:30,730
Can I come in?

366
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:34,108
Brought lunch. Hi, Gabriel.

367
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,755
- Where's the beef?
- Right here.

368
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,805
Go ahead.

369
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:43,718
So how's he doing?

370
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:46,537
- He's better.
- Good.

371
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:49,707
We got a lot of questions, I'm gonna
have to bring him into the FBI.

372
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:53,401
He hasn't finished
his IV antibiotics.

373
00:20:53,526 --> 00:20:55,103
He needs a brain scan.

374
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:57,120
He's not going anywhere
for a few days.

375
00:20:58,593 --> 00:21:01,422
Would it be all right if I just ask him
a few questions here, then?

376
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:03,684
Sure.

377
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:11,520
Can I ask you a question?
I found this in your things.

378
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,816
You wanna tell me what this is?

379
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,061
My book. It's all there.

380
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,114
But what is this a picture of?

381
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,407
Gabriel, this is important.

382
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:25,701
I saw it.

383
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:27,787
I was there,

384
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:29,246
on a trip.

385
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,376
I saw it.

386
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,617
A flash-forward.

387
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:44,595
- I don't like pickles!
- Okay, it's okay.

388
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:49,291
I don't like lettuce!
I hate onions! I...

389
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,087
I like tomatoes.

390
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:00,832
Now where are we?

391
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:03,489
Starting from where we first pick up
the van Campos' sister was in,

392
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,992
6th street bridge.
Then we headed South.

393
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,679
We picked them up here,
and then here,

394
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:10,663
they head
into this weird zone downtown.

395
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,052
Eight blocks wide.
Coverage their is sketchy, we lost them.

396
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:15,459
- You can't get me any more than that?
- I'm not a magician.

397
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:19,505
Any way we can pick up
the van coming out of that zone?

398
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,616
There are over a hundred exits.
It'd take at least a day and a half

399
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,802
- to go through.
- It's only eight blocks.

400
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,597
We can do a sweep in less time
than whiz kid here

401
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,048
- You found something.
- Just following up on a tip.

402
00:22:33,173 --> 00:22:34,514
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

403
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:36,314
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not!

404
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:37,990
Listen to me, Simon.

405
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:39,358
You're here for one reason

406
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,770
and one reason only...
to work on the QED.

407
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:44,986
Your volunteering here is starting
to feel a little convenient.

408
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,712
I don't trust you, Simon.
Not for a minute.

409
00:22:47,837 --> 00:22:49,716
- That's your prerogative.
- You're damn right,

410
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:52,179
and that's not gonna work out
too well for you.

411
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:55,909
Right now I'm gonna go
get your sister back.

412
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:59,033
And after I do, you and I
are gonna have a little sit-down.

413
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:00,950
No more lying.

414
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:34,622
<i>They want you and the ring. They got
your message, they're sending one back.</i>

415
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,874
<i>You have 12 hours,
or they'll kill me.</i>

416
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,503
<i>Please, Simon.
Give them what they want.</i>

417
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:05,987
Thanks for coming by.

418
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:09,598
I wanted to go over
your latest serologies with you.

419
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:13,327
Your tumor markers are undetectable.
Lymphocytes are back to normal.

420
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:15,595
Wait.

421
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:19,405
- Does that mean that I'm...
- Experimentation seems to be working.

422
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:22,169
Your cancer is officially
in remission.

423
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:24,371
What?

424
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:28,338
We've been optimistic
for a few weeks.

425
00:24:28,463 --> 00:24:29,969
I didn't want to get your hopes up.

426
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,805
I've had two other oncologists
check those results,

427
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:34,538
and it's working.

428
00:24:34,663 --> 00:24:35,982
That's incredible.

429
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,855
What are you waiting for? Go on.
Get out of here.

430
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,773
The future awaits.

431
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:53,886
You wanted to see me?

432
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,958
We have a shift down
at immigration tonight

433
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,715
giving flu shots to detainees.
Can you help out?

434
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,785
Sure. Happy to.

435
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,357
Great. Take a look through these files
see what you're getting yourself into.

436
00:25:04,482 --> 00:25:07,275
Don't worry. It's all basic.
Nothing you can't handle.

437
00:25:24,842 --> 00:25:26,315
Have you been working all day?

438
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,944
Since 5 o'clock in the morning.

439
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,029
Do you know this man?

440
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:32,031
Someone tampered with his coffee.

441
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,869
- You're sure?
- He's a regular. He's here every day.

442
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,913
- So am I.
- When's the last time you saw him?

443
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:42,959
Yesterday. He was here with some guy,
chatting away like they were old pals.

444
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,641
Made a big deal
about surviving something,

445
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:47,255
his whole life to look forward to.

446
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:48,965
What'd his friend look like?

447
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,842
I don't know.
Tall, kinda geeky-looking,

448
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,852
wearing this big,
ugly horseshoe ring.

449
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,519
<i>Life is energy, you see.
As each new life begins,</i>

450
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,980
<i>another ends. If you mess
with that balance, the universe...</i>

451
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:05,898
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I am.

452
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:07,262
<i>Pushes back.</i>

453
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:10,486
"You can do

454
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:11,784
"what you will,

455
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:14,220
"but at any given moment
of your life,

456
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,371
"you can will
only one definite thing.

457
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,328
"Nothing other than that thing."

458
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:21,330
What does that means?

459
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,667
That free will is a lie?

460
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:31,966
Exactly.

461
00:26:39,426 --> 00:26:40,641
Where's Mr. Slingerland?

462
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,603
I don't know. He was here,
and then he just left.

463
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,574
Are you Agent Noh?

464
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,941
He wanted me to tell you something.

465
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:49,859
What?

466
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:52,005
The universe always pushes back.

467
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,268
<i>You might want to be careful.</i>

468
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:58,284
<i>Someone's killing the people
that lived past their death dates.</i>

469
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,163
<i>So you don't want me to go on television
and announce it to the world?</i>

470
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:03,289
I'm still here.

471
00:27:03,674 --> 00:27:05,917
The universe seems to have
a different plan for me.

472
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,474
He's trying to course-correct.

473
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,172
I know who he's going after next.

474
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:25,478
Welcome to your future.

475
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:37,198
Run! Celia, run!

476
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:39,492
Now! Celia!

477
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:47,250
He's heading South on grand!

478
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:51,796
Freeze! FBI!

479
00:28:00,235 --> 00:28:02,445
She just ran in front of me!
I couldn't stop!

480
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,789
She's still alive.

481
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,812
EMTs to grand and 6th priority 3!

482
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,854
Code 1! Move!

483
00:28:09,427 --> 00:28:10,648
She was just there.

484
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:12,839
She's all right. Stay with her!

485
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:23,820
She's not dead.

486
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:25,153
She's alive.

487
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:26,205
You failed.

488
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,207
Not yet.
Anyway...

489
00:28:30,762 --> 00:28:31,860
It's not me.

490
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:33,754
It's the universe,

491
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:36,674
which never fails.

492
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,600
It's funny.

493
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:45,958
I was supposed to have an aneurysm,

494
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:47,977
you killed me instead.

495
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:50,998
Gets done either way.

496
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,915
See you soon...

497
00:28:55,962 --> 00:28:56,861
sport.

498
00:29:27,706 --> 00:29:31,145
- Simon.
- Here to make up for my bad behavior.

499
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:35,225
Don't worry about it. You've been under
a lot of stress lately.

500
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,237
I just wanted to say thanks.

501
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:39,320
For what?

502
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:42,823
Cambridge, the Brewschlagger fellowship,
for getting me into NLAP.

503
00:29:43,702 --> 00:29:46,278
I did it for selfish reasons.
You make me look good.

504
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:47,453
Gracious as well.

505
00:29:48,102 --> 00:29:49,954
You helped me out and you know it.

506
00:29:50,282 --> 00:29:51,934
I wouldn't be anywhere without you.

507
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,668
What's going on?

508
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,673
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Annabelle. Truly, I am.

509
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:02,845
I should've. It's been eating away at me,
and I've been pretending I was fine.

510
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:04,951
I should have said something.

511
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:07,265
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

512
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,207
- I would have, you know.
- I know you would.

513
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:11,936
You're my only friend.

514
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:16,822
You are clearly in need of a drink.
Come on.

515
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:18,885
You're not wrong, but I...

516
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,569
I have to be somewhere.

517
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:23,315
I'll see you, Lloyd.

518
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:40,904
I've been looking all over for you.

519
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:45,943
What's the matter?

520
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:53,584
- I have something I have to tell you.
- Me too.

521
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,821
- Then.
- You're never gonna believe this.

522
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:07,074
My cancer is in remission.

523
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:10,036
- I know!
- My God! That's amazing!

524
00:31:10,472 --> 00:31:12,277
I'm still completely in shock,

525
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:16,834
and it got me thinking about my future,
and I don't want to waste any more time.

526
00:31:18,874 --> 00:31:19,987
Are you sure?

527
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,381
- What we saw is.
- No, forget what we saw.

528
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:24,382
We're here, now.

529
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:27,470
This is all that matters.

530
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:39,653
What happened to Celia...

531
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,840
there was nothing we could do.

532
00:31:46,098 --> 00:31:48,067
I've been thinking about our bird.

533
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:50,743
What if you tape the window?

534
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:53,598
- How do you mean?
- Well, if you cover the window,

535
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:56,582
the bird might not crash into it.

536
00:31:56,938 --> 00:31:58,292
It's a nice thought.

537
00:31:59,024 --> 00:32:01,837
But I think it'll probably just crash
into a different window.

538
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,005
Maybe.

539
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:05,967
But it's worth a shot.

540
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,801
It's the hospital calling.

541
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:28,897
<i>Agent banks?
Agent Fiona banks?</i>

542
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:32,343
<i>I'm calling about Celia Quinones
and I'm afraid it's bad news.</i>

543
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:35,871
<i>Her physical and neurological injuries
are extensive, and I'm not optimistic</i>

544
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,832
<i>about her chance of survival.</i>

545
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,431
You're gonna call again on the 29th

546
00:32:43,018 --> 00:32:45,423
- to tell me that she's gone.
- <i>Ms. Banks,</i>

547
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:47,893
<i>what happened to Celia
was an accident.</i>

548
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:52,440
There are no accidents anymore.

549
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,308
<i>Mark, we're running out of time
for Campos' sister.</i>

550
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:05,214
<i>I've covered a 5-block radius.
Only 3 to go.</i>

551
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:21,328
I'm sorry.

552
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:22,793
Special Agent Benford.

553
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:23,763
FBI.

554
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:26,204
Looks like
they got you working late.

555
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:29,926
Yeah. Some clown ran right into this,
nearly took out the electrical box.

556
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:32,393
Pulled into that warehouse
driving crazy.

557
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:34,116
That's a lot of damage.

558
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:36,846
Imagine what the van looked like.

559
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:38,184
Imagine.

560
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:44,686
I think I found the van.

561
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,815
Put me through to the SWAT.

562
00:34:15,863 --> 00:34:17,081
You're safe now.

563
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:18,206
I'm here.

564
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:27,108
<i>It's mark.</i>

565
00:34:27,476 --> 00:34:28,526
We got her.

566
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,699
She's sitting right next to me.

567
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:32,297
Thank God.

568
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,407
- Is she all right?
- <i>Exhausted,</i>

569
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:37,285
- confused, but physically she's fine.
- <i>Can I talk to her for a second?</i>

570
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:39,453
- I just wanna hear her voice.
- <i>All right,</i>

571
00:34:40,332 --> 00:34:43,666
but then you and I need to talk,
and you need to tell me everything.

572
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:45,676
<i>No more lies, Simon.</i>

573
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:47,668
Fine.

574
00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:51,687
He wants to talk to you.

575
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,976
Belle. Is that really you?

576
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:01,343
I'm really tired, Simon.

577
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,394
I wanna go home

578
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:05,339
and see mom.

579
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,304
I know. I just wanted
to make sure you were safe.

580
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:12,038
No matter what happens,
baby sister, remember...

581
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:13,878
I love you.

582
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,847
I love you, too.

583
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:19,000
Good-bye, belle.

584
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,294
He took the damn ring.

585
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:52,838
What am I looking at?

586
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,279
This is Gabriel McDows brain.

587
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:57,198
No brain damage.

588
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,158
And he had hundreds
of flash-forwards.

589
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:01,494
These

590
00:36:01,837 --> 00:36:05,122
are taken from people who were being
scanned at the time of the blackout

591
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,791
on October 6th. Same thing.

592
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,000
No damage.

593
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,380
Nothing unusual.

594
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,303
So you weren't lying
about this in your interview.

595
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:17,309
Makes me feel a bit better.

596
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:18,532
Good.

597
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,645
So this McDow is a savant?

598
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,332
He's pretty high-functioning.

599
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:26,269
- Incredible memory.
- And he thinks

600
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:28,312
we should be together.

601
00:36:31,832 --> 00:36:34,610
That's what he saw
in his flash-forwards.

602
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:37,280
Were we happy?

603
00:36:40,779 --> 00:36:42,451
I know how I felt in mine.

604
00:36:56,243 --> 00:36:57,626
I need to talk to you.

605
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:02,222
I was just leaving.

606
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:08,632
Thanks for the scans.
I really appreciate it.

607
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:10,062
Yes, sure. Excuse me.

608
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,218
- See you later.
- Bye, mark. I'll call you.

609
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:22,950
Simon Campos has disappeared.

610
00:37:24,122 --> 00:37:25,493
- What?
- He's gone.

611
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:29,373
He came to see me tonight.

612
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:33,002
It was the strangest thing.
Like he was trying to say good-bye.

613
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:36,964
The day of the blackout,
anything about

614
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:38,525
his behavior seem...

615
00:37:40,084 --> 00:37:41,115
strange?

616
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:44,988
I don't know. He was in Toronto
at his father's funeral.

617
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,090
My dad died.

618
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,191
- What happened?
- There was an accident.

619
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:57,818
I have to go home.

620
00:37:58,253 --> 00:37:59,636
Yes, of course.

621
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:01,739
Then we'll postpone
until you get back.

622
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:04,158
Stick to the plan.

623
00:38:04,593 --> 00:38:07,870
The system's still on standby.
What difference does? What's the rush?

624
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,465
No, we've worked too long,

625
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,749
too hard at this.
We have to stay on schedule.

626
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,282
It has to be

627
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,747
October 6th,

628
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,250
11:00 AM.

629
00:38:17,196 --> 00:38:18,309
No delays.

630
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:25,471
I never understood
why he would miss that moment,

631
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,640
after all those years of work,

632
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:29,308
we could've changed the date.

633
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,639
Is Simon Campos capable
of engineering a global blackout?

634
00:38:33,742 --> 00:38:35,481
He's capable of anything.

635
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:39,995
And he always has a plan.

636
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,173
Once we realized that his involvement
in the blackout

637
00:38:47,298 --> 00:38:49,787
was deeper than we thought,
I went back and I ran this

638
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,420
gait analysis on Simon
Campos and on suspect zero.

639
00:38:52,545 --> 00:38:55,001
Not only are they comparable in height,
weight and age,

640
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:58,771
they're a 99th percentile match in
spacial-temporal and kinematic classes.

641
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:01,056
But suspect zero was in Detroit,

642
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:03,467
and we have multiple
eyewitnesses that put Simon

643
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:06,470
at his father's funeral
in Toronto the same day.

644
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:09,515
I checked inbound flights
to airports around Detroit.

645
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:11,225
On October 6th,

646
00:39:11,737 --> 00:39:13,905
a g4 with Canadian
tail numbers requested

647
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,355
an emergency maintenance
landing at willow run.

648
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:18,452
So they wouldn't have filed
a flight plan.

649
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:21,402
Plane was on the ground for a couple
of hours then right back to Toronto.

650
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:25,122
He could've gotten to the stadium
then back to the airport by then.

651
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:28,099
Show me that footage again.

652
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,756
Simon Campos is suspect zero.

653
00:39:39,781 --> 00:39:41,505
If I showed you pictures, Annabelle,

654
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,674
could you identify any
of these guys?

655
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:46,098
We need to find
the men who took you.

656
00:39:49,432 --> 00:39:50,890
I never saw any faces.

657
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:54,060
They always wore these weird masks.

658
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:59,065
- Please, can I go home now?
- I know you're tired.

659
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:01,010
Just one more question.

660
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,027
What did they want from Simon?

661
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:05,571
I told you. I don't know.

662
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:09,241
They just left me in the van.
They said they were done with me.

663
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:12,662
Did you overhear anything?
Anything at all?

664
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,419
What did they want him for?

665
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:23,039
I promise you.

666
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,549
Nothing bad will happen to Simon.

667
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,413
Think real hard.

668
00:40:30,112 --> 00:40:32,807
Did you overhear anything?
Anything at all?

669
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:40,815
They said he's going to cause
another blackout.

670
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,026
