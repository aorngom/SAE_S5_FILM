1
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:10,593
<i>It would seem our fates</i>

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,403
<i>are on a collision course.</i>

3
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:14,945
Find Dyson Frost yesterday.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,437
<i>The next move is Mark Benford's.</i>

5
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:19,602
Dyson Frost?
It's your move.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,437
I took this picture.

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:25,107
She saw something she shouldn't have
and got in trouble with Jericho.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,944
The second that Jericho knows
that I'm still alive...

9
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,154
They'll find me,
and they'll kill me.

10
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,448
I know you took her.
Now you're gonna give her back.

11
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,451
- I can't give you your daughter back.
- Then we go to war.

12
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,411
You will be shot 3 times

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,038
on march 15th.

14
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,582
It will be your gun, Agent Benford.

15
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,378
The box is here,
but the gun is gone.

16
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:48,130
My first term was a bitch.

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,467
I could have used you, Stan.
I'm sorry I couldn't bring you in.

18
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,607
I don't want you to think
I'm harassing you.

19
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:55,554
I know.
You're just trying to save the world.

20
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:56,877
Good-bye.

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,267
She was signaling her handlers.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,814
I should have known...

23
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,149
Two moles, in case one is caught...

24
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,510
And not one person in the office
would suspect it's you.

25
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,347
Today is more than just
the beginning of your career.

26
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:22,289
Today, along with a badge and a gun,

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,485
you're gonna get a story
about your first day on the job.

28
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:29,785
Every special agent has one.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,490
Some are funny.
Some are tragic.

30
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,643
Some are boring.

31
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,914
But today won't be
the most important day in your career

32
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,306
as an FBI agent.

33
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:41,988
That day is somewhere down the line.

34
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:44,393
You won't see it coming.

35
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:45,784
It sneaks up on you.

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,150
It'll most likely be
an anonymous moment.

37
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,518
A crossroads where you're asked
to do something,

38
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:54,798
make some kind of personal sacrifice
for the good of someone else,

39
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,419
and that person may never know
your name or see your face

40
00:01:57,544 --> 00:01:59,331
or even understand what you did.

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,379
But you'll know.

42
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:06,858
And isn't that why you're here,
after all?

43
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:11,547
Because you can be counted on
to do the right thing at the right time,

44
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:13,324
every time.

45
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:15,968
Welcome to the FBI.

46
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,736
Well done. Nicely done.

47
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:27,772
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
See me for your partner assignments.

48
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,231
Congratulations.

49
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:33,736
Nicely done.
Special Agent Vreede...

50
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,259
Is it "vreed-y"
or "Vreede" as in "freed"?

51
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:38,532
I don't know.
I got Benford.

52
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,285
- Switch with me.
- Why?

53
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,914
He's a legend. Surveillance,
counterterrorism, trafficking.

54
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:46,817
Do it.

55
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:49,502
Whatever, but you gotta take it up
with Wedeck and get it approved.

56
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,711
Done. Thank you.

57
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,019
- Of course.
- Yes!

58
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:55,216
- Janis, who'd you get?
- No partner. Headed to analysis.

59
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,178
Boring.

60
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:58,302
I got it worse. I report to you.

61
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,305
How could that be?
I scored higher.

62
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,182
Yeah, in, like, one category.

63
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,975
Come on, Marcie. We'll have fun.

64
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,520
We've been a team since Quantico...
Booze and bullets.

65
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:11,106
- What am I, the mascot?
- No, you're like our captain.

66
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,734
You'll probably outpace all of us.
I'm sure of it.

67
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,694
Yeah, we're sure.

68
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:23,428
Interview of Marcie Turoff,

69
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:25,704
Agents Benford and Noh questioning.

70
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,852
March 12, 2010.

71
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:30,334
We'd like to know...

72
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,462
Who came after us
in that parking garage in DC?

73
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,463
I don't know.

74
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,257
Who came after us
in the parking garage in DC?

75
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,633
I don't know.

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,094
- On to the next.
- Are they still after us?

77
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:41,512
I don't know.

78
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,265
- Who killed Ian McKinnon?
- Demetri. Come on. Let's go.

79
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,850
Is that who's coming after me?

80
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,142
Let's go.

81
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,567
We need those answers.

82
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,320
There are a whole lot of other ones
we need to get to first.

83
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,197
Listen, Dem.

84
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,367
You think I don't have march 15th
circled in my calendar, too?

85
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:06,375
We both know there's a chance
you'll die in three days.

86
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,998
Look, you keep chasing down leads.

87
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,817
I'll let you know when we're ready
for your questions, all right?

88
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,297
Janis, I need your help in here
with Marcie.

89
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,191
Me?

90
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,301
What, you got something more important
than grilling our mole?

91
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,678
No. Of course not.

92
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,064
What were your duties?

93
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,843
Every week, I'd take
whatever information

94
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:42,031
there was in the mosaic investigation
and leave it at a dead drop.

95
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:44,158
Who recruited you?

96
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,830
I was approached by a man
three months before the blackout hit.

97
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,398
What was his name?

98
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,375
All in due time.

99
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:58,047
He asked if I wanted to be
a part of something big.

100
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,007
And you said yes.

101
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,763
You think I sold out
my friends and my country, but...

102
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,806
you don't know me.

103
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:12,061
Why don't you enlighten us?

104
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,398
Come on.
Don't you remember my flash-forward?

105
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,044
No, you don't,

106
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:24,840
'cause neither of you
ever bothered to ask me what I saw.

107
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,161
I was incarcerated.

108
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,898
That didn't cross your mind

109
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:37,294
when you shot six
of your fellow agents?

110
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:42,676
It did.

111
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:46,595
But even though I was in jail,
I was happier than I've been in years.

112
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,889
<i>I thought we'd have to beg
for life without parole.</i>

113
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,599
<i>I told you they'd come around.</i>

114
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,602
<i>Until I tell them who recruited me,
I'm indispensable.</i>

115
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,649
For the first time since I got here,
I actually felt like I was important.

116
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,550
I need you Mark.

117
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,440
These are our guests
from washington.

118
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:17,346
And while they're grateful
for all our efforts

119
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,581
in apprehending Agent Turoff...

120
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,797
You gotta be kidding.

121
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,937
Director Middleton
feels more comfortable

122
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:27,052
having such a highly valued target
where he can keep an eye on her.

123
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,055
And where he can give
the press conferences himself.

124
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:31,682
Hear me out.

125
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:34,581
We know her. We can read her.
Just give us one more day.

126
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,785
I know it's frustrating,

127
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,995
but let's try to get something
positive done today.

128
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,372
Like maybe get back to
what caused the blackout.

129
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,083
I'll be out of the office for a couple
of hours, so give me an update.

130
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:01,545
Dyson Frost. He's our best lead so far.
Where are we?

131
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,798
I've left 4 messages. Haven't heard back.
I'm afraid he's just toying with us.

132
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,594
He's been wanting to talk for 19 years,
and now he's playing hard to get?

133
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,406
Shel, see what you can get
by tracing Frost's phone.

134
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,975
I just got a call from LAPD.

135
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,376
They've got a ballistics report
saying that Mark's gun,

136
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,647
that's supposed to kill me
in three days,

137
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,734
was used in a murder last night.

138
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,288
-= Blackout Team =-

139
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:33,151
Saison 1 Épisode 16
-= Let No Man Put Asunder =-

140
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,805
So what do we know
from the eyewitness reports?

141
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,928
55-year-old,

142
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:57,045
in his cot,

143
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,570
presumably asleep.

144
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:00,979
At 3:33 am,

145
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,723
the shooter walked up to him,

146
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,017
and a couple of insomniacs
heard the victim say...

147
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,322
I knew it would be you.
I just didn't want to believe.

148
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,075
The shooter must have had
a silencer on your gun.

149
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,854
He plugged him three times
in the chest at close range.

150
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,112
Do you want to put that thing away?

151
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:26,463
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

152
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:30,075
Physical description ranging from...

153
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:33,685
5'5" white guy to a 6' indian.

154
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,091
- Another dead end.
- Wasn't there something about a car?

155
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,269
Somebody said they saw

156
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:46,275
a 1970s blue sedan drive away...
Foreign make.

157
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:48,026
That's a start.

158
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:52,687
LAPD's gonna forward
the victim's effects to us.

159
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,408
Can't wait to sift through that.

160
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:57,035
Forget about the shooter.

161
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,622
Who's the one other person
we know who handled that gun?

162
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,791
There were 40 agents
in that evidence room.

163
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,691
They were all cleared months ago.

164
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:08,111
One of those agents is Marcie?

165
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,326
Stop!

166
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,931
- Stop!
- You guys never give up.

167
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,017
- I need to talk to her.
- She's in our custody.

168
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:24,021
- She's part of our investigation.
- I'm just doing my job.

169
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,231
- Who'd you give my gun to, Marcie?
- I don't know.

170
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,317
- Who has it?
- I don't know.

171
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,652
Come on. Don't do this.
We were friends.

172
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,870
Look, I'm sorry.
Really, I am.

173
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:35,574
All I heard is that
you're supposed to die in LA.

174
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,495
What?

175
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:39,953
Give me more specifics.
Who does it? When?

176
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,623
It was a voice on the phone when
I called to report the gun in lockup.

177
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,459
- Who'd you call?
- A number. It was different every time.

178
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,987
Look, that's all I know.
There isn't any more.

179
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,467
You're gonna die in three days,
there's nothing you can do to stop it.

180
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,795
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,079
Come on.

182
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,434
Marcie, come on.

183
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,030
Come on, come on!

184
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,199
Sweetie, what is the hurry?
We're here.

185
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,329
I told him we'd be here by 2:00.
We're late.

186
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:20,730
- Who?
- Dylan!

187
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:25,256
Nuts to you, Squirrlio!

188
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:27,501
Come on, Dylan!

189
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:29,413
I'm coming.

190
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,047
Did you know about this?

191
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,787
Absolutely not.

192
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,552
Charlie, who arranged this?

193
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,512
I did! I got Dylan's phone number

194
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,180
from him in the hospital.

195
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:43,433
He was very insistent
about this specific park,

196
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,060
and now I know why.

197
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,437
Do you normally come here?

198
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,964
The house is just around the corner.

199
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:51,921
Right.

200
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,363
- This is fun.
- You go first.

201
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,410
- I can sit on a bench.
- Fine. Doesn't have to be that way.

202
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,209
- What happened?
- Let me see.

203
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,501
We bonked heads.

204
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:12,377
- Did he hit your teeth?
- Let me see, baby.

205
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:15,132
- Let's see. Open up.
- I'm bleeding.

206
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,304
Let me see.

207
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,283
- She okay?
- Open your mouth.

208
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,471
Here we go.

209
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,849
I want you to do something now.
Just grab my hand,

210
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,476
when it hurts, I want you to squeeze
as hard as possible, okay?

211
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:31,231
Is that all you got?
You try a little bit harder than that.

212
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:32,524
That's good.

213
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,444
Does this mean I can't go
to the carnival, mommy?

214
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,779
I think you're gonna be fine
for the carnival.

215
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,531
I think you're gonna be okay.

216
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,782
That's good.

217
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,077
I'm starting to feel that a bit now.
I'm just gonna get a bottle of water

218
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,246
and a towel.
You'll be okay.

219
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,488
I see carnivals in your future.
Come here.

220
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:52,002
- I wanna go.
- I know.

221
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:53,992
It's okay, sweetie.

222
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:11,521
Assistant director Wedeck?

223
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,569
That's me.

224
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:17,069
Come this way.

225
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:19,654
- She's ready for you.
- Thank you.

226
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:28,916
Madam Vice President.

227
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,784
Good to see you, Stan.

228
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:32,825
It's been quite a while.

229
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:35,436
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

230
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:44,609
Thanks for coming
on such short notice, Stan.

231
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:47,138
How is everything?

232
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,686
You want to tell me
why you dragged me out here?

233
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,731
It's nice to know my new position
hasn't changed your attitude towards me.

234
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,693
Does the name Jericho

235
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,949
ring a bell?

236
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,407
They're a private contractor
operating over in Afghanistan.

237
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,117
I've heard of them.

238
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,786
Agent Benford look into them
a while back.

239
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:12,414
Well,

240
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:16,480
in my security briefing this morning,
I learned that Jericho's CEO

241
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:19,631
just tripled the security
around his malibu compound.

242
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:21,371
You should take a look.

243
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:23,677
Wrong department.
NSA is who you want to call.

244
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,138
I don't want them to know.

245
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,141
I need this done off the books.

246
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,704
The Vice President
doesn't fly across the country

247
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:34,020
'cause some guy hired
an extra night watchman.

248
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:46,246
In my vision, it was clear
that Jericho had done some things

249
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:48,452
that threatened
our national security.

250
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:50,787
The same one where you
saw yourself as President?

251
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,626
As a matter of fact, yes.
And I was there

252
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,297
because Jericho did something
that triggered a political crises.

253
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:05,594
I can't find out anything about what
they're doing. But if it's bad enough

254
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,513
to bring down President Segovia,
it must be significant.

255
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,406
I've been keeping a close eye
on every move they make,

256
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,518
and something
is happening right now.

257
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:17,481
Are you sure you don't know
what it is

258
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,214
even if I did,

259
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:22,266
Dave and I go back 25 years.

260
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:23,403
Listen,

261
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,739
these flash-forwards
are coming true.

262
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,186
Segovia is going down.

263
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:34,646
Do you want to be out with
the old or in with the new?

264
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,720
Now we know your gun's here in L.A.

265
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:45,091
Yeah, too bad Marcie couldn't tell us
who's using it.

266
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:46,895
So I'll run this car info,

267
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,781
see if anything pings
on a 1970s blue sedan.

268
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:51,613
We're gonna get this guy.

269
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,757
Got a second?

270
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,710
Jericho...
You used our database

271
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,268
to look into them a few months ago.

272
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,652
- Is that a problem?
- No. Just curious why you did.

273
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:06,253
It was a favor for a friend...

274
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:09,658
Wanted as much information
as I could give him, which wasn't a lot.

275
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,010
A friend?

276
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:15,130
Do all your friends ask you to research
third world military contractors?

277
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:18,580
He had questions
about his daughter's death.

278
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:20,293
She was serving in Afghanistan.

279
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,003
He thinks Jericho is involved?

280
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:27,176
The things he told me...

281
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,386
They were in confidence.

282
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:31,689
I can respect that.

283
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:33,807
Thanks.

284
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,851
Do you mind if I talk with him?

285
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,219
Maybe ask him a few questions?

286
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:42,098
What's his name?

287
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:43,859
Aaron Stark.

288
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:47,642
Good luck finding him.

289
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:49,823
He's off the grid.
I don't know where he is

290
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:51,829
or how to track him down.

291
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:53,724
- Thank you, Mark.
- Sure.

292
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,424
Just heard on the scanner...

293
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:10,218
L.A.P.D.'s in the middle
of a high-speed chase.

294
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:13,144
Driver... Ross Webber...
Has been spotted with a gun.

295
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,473
Car they're following...
'71 blue sedan.

296
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,726
The shooter
from the homeless shelter?

297
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:20,936
How many criminals are driving
the same disco era sedans, right?

298
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:22,939
Any idea where they're headed?

299
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,430
There's your blue sedan.

300
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:30,634
- Where is he?
- Right inside.

301
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,574
A bunch of people ran out.
He's got hostages.

302
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,254
- Where is he?
- Second floor.

303
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:36,077
- Who's talking to him?
- No one yet.

304
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,802
- He's just gonna come out on his own?
- Captain doesn't want us to do anything.

305
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,375
Shots fired!
Get down! Stay down!

306
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:52,620
You hang back.

307
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,979
I talk to him,

308
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,845
try to make sure he releases
the hostage. Once he does,

309
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,309
you take your shot.

310
00:16:58,678 --> 00:16:59,786
Sounds good,

311
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:03,330
except for the part about me
staying on the sidelines.

312
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,025
No way you're going down there.

313
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,902
I'm not gonna let
that gun kill one more person.

314
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,907
March 15th... I know that's
the day you're supposed to die.

315
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,534
Who says you didn't get shot
three days earlier?

316
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,245
Who is that?!

317
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:21,877
I'm right here!

318
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:27,921
Try not to shoot me.

319
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,930
I told them the only person
I want to talk to is Randy Savage!

320
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,169
Macho man?

321
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,519
Yeah, I dig that.
That's not me.

322
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,771
- My name's Demetri.
- Oh, god!

323
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,733
You don't turn around
in four seconds, I will kill her.

324
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:52,529
Doesn't matter to me.
She's just a saleswoman.

325
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,890
That's what she gets

326
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:56,533
for causing the blackout.
I said stop!

327
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,914
You still have that gun, right?

328
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,666
I'm gonna take the clip off now.

329
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,386
Here we go.

330
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,386
Gone, buddy.

331
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,408
And...

332
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:19,323
On my ankle,

333
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:21,358
I got a gun, man.

334
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,685
I'm gonna take that off, too, okay?

335
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,377
We're not worrying
about that anymore.

336
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:42,612
What were you saying,
though, about...

337
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:46,023
About how salespeople
caused the blackout?

338
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,001
That's a fascinating theory.

339
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,387
I'd like to hear more about it.

340
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:54,836
They made us buy cell phones.

341
00:18:57,374 --> 00:19:00,534
Before everybody had a cell phone,
nobody ever blacked out. None of...

342
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:01,898
Stop moving!

343
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,018
You think I won't kill you?

344
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:07,073
You're about just plain incorrect.

345
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:15,299
I'm not afraid.

346
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:18,810
It's okay.

347
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:22,956
Everybody's scared of dying, man.

348
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:28,926
She is.

349
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,137
Look at her...

350
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,096
I'm scared of dying...

351
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,396
All three of us.

352
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:40,016
It's what makes us human,
don't you think?

353
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:43,851
You're scared.

354
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,174
That's fine.

355
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,083
See, when people get scared,

356
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:52,422
judgment gets clouded.

357
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:55,068
I'll be honest, man.

358
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:58,196
You have made some
really bad decisions today.

359
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:04,780
But you can make a really good one

360
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:07,372
right now...

361
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,235
If you just give me the gun.

362
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:13,625
Come on.

363
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,674
Let me save your life.

364
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,967
EMT says he's stable.
We can question him in the hospital.

365
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:56,090
It's not your gun.

366
00:20:58,314 --> 00:21:00,189
Serial number is totally different.

367
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:03,844
Your gun's still out there.

368
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,140
So you almost got yourself killed
for nothing?

369
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:09,517
Yeah, I guess so.

370
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:18,468
All right.

371
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:19,730
You took him down,

372
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,664
saved an innocent woman.

373
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:24,908
That's fantastic work.

374
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:27,619
What I can't understand is,

375
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:30,160
if you thought that gun
was gonna kill you,

376
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:35,252
The place was surrounded. He was never
gonna make it out of here anyway.

377
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,734
That's why I needed
to get to him, man...

378
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:39,672
So I could ask him why.

379
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,209
Do you remember...

380
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:55,820
That speech you gave
my first day on the job?

381
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,961
It was all about
being the kind of person

382
00:22:02,124 --> 00:22:03,973
who could be counted on

383
00:22:04,964 --> 00:22:07,514
to do the right thing
at the right time.

384
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,295
Since October 6th,
when I didn't see anything,

385
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,270
I have had a lot of trouble

386
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,299
being that person.

387
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,928
And I need your help.

388
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:22,493
Why?

389
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:26,755
Look at me.

390
00:22:27,594 --> 00:22:29,639
If you think
I've been making good choices,

391
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,524
you're crazier than I thought.

392
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,127
I'll do anything to help you,

393
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:38,648
so I'm gonna tell you something,

394
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,787
and I really want you to listen.

395
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:43,569
Get out of here.

396
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:46,178
You and Zoey just get out of here.

397
00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:50,576
- I'm not running away.
- That's right. You're not.

398
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:53,997
You're being smart.

399
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:58,626
Promise me you'll go somewhere safe.

400
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:12,722
Special Agent Noh,
do you recognize exhibit "H"?

401
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,283
Yes. It's a copy of my notes

402
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:17,516
taken while witnessing
the transaction.

403
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:21,806
And those handwritten notes
are your only record of the events?

404
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,530
Well, it was a very simple
money-for-stolen-goods exchange.

405
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,077
That is very good.

406
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:36,039
Agent Noh, who taught you to draw?

407
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:39,042
I guess I'm just naturally artistic.

408
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,045
Lucky guy, right?

409
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:45,965
Now your description here

410
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:49,135
of the alleged buyer, here,
further down in your notes...

411
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,806
Can you read that
for the court, please?

412
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:55,851
"Caucasian male,
average height/weight,

413
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,191
"dark jacket, baseball cap."

414
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:01,299
When my client was booked,

415
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:05,340
he was photographed
wearing a red jacket, not a dark one.

416
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,975
Wasn't he?

417
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,488
And he clearly has a goatee,
does he not, Agent Noh?

418
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,931
So which individual

419
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,426
bought the stolen computer disk,
Agent Noh...

420
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:18,997
The one with the goatee,
or the one in your artistic notes?

421
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:21,490
Because they're obviously not
the same person.

422
00:24:21,615 --> 00:24:23,867
- Objection... Argumentative.
- Sustained.

423
00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:25,963
- Do I get to answer that?
- Not really.

424
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,427
No further questions.

425
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,575
I'm done with this witness.

426
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,512
You can go.

427
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,936
Come on.
There's no need to take it personally.

428
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,129
That was a win
that you turned into a loss.

429
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:44,779
It was never really a win,
because you were wrong.

430
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:48,220
I'm gonna go ahead
and take the stairs.

431
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:49,779
I'm sorry.

432
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:51,864
I'll turn the defense attorney off.

433
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:54,222
That would be
an instant improvement.

434
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:56,493
Why don't you let me
make it up to you?

435
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:58,961
Can I...
Take you to dinner?

436
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:03,357
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What?

437
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,740
There's not a chance in hell
I would ever go out with you.

438
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,910
How are you?

439
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,106
Good.

440
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,363
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

441
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:30,313
It's okay.

442
00:25:33,056 --> 00:25:35,363
- You're beautiful.
- Shut up.

443
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,786
What is wrong with you?

444
00:25:39,742 --> 00:25:41,837
- Nothing.
- It's good.

445
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,210
I wasn't supposed
to be there that day.

446
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:48,134
What day?

447
00:25:49,358 --> 00:25:51,167
Al Gough was supposed to be
Mark's partner.

448
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:54,552
I switched with him,
and because I was mark's partner,

449
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,101
I was covering the bust
that led me to you.

450
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,158
All these tiny little decisions
we make,

451
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,996
without thinking, they all...

452
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,528
They all line up,

453
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:05,703
to lead us somewhere...

454
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,773
Somewhere good.

455
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:12,107
So I want to ask you if you will...

456
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,330
Marry me.

457
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,613
Baby, we covered this.
I said yeah.

458
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,088
No, I want to get married right now.

459
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,207
Tomorrow.

460
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:26,787
Then we get on a plane
and we go to Hawaii.

461
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:30,755
We stay there through the 15th,
maybe through April 29th.

462
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,539
Maybe we don't ever come home.

463
00:26:34,432 --> 00:26:36,619
- Want to do it?
- Are you serious?

464
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:38,596
- I'm serious.
- Hell, yes!

465
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:40,769
Of course!

466
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:43,204
I love you.

467
00:26:58,364 --> 00:27:01,162
I... sorry. I just wanted to come by

468
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,413
and say thanks for what you did
with Charlie today, in the park.

469
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:08,298
No problem.

470
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,881
Can I get you to come in?

471
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:17,468
I just left the water running,
but please, please come in.

472
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:21,569
Sure.

473
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:28,784
Sorry.
The dishes were getting out of control.

474
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:30,683
Can I get you something to drink?

475
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,658
I could offer you a carton of milk
that expired yesterday,

476
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:37,655
some juice boxes or a bottle of gin.

477
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:46,998
No, I think I should be going.

478
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:49,208
Really?

479
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,795
- Thank you for today.
- Yeah, I do have a telephone.

480
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,970
You could've called
to say thank you.

481
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:03,011
Why are you here?

482
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,857
I don't know. I've just made
such a mess of things.

483
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,404
I wish I could blame it all on Mark,
but I really can't.

484
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,878
I made a ton of mistakes.

485
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:27,094
I know that feeling.

486
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:32,693
I tried my best with Linda
after Dylan was born,

487
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:36,877
but to be honest,

488
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,868
I used his autism
as an excuse to get away from her.

489
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:44,107
Even the thought of that
makes me ashamed now,

490
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:47,027
I thought
I was doing the right thing at the time.

491
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:50,228
You're damned if you do,

492
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:53,786
- and then you're damned if you don't.
- Maybe we just...

493
00:28:55,496 --> 00:28:58,216
choose to live in the moment,
you know, just grab the...

494
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:03,157
good things in our life
when we recognize them.

495
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:07,601
- I have to go.
- Look. Wait.

496
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,375
I'm not trying
to argue against Mark.

497
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:16,124
He's a brave man
doing something extraordinary.

498
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:18,331
Yeah, he is.

499
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,080
This does kind of put me

500
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:26,513
in the Lancelot-trying-
to-persuade-Guinevere position.

501
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,407
You did not just compare yourself
to Lancelot.

502
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:33,514
The only other metaphor
I had involved protons and neutrons,

503
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:37,415
and believe me, under the circumstances,
I went with the stronger choice.

504
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:43,906
I know that we're feeling
the same thing right now.

505
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,577
How do you know what I'm feeling?

506
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:51,832
Because I'm in that room
on April the 29th.

507
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:57,461
That wasn't an accident.

508
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:05,968
This scares me.

509
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:09,453
It should.

510
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:28,651
Who the hell you?

511
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:32,324
It's okay, Aaron.

512
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:34,461
I work with Mark.

513
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:36,788
I'm a friend.

514
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:42,882
You mind telling me
how you found me?

515
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:45,889
There was a computer
in Echo park doing web searches

516
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:47,928
for a "Jericho Parwan Afghanistan,"

517
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,011
"Jericho central base"
and "Jericho murder US soldiers."

518
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:53,629
That library's 2 miles from here.

519
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,994
And this is the 14th cash-only hotel
I've hit.

520
00:30:58,078 --> 00:31:00,357
Well, here I am.
Now what?

521
00:31:00,853 --> 00:31:04,412
Mark didn't want to tell me
why you were so interested in Jericho.

522
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,403
But some very powerful people
would love to take them down.

523
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:11,202
All they need is proof.

524
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:14,287
They got my daughter.

525
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:16,665
- They kill her?
- They tried.

526
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,876
- She's still alive.
- But in your file it...

527
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,336
Tracy's alive.

528
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,410
She was here, but Jericho found her
and to her back to Afghanistan.

529
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:28,454
I gotta believe I've only got
so much time left to find her.

530
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:31,386
- Wait. You're going to Afghanistan?
- Sure am.

531
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:33,098
I know you were in the service,

532
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,250
but how are you planning
on getting there?

533
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:37,310
Fly into Uzbekistan,

534
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,230
cross the border at Termez.

535
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,398
And you're doing this
with a US Passport?

536
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:44,610
You'll be dead
before you leave Hairaton.

537
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,530
I don't have a choice.

538
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:53,160
Do you know why Jericho tried
to kill your daughter two years ago?

539
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,192
She saw Jericho wipe out
an entire village.

540
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:07,196
If I could help you get to Tracy...

541
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:10,719
you think she would
tell us the whole story?

542
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:21,470
Really?
You can do that legally?

543
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:24,984
- Come here.
- What?

544
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:27,943
Yo, I'm getting married.

545
00:32:28,235 --> 00:32:30,448
- Come here.
- I'm getting married.

546
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,034
So would you be okay
with Vreede officiating at your wedding?

547
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,135
Define "okay."

548
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:39,627
No charge.

549
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:42,414
Consider it

550
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,387
- my wedding gift.
- You're gonna marry him?

551
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:47,366
Vreede's an internet

552
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,640
minister.

553
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:51,216
Have I ever told you how awesome
you are, Shelly Vreede?

554
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:53,137
You make me feel awesome.

555
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,597
Janis, you're awesome, too.

556
00:32:55,154 --> 00:32:56,724
- Thank you.
- Janis is awesome.

557
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,994
That's very sweet. Thank you.

558
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,192
All right.

559
00:33:00,317 --> 00:33:01,839
Mark is awesome.

560
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:05,088
- Time to take the groom home.
- Yeah. Let's find a cab.

561
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,913
Here we go, buddy.

562
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,588
- I'm sleepy.
- Yeah.

563
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:16,535
You got military clearance.

564
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:20,012
Your cover is you're in Afghanistan
to help install their power grid.

565
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:24,209
Satellite phone.

566
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:25,878
Video capability.

567
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,782
As soon as you can document
what Tracy knows, I want it uploaded.

568
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,216
If you see any Jericho activity,
I want it uploaded...

569
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,474
Pictures, video, audio,
anything you can get me.

570
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,549
- No problem.
- Get yourself to bagram

571
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:38,003
as soon as you're clear.
Military transports

572
00:33:38,128 --> 00:33:39,892
leave every two days.

573
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,894
- I'll arrange a flight home.
- Excellent.

574
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,161
I'm guessing...

575
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:47,566
You don't need me to tell you
what to do with these.

576
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,694
I got a couple ideas.

577
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:53,864
All this gear is clean.

578
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,991
None of it can be traced back
to this agency.

579
00:33:57,752 --> 00:33:58,869
If they find you...

580
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,705
You're on your own.

581
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,207
Is that it?

582
00:34:05,654 --> 00:34:06,789
I guess it is.

583
00:34:08,194 --> 00:34:09,463
Thank you, Stan.

584
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,882
This isn't something I think
I need to tell you, but

585
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,134
there's a good chance
you're never coming back.

586
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:16,387
I saw myself with my daughter.

587
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,681
We were together in Afghanistan,

588
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,432
and she was alive.

589
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:23,435
God help anyone
who stands in my way.

590
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:32,716
Do you think I'm chicken

591
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:34,378
for running away?

592
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:38,532
Sometimes the best offense
is a good defense.

593
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:43,540
I'm just scared.

594
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,624
You played this out as best
as you could

595
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:48,293
everybody needs

596
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,129
a successful exit strategy.

597
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:51,946
This is yours.

598
00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:03,555
I want you to know...

599
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,744
- that night in Somalia...
- Don't.

600
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:09,074
No, I want to. I have to...

601
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,884
- Just stop.
- No,

602
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:14,342
this may be my last chance,
all right?

603
00:35:15,456 --> 00:35:16,685
I'm pregnant.

604
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:19,144
What?

605
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:35,093
This is perfect.

606
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,194
My mom is gonna be so excited.

607
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:39,782
I'm happy to let you use the space,

608
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:42,320
but since you aren't members here,

609
00:35:42,445 --> 00:35:44,641
and, since we didn't do any

610
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:46,299
premarital counseling...

611
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:49,581
We don't need any premarital counseling.
We've been living together for a year.

612
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:51,774
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear.

613
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:55,911
You need to get married
this afternoon...

614
00:35:56,157 --> 00:35:58,655
fine.
But under these circumstances,

615
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,811
you're going to need to find
somebody else to officiate for you.

616
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,753
I never heard.
Did you, track down Aaron?

617
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:15,108
I guess he didn't want to be found.

618
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,053
You gotta see this.

619
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:21,261
It's Frost.

620
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,453
You found him?

621
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:24,640
His phone was activated 12 days ago

622
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,389
at a convenience store on the corner
of Western and Washington... 3:18 P.M.

623
00:36:29,864 --> 00:36:30,719
3:19,

624
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:33,283
a man fitting Frost's description

625
00:36:33,557 --> 00:36:35,237
walks to a 1971

626
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:36,985
Citroen DS sedan...

627
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:38,767
powder blue, silver top.

628
00:36:41,807 --> 00:36:43,429
A match from the shelter.

629
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:44,596
Wait a minute.

630
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,493
Dyson Frost made a videotape
for you 19 years ago,

631
00:36:47,716 --> 00:36:49,706
then encoded a phone number
for you to find.

632
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,334
And then after all that,
instead of meeting with you,

633
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:54,458
he's murdering a homeless guy?

634
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:57,214
But he used my gun to do it.

635
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,807
He may be crazy,
but he isn't random.

636
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,148
There's a method here.

637
00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:06,034
We just don't understand
what it is yet.

638
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:33,625
Any word from the LAPD on the search

639
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,562
- for Frost's vehicle?
- Still looking. I'll stay on top of it.

640
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,688
- Let's keep putting the pressure on.
- Guys, can we stop with the shoptalk?

641
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:42,259
- This is a special occasion.
- It's just like Demetri

642
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,219
to be late for his own wedding.

643
00:37:44,714 --> 00:37:46,471
He's not answering his cell.

644
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:48,265
I called three times.

645
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,391
Let me try.

646
00:37:56,798 --> 00:37:59,174
- <i>Demetri Noh. Leave a message.</i>
- Nothing.

647
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:00,649
What is it?

648
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:02,321
Guys, where is he?

649
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,154
Sweetie.

650
00:38:44,428 --> 00:38:46,863
- Hi, mom!
- Step right up, ladies and gents.

651
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:48,325
Wheel of fortune...

652
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,207
One spin for three tickets.
You want to give me?

653
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:53,438
Round and round she goes,

654
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:55,229
and where she stops,

655
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:57,453
nobody knows.

656
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:05,884
Hey. Where are you?

657
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:07,761
School, carnival.

658
00:39:08,156 --> 00:39:11,640
I'm calling because I'm gonna make it.
I need you to keep Charlie.

659
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:13,934
How come?

660
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,519
Something's happened to Demetri.

661
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:16,796
What?

662
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,184
Not sure what it is yet.
He didn't show up at the wedding.

663
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:21,650
I thought you should know.

664
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,395
- What do you think happened?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

665
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,988
<i>I hope it's just cold feet,</i>

666
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:29,873
because it's almost march 15th,
and this is too close for comfort.

667
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:35,093
Be careful.

668
00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:36,331
Of course.

669
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:37,749
Kiss Charlie for me.

670
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:39,201
I will.

671
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:43,399
Hang on, kids.

672
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:03,511
Hello, Charlie.

673
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,570
