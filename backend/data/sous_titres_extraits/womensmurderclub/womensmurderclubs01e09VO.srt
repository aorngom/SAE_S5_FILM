Hey.
Hmm?

3
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,210
The show's over here.
Oh. Okay.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,460
Name of the deceased?

5
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,940
Dakota manning-- A.K.A. Glenn whitney.

6
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,310
E club owner, oliver duprix, found her--

7
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,320
Him. Uh, the body.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,422
Let's get mr. Duprix in here.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,136
Hell of a way to make an exit. Mm.

10
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:57,440
Are you just gonna leave her like that?

11
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:59,742
Mr. Duprix?

12
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,945
Darling, tonight i wish i weren't. Pardon me.

13
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:03,813
I have to deal with some lookie loos.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,718
Dakota was my greatest star. I have to protect her.

15
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:09,770
Can you tell us what happened?

16
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,010
Around 7:00, i was passing by here,

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,870
And i heard glenn behind closed doors with somebody.

18
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,930
Now i did not recognize the voice,

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,951
But they were arguing something fierce.

20
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:22,154
Was the voice, uh, male, female? Male.

21
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:24,270
Although you can never be too sure

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,710
Here at the illusion room.

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,859
What were they fighting about?

24
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:29,795
Inspector, my mother was a simple girl from abilene

25
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:31,830
When she bought this place, and she taught me,

26
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:33,732
When your castle's full of queens,

27
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,950
You stay on the other side of the moat,

28
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,950
But when dakota didn't show up onstage by 8:30,

29
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:40,772
I came looking.

30
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,030
Thank you for your help.

31
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,713
Hmm. Okay.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,620
I've seen my share of freak accidents.

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,818
Something tells me he didn't trip, fall and drown in there.

34
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:54,786
Definite signs of a struggle.

35
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,788
Yeah, and no shortage of suspects either.

36
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,790
If the body was discovered at 8:30,

37
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:01,160
That means the whole audience would have been here.

38
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,270
Break a leg, superstar.

39
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,800

Too bad.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
Uh, please take your seats.

43
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:30,522
Thers been a murder.

00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:43,925
Subconjunctival hemorrhage. He was heaving hard enough

48
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:45,670
To blow the blood vessels in his eyes.

I'm fine.

55
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:07,154
Wh do you think, claire? If you hadn't pointed out the signs of struggle,

56
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,357
I'd have said textbook drug overdose.

57
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,859
But he did drown?

58
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,695
I can't say definitely till the autopsy.

59
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:17,930
That audience is full of surly lawyers

60
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,933
Who claim we have no right to hold 'em.

61
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,203
They're making this out to be some kind a gay gitmo.

62
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,704
I'm on it.

63
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,941
Hi, folks.

64
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,110
Hi. I hope you've been waiting a while...

65
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,644
This is terrible

66
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,246
Dakotaas an icon in the gay community.

67
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,782
She--She hosted charity events.

68
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,517
She grand marshaled the pride parade.

69
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,519
How did you get in here?

70
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,454
The bouncers know me. I am grace to, like,

71
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:44,180
Ten wills in this city. Well, then you're the perfect person

72
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,760
To ask around about glenn whitney.

73
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,700
Can you find out who hated him enough to take him for a swim?

74
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,562
My friend dominic works

75
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,531
At the san francisco gay & lesbian center.

76
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,433
If he can't offer up some leads, no one can.

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,668
Well, sadly, there is someone else.

78
00:03:56,937 --> 00:04:00,374
Glenn made sure i took my medicine every morning.

79
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,744
He'd stand there, glasof water in one hand,

80
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,513
Fistful of horse pills in the other,

81
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,148
And cheer as i downed them.

82
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,150
Oh, it's ridiculous, i know,

83
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:13,087
But he was hell-Bent on killing my cancer with kindness,

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,123
And he did. I've been in remsion three months.

85
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,361
How long were you two tother, mr. Ford?
Ten years,？？？

86
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,800
Were you involved in the show, too?

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,466
Glenn recruited for "dakota manning's cabaret drag-Array."

88
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:28,110
I made thespectacular.

89
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,220
Had he had any, uh, recent conflicts with anyone? No. Why?

90
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,808
Before the show, mr. Duprix said

91
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,411
That he heard glenn arguing in his dressing room. That's not possible.

92
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,081
While he was transforming, glenn never received visitors,

93
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,020
Not even me.

94
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,351
He'd hole himself up, mix himself a dirty martini,

95
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,421
And, um, he wouldn't emerge until curtain.

96
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,056
What is it?

97
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,059
Therwere some ys at the club a few eks ago.

98
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,062
Drunk, homophobic punks looking to me trouble.

99
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,531
They heckled dakota, and she gave it right ck to them.

100
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,467
Ripped into them until they left

101
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,302
With their tail between their legs.

102
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:05,439
Uh... i'm not a big believer in coincidence. Neither are we.

103
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,008
But that night, the cars in the lot were vandalized.

104
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,444
Glenn's took the brunt of it.

105
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,347
Windows were smashed. All of his costumes were stolen.

106
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,170
Some of my best work.

107
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,786
Did you call the police?
Yes, but without names or eyewitnesses,

108
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,755
They said there was nothing they could do.

109
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,523
Please don't tell me i'm gonna hear that again.

110
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,270
Not from us.

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,730
Yoknow, property crimes rely needso step it up.

112
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,200
I pulled the report for the car vandalism at the illusion room.

113
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,370
There are no ptographs. The address is wrong.

114
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,090
The event description is blank.

115
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,840
I an, w-We're trying to solve a homicide,

116
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,930
This is thin-House help we get? I--

117
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,800
嫂y est璋?Es la ay jacobi. Que recibimos?

118
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,860
What's that?
Nothing.

119
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,950
Babcock got us a group discount

120
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,000
At the international house of ties.

121
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,500
I'll put it away. Well, y would you do that?

122
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,980
'Cause it's a 100%-Silk reminder of your ex-Husband's wedding.

123
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,380
Some would find it distracting.

124
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,140
I am laser-Focused on this case.

125
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,160
A little italian neckwear isn't gonna distract me.

126
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,620
Could we please fast-Forward to sunday

127
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,270
When the stupid weddg will be over with?

128
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,210
It's all anybody can talk about.

129
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,741
You were just talking about it, weren't you?

130
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:20,810
Actually, the opposite. As in, where you, cindy and i ll be instead.

131
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,450
"The transcendence spa. Come experience blis"

132
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,510
I hate bliss.

133
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,888
We know, but nothing rids the body of impurities

134
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,190
And thoughts of your ex-Husband's nuptials

135
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:34,059
Faster than a green tea body wrap.

136
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,750
I would rather have a batub full of bourbon.

137
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:40,065
I just got glenn whitney's preliminary blood work back.

138
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,440
He had g.H.Bin his system.

139
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,300
Caus euphoria, increased sex drive.

140
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,503
I checked with glenn's partner. He swears he didn't use.

141
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,874
Well, g.H.B. Isn't always recreational. Yeah, it's the date rape drug.

142
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,780
A g.H.B. Overdose matches what we observed at the scene,

143
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,020
Anautopsy should confirm it.

144
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,260
Okay. Let's meet back here at the end of the day.

145
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,784
About that. As y'a know,

146
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:01,753
Uh, while you're all transcending tomorrow,

147
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,522
I'm gonna be atom's wedding, and i'm not happy about it.

148
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,150
My allegiance lies with you, but...

149
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,960
Getting out of the house and seeing old coworkers

150
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,196
Is the first thing my husband

151
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,166
Has been looking forward to in months. Well, so what's the problem?

152
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,680
The problem is everyone in homicide

153
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,060
Wants their autopsies before the big day, and i'm buried.

154
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,650
Something only complicated by i'm taking a half-Day today.

155
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,213
You know this means you'll be dealing with my sub.

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,515
Have fun at my ex-Husband's wedding.

157
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:33,518
Here you are. Off t lead about glenn whitney's car,

158
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:36,300
I stopped by the gay & lesbian center's hate crime office.

159
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,157
Here's a copy of their report on the incident.

160
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:42,294
Okay, this is at i call a case file.

161
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,462
Anyway, i the only one who sees greek letters

162
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:46,531
Scratched in there? "Pi theta delta."

163
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:50,435
And the only school in the city with a chapter of that frat

164
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,800
Is 4 miles from the illusion room.

165
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,214
S.F.P.D. Can we come in?

166
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:07,619
Mm. We, that sounds like a "yes" to me.

167
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:12,424
What is that smell?

168
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,492
Misspent youth.

169
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,048
All right, everyone against the wall. Let's go.

170
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,084
My dad's goa kill me!

171
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,588
Dude, i got a 2:00 final.

172
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,540
Oh, cry me a river, doll.

173
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,069
Do any of these fine youngen look familiar?

174
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:57,573
The one in the gray sweatshirt d the two on the far right.

175
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,860
They were dakota's hecklers, no doubt.

176
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,080
Ose are his dresses.

177
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,600
We got three positive i.D.S.

178
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,640
Well, for the vandalism and property theft, yes.

179
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,800
I just got off the phone with the chapter president.

180
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,730
Pi theta delta hosted a toy drive

181
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,570
For the children's hospital the night of the murder.

182
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,630
All the boys were apparently accounted for. S-So they just get to go home.

183
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,430
They're not going home to much. Once i file hazing

184
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,413
And underage drinking charges with the university,

185
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,682
That house of theirs is good as gone.

186
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,586
May i have glenn's things now?

187
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,980
Uh, we can only release personal belongings

188
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,710
To family members, spouses or children.

189
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,810
Do you have a certificate of domestic partnership?

190
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,650
D glenn have a will? When i was sick,

191
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,920
I wanted us both to draw one up, but he refused.

192
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,640
He said it meant i was surrendering to e cancer.

193
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,024
Now wh happens?

194
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,760
Intestaclaws dictate his remains and property

195
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,061
Pass to next of kin.

196
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,000
To his parents? The ones who disowned him.

197
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,967
Glenn would not wanthat.

198
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,136
This is a nightmare.

199
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:04,038
Our house is in his name.

200
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,140
I can help file a temporary restraining order

201
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,840
Against the family. It'll buy you some time.

202
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,378
It'll prevent them from barging in and taking things.

203
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:12,740
Otherwise, there's not much else we can do.

204
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:20,521
Sy?

206
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:22,557
Uh, just-- Just a lite.

207
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,300
Trying to tie up some loose ends before...

208
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:27,300
What's up?

209
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,065
Glenn whitney's domestic partner was just here,

210
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:32,230
And...

211
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,137
Seeing how he wasn't really prepared

212
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:39,800
To be, uh, one half of a couple all of a sudden...

213
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,570
I mean, sometimes it's not all of a sudden.

214
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,930
Sometimes, you know, it's gradual.

215
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,414
It--W-Whatever way it--It happens, it's--It's sad.

216
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:49,417
I mean, he dn't get a chance to tie up loose ends.

217
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:51,180
You know, he--He didn't get a chance to say good-Bye,

218
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,210
And it just made me think about how important it was

219
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,000
To mark the end of something,

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,163
And, you know, make sure things end on a--On a good note.

221
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,880
Linz--
Tomorrow is--It's a-- It's a big day for you,and...

222
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,171
In a way, it is for me, too.

223
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:13,841
But... truthfully, tom,

224
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:17,412
I just--I just wanted to extend my warmest--

225
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,310
Tom!It's a disaster. Buffalo-Nowed in.

226
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,210
The airport is shut down, and my entire family is stuc okay.

227
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,640
Who's gonna walk me down the aisle?

228
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,900
And we're gonna have three empty tables at the...

229
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,170
Reception. Oh, my god. You're in the middle of something. Actually--

230
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,220
No, no. It's okay.

231
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,740
We're done.

232
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,202
The whitney autopsy is your first order of business.

233
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,830
Not according to the case number.Okay.

234
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:48,620
Inspector boxer is expecting a quick turnaround,...

235
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,930
The order received is the order cleaved.

236
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,000
That protocol.

237
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,984
Bernhardt,n act of god

238
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,253
Has left one of our colleagues in crisis.

239
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Now i've asked our office to roll up its sleeves.

240
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,670
Sure. What do you need?

241
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,060
Excellent. Clear your schedule tomorrow.

242
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,830
We're going to lieutenant hogan's wedding.

243
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,531
Tomorrow's no go. I have plans,

244
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:13,370
Uncancelable plans with a friend with a crisis ofer own.

245
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,380
This is a move to bolster interdepartment relations.

246
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,606
It's a work function, i.E., mandatory.

247
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,342
Anything else? Gd. Details are in my evite.

248
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:22,400
My computer is down.

249
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,600
3:00. Marina plaza. Plusne.

250
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
And oh, it's a green event, so put together a carpool.

251
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:29,620
Linz.

252
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:32,720
We've got good news d bad news.

253
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:34,420
The bad news is mostly terrible for me,

254
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,660
Because i'm being forced by the evil powers that be

255
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,730
To miss spa day in favor of tom's wedding.

256
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,970
The good news is, you're gonna be getting

257
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,970
Some one-On-One bonding time with... ta-Da!

258
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:49,400
Oh, you think i'm gonna talk too much.

259
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,206
No, it's just that

260
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:55,140
Glenn whitney's datebook is preoccupying me.

261
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,478
Obviously, because you ignored the words

262
00:12:57,545 --> 00:13:00,281
"Me, forced" and "tom's wedding." Well, i had a hunch.

263
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:02,383
Denise has bn running around telling eryone

264
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,153
How she saved the day. Wouldn't she just?

265
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,455
Anyway, um, glenn had meetings

266
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:10,057
With a guy namedhaddeus once a week,

267
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,400
And taped to the page of today,

268
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,050
There's a check made out to thdeus,

269
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,850
And have no idea for what. Wasn't a wig fitting if they met at the hotel eureka.

270
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,070
That place is male prostitute central. He was cheating on bruce?

271
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,740
Maybe thaddeus fought with glenn in his dressing room.

272
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,275
Well, hustlers have plenty of access to g.H.B.

273
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,100
I'd know. I've prosecuted my share.

274
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,746
Well, i guess it's check-In time at the hotel eureka.

275
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,200
There he is.

276
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:42,570
Thaddeus prescott, we have to ask you

277
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,127
A few questions about glenn whitney. Why? What's going on?

278
00:13:46,194 --> 00:13:48,000
You tell us. Was he one of yo clients?

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,050
E tuyo? Oh, no, no, no. You've got the wrong idea, man. Uh-Huh.

280
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,653
En what exactly is your relationship with glenn whitney?

281
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,682
He's my father.

282
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,169
Glenn's contract with the sperm bank

283
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:10,340
Said that he'd be cool with a onetime meeting once i turned 18.

284
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,000
How was that get-Together?

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,050
It was pretty trippy.

286
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,860
Most people would be shocked

287
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,500
To find out their biological father was gay,

288
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,620
Much less a renowned drag queen.

289
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,519
Yeah, but the more that i thought about it,

290
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:26,055
The more it answered a lot of major questions,

291
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:27,750
Like why i'm an outsider in my own family,

292
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,559
Why i don't share their dreams for me.

293
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,729
You know, grow up, go to penn, become a stockbroker.

294
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:36,532
What--What do you got in there?

295
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:41,003
Martin 17 series. Same as dylan's. It's nice.

296
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,206
Yeah, i saved up two summers to buy that. You play?

297
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:46,275
You should hear his "purple haze."

298
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:49,278
Well, then you get why i wanted glenn to be a part of my life.

299
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:50,800
I mean, he was a performer, too.

300
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,000
It didn't really matter to me what kind.

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,110
That's why he started making donations

302
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,920
To the fertility clinic in the first place.

303
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,020
The money helped keep him afloat while he refined his act.

304
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,800
It's pretty cool, huh? To think that i'm in this world

305
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,720
Because of his art? And how about glenn's partner bruce?

306
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,300
Uh, did he know you were in the world? He was real sick at that point.

307
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,600
Glenn thought that it would be too big a bomb to drop.

308
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,780
He was gonna tell him eventually, but until then,

309
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,760
We met in secret. And he'd give you money?

310
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,610
Yeah, to help me out. My parents really aren't so cool

311
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,679
With whole the music thing. How not so cool?

312
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:24,080
You should have been there last night.

313
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,400
They showed up all ballistic and tried to drag me home.

314
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,000
Like i don't have enough drama living in that place as it is.

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,903
We screamed at each other for, like, an hour. What time was this?

316
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,872
7:30 by the time they left.

317
00:15:34,872 --> 00:15:36,580
About an hour before glenn whitney turned up dead.

318
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,850
Mm-Hmm. Thaddeus, we're gonna need to talk to them.

319
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,840
Why? You don't think that...

320
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,370
No. They're republicans. They're not murderers.

321
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,720
Besides, they didn't even know glenn.

322
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,370
They never knew that i tracked him down.

323
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,320
In my experience, parents know everything.

324
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,970
A homosexual impregnated my wife?
You didn't know?

325
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,847
18 years ago,

326
00:15:57,914 --> 00:16:00,750
The clinics didn't keep as much personal data on donors.

327
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:02,220
If i'd been made aware, i...

328
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,550
We'd have never let any part of that...

329
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:08,992
Pervert near her.

330
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,294
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:14,698
We're taught to hate the sin, love the sinner.

332
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:18,702
To think that our son has been lying to us this whole time...

333
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:21,770
Thaddeus mentioned that you all

334
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,273
Haven't been gting along recently.

335
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,677
750 on his math s.A.T., and he wants to be a rock star.

336
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:30,300
You're damn right we're not getting along.

337
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,150
There was an argument at the hotel.

338
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,249
Where did you go after?

339
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:35,251
To reverend dodd, our pastor.

340
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:38,355
We're not monsters, inspector.

341
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:40,924
Our only crime is loving our son too much.

342
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,293
It's not easy letting go, but...

343
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,100
We're trng.

344
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,167
Okay. We'll be in touch.

345
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:53,269
Is that it?

346
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:56,230
Mm-Hmm. Thank you.

347
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,900
Awkward for me--

348
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,253
Telling a baptist she'd been impregnated by a drag queen.

349
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,960
How was it for you

350
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:17,394
What is is?

351
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,470
Uh, this is a non-Bullpen conversation.

352
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,550
Now look, i know you've had a rough week... oh, please don't.

353
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,410
But... please.
All i'm saying is,

354
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:28,238
If you need me, i will blow off th wedding.

355
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:30,430
It's not pity. Hell, we won't even call it commiseration.

356
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,550
It's just two paners burying themselves in a case

357
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,780
On a satday afternoon.

358
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,260
Well, as much as i would like to take you up on that,

359
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,610
Someone has already beaten you to the babysitting gig, so...

360
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:43,580
Go and--And--And enjoy yourself.

361
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,830
I'm serious. Go.

362
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,370
Jacobi.

363
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,310
Thk you.

364
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,470
Hey. Would you lovelyadies like some champagne?

365
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,800
Yes. Yes.

366
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,017
I'll come with you.

367
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,518
Be back. Yeah.

368
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,400
Damn, our boys are cute.

369
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:23,420
Speaking of cute.
Warren jacobi, you clean up good.

370
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,460
You know, i try.

371
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,895
Where's your date?

372
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,566
Why bring a snack to an all-You-Can eat ffet?

373
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:31,670
Ladies.

374
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:33,903
Ooh, these look delicious.

375
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,039
Thank you. All right.

376
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:38,008
I'm almost fgetting to feel guilty

377
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,809
About not being with lindsay.

378
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:43,500
You know what? We did all we could.

379
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,160
From this moment on,

380
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,900
I propose that we focus our full attention

381
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,800
On the fantastic men in our lives

382
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,130
And being exactly where we are.

383
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,170
That mig be easier said than done.

384
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,803
Who's ready for a hand and foot fantasy?

385
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,174
Um, i left a message for claire's sub--Roberta--

386
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,176
To call me on my cell

387
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,579
As soon as she is done with the whitney autopsy.

388
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,214
Am i forgetting anything?

389
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:29,887
No. Hu not forgetting. No.

390
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:31,422
What was that? Wh?

391
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:33,424
That hesitation...

392
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,393
And now the lack of eye contact and the foot tapping. What?

393
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,110
Nothin it should wait until tomorrow.

394
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,640
I promised jill and claire i would keep you

395
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,920
On a very specific schedule.

396
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,880
You know you want to tell me, or we'd be out the door by now.

397
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,370
This morning i was at bruce's apartment,

398
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,400
Getting some anecdotes for my article.

399
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,700
He gave me these. They're from glenn's computer.

400
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,278
"If you wanna be a woman,

401
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:57,681
Drag pig, my knife can make it happen."

402
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:00,350
One vile, threatening e-Mail a day

403
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:05,520
For three months straight.
From karenadams@sfglc.Org.

404
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,080
It's the gay & lesbian center's server.

405
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,970
They have an internet caf?That offers free e-Mail accounts.

406
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,080
I was gonna stop by and ask arnd a bit, but-- Yes. Go do that.

407
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,600
It will take me two minuteto find karen adams' me address,

408
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,635
Ten minutes to do a stop by.

409
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:22,100
Yeah, i'll call the spa, push our appointments a half-Hour.

410
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,100
Yeah..Yeah

411
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,500
Yeah. Jill and claire never have to know, right?

412
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,400
No. I like your stely, thomas.

413
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,900
Hi, i'm lindsay boxer, san francisco police department.

414
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,700
-I'm looking for karen adams.
-Yeah, she's not home.

415
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,200
-Are you her roommate?
-Yeah.

416
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,300
Well, do you happen to know where she is?

417
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,600
She hasn't been around all weekend.

418
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,500
Look, i'late for work.

419
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,600
-Boxer.
-Did you find her?

420
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,300
No.I met the roommate, ough. He couldn't be bothered.

421
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,500
Lindsay, that may have been her.

422
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
No, the roommate's a guy.

423
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,200
No, karen adams is better known as "bu baltimore."

424
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,000
She's a drag king. Hang on. I'm--I'm sending you a picture.

425
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,600
Hey, buzz.

426
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,200
We weren't properly introduced.

427
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,800
So i know it's none of my business

428
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,000
But i've got to ask. Denise?

429
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,300
Well, i couldn't wait around for you forever.

430
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
But denise?

431
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, she's uh, beautiful, smart, successful.

432
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,500
Overbearing, cutthroat, ckstabbing.

433
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,500
You obviously don't know her.

434
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,200
Still, do my department a favor.

435
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,000
Keep her happy and away from us for the next four hours.

436
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,000
We need a break.

437
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,100
So your job is impersonating bobby darin?

438
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,400
Do you do "mack the knife"?

439
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,200
After all, it is about a murderer.

440
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,400
Ms. Adams.

441
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Not too bright, sending glenn wtney threats

442
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,200
From your personal e-Mail account.

443
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,100
Screw that. I'm protecting myself.

444
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,400
Okay, we're already recording this.

445
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,000
I can make you a copy.

446
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,900
No, thanks.

447
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,300
Let's get back to glennhitney.

448
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,600
He was a vious old queen who was out to get me.

449
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,100
Oh, so you're the victim?

450
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,700
That show of his guarantees exposure

451
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Not to mention decent cash, so i auditioned. Twice.

452
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,100
What was his response? Nothing.

453
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,800
Until i find out he's been bad-Mouthing me

454
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,300
To other club owners around town

455
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,800
Saying i'm unprofessional.

456
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,800
After that, people stopped hiring me.

457
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,000
You had a gig tonight.

458
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,200
For free.

459
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Why couldn't you just accept

460
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,900
That maybe glenn whitney didn't like your act?

461
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,400
He was a shortsighted misogynist like the rest of them.

462
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,700
See, when a man straps it down, throws on a dress,

463
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,900
Everyone calls it fabulous, but when a chick

464
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,100
Dresses up like a guy, all they feel is threatened.

465
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I'm starting to think you're the threatened one, karen.

466
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
Threatened enough to poison glenn whitney.

467
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,100
Surprises me, though-- Tough broad like yourself

468
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,700
Choosing such a cowardly way to do it.

469
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,600
Is it cowardly to ask for a lawyer?

470
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,800
Excuse me. I'm looking for inspector boxer.

471
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Sorry. I-I don't know when she'll be back.

472
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,700
Could you just tell her that thaddeus prescott was here?

473
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,000
Thaddeus. Hi. I'm cindy thomas.

474
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,400
-I'coring glenn's story for the "register."
-Oh, hey.

475
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,400
Listen, this might sound forward,

476
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,100
But i've been in contact with glenn's partner bruce.

477
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,100
He's obviously having a rough time, too.

478
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,600
Anyway, i just thought if you wanted to contact him

479
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,300
I could, uh...

480
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,500
Well, here's my card.

481
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,500
Excuse me.

482
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,500
Thaddeus? How's it going?

483
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Moved home yesterday. I found them in my dad's study.

484
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,300
They were trying to file a restraining order against glenn?

485
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
Yeah, but look. It's dated six months ago.

486
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,200
-That's when he and i first met.
-They knew about him all along.

487
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,900
Right. So why wouldn't they have said something to me?

488
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,200
And why would they have lied to you? Unless...

489
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Do you have a friend you can stay with? Good.

490
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,800
Go there and wait for my call, okay?

491
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,700
Roberta, i asked you to call

492
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,200
When you finished the whitney autopsy.

493
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,000
I did.

494
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,700
On my cell. I've been waiting for this information

495
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,400
-For you to walk me through it.
-Well, i'm off the clock now.

496
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,900
If you want this conversation to ctinue, you should contact

497
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
The chief medil examiner's office

498
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,600
Request an overtime approval rm--

499
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,200
Okay,you know what? You i don't need.

500
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,900
Believable.

501
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,600
We are gathered here today to recognize the bond

502
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,400
That you have declared,

503
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,200
And to hold it up for all to see.

504
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,200
With that in our hearts and minds

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,300
Thomas daniel hoga

506
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,200
Do you take heather to be your wedded wife,

507
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,800
To live together in marr--

508
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,300
To live togethern marriage?

509
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,500
Do you promise to love, honor, cherish and keeper...

510
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,000
For richer, for poorer...

511
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,300
Claire? Hello?

512
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,600
In sickness and in health,

513
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,400
For saking all others

514
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,600
And being faithful only to her

515
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,400
For as long as you both shall live?

516
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,300
I do.

517
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,500
And, heather marie donnelly

518
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,500
Do you take this man to be your husband

519
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,900
To live together in--

520
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,700
What happened?

521
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,700
He said "i do."

522
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,700
You found your date yet?

523
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,900
This is not a process you can rush.

524
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,900
We're doing shots!

525
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,000
-No, thank you.
-Hey, overrul. Everybody, everybody.

526
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,300
Okay.

527
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,100
Uh...

528
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,800
Ooh!

529
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,700
Thank you. Mm.

530
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,800
She's doing the conga line by herself.

531
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,800
When i asked you to keep her happy

532
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,200
I di't mean get her blitzed.

533
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
The woman's got a llow leg.

534
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,000
Wh's the secret?

535
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,600
Um... no?

536
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,300
No.

537
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,900
Come on, dance with me. Dance with me

538
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Okay.

539
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,200
Huh.

540
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Uh, speaking of dancing, has anyone seen my wife?

541
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,000
Ooh, ooh

542
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,200
Thank you.

543
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,700
What? No, no, no.

544
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,300
You--You are not getting out of the hokey pokey. Let's go.

545
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,900
I'm surpsed you haven't kicked me out.

546
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,400
-No, we--We've all been there.
-Mm..Hmm.

547
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,400
-What's this?
-Someone needed my rush input on an autopsy

548
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,600
And, uh, the chef was kind enough tlet me use his fax.

549
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,300
"Someone" who?

550
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,000
Uh...

551
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Tom?

552
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,700
I've been looking all over for you. Did you...

553
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,500
Sneak out and smoke a cigar?

554
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,200
No, sweetheart. I did not.

555
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Lovely wedding.

556
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,000
Did you see... either one of these people

557
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,500
At the club the night of the murder?

558
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,600
All of me wants to say "yes," but...

559
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,300
Oh, everyone's gonna be so disappointed.

560
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,700
We were hoping for some closure

561
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,600
Before the memorial service tonight.

562
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,400
You should come.

563
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,000
The illusion room wasn't nothing but a gin mill with a jukebox

564
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,500
Before glenn walked ithe door.

565
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,000
He was my good luck charm.

566
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,000
I owe him everything.

567
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Um, thank you for coming in.

568
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,700
How much do you hate me?

569
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,800
Not as much as an eco-Conscious kindergarten teacher hates me.

570
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm so sorry. It was asinine to call.

571
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,300
I just... i was blinded by rage.

572
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,100
My fault for leaving you with roberta.

573
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,300
Thank you.

574
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,100
Okay, topsy showed pulmonary edema.

575
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,900
Put simply--

576
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
Glenn whitney had water in his lungs.

577
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,200
So he did drown. Uh, what about the g.H.B.?

578
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,700
I'm looking at the complete tox analysis.

579
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,200
The levels in his system

580
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,400
Topped out at 30 milligrams per liter.

581
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,000
And in most overdoses, that number's over 100.

582
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
-So the killer underdosed him.
-Not surprising.

583
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,900
If he bought it on the street

584
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,700
There'd be no way of telling how concentrated it was.

585
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,900
Which is why our murderer moved to plan "b"--

586
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,700
Shoving glenn's head in the toilet.

587
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,100
Okay, have fun at the party. Bye.

588
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,700
All right, so we have two sets of suspects.

589
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,500
And since karen adams hasn't been assigned

590
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,200
A public defender yet, i can't talk to her

591
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,600
-So--
-The prescotts it is.

592
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,600
I'm gonna pay them visit

593
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,900
And ask them why they lied about not knowing glenn whitney.

594
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
And i can drop you at home.

595
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,000
Unh-Unh. No,, no, no, no.

596
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,700
I promised jill and claire that i wouldn't leave you.

597
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,100
W--That was when we were spa-Ing, and now i'm working.

598
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Lindsay, you just heard your ex-Husband's wedding vows.

599
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,400
Have you taken five minutes to process how huge that is?

600
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,900
Why would you?

601
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,400
You're a hardened homicide inspector.

602
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,700
Here's the thing--

603
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,400
At some point, you're gonna be hit

604
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
With a wave of loss and sadness so massive

605
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,000
You're not even gonna be able to breathe.

606
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,100
So will you just shut up and let me be here for you?

607
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,000
Let's go.

608
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,800
U see? Weddings aren't all that bad.

609
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
I mean, can't you see yourself in a white dress

610
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,300
Surrnded by solar-Powered twinkle lights

611
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,000
And fair-Trade floral arrangements?

612
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,600
Honey.

613
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,400
Oh, i know. I know. Not your thing.

614
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,300
To tell you the truth, i, uh,

615
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,500
I have been thinking about taking theext step

616
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,300
In order to protect what we have

617
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And who were are to each other.

618
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,000
Luke...

619
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,000
Will you draw up

620
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Papers for living wills

621
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,200
And durable power of attorney with me?

622
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,000
Of course i will, you sentimental fool.

623
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,200
Kiss me.

624
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,600
Yeah? Yeah.

625
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,500
Hey.

626
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
You, uh, leaving?

627
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,800
Well, let's just say cinderella's on borrowed time.

628
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,500
Oh. Need a hand, man?

629
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,300
She seems to be missing a shoe.

630
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,500
Oh. Here you go.

631
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
Come on. Let's get going.

632
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,100
Come on. Hey, come on

633
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,700
Hey, get off. I'm fine.

634
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,700
Listen, you don't want to have any regrets come monday

635
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,200
So i'm taking-- I'm just gonna take you home.

636
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,400
You're just trying to get rid of me.

637
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,800
Okay, don't think that i haven't seen you and bernhardt

638
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,700
Flirting all night.

639
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,300
W--Right in front of me.

640
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,500
You're my date.

641
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Okay, maybe we should take this outside.

642
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,700
-What do you say?
-Maybe you should take me home, huh?

643
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,600
Then he can go screw your girlfriend

644
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,900
Behind your back again.

645
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,500
Sorry, not behind your back.

646
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,200
On her desk.

647
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,900
Denise, come on.

648
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,000
-Well, that was a lot of fun.
-Just let go of me. I'm fine.

649
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,600
-Whoa, whoa, watch yourself. Hey, hey, hey.
-Let go. I'-

650
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,100
-Listen, i hope you're proud of yourself.
-God, i just want to get--

651
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,300
Excuse me. Exse me. Taxi!

652
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,700
Luke.

653
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,100
Luke! Let me explain.

654
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,700
Is that true?

655
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah.

656
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,100
You know what's sad? Is that i'm not even surprised.

657
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,000
How can i fix this? Just tell me

658
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,000
-And i'll do it.
-Jill, you can't.

659
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,400
-Whatever it is, i'll do it.
-No. No, no, no, no, you can't fix this.

660
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
You know, it was car to me from the beginning

661
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,100
That you were only half in this

662
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,700
-But that was okay because i loved you.
-That's not true.

663
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,000
Now--Yeah, yeah, it is true, because now it's apparent

664
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,800
That you were never in this, never.
-Luke, please.

665
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,700
No, i'm sorry.

666
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,700
Hello?

667
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,000
It's over.

668
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,700
What?

669
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,300
Luke fou out about hanson, and, uh, he left.

670
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,700
My purse and keys are in his car.

671
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,500
I-I need you to come pick me up.

672
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
Wh--Hang on a second. Where's claire?

673
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
Please? I can't go back in there.

674
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,300
Okay. Meet me out back in ten.

675
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,900
Linz, i am so sorry.

676
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,600
For what, having a relationship ltdown?

677
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,300
Don't be. But just, the ris of sounding insensitive...

678
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Let's get the hell out of here. How'd y'all gehere so fast?

679
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
W-We were on our way to talk to the prescotts

680
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,700
They your prime suspects?

681
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,100
Right now they're in a dead heat with this karen adams.

682
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,500
She's a male impersonator,

683
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,400
Performs under the name buzz baltimore.

684
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,800
Wow, you two have missed a lot. Does she have motive?

685
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,000
Yes, besides being completely bizarre.

686
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,200
I've never seen anything like it.

687
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,700
She spaces out. She laughs uncontrollably.

688
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,300
She even pulled out a tape recorder

689
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,200
-In the middle of my questioning.
-Is she narcoleptic?

690
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,500
Did she conk out in the middle of my interview? No.

691
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,300
But, like, two seconds after i put her in the holding cell,

692
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,100
She was out like a light.

693
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,000
Well, all the things you've mentioned are classic symptoms.

694
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,400
A tape recorder is a symptom?

695
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Because narcoleptics often have no memory

696
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,300
Of previous conversaons, they tend to carry them.

697
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,100
That sounds terrible.

698
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
But it just made karen adams

699
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,100
Pull ahead of the prescotts as a susct.

700
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,400
Narcoleptics are treated with sodium oxybate,

701
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,200
-Also known as g.H.B.
-Excuse me.

702
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,500
I was looking for tom.

703
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,000
Have you seen him?

704
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,000
We haven. I didn't mean to...

705
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,400
-You need to leave.
-Absolutely.

706
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,200
No, all of you.

707
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm sorry. Don't take this the wrong way.

708
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,000
I don't want to be a bitch, but this is my wedding

709
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
And you're not doing me any favors by being here

710
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,600
When i know that you would all rather be somewhere else.

711
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,300
You can't stay off the phone.

712
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,700
You were the center of a drunken spectacle.

713
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,200
I don't even know you.

714
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,500
And you... crashing weddings and lurking in the alley.

715
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,900
This can't be fun for you.

716
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,100
It's not.

717
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
He's not yours anymore, lindsay.

718
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,900
So do yourself a favor and let him go.

719
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,100
We checked for fingerprints again

720
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,100
On the toilet, walls and the light switch.

721
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,600
Zilch on the blo and hair.

722
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,200
I mean, there's nothing that suggests

723
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,600
Anyone but glenn whitney was in there.

724
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,500
Hey, jill got a search warrant

725
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
For karen adams' medical records.

726
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,600
-She's on the phone with her doctor now.
-That's good news.

727
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,400
A prescription for g.H.B.

728
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,700
Isn't enough to tie h to the murder.

729
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,500
We need forensic edence.

730
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,600
How could she strangle someone in here

731
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,600
-And not touch anything?
-One thing's certain--

732
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,200
Karen may be narcoptic, but she's not claustrophobic.

733
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,700
-You couldn't be that and pu this off.
-You're right.

734
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,600
Okay, claire, i need to simulate the position of glenn's corpse.

735
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,100
Does the tech have a forensic dummy?

736
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,300
No, he rushed over with a bare-Bones kit.

737
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,200
Just use me.

738
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,900
All right. Um, glenn's out of it, towing up.

739
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,300
Karen sees an opportunity, comes up behind...
-Mnh-Mnh, mnh-Mnh.

740
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,600
There was no bruising. It's impossible.

741
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,600
Unless the killer used her feet.

742
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,000
You know, it'd be tough for him to balance

743
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,200
With the victim fighting back.

744
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,900
Yeah, but doable if she had something to hang on to.

745
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,700
Rizzo!

746
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
Karen adams was on antidepressants

747
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,500
Migraine medication and allergy pills

748
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,000
But no sodium oxybate.

749
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,600
Damn it.

750
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,100
We're setting up for the tribute.

751
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,500
There's food if you'd like.

752
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,700
I could go for some emotional eating. You?

753
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,500
Yes.

754
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,700
-Guess what? He found a print.
-Finally.

755
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,400
He's gonna lift it and meet us back at the hall.

756
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
In the meantime, i'm gonna check gln whitney's body

757
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,000
And see if it has something else ttell us.

758
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,900
Now if this we my autopsy

759
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,600
I'd have shaved glenn's head right off the bat.

760
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,100
But why do something youelf when you can hand it over

761
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,500
To a work-Shy, ill-Mannered counterpart?

762
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,700
-Are we supposed to answer her?
-No,that's not necessary.

763
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,200
Luke texted me. He's staying at a hotel tonight

764
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,500
And moving out of the apartment tomorrow.

765
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,400
-All happening so fast.
-Nothing's happened yet.

766
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,800
Maybe you both need to sleep on it.

767
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,500
-You know, things could be very different tomorrow.
-I don't think so.

768
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Jill, we've got it covered here, okay? Go home, get some rest.

769
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,500
Honestly, this case is the only thing keeping me from losing it.

770
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Well, now you know the method to my madness.

771
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,200
Hello, gorgeous.

772
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,400
A foot-Shaped contusion on the occipital scalp

773
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,000
Pronounced heel

774
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,900
Tapering to the toe.

775
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
Does karen adams wear boots?

776
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,200
Yes, but not that kind.

777
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,800
Well, i knew it was only a matter of time

778
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,100
Once you found fingerprints.

779
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,000
I hold a liquor license. Mine are on file with the state.

780
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,900
Didn't need 'em.

781
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Your boots left an impression

782
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,200
On the back of glenn whitney's skull.

783
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,100
Owning a nightclub is lonely.

784
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,900
Sleep all day

785
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,400
Work all night.

786
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,400
No time for boyfriends or family.

787
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,300
Before long, the people you work with

788
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
They're your everything.

789
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,100
Especily glenn?

790
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,400
He wasn't nothing when he came to me

791
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Just a tacky little queen lip-Synching to madonna.

792
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,300
I made him into dakota manning.

793
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,600
But in the end, that wasn't good enough.

794
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,100
He needed options.

795
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,500
Meaning?

796
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,500
He was gonna leave me and start his own place.

797
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,900
-To make more money?
-That, and he wanted to surprise bruce.

798
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,600
It was gonna mark a whole new chapter in their lives

799
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,300
Now that the cancer was gone.

800
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,600
So you snuck into his dressing room

801
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,500
Poured g.H.B. Into his martini

802
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,300
Lied about hearing an argument to throw us off.

803
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,900
It was supposed to be such a graceful exit.

804
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,200
Until you had to drown him.

805
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,600
Tell me why.

806
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
He was mine, inspector.

807
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,100
I wasn't ever gonna let him go.

808
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,700
I don't think anyone will disagree with me

809
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,700
When i say today was a day.

810
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,100
At least there's a shred of silver lining.

811
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,900
As glenn's biological son

812
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Thaddeus prescott is his next of kin.

813
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm assuming bruce won't have as much trouble aling with him

814
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,600
As he would with glenn's estranged parents.

815
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,600
Do you mind if i run with that?

816
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,200
Speaking of family, i just spoke to mine

817
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,300
And ed--Who had a woerful time at the reception--Went to bed

818
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And the boys putome towels in the guest bedroom for you.

819
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,200
-You can stay as long as you like.
-Thanks.

820
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,400
The idea of facing an empty apartment

821
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,600
Makes me wanna change the subject.

822
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,400
Okay. You know what i hate about heather?

823
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,100
Every time i see her

824
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Or talk to her

825
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,200
She says something that makes me respect her a little bit more.

826
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
She's right.

827
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,900
I need to let go.

828
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,100
And it's weird

829
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,000
But tonight...

830
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,500
I think i finally have.

831
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,500
My grandma used to say

832
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,600
That when one door closes, another always opens.

833
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,700
Well, then a toast.

834
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,300
To cindy's grandma.

835
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,500
She sounds like a smart cookie.

836
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,300
Inspector lindsay boxer?

837
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,200
Yes.

838
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,000
Agent john ash, fbi. I've been waiting for ya.

839
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,300
Do you always make it a point

840
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,200
To show up on a girl's front stoop unannounced?

841
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,800
Well, i do when it involves the kiss me not killer.

842
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,700
We've had some new developments.

843
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,600
This, uh, arrived at the agency this morning.

844
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,000
It's cindy's thomas' article

845
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,100
From the day the last victim surfaced.

846
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,600
We're sure it's him.

847
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,800
We think you might be his next victim

848
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,640
