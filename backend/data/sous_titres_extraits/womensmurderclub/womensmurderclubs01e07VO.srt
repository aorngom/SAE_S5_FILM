00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,030
Hey,your phone was off.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,540
I had to t-Pod a guy from a motorcycle mishap.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,350
Kid's leather pants were holding him together.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,310
Why do you put these images in my head? Look,i just got here. Did you grab a table?

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,940
I had to go. We split a salad.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,570
They're holding your half at the bar. I'll see you tonight.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,750
Bye.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,420
Dusting lamps for 10 bucks an hour.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,990
What a w to spend your last night on earth.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,000
Judging by these lacerations,

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,110
He was beaten with something small,

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,430
Heavy and angular.

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,710
Like a portable radio?

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,570
Third-Shift guy said his was missing when he found him.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,050
Missing

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,510
And probably at the bottom of the bay by now.

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,280
"A tale of two cities."

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,130
At least he had stopped reading

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,550
Before the sad part.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,430
"Ben cooper." Why do i know that name?

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,050
Our janitor did not go down easy.

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,740
Yeah,but it doesn't look like he was taken by surprise.

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,450
Is he someone i arrested once?

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,020
So one possibility

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,680
Is someone came here to rob the warehouse,

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,050
Janitor heads out for a smoke,

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,820
Finds the robber, gets killed for his trouble. Yeah,except we checked the warehouse.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,100
Nothing's missing.

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,950
Tell me you didn't drive this here.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,380
Please. I drove maggie, my little red car.

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,210
And then you sweet-Talked officer cho

33
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,070
Into sneaking you past the tape.

34
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,200
Wait,your car has a name? Doesn't yours?

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,180
So you were saying, not a robbery.

36
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,040
No,this is a low-Rent place without surveillance cameras.

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,180
A robber would've come in,

38
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,980
Taken what he wanted once the janitor was dead.

39
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,610
I think this was personal. There's blood and skin under the victim's fingernails.

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,200
We can get the killer's d.N.A. From that. Title search will give us the owner of the warehouse

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,120
And any legal proceedings involving the property. The only question

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,440
Is whether there was something going on here

43
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,090
That wouldn't be on the books. Dull places are the best fronts.

44
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,820
I'll chat up the locals, see if there was anything

45
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,180
More interesting for sale here at the house of lamps,

46
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,850
Lamps and more lamps.

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,740
All right,maggie.

48
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Where should we start?

49
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,460
Just keep driving. Don't scream. I got a gun.

My name's jamie galvan. Oh,god.

53
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,050
I'm not gonna hurt you. No,you're gonna kill me

54
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,980
Because you wouldn't tell me yo name unless-- I just need your help.

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,940
To flee a crime scene

56
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,120
Where you just beat a guy to death with a radio.

57
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,610
Ben cooper was dead when i got there. You expect me

58
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,390
My dad is in jail,okay? Death row.

59
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,040
Ben cooper was the only person who was gonna help him out.

60
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,870
Now that he's dead, i don't have anybody.

61
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,120
Okay? That's why i need to talk to you.

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,310
Deep breath. Just listen to me.

63
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,700
You're a crime reporter for the "register."

64
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,780
I've seen your face on the byline picture.

65
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,850
I have two days to stop an execution. Wait,is your father

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,830
Who's scheduled to die in two days?

67
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,250
In two days,yeah.

68
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,760
Listen,my dad's innocent. Okay?

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,300
And i--I've read your work.

70
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,350
You care about the truth and you know people,

71
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,740
And you're-- You're smart.

72
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,880
Now you're just getting all flatterer-Y.

73
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,760
You don't have to be scared of me.

74
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,820
Maybe if you didn't have a gun.

75
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,680
I don't. Okay?

76
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,630
You can pull over.

77
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,580
What?

78
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,190
Listen,this is everything there is

79
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,030
About my dad's case.

80
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,550
I'm putting his life in your hands.

81
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,690
Where do i know this guy from?

82
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,040
Does he go to my coffee shop?

83
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,180
Is he my old high school gym coach?

84
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,050
Was he my mailman? Wha

85
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,250
You're sitting. You never sit.

86
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,590
Ugh. It's late. I'm tired. Go on.

87
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,140
All right.

88
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,060
I'm waiting for the results on the killer's d.N.A.

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,170
What did cooper's background check show?

90
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,320
Um,no next of kin.

91
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,310
A few drug arrests years ago.

92
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,740
Well,no signs of recent drug use.

93
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,270
Are you coming down with something?

94
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,050
Come on. Let me feel your forehead.

95
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,610
I do not have a fever,mom.

96
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,400
I'm not cutting this man open till you tell me what's wrong.

97
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,950
Okay.

98
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,550
<i>Look,just between us.</i>

99
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,490
Mm-Hmm.

100
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,330
It's the third week of the month.

101
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,860
At least it's supposed to be for me.

102
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,510
But it's not.

103
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,750
I'm late.

104
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,990
Late? You work too hard, you don't eat right.

105
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,880
Cycles get off balance sometimes.

106
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,450
I mean,

107
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,700
At least we know you'ot pregnant.

108
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,970
I mean, we'd be talking about

109
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,890
<i>An immaculate conception, right?</i>

110
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,120
Well,i...

111
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,810
<i>May have had a one-Night stand.</i>

112
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,460
Girl,a one-Night stand is a big step forward for you.

113
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,250
Okay,in a way. Who's the guy?

114
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,130
Tom.

115
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,660
Tom?

116
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,920
Yes.

117
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,730
Tom?

118
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,920
Your ex-Husband/boss

119
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,870
Who's-Getting-Remarried- In-A-Matter-Of-Weeks tom?

120
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,400
Okay.

121
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,150
Really more of a backwards step.

122
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,430
Oh,my god!

123
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,040
And no one thought to use protection?

124
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,670
Y-Yes,we did. We thought.

125
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,500
The... condom was kind of old.

126
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,590
How old was this antique condom? Oh,you know what?

127
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,870
????

128
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,270
Latex is very durable.

129
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,450
Okay,please don't focus on that point.

130
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,930
It was a onetime thing. Oh,my god.

131
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,880
<i>It was a mistake. Oh,my god.</i>

132
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,650
Whatever. Will you stop saying "oh,my god"?

133
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,460
<i>Mnh-Mnh-Mnh. What?</i>

134
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,970
Text message from cindy.

135
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,780
She wants to meet us in the diner. When are you gonna tell him?

136
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,520
There's nothing to tell him yet. Ever.

137
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,910
We're just keeping our distance.

138
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,170
<i>Clearly, that's working for you.</i>

139
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,540
I'll do your pregnancy test.

140
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,710
Hello? I am in the middle of solving a murder.

141
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,690
And cindy just said she has something on the crime.

142
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,890
And if you tell anyone about...

143
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,220
My sleeping with tom,

144
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,590
I will come at you with that bone saw.

145
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,950
<i>I'm not saying a word.</i>

146
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm putting mr. Cooper in the fridge,

147
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,240
And i'll catch up with you in ten.

148
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,320
<i>I so don't feel better now that we've talked.</i>

149
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,390
Uh,give me ten.

150
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,370
Tom.

151
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,130
Hey,linz. How you doing?

152
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,020
Fine. Why do do you ask?

153
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,060
Well,my--My mama

154
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,670
Taught me a little thing called being polite.

155
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,480
Seven years ago, ben cooper

156
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,120
Was the key eyewitness in a murder investigation.

157
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,490
His testimony convicted a man named paul galvan.

158
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,390
The victim was a deputy district attorney

159
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,730
Who worked in your building. That's why i know ben cooper's name.

160
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,780
Do you know this case?

161
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,080
Uh,d.D.A. Tracy welng was raped and murdered

162
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,260
In her apartment. No,before my time.

163
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,040
Well,ben cooper lied on the stand.

164
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,150
His testimony put an innocent man on death row.

165
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,740
But he was about to recant. And you know this how?

166
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,750
Uh,the guy who is on death row,

167
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,380
I sort of met his son jamie.

168
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,140
How'd you meet him?

169
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,680
Just around.

170
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,300
I mean,you know, i-I meet people.

171
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
So between the last time we saw you and now,

172
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,050
You met paul galvan's son.

173
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,140
Please don't give me the laser vision.

174
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,650
It makes me really nervous. All right.

175
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,040
All right,i wasn't gonna say anything before

176
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,850
Because this is gonna sound really,really bad,

177
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,650
But it actually isn't, so just hear me out.

178
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,690
Jamie... got into my car at the crime scene.

179
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,000
You went off with a total stranger?

180
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,540
Have we taught you nothing? He said he had a gun.

181
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,830
<i>What? He kidnapped you?</i>

182
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,140
Are you okay? He was very sincere.

183
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,270
N-Not about the gun. He made that part up.

184
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,010
He kidnapped you. Not really.

185
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,520
"Pretend gunpoint" still counts

186
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,220
As being restrained against your will.

187
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,680
Let's take you to the hospital, get you checked out.

188
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,040
He didn't touch me. I'm fine. Tell me everything. Start with a description.

189
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,900
Um,okay, he was kind of... cute.

190
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,180
And he had a little blood on his shirt.

191
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,340
More,please. You guys,an innocent man is about to be executed

192
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,730
In,like,48 hours.

193
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,300
Check,please.

194
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,390
It was no different from any other trial.

195
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,480
But it was your first big case--

196
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,210
Second chair--

197
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,170
And the victim worked in this office.

198
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,580
We had the killer cold-- Criminal record,

199
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,170
Fingerprints at the scene, bulletproof eyewitness,done.

200
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,920
An eyewitness named ben coop,right?

201
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,770
What if someone told you

202
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,990
Cooper was about to recant his testimony?

203
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,270
I would say that somebody was a conspiracy theorist

204
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,840
In need of attention,

205
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,480
And i'd advise him or her to go start a blog.

206
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,910
Been meaning to call you.

207
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,980
I spent some time working on

208
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,770
Your boyfriend's malpractice case.

209
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,780
I've advised his attorneys to move for dismissal

210
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,530
On the grounds of-- You're not even listening.

211
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm sorry. That's... that's great news.

212
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,330
Yes,it is.

213
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,520
And i know that look, so what's on your mind?

214
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,730
I was talking to denise about one of her old cases.

215
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,800
I'm trying to figure out what her angle is. Good luck.

216
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,630
Speak of the devil. You ready to go? Yeah.

217
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,380
Good seeing you, counselor. Good night,jill.

218
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,940
Good night.

219
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,520
Jamie galvan's last known address

220
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,130
Is apartment 2b, second floor.

221
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,060
So...

222
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,510
This guy kidnaps your friend,

223
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,530
Tells her he has a gun,

224
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,320
And,uh, she thinks he's "cute"?

225
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,830
Yeah,she definitely used the word "cute."

226
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,630
Why do you hang out with this girl?

227
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,680
Some women just lose all sense of reality

228
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,820
In the face of cuteness,

229
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,820
Apparently even if the guy is fleeing a murder scene.

230
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,580
A scene at which he had opportunity,means and motive.

231
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,050
And blood on his shirt. You're with me on this.

232
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,950
100%.

233
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,640
Aah! Watch out!

234
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,270
Whoa!

235
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,100
Make that 95.

236
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,020
Paul galvan?

237
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,870
I'm jill bernhardt.

238
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,850
San francisco d.A.'S office.

239
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,790
I have some questions about your trial.

240
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,530
Seven years ago,ben cooper testified he saw you leang

241
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,210
D.D.A. Tracy welling's apartment

242
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,110
The night she was murdered.

243
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,140
Yeah. She lived downstairs from me.

244
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,410
But i only remember being in her place once.

245
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,630
Tell me.

246
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,840
I was trying to get a job

247
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,020
Because my disability checks had ruout.

248
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,490
But i had done some time for my d.U.I.S,

249
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,710
So... tracy sat me down in her living room

250
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,790
And wrote me a character reference.

251
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,920
It meant a lot. Is that why you sent roses to her office

252
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,190
Three mondays in a row?

253
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,170
I had a crush on her.

254
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,970
After a few weeks, i took the hint...

255
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,190
I think.

256
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,500
Back then i was a blackout drunk.

257
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,050
So there's,uh,lots of stuff i don't remember,

258
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,860
Including the night of tracy's murder.

259
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,360
And that's why you waived your last appeals,

260
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,460
'Cause you're not sure you didn't do it?

261
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,220
Well,my lawyer was useless anyway.

262
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
I'm not a rapist...

263
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,410
Or a murderer.

264
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,830
But when you can't remember a whole day of your life,

265
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,140
It gets pretty hard to defend yourself.

266
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,460
I don't want jamie fighting this.

267
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,580
He can't stop the execution.

268
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,000
He needs to make his peace and move on.

269
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,340
You tell him i said that.

270
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,280
I don't know if i can.

271
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,070
There was a gas explosion at jamie's apartment.

272
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,000
What?

273
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,280
Is he hurt?

274
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,620
<i>Is he dead?</i>

275
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,520
We don't know yet.

276
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,910
Hey,uh,the fire department wouldn't let us in

277
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,830
Till this morning.

278
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,510
The good news is there's no human remains,

279
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,680
So we still have a suspect in our janitor's murder.

280
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,590
Unis canvassed all the neighbors.

281
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,530
Came up with a whole lot of nothing.

282
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,470
So there's no way to tell whether jamie rigged this

283
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,320
To cover his tracks after killing ben cooper.

284
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,110
Or if someone was trying to silce jamie

285
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,600
The way they silenced ben cooper.

286
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,620
I'm gonna,uh,head back to the hall.

287
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,470
I had everything

288
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,960
On the tracy welling murder trial pulled.

289
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,450
Whatever's going on here,i think it all goes back to that.

290
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,450
D.A. Pratt. Good morning,sir.

291
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,900
I was looking for the archives of tracy--

292
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,850
Denise,hope you had your espresso.

293
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,890
You have the jurisdiction exhibits ready? Yes,to both sir.

294
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,240
Bernhardt, you were saying? You're busy.

295
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,720
I'll come back later. No,no. You've got me now.

296
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,890
What about the archives?

297
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,330
I was researching the tracy welling murder trial.

298
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,140
The transcripts are missing. Probably out being digitized.

299
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,760
I didn't ask for any research. You were first chair.

300
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,530
You got the death penalty for paul galvan.

301
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,930
If i could have a few minutes of your time

302
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,160
To ask you some questions. One of your d.D.A.S has time

303
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,550
To look into cases from seven years ago?

304
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,850
Now i thought ran a tight ship. Not to worry,bruce.

305
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,490
I'll be upping her caseload.

306
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,730
My research is part of a current murder investigation.

307
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,310
Call my assistant. She'll get you on the books.

308
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,360
No, i have to work tonight.

309
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,660
Can you hear me?

310
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,720
Crap.

311
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,310
Girls, here's what we know--

312
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,350
Son of death row guy had means,

313
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,530
Motive and opportunity

314
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,250
To kill ben cooper last night.

315
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,570
He fled the crime scene, kidnapped cindy,

316
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,590
And then went on the run.

317
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,820
His name is jamie galvan, and he only went on the run

318
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,790
Because someone tried to kill him.

319
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,440
Listen,my instincts are telling me that this-- Shh. You,not old enough to have instincts.

320
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,510
And i'm not saying that jamie has to be the killer,

321
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,500
But i am saying that the simplest explanation

322
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,390
Is usually the right one. Do we have any idea where jamie might have gone?

323
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,440
We issued a "be on the lookout" for him,

324
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,560
But no sightings of him yet.

325
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,100
We do know that he's posting on his web site.

326
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,360
Organizing a protest outside san quentin.

327
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,010
We faxed jamie's photo to every wi-Fi spot in the city.

328
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,850
Meanwhile...

329
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,820
I pulled all the forensic evidence

330
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,540
On the tracy welling murder trial,as requested.

331
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,400
We're reopening the case? Cool.

332
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,660
No,we're not reopening anything.

333
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,830
We're trying to figure out

334
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,990
Who murdered our janitor ben cooper,

335
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,790
And if his tesmony in the old trial

336
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,720
Had anything to do with it.

337
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,300
I called every archive in the state.

338
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,290
No one can find the transcripts from the trial.

339
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,900
Our taxpayer dollars at work.

340
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,080
And no one in my department wants to talk about the case.

341
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,470
I don't know why they'd mind. Everything seems in order here.

342
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,990
No semen on tracy welling's body,

343
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,670
But there was other physical evidence of rape.

344
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,000
Cause of death was asphyxia due to suffocation.

345
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,510
And there was some unidentified blood sample

346
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,960
Found in tracy welling's kitchen sink.

347
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,240
Unidentified as in not paul galvan's?

348
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,040
Unidentified as in unidentified.

349
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,950
Wait,jamie talked about this in the notebooks.

350
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,520
Uh,the prosecution said

351
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,990
That anyone could've left the blood there,

352
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,880
Even weeks before the crime happened. Paul's public defender

353
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,520
Should've pointed to that blood as reasonable doubt.

354
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,990
Can you retest that blood sample?

355
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,650
Yeah,glad to. Any other tests we should run?

356
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,870
Not right now.

357
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,400
Jill,did you go to death row

358
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,440
And talk to paul galvan?

359
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,250
I did. I looked him in the eye.

360
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,230
I think he's innocent.

361
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,160
I'm gonna apply for a stay of his execution. Our club rocks.

362
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,820
It's not a club. Excuse me.

363
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,980
None of this proves that cute jamie galvan

364
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,520
Didn't kill ben cooper last night. Jamie didn't kill anyone.

365
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,080
I'm with her. I'm undecided, but sympathetic.

366
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,520
I'm touched that everyone wants to see the best in people.

367
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,310
I am a cop. I don't have that luxury.

368
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,770
You go on your gut all the time. You can take one look at a guy--

369
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,270
And i haven't seen jamie galvan

370
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,760
Because after he kidnapped you,

371
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,620
He disappeared off the face of the earth.

372
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,140
By which i mean no one has heard from him.

373
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,000
Am i right?

374
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,870
Yeah.

375
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,550
Totally.

376
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,860
<i>Worst liar ever.</i>

377
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,020
Don't make me charge you with obstruction.

378
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,610
Every y$tered,?????

379
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,030
You start whipping out the charges.

380
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,930
Please spare us all the pain of watching you try to bluff.

381
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,080
I'm not bluffing,i'm...

382
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,700
<i>If... jamie were to have</i>

383
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,030
Sent me a text message, say this morning...

384
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:57,590
Ugh!

385
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,020
I would have promised

386
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,780
To keep that text message a secret.

387
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,560
Hey.

388
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,610
Hey.

389
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,580
Sorry. I'm,uh, i'm wrecked.

390
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
I,uh,couldn't exactly go home and change.

391
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,980
Or sleep?

392
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,090
I'm,uh,i'm all right. So you have some news?

393
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,760
I talked to a lawyer.

394
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,760
She's putting together an emergency application

395
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,460
For a stay of your dad's execution.

396
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,090
Wyers always turn me down.

397
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,220
How--How'd you get her to do that?

398
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,930
She's a friend.

399
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,910
And i,um... i have another friend

400
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,850
I'd like for you to meet.

401
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,570
I'm inspector lindsay boxer.

402
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,620
You set me up? You can trust her.

403
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,950
Nowhere to go,jamie.

404
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,230
Outta my way.

405
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,800
Ow!

406
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,400
That's not gonna help. You good?

407
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,910
Yeah,i'm good.

408
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,610
God.

409
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,400
I didn't kill ben cooper.

410
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,340
You were at the crime scene. You abducted cindy thomas.

411
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,930
Ben cooper was gonna change his testimony.

412
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,330
He was the one person

413
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,910
That wanted to actually help my dad.

414
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,930
I would not have hurt him. Open.

415
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,300
I'm having your d.N.A. Tested against the blood we found

416
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,030
Under ben cooper's fingernails.

417
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,770
Label that right now.

418
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,190
I don't want anything messing with the chain of evidence.

419
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,730
It's attitude like that that makes me think-- I don't care what you think!

420
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,910
They're gonna execute my dad in 36 hours.

421
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,030
If i can't help him,

422
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,510
Then that puts the blood on your hands.

423
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,440
What about that blood on youshirt?

424
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,280
When i found ben cooper, i was trying to help him.

425
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,610
I touched his head. I'm so tired of this story.

426
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,470
It's,uh,new to me. I'd like to hear it.

427
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,980
May i?

428
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,860
Jamie's story is very consistent.

429
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,210
Let's see what his d.N.A. Says.

430
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,340
Heard you walked into a door. No,thanks.

431
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,160
I can't be a wuss and drive at the same time.

432
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,120
You let her drive? We're going to walnut creek.

433
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,800
I don't do the caldecott tunnel.

434
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,040
We have an interview with a guy named henry dow.

435
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,000
He's still the building manager of the place

436
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,760
Where tracy welling and ben cooper

437
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,850
And paul galvan used to ve. Lot of names in this case.

438
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,580
Keep up,tom.

439
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,970
Keep up.

440
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,900
Thanks for taking jamie on as a client.

441
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,110
Got another favor to ask.

442
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,340
Well,keep talking. I like it when you owe me.

443
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
I'm applying to have his father's execution stayed.

444
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,580
Well,that,uh,

445
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,900
That's a delicate proposition

446
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,900
Given that you're with the same d.A.'S office

447
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,290
That put galvan away. That's why i need a defense attorney

448
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,290
To file the application.

449
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,080
Hmm.

450
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,640
I'm in.

451
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,710
Just like that?

452
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,780
No quid pro quo?

453
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,830
Your death row prisoner might be innocent.

454
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,990
And in my opinion,

455
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,000
That's a good enough reason not to kill him.

456
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,620
This will only take a few minutes.

457
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,870
Okay.

458
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,050
Cute kids.

459
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,460
Hmm. Thanks.

460
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,510
My sister's.

461
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,720
At least now i have an extra room for them

462
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,040
When they come to visit.

463
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,230
Of course,i haven't told the ki what happened here.

464
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,340
This is tracy welling's old apartment.

465
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,290
Was,uh,that her bedroom back there?

466
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,150
Yep.

467
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,540
Yeah,nobody wanted to rent this place after the murder,

468
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,860
So the landlord made me take it,

469
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,090
By then half the tenants had already moved out.

470
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,950
But i had it repainted, put new furniture in.

471
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,590
Would you mind putting those photos away? Sorry.

472
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,350
When did you meet ben cooper?

473
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Uh,hired him in '99. He was just out of rehab,

474
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,410
But he was trying to go straight.

475
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,280
But he had these friends who kept coming,looking to score.

476
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,070
So that's why i had to eventually let him go. Did you stay in touch after that?

477
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,640
Mnh-Mnh. Hadn't seen him in years.

478
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,300
Why?

479
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,560
We're trying to find someone who can tell us

480
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,910
About his relationship with jamie galvan,paul's son.

481
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,300
I wouldn't expect them to be friends.

482
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,670
I remember jamie from the trial. He seemed a little off.

483
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,050
W-What do you mean,off?

484
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,930
When they read the guilty verdict,he--

485
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,810
The kid went out of his head.

486
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,040
I me,the bailiff had to hold him down.

487
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,920
Hell of a temper, like his father.

488
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,920
You think jamie had it in him to,uh,kill a man?

489
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,460
Like i said, apple don't fall far.

490
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,740
Ben cooper's false testimony

491
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,250
Caused a severe miscarriage of justice

492
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,410
Seven years ago.

493
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,460
D.D.A. Tracy welling

494
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,340
Was a highly respected member of my office. I'm sorry,your honor.

495
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,700
The d.A.'S key eyewitness was about to recant.

496
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,340
An assertion based on a printout from a web page

497
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,180
Of jamie galvan's--

498
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,710
A supposed,uh,e-Mail from ben cooper--

499
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,610
A man who's now dead

500
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,840
And can neither confirm or deny any of this.

501
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,770
You can't take this seriously. Somebody took it seriously.

502
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,400
Ben cooper ended up dead last night.

503
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,840
Sorry.

504
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,850
Sorry,your honor. Under the rule of plain error,

505
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,280
Paul galvan must be granted a new trial. Paul galvan's romantic advances

506
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,900
Had been rejected by the victim on numerous-- Oh,i've been rejected plenty of times,

507
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,890
And that doesn't make me a murderer. Galvan was an ex-Con

508
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,260
And a blackout drunk with a violent temper.

509
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,670
And--And ben cooper, a reliable eyewitness,

510
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,190
Came forward of his own volition

511
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,510
And gave an exact description of paul galvan

512
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,000
Leaving d.D.A. Tracy welling's apartment

513
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,630
On the night of her murder.

514
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,660
Ms. Bernhardt, anything to add?

515
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,550
I believe my colleagues have said more than enough,

516
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,190
Your honor. I'm inclined to agree.

517
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,760
Tracy welling's family has waited seven years for justice.

518
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,190
Paul galvan has been waiting for justice as well,your honor.

519
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,050
I've heard nothing to suggest that he hasn't received it.

520
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,550
And since this letter from ben cooper

521
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,610
To jamie galvan can't be verified as genuine,

522
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,220
Neither can we verify ben cooper's

523
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,690
Alleged intention to recant.

524
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,510
Application for stay of execution

525
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,910
Is summarily denied. All we're asking

526
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,720
Is for the time to find out the truth. Ms. Thomas,i'd rather not

527
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,490
Have you arrested for contempt. Well,would you rather go--

528
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,730
What are you doing here?

529
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,090
Oh,other than to offer

530
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,380
My belated yet heartfelt apologies

531
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,640
For setting up your takedown,

532
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,720
Which i only did because i know

533
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,140
That my friends will help you,

534
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,190
I got arrested for contempt of court.

535
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,320
We had this total neocon judge--

536
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,600
He turned down the stay, didn he?

537
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,940
Yeah. Listen, tell your friends

538
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,420
That i said thanks

539
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,590
And get me the hell outta here.

540
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,360
You should be nicer to her.

541
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,400
She determines what happens to you. What are you talking about?

542
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,450
First of all,today's judge was not the end of the road.

543
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,380
The next stop is the u.S. Court of appeals.

544
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,580
Second,i did the eliminary blood typing

545
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,600
On jamie's d.N.A., and it's not a match

546
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,840
To the fingernail scrapings from ben cooper's body.

547
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,120
Proving that jamie did not kill ben cooper last night.

548
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,920
You see? I told ya.

549
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,680
So is that pizza some form of apology?

550
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,040
Do you want the breadsticks or not?

551
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,500
She's sorry that she didn't believe you.

552
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,690
Whicleaves the kidnapping. Do you want to press charges?

553
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,160
Over a little fake gunplay? Nah,i'm cool. Thanks.

554
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,420
I had to ask.

555
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,870
I,too,am declining to press charges

556
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,350
For assault on a police officer.

557
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,550
So...

558
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,510
Guess what did match the fingernail scrapings

559
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,070
We got off ben cooper's body?

560
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,170
The unidentified blood

561
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,940
Found in tracy welling's apartment in 2000.

562
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,320
What are the odds?

563
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,370
Unless the same person murdered them both.

564
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,090
Which means that tracy welling's killer

565
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,840
Is still out there and still killing people.

566
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,610
And paul galvan is about to be executed

567
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,150
For a crime he didn't mmit.

568
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,420
We have 24 hours to catch a double murderer

569
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,730
And to save your father's life.

570
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,140
Hey,honey. I'm sorry i never came home last night.

571
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,020
I've been working on a writ of habeas corpus

572
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,760
To try to get an execution postponed.

573
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,220
We've got 17 hours left.

574
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll call you later.

575
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,670
I love you.

576
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,560
Why the guilty look?

577
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,130
You're not lying to him.

578
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,230
At least not about working all night.

579
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,190
On an 80-Page writ

580
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,400
Supported mainly by...

581
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,330
What?

582
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,840
Hope? Chutzpah?

583
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,680
U know this is a hail mary.

584
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,500
I certainly do.

585
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,300
But i can never resist a challenge.

586
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,350
We need more coffee.

587
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,100
Oh,you gotta be kidding me.

588
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,550
I'm having jacobi track down

589
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,120
All of ben cooper's old drug acquaintances.

590
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,980
The unis are canvassing his neighborhood again.

591
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,900
Meanwhile tom is calling everyone who knew

592
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,720
Our lawyer victim tracy welling

593
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,300
Back in the day.

594
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,420
What am i missing?

595
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,550
How about a plan from you?

596
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm throwing everything against the wall.

597
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,040
Not about the case. About tom.

598
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,260
What if you find out you're pregnant?

599
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,150
Oh,i'm not even thinking about that right now.

600
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,770
Okay,maybe just a little.

601
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,660
Would you keep the baby?

602
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,400
Of course.

603
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,380
And when would you tell tom,

604
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,560
Before or after the wedding?

605
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,840
Because if it's before,

606
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,360
You know he'll probably call it off.

607
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,380
I'm not trying to break up tom's engagement.

608
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,380
All right, so you are trying

609
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,200
To improve his relationship with heather

610
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,240
By having sex with him?

611
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,550
We don't even know if i'm pregnant.

612
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,140
So take a damn test.

613
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,150
It's probably nothing, claire.

614
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,570
And until you know for sure,

615
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,190
You get to feel like it could be something.

616
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,470
Right?

617
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,450
I appreciate your help,

618
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,940
But you can't have it both ways.

619
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,700
Is there any chance that i could finish my coffee

620
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,450
Before you have one of your moments?

621
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,460
This is a transcript

622
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,760
Of ben cooper's deposition from 2000

623
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,680
From the missing court archives.

624
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,080
It was left under my door.

625
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,200
Whoever left the file clearly wished to remain anonymous.

626
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,810
Yesterday d.A. Pratt said n cooper gave

627
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,010
An exact description of paul galvan.

628
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,440
These transcripts make it clear

629
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,030
That was a lie.

630
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,270
Excuse us.

631
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,490
Sure.

632
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,080
Now you never heard this from me.

633
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,180
When tracy welling was murdered,

634
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,910
She was having an affair with d.A. Pratt.

635
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,570
And he didn't recuse himself from the trial?

636
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,330
And you knew and you didn't say anything?

637
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,340
At the time, i was convinced

638
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,740
By the evidence against paul galvan,but...

639
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,680
The other night when you told me that

640
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,920
Ben cooper planned to recant his eyewitness testimony,

641
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,760
I... remembered his eay deposition.

642
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,860
Which d.A. Pratt took.

643
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,560
If he suborned perjury from ben cooper then,

644
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,130
He'd want to keep it a secret now.

645
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,770
Pratt had a motive to kill ben cooper.

646
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,380
I do not think that i would go that far. I'm sure you wouldn't

647
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,010
Because that trial made your career.

648
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,790
You moved into tracy welling's old office

649
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,670
After paul galvan was found guilty.

650
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,240
But you can't help me try to undo the case

651
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,300
And hope to remain unaffected.

652
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,190
I never claimed to be unaffected.

653
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,830
The reason i knew about the affair

654
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,840
Was because tracy welling was my friend.

655
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,740
How do you think it feels to sit at her desk

656
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,400
And wonder if we got the wrong guy?

657
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,500
Denise... when the truth comes out--

658
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,220
You won't be telling anyone i was your source on this.

659
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,140
I'm sure your doctor boyfriend would hate to find out

660
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,280
What happened last month...

661
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,380
With hanson on your desk.

662
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,660
Our office walls are very thin.

663
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,570
I know you're a busy man,

664
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,940
So,uh,if you have to head out at any point,

665
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,350
Just,you know...

666
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,890
Anyway,uh,i talked to my people

667
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,360
And explained that there's no reason for them

668
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,560
To go digging into a 7-Year-Old murder trial.

669
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,810
Good.

670
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,880
I'm sorry. Do y'all need the room?

671
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,190
Oh,we won't be long.

672
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,410
You sure? Uh,we can head up to my office.

673
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,500
Don't do it.

674
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,280
He'll start showing you his baseball memorabil.

675
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,340
You'll never be heard from again.

676
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,660
I have no idea what she is talking about

677
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,060
Unless you're a fan of the amazing a's.

678
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,010
Hey,can i get some legal advice to settle a bet? Really not the time,linz.

679
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,860
He doesn't want to lose the bet.

680
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,020
I don't mind. Go ahead.

681
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,770
Okay,i have a witness in a murder case.

682
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,610
Yeah.

683
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,750
This witness saw the murderer,

684
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,830
But he doesn't quite know how to describe the guy.

685
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,720
Is it okay if i jog his memory a little?

686
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,030
You know, suggest specifics to him?

687
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,190
You'd be getting into murky waters there,

688
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,360
Legally speaking. See? That's what i thought.

689
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,350
So if i fed the guy an exact description

690
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,200
And had him repeat it back to me chapter and verse,

691
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,450
That would pretty much be out of the question... yeah.

692
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,970
Legally speaking? But that is not what i said you should do.

693
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,070
I mean,that would be, what do you call it? Witness tampering.

694
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,910
Or--Or is that suborning perjury?

695
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,870
I'm sure the lieutenant would ver suggest

696
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,240
That course of action. Oh,no,no,no,no.

697
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,780
He's not the one that gave me the idea.

698
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,860
I actually was reading a transcript of a deposition

699
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,730
That you took in 2000.

700
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,820
The witness' name was ben cooper.

701
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,150
Thank you for the coffee.

702
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,170
Ben cooper was a witness

703
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,810
In the murder of d.D.A. Tracy welling.

704
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,200
I heard a rumor that you were sleeping with her back then.

705
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,070
In my experience, once you find the lover,

706
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,230
You usually find the killer.

707
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,210
If you have any other questions,

708
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,390
I'll invite my lawyer to join us.

709
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,510
????

710
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,490
How long do we have left?

711
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,560
Six hours.

712
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,490
I wish i could compel a d.N.A. Sample.

713
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,090
A look at the back of his neck would do.

714
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,280
I been thinking about

715
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,700
How our janitor fought with his attacker.

716
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,210
Claire said that ben had the killer's blood

717
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,820
Under four fingernails on each hand,

718
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,430
But not under his thumbnails,

719
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,100
Like he was trying to hold the murderer off.

720
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,550
You know,maybe he got his hands around the guy's neck.

721
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,380
That's where ben would've scratched his attacker.

722
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,460
I know d.A. Prt.

723
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,930
He won't move a muscle till his lawyer gets here.

724
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,070
Well,he got away with murder once.

725
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,290
He thinks he's gonna do it again.

726
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,960
I really should go see claire while we wait.

727
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,140
I'll leave you to it

728
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,050
While i gather affidavits for my court petition.

729
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,860
Wish me luck.

730
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,230
You and me both.

731
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,110
Leave the band-Aid.

732
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,290
Okay,here's what i'm thinking--

733
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,640
Seven years ago,ve the band-Aid.

734
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,330
D.A. Pratt coached ben cooper

735
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,020
And skewed his eyewitness testimony

736
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,350
Because d.A. Pratt was the real killer,

737
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,900
And he was framing paul galvan to take the fall.

738
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,710
Mm-Hmm. Flash forward to the present--

739
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,470
Ben cooper knows

740
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,420
That paul galvan's execution is only a few days away.

741
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,750
He finally develops a conscience

742
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,730
And wants to recant his old testimony.

743
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,870
Maybe he asks d.A. Pratt about it.

744
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,900
Pratt goes to see him, tells him to stay quiet.

745
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,860
They argue,they fight, and ben cooper ends up dead.

746
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,090
Good theory, but hard to prove.

747
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,830
Ben cooper's in the drawer over there,

748
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,200
And d.A. Pratt ain't talking.

749
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,720
All right.

750
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,520
According to your blood test, you are not pregnant.

751
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,680
Oh.

752
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,170
What you are is anemic.

753
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,900
Oh.Oh.

754
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,410
You have a deficiency of red blood cells.

755
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,600
That's why you've been feeling so run-Down.

756
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,590
<i>This is a list of vitamins to get.</i>

757
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,800
Take the vitamins, eat some actual meals...

758
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,650
And you'll be 100% in no time.

759
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,940
Okay. Thanks.

760
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,660
This is good news, right,

761
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,790
Not being pregnant with your ex-Husband's baby?

762
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,870
Yeah. Of--Of course. It's great.

763
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,620
I just...

764
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,220
Thought maybe you and tom would get a do-Over?

765
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,640
<i>No.</i>

766
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,320
Maybe.

767
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,670
I don't know. I just--

768
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,660
I mean,look at me, look at my life.

769
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,600
This is not exactly mother-Of-The-Year material.

770
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,400
You know,maybe...

771
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,010
God's just telling me i already had my chance.

772
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,520
He or she...

773
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,650
Is telling you...

774
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,910
Not right now, not this time.

775
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,010
That's a long,long way from never.

776
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,610
You should see all the protesters.

777
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,990
They,uh, fill the parking lot.

778
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,110
The press is all over this.

779
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,410
You got a lot of people on your side.

780
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,710
That's nice to hear.

781
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,420
You,um, you met my friend jill?

782
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,600
She wrote a legal petition for you.

783
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,640
It's too late for all that.

784
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,220
We have four hours.

785
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,270
I'm just glad we got a chance to say good-Bye.

786
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,950
No,don't talk like that.

787
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,910
Well,it's not gonna change anything

788
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,730
If i talk different.

789
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,490
You got a bad break, getting me as a dad.

790
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,290
That's not true.

791
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,220
Yeah,it is.

792
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,930
I been letting you down your whole life.

793
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,280
And i'm-- I'm sorry i didn't...

794
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,840
I didn't do better for you.

795
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,480
If i can show that d.A. Pratt knew

796
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,910
Ben's testimony was unreliable,

797
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,470
It'll really help my petition to the ninth circuit.

798
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,150
Y$o do ben's testimony was unreliable,

799
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,320
Is tell you how ben used to sell his drugs?

800
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,190
Exactly like you said to the police yesterday.

801
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,920
I have an affidavit form here. All right. Come on in.

802
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,110
Let me,uh,move these out of the way. Headed out of town?

803
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,080
Yeah,vacation. I'm leaving tonight.

804
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,950
You all right? You look a little--

805
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,350
Sorry. It's been a...

806
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,990
<i>Very long day.</i>

807
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,080
Hmm.

808
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,650
All right,come on in.

809
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,430
Come on in the kitchen...

810
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,280
And have a seat,

811
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,200
And i'll get you a drink.

812
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,220
Perfect.

813
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,440
I hate to admit it,

814
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,970
But i need to get my glasses.

815
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,410
<i>You've reached the voice mail of inspector lindsay boxer.</i>

816
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,450
Hey,it's jill.

817
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,740
I'm at henry dow's apartment.

818
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,290
I don't know how long i can stall him.

819
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,750
He's headed out of town. You need to get here.

820
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,140
I think he's our guy.

821
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,300
Here we go.

822
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,600
So i'll notarize your signature

823
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,670
And fax it over to the court.

824
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,060
Hang on.

825
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,870
I need you to walk me through this step-By-Step.

826
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,310
I'm wog,sir.

827
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,840
So formal.

828
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,320
There's your problem. You need to relax.

829
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,490
And i got some questions for you

830
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,930
About this affidavit before i sign anything.

831
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,550
Or i could just forget the whole thing

832
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,320
And get going.

833
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,110
All right.

834
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,400
Ask away.

835
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,820
What's happening to him now?

836
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,410
The priest dips his fingers in oil,

837
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,660
And then he makes the sign of the cross

838
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,080
Over your dad's eyes, ears,lips,hands and feet.

839
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,690
And then he asks god to forgive your dad

840
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,020
For anything he's done or desired in his heart.

841
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,830
And then he asks god to release your dad

842
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,840
From all pain of body or mind.

843
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,730
Well,if he's dead, doesn't that happen anyway?

844
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,350
That's another way to look at it.

845
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,560
Witness tampering,

846
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,740
Suborning perjury, obstruction of justice--

847
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,370
No matter what, your career is over. The question is,

848
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,110
How does the rest of your life play out?

849
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,980
We're here to talk about a deal.

850
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,620
Why isn't there a d.D.A. Present? You have the chance

851
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,900
To do one right thing in the time we have left.

852
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,230
30 minutes and counting. Ben cooper was scared.

853
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,630
He would have never had the guts to come forward on his own.

854
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,510
We think someone sent him to you.

855
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,880
Who gave you ben cooper?

856
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,900
You okay?

857
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,040
No.

858
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,450
A brief statement would be enough.

859
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,740
It's kinda too late for this,isn't it?

860
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,900
What good can i do at this point?

861
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,930
You can tell the truth.

862
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,810
Let me see that form again.

863
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,340
Easy.

864
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,270
Mr. Dow,if you're not gonna sign this,

865
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,610
I really should go. No,i'm gonna sign it. I promised.

866
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,330
You need my help, don't you?

867
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,890
Hey,you need my help, don't you,huh?

868
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,240
Hey,look at me when i'm talking to you! Huh? So glad i caught you at home.

869
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,800
D.A. Pratt said i should talk you.

870
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,410
How'd you get those scratches on your neck,henry?

871
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,430
Henry dow, you are under arrest

872
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,430
For the murders of ben cooper and tracy welling.

873
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,970
Let's wake up a judge. My pleasure.

874
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,780
Confess to both murders now,

875
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,530
And we'll take the death penalty off the table.

876
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,980
Or you could wait till after midnight,

877
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,290
And if paul galvan dies,then you get the death penalty,too.

878
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,200
Thank god.

879
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,400
Arms out,please. And then a few days ago,

880
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,170
You posted an update on your web page

881
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,530
Saying that ben nted to recant.

882
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,600
And henry went to your web page all the time.

883
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,540
That was where he first heard the news about ben.

884
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,510
So it's my fault that ben died.

885
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,680
No.

886
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,980
No,of course it isn't.

887
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,160
And if it makes you feel any better,

888
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,060
You were supposed to be next.

889
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,130
It was henry who set off that gas explosion

890
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,370
In your apartment.

891
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,210
He figured if you were dead,

892
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,820
Then no one else would stop the execution.

893
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,470
And it was henry that raped and killed tracy welling.

894
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,860
She had called him and asked him to come over

895
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,480
And fix her garbage disposal.

896
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,910
He cut his hand in her sink.

897
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,800
When she went to give him a band-Aid,

898
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,630
He tried to kiss her. She fougim,

899
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,200
And he ended up suffocating her.

900
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,340
He panicked and ran.

901
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,110
Your father got caught between henry dow's frame up

902
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,600
And d.A. Pratt's rush to close the case.

903
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,240
You cannot blame yourself for what happened to ben.

904
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,800
He was following his conscience,

905
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,770
The same way that you followed yours.

906
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,190
You saved your fathes life.

907
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,300
Thanks,jamie.

908
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,500
Yeah.

909
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,980
You should thank them,too.

910
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,590
Just doing our thing.

911
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,340
No,please. I want you to keep it... for your story.

912
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,340
Thanks. You're welcome.

913
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,770
You ready?

914
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,020
I think jamie kind of likes you.

915
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,790
You think?

916
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,980
There's a guy at the end of the bar

917
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,340
Holding a rifle.

918
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,340
So we move in,we're yelling. He doesn't back down,

919
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,250
Doesn't even look at us. So i take him from the left,

920
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,580
Couple of other guys go at him from the right,

921
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,610
And we realize the rifle is attached to a video game.

922
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,600
Guy had been playing a game this whole damn time.

923
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,410
We ask him why he didn't give up the gun.

924
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,540
He says,"because i already paid my 25 cents."

925
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,690
The guy says he's just about to hit level ten...

926
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:48,730
