1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,970
so you leaving the beanie baby's
earring tree and the butt master?

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,150
It was late at night.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,590
Couldn't sleep. Infomercials.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,650
That's how I ended
up with a rotato.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,790
You know, this is the good
thing about moving in with a man,

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,850
starting a whole new
grown-up relationship,

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,770
is that you can leave your
embarrassing stuff behind.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,670
It's like leaving your lesser self.

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,830
Starting fresh,
clean slate-I love it.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,020
Just one beanie baby
- the dolphin.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,490
I want you to keep this for me.

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,090
I
- is it somebody's ashes?

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,890
It's a getaway box.

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,830
Get away from what?

15
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,810
You know, living with
luke isn't going so hot.

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,140
I, uh, need to get out in a hurry.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,130
I don't have to
stop and pack stuff.

18
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,400
Ruins the whole dramatic exit.

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,040
So if it doesn't work out with
luke, you're living with me?

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,410
No, I'm just gonna
come pick up the box.

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,720
Maybe I'll spend one night.

22
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,850
Oh, so romantic.

23
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,110
I've never lived
with anybody before.

24
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,860
It makes me nervous.

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,640
You, of all people,
should understand.

26
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,850
Just because my relationship went down in
flames doesn't mean that yours is going to.

27
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,080
And if it does, at least you know there's
no chance luke will end up being your boss.

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,180
Hey, I am totally okay with the
"my ex is now my boss" thing.

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,480
Tom is professional.

30
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,800
I am professional.

31
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,460
It's all very professional.

32
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,760
Seriously.

33
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,930
We are both very okay with this.

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,960
But since you brought up the subject of work
- no, no.

35
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,880
She didn't bring up work.

36
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,030
She brought up tom.

37
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,950
We're taking a work break.

38
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,180
Which means no discussion
of the kiss me not killer.

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,010
I never 100% agreed to that.

40
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,230
What's left to discuss?

41
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,590
We have nothing
- no D.N.A., No fingerprints, no fibers.

42
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,130
We don't even know who
she is, the poor girl.

43
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,730
We're missing something.

44
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,300
No killer is that good.

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,440
They always make a mistake.

46
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,530
Not this one.

47
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,390
Not yet.

48
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,290
Lindsay, I'm not saying you shouldn't do everything
in your power to bring this son of a bitch down.

49
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,360
You should.

50
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,690
We all should, and we will.

51
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,840
But you need to be able to put it
away sometimes, like, for example, now.

52
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,940
Let's just try...

53
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,570
and be in the moment.

54
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,710
You're the one with
the getaway box.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,660
ah, this can't be good.

56
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,290
Boxer.

57
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:05,710
Bernhardt.

58
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,670
Washburn.

59
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,490
We're in the process of disconnecting the
car, so the electricity had to be turn off.

60
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,610
I don't know how much
we can do in the dark.

61
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,510
somebody's working on a generator.

62
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,610
Watch your step.

63
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,730
I wish I had a
getaway box for this.

64
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,850
3 dead, 6 gunshot wounds
from what appear to be a. 38

65
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,770
My guess is one killer with
good aim and coordination.

66
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,110
"noreen davenport.

67
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,060
" Looks like she was running
for the door, but her heel broke.

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,000
She might have made it.

69
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,590
Never run in jimmy choos.

70
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,400
She's still holding her blackberry,
but her wallet's stripped of cash,

71
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,570
and the tan lines say she
was wearing a lot of jewelry.

72
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,610
Oh, look.

73
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,820
A sock from before
socks were invented.

74
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,680
Hey, put this in evidence with the four
condoms and the calcified raisinets.

75
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,060
Tell me that leg
was already missing.

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,270
I think he left it in iraq.

77
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,220
"Carlos fuentes, "
from his dog tags.

78
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,940
He fought hard here, too.

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,980
The shot through his
hand is a defensive wound.

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,060
And then there's rodney boyce.

81
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,880
Never knew what hit him.

82
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,120
"go green" t-shirt, hemp bag.

83
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,105
Kid was fighting
for a perfect world.

84
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:24,850
He's there now.

85
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,070
All right. By the size of that boot
print, safe bet is our killer is a man.

86
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,470
What are you
thinkin', spree killer?

87
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,990
No, a spree killer doesn't
boost things from a crime scene.

88
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,990
This guy's organized and precise.

89
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,470
The boot print is
all he left behind?

90
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,340
That and the forensics from the last
50 people who passed through the car.

91
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,110
all right, subway is
shut down indefinitely.

92
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,220
Mayor's on his way.

93
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,080
I got a press conference.
What do you got?

94
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,100
We don't even know yet if
there was an intended target.

95
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,290
The victims all seem unrelated.

96
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,410
Get unis to search the other subway cars for
a rder weapon, trash receptacles, anything.

97
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,350
Jacobi's on it.

98
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,630
We have to disconnect this
subway car, move it downtown.

99
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,400
It's in the works.

100
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,240
What's claire got?

101
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,980
Well, what doesn't she have?

102
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,260
There's too much information.

103
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,810
All right.

104
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,470
the politics on this
are gonna be endless.

105
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,060
I want you to find me when
you have anything at all.

106
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,510
Of course.

107
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,970
I can't talk about
the case, but it's big.

108
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,070
I don't know when
I'll be home again.

109
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,900
Honey, let me, uh,
let me call you back.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,590
Hey, what are you doing down here?
- I'm with lindsay boxer.

111
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,570
She's expecting me.

112
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,280
Excuse me, where do
you think you're going?

113
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,720
Hey, jill, it's great to see you.

114
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,570
What a circus. Huh?
- Yeah, how did you get by the uniforms?

115
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,890
I told them I have a
relationship with lindsay.

116
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,180
You have a very loose
definition of a "relationship.

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,930
" Not according to
my last boyfriend.

118
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,030
Hey, you have to leave.

119
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,220
No, this happened very quickly,
so I didn't have time to alert you.

120
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,280
I am on the crime desk
at the "register" now.

121
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,020
You should be behind
that desk as we speak.

122
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,630
You'll get all the details at the press
conference along with everybody else.

123
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,330
Jill, I need to talk to you.

124
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,160
Denise kwon.

125
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,580
Cindy thomas from the "register.

126
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,140
" As criminal division chief, how
does your office plan to proceed?

127
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,040
A reporter on the crime scene?

128
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,430
I am a crime reporter.

129
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,530
She was just leaving.

130
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Look, sorry to throw you intohe deep end here,
but you were the only one to answer the phone.

131
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,220
Obviously I'm gonna
reassign this in the morning.

132
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,210
Just take good notes.

133
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,310
Why would you reassign it?

134
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,190
You've never handled
anything of this magnitude.

135
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,340
I have a 98% conviction rate on
every case where I was lead counsel.

136
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,730
If you take me off of this, I'll
have to challenge that decision.

137
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,410
From hello to over my head, and
it feels like I just got here.

138
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,510
Okay. I'll give you a shot...

139
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,350
but you might wish I hadn'T.

140
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,310
All right. Okay, bring her in, art.

141
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,540
just need you to confirm
this is rodney boyce.

142
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,970
My god.

143
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,070
Yes, it's rodney.

144
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,040
He's a, uh, temp worker, but we
were gonna offer him a position.

145
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,910
So much promise, thakid.

146
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,270
First in, last out every day.

147
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,040
We've been unable
to locate his family.

148
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,120
The only I. D. He had on
him was his employee card.

149
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,260
I think he was from wisconsin.

150
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,810
I'll check my records.

151
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,130
Okay.

152
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,630
What, uh, was the nature of
his work at lazar software?

153
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,540
Whatever needed doing.

154
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,490
He was there to learn.

155
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,440
About?

156
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,700
Oh, small business- in my case,
software- inventory and billing systems.

157
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,000
I could tell you more, but it
usually clears dinner parties.

158
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,460
If you could get us the personal information,
we'll handle notifying the family.

159
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Thank you for coming in, mr. Lazar.

160
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,250
So I just subpoenaed the personnel
records of 250 bart employees.

161
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,880
If any one of them so much as threatened
a subway rat, I'll know about it.

162
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,145
Where are you guys?

163
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:49,680
Buried, but I can tell you that the shoe
print is a rubber outsoled army boot,

164
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,440
which doesn't exactly
narrow the field.

165
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,300
I also pulled a court
record on carlos fuentes.

166
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,270
Nothing much. Some gang
activity in his youth.

167
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,150
Um, he chose army over
prison when he got busted.

168
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,410
Where he performed well
and got glowing reports.

169
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,610
I spoke to his company commander.

170
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,840
I have yet to notify
his next of kin.

171
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,860
god, it's so sad.

172
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,680
He survived gangs in hisouth,
survived I. E. D. S over there-

173
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,170
talk about life's not fair.

174
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,480
What about noreen davenport?

175
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,030
Some really good work on her face, easily 50,
000 bucks worth, and that's just above the neck,

176
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,250
and the blouse costs as much
as the extension on my house.

177
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,920
So why is she riding the train?

178
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,210
Who I. D. 'Ed the body?

179
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,670
Her sister, who mentioned an ex-husband,
and it did not sound like an amicable split.

180
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,960
It's worth checking out.

181
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,910
And speaking of ex-husbands, tom is hoping that
we can eliminate the spree killer idea A. S. A. P.

182
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,880
Is there any way that you
can help me out with that?

183
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,860
Well, sure, if you don't need, I
don't know, facts to back it up.

184
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,400
The bart is up and running, but
people are too scared to ride it.

185
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,160
The city is shutting
down from gridlock.

186
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,610
Department of transportation
is having a meltdown.

187
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,020
Well, I can't give
you what I don't have.

188
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,930
I know.

189
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,030
Okay, thanks.

190
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,720
Come on, where'd
you get the address?

191
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,000
Tom has a snitch in los
santos, carlos' former gang.

192
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,480
Say fuentes has a brother
living here-alberto.

193
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,500
He's the only next
of kin I could find.

194
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,280
And don't look at me like I'm
cheating on you 'cause I talk to tom.

195
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,010
Well, have I not said
that tom and I are good?

196
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,170
Your turn.

197
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,650
Oh, god, I hate notifying family.

198
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,810
I don't even deal
well with my own pain.

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,350
Mr. Fuentes?

200
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,320
Anybody home?

201
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Let's check around back.

202
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,430
A canine welcoming committee.

203
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,810
door's open.

204
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,720
Mr. Fuentes?

205
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,150
San francisco police department.

206
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,250
Can we talk to you?

207
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,930
get down!

208
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,370
there he goes.

209
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,720
stop!

210
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,490
Police!

211
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,150
Dinero cuando no hay de que reírse.

212
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,090
stay down!

213
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,215
Stay down!

214
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:09,315
You don't run from the police!

215
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,900
Don't shoot! Don't
shoot! Don't shoot me.

216
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,140
I'm guessing he already
knows about his brother.

217
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,620
Lindsay, the point is, why would he kill
his brother, not to mention two strangers?

218
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,170
Carlos left los santos three years
ago, but you were still active.

219
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,770
what's she getting at?

220
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,640
we know what happens when
someone leaves a gang.

221
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,520
They're marked.

222
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,440
I've been to a few
of those funerals.

223
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,470
I know you're still mad about the gun thing
- the gun thing?

224
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,090
You me where my partner and I
were almost killed, that gun thing?

225
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,200
Alberto is not your subway killer.

226
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,440
Did you not tell everyone in los santos
that your brother was dead to you?

227
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,760
Look, they hated
him for getting out.

228
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,950
Me, too, maybe.

229
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,340
But it was righteous what
he did, going to iraq-

230
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,950
kicking ass over there,
coming back all busted up.

231
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,640
You don't mess with
a guy like that.

232
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,900
He's still booked for
attempted murder...

233
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,220
for "the gun thing.

234
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,940
" Don't worry, alberto.

235
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
I'll be your lawyer.

236
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,660
hey.

237
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,120
Take it.

238
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,220
It's for you.

239
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,370
okay, don't attack. It's me.

240
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
I need another reason.

241
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,850
Information in the subway killings.

242
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,900
Look, I figure-I figure we
could work out a quid pro quo.

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,850
I give you this.

244
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,950
You give me, uh...

245
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,410
uh, you know, whatever.

246
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,510
I'm open.

247
00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:00,350
Okay, listen, my editor is screaming at me to write
a 2-page spread entitled "spree killer on the rampage.

248
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,360
" It's not a spree killer.

249
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,510
Hey, you know that for a fact?

250
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,210
My gut does.

251
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,020
See, the thing is, "spree
killer" sells papers.

252
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,140
If, uh, if you were to give me something
else, I could help with the spin.

253
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,680
Rodney boyce, the temp at lazar
software, had a-had a police record.

254
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,730
I didn't get a hit on him.

255
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,260
Canada.

256
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,540
He was arrested for
assault on a police officer.

257
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,740
Well, okay, technically, a mountie.

258
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,430
What was he doing in canada?

259
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,110
Fun place to go when you're
in trouble with the law?

260
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,210
Plus the beer.

261
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,200
Anyway, it's a lead.

262
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,010
It's a bribe.

263
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,620
You're gonna miss me
when I stop coming around.

264
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,810
Give me a chance to find out.

265
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,720
Om) this is obviously top priority.

266
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,340
We've got 15 additional officers in the bart,
and I've got my best inspectors working on it.

267
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,750
What's going on?

268
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,540
I think tom's getting a
taste of being lieutenant.

269
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,180
The chief and the mayor,
not just their people.

270
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,380
Now do you want tom's job?

271
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,910
I don't even want mine.

272
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,120
I just spent hours with the surveillance
tapes from the bart atform and got nothing.

273
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,840
How's it going with
the fuentes kid?

274
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,440
I don't like him as the killer.

275
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,520
He emptied a clip on us
and didn't hit a thing.

276
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,090
I like that in a shooter.

277
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,970
Well, I finally pulled all the info
from noreen davenport's blackberry.

278
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,760
The woman could talk
a lot about nothing.

279
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,670
But this transcript is good.

280
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,750
It's to her ex-husband,
threatening to sue him

281
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,250
for having the 7 series towed from her
driveway the night before the murders.

282
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,960
That explains why
she was on the train.

283
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,790
What are his responses?

284
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,890
Uh, I don't know.

285
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
He, um, tends to ignore her.

286
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
I know how that feels.

287
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,470
You busy?

288
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,620
Overwhelmed.

289
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,940
What can I do for you?

290
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,820
Well, I was just in the building, you know, trying to get
the fuentes kid off on a bogus attempted murder charge.

291
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,670
And you want me to talk to lindsay?

292
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,110
Well, yeah.

293
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,340
But I, uh, also think
the two of us should talk.

294
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,330
hanson, be a guy.

295
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,430
The guy never wants to talk.

296
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,290
Look, I know your situation.

297
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,870
I don't expect you to dump
your E. R. Doc over me.

298
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,510
But if you were to dump him for some other reason,
like he's a workaholic with a god complex...

299
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,310
hanson.

300
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,410
Then come find me.

301
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,310
Listen, we're not gonna deal on the
fuentes kid, so you can just forget it.

302
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,150
Now if I were you, I'd leave, unless you want
to stick around to meet denise's dark side.

303
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,050
Trust me, I've seen it.

304
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,560
I can't believe that she
called the cops on me.

305
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,920
I mean, I-I admit I shouldn't have towed
her car, but noreen keeps stonewalling.

306
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,250
mr. Davenport, that's not
why we called you to come in.

307
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,100
Noreen was killed.

308
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,170
She was one of the victims
in the sway murders.

309
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Wh
- I'm sorry.

310
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,550
Oh, dear god.

311
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,350
I did this to her.

312
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,150
I didn't mean that.

313
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,210
I...

314
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,890
she was on the subway because
of me, because of the car.

315
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,220
Mr. Davenport, the language of her e
- mails to you is, uh, pretty extreme.

316
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,140
Yeah, well, that's
- that was noreen's way of keeping a relationship going.

317
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,410
She couldn't accept
that I moved on.

318
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,760
When you say moved on,
you mean you're remarried?

319
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,290
Uh, yes, almost a year.

320
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,000
So you have no strong
feelings for your ex-wife?

321
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,200
Am I a suspect?

322
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,840
Understanding the victim
helps us understand the crime.

323
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,490
No, I didn't have any
strong feelings towards her.

324
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,190
But I didn't want her to die.

325
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,820
Hey!

326
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,450
bart shootings,
oakland commuters...

327
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,240
hey.

328
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,590
Didn't know if you'd be home.

329
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,510
Uh, yeah, tag teaming.

330
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,140
Marin county sent some
people to help out.

331
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,270
Where are the kids?

332
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,170
Homework, upstairs.

333
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,580
Has anybody eaten?

334
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
There was talk of pizza.

335
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,130
Have a bad day today?

336
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,800
You don't want to know.

337
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,030
Is that why you're not
at physical therapy?

338
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,560
I can't predict when I'm
gonna feel like this, claire.

339
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,950
And even when you do feel this
way, you have to keep going.

340
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,700
The doctor said there was-

341
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,680
look, this whole "one foot in front of the other"
thing is easier for some people than others.

342
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,610
You're telling me?

343
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,990
I've been staring at the
body of a disabled vet

344
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,690
who fought like an olympic
warrior to save his own life.

345
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
And you can't make dinner.

346
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,260
hey, can it wait?

347
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,450
We got the murder weapon.

348
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,960
Unis found it in a storm drain four
blocks away from the bart station.

349
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
I'm on my way.

350
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,830
yes.

351
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,770
So-yeah, as soon as we confirm it is not a
spree killer, I will give you a call back.

352
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,400
Yes, sir.

353
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,400
No, sir, I-hello?

354
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Damn!

355
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,670
Grumpy mayor?

356
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,160
Turns out that man has a silver platter, which
he just handed me with my ass all over it.

357
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,150
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,050
Part of the job.

359
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,520
Can't take it personal... ly.

360
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,970
Is that what I think it is?

361
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,460
Do you think it's
the murder weapon?

362
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,350
I do.

363
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,450
Then it is what you think it is.

364
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,360
You know what this means?

365
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,080
That you can call the mayor back.

366
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,180
And give him what?

367
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,730
Good news.

368
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,430
Very...

369
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,770
good news.

370
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,270
Come on. Come on.

371
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,040
We are gonna solve this case.

372
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,980
The city is gonna
get back to normal.

373
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,690
Things are lookin' up.

374
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,800
Come on. Give me a little shimmy.

375
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
This is so not professional.

376
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,450
is that the mayor again?

377
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,550
It's the chief...

378
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,430
calling to make threats on my
job if we don't solve this case.

379
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,880
We are gonna solve
this case, right?

380
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,430
I'm workin' on it.

381
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,820
hello, chief.

382
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,830
Uh, no.

383
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,340
Actually, we have
found the murder weapon.

384
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,710
Yes, sir.

385
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,340
Claire says it's a match
on all three victims.

386
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,800
The bad news is it's
unregistered and untraceable.

387
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,180
Did you go home last night?

388
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,380
No. Can you tell?

389
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,510
You look fine.

390
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,310
The good news is I spent the night
running all the stores that sell army boots

391
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,530
like the ones our
killer was wearing.

392
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,920
I found one that's been busted twice in
the past year for selling illegal firearms.

393
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,530
Seriously, am I, like, haggard?

394
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,860
Is it dark circles, what?

395
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,100
You're fine. It's a solid lead.

396
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,430
Have you told tom?

397
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,890
Well, I was on my way.

398
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,820
That should keep the mayor off
his back for at least an hour.

399
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,000
How's that going?

400
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,560
It's, uh, still professional?

401
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,130
Oh, yeah. He's moved
on. I've moved on.

402
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,230
It's-it's all good.

403
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:24,920
But it's clean, though.

404
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,810
Yeah, this is
- hi.

405
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,790
Oh, do you need tom?

406
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,750
No.

407
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,960
Not at all.

408
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,210
Uh, lindsay, this is heather.

409
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,260
Heather, lindsay.

410
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,570
Well, I assumed.

411
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,560
It's nice to finally meet you.

412
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,060
Yeah, you, too.

413
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,000
She brought me a fresh shirt
since I worked all night.

414
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,310
It's
- it's a beautiful shirt.

415
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,270
Italian.

416
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,010
She's trying to upgrade me.

417
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,640
Just your clothes.

418
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
Just...

419
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
Uh, did you need me?

420
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,210
It can wait.

421
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,580
Nice to meet you.

422
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,590
Okay.

423
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,690
I'll talk to you later.

424
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,960
Thank god I've moved on.

425
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,370
Because if I hadn't moved on,
that would've been awkward...

426
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,470
seeing him...

427
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,660
half-naked...

428
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,550
in front of his fiancéE...

429
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,930
heather.

430
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,140
Do you need me for
this conversation?

431
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,430
Surplus store.

432
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:21,930
You comin'?

433
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,860
Yeah.

434
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Were you up all night?

435
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,140
I'll meet you the motor pool.

436
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
I don't sell gunS.

437
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,465
Not legally, anyway.

438
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:40,480
Listen, you sell guns,
you don't sell guns.

439
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,530
We're just trying
to find the murderer.

440
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,760
Long as you're not
him, you're good.

441
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,830
Really?

442
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,440
'Cause one more citation,
A. T. F. Shuts my store down.

443
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,390
I will not call A. T. F. On you.

444
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,490
I promise.

445
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,270
Is that the marine corps?

446
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,490
You were in the marines,
weren't you, jacobi?

447
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,200
Yeah, um, trained in parris island.

448
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,050
Yeah?

449
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,170
Me, too.

450
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,600
Well, different decade, though.

451
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,170
You deployed to nam?

452
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,920
You're hilarious.

453
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,880
One of the victims was a vet.

454
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,530
He lost his leg in iraq only to die at
the hands of some lunatic on the subway.

455
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,760
It's not exactly a
hero's end, right?

456
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,530
You really not gonna turn me in?

457
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,730
Biker guy came in looking
for a. 38 Nice enough guy.

458
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,360
Kind of a camo freak.

459
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,410
He said he needed
it for protection.

460
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,060
He calls himself "mad dog.

461
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,520
" Biker named mad dog, yeah.

462
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,710
That narrows it down, yes.

463
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,810
Mad dog vinny.

464
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,520
That's all I know.

465
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,320
You got an address?

466
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,430
Tenderloin district...

467
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,730
maybe.

468
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,190
You were good.

469
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,920
Look, who would ever
buy me as a marine?

470
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,830
I have a titanium hip, and i
was a kid when the war ended.

471
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,930
I was.

472
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,800
You ll A. T. F. On that guy?

473
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
Well, you can'T. You promised.

474
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,140
Hey!

475
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
This is where the
murder weapon came from?

476
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,980
You know, there is a fine line
between investigating and stalking.

477
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,910
Hey, look, this isn't
just a police matter.

478
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,590
You're aountable to the public
whose tax dollars pay your salary.

479
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,200
Now you can keep stonewalling me, or
we can find a way to help each other.

480
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,550
Off the record?

481
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,440
Of course.

482
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,500
A biker named mad dog, and if I see that
in print, you'll be held accountable to me,

483
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,840
which is much worse than being
held accountable to the public.

484
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,560
You won't be sorry.

485
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,310
We're going on day
three with nothing, jill.

486
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,530
Tell me why I shouldn't
pull this from your desk.

487
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,380
Because you'd have
to start from scratch.

488
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,740
Because I have a far better working relationship
with the detectives than anyone in our office.

489
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,880
And yet I still have
nothing to report to my boss,

490
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,480
who in turn has nothing to
report to his boss the mayor,

491
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,430
who in turn has nothing to report
to the people who elected him.

492
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,210
I get the whole chain of command.

493
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,310
Then act like it.

494
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,890
Girl talk?

495
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,330
here's your warrant.

496
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,620
This better be the right mad dog.

497
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,590
Let's leave it at that.

498
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,060
Listen, this guy's been hauled
in multiple times for possession.

499
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,970
The store owner I.D.'Ed his
mug shot off of a six-pack,

500
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,480
oddly enough, right before
A.T.F.Raided his shop.

501
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,940
I met heather.

502
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,990
You did? When?

503
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,290
In tom's officE.

504
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,790
She brought him a shirt.

505
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,810
He was half undressed.

506
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,080
And here's the wrd thing
- walked in, and he didn't even flinch.

507
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,960
Why would he flinch?

508
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,390
You've both moved on.

509
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,530
I would still expect a flinch.

510
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,230
Go get mad dog, then we'll talk
about heather. I want details

511
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,530
Smells like vinny's
having meth for lunch.

512
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,520
Vincent morelo. San
francisco police.

513
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,170
Mr. Morelo?

514
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,670
Vincent?

515
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,460
Oh, this doesn't look good.

516
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Jacobi.

517
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,040
mad dog's been on a drug binge.

518
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,550
Damn it, he's O. D. 'Ing.

519
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,650
Call it in.

520
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:15,910
Come on, vinny.

521
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,040
You don't die without
giving me some answers.

522
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:29,990
What do we got?

523
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,600
30-year-old male,
meth overdose.

524
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,030
He's in a lethal arrhythmia,
hypertensive and diaphoretic.

525
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,800
All right, let's check breath
sounds, get a monitor in him.

526
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,300
All right?

527
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,150
Draw my labs.

528
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,660
I'll take it from here.

529
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,130
Okay. I-I want this guy,
luke, alivand talking.

530
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,930
That's the bart killer.

531
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,880
Yeah, okay, well, linz, right
now, he's my patient, okay?

532
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,450
So just go wait in the chairs.

533
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,300
Did you get anything out
of him in the ambulance?

534
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,160
No, he never regained
consciousness.

535
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,970
You both need to leave.

536
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,200
We both need to leave.

537
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,580
Whose side are you on?

538
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,600
Let me get back to you on that one.

539
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,340
This is when I call denise
to tell her we got our killer,

540
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,200
and she manages to
take all the credit.

541
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,230
Remember when I wanted
to buy a motorcycle?

542
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,670
Your subconscious
post-divorce death wish?

543
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,280
The good ones are expensive,
like 30 grand easy.

544
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,370
Mad dog had a brand-new bike
parked outside his trailer.

545
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,160
The thing had to cost way
more than what he would

546
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,080
have made pawning the stuff
he stole from the crime scene.

547
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,390
Meth heads aren't
known for their savings.

548
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,140
He must have had a windfall.

549
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,770
Somebody paid him to
commit those murders.

550
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,870
Yeah, one of them, anyway.

551
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:27,790
The othetwo he killed just to spin us
sideways, or just because they were there.

552
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,050
If mad dog dies, we may never know
who he was paid to kill or why.

553
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,440
Mad dog's in capable
hands, believe me.

554
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,450
Yeah, luke is pretty
amazing in action.

555
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,200
'S kind of sexy, actually...

556
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,220
except for the part when he
kept telling me to get lost.

557
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,030
Nah, that was kind of sexy, too.

558
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
yeah, he's great.

559
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,720
You say "he's great" the way
people say green tea is great.

560
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,190
Like we're supposed to drink it,
but we really want to drink coffee.

561
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,540
Oh, you heard all
of that in my voice?

562
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,900
Is there someone else?

563
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,350
Someone a little more coffee?

564
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,880
This is not about
green tea or coffee.

565
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,030
I just haven't told him I
sleep with a wave machine.

566
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,990
You do know cops are
like human lie detectors?

567
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,620
it happened once.

568
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,180
It's not an affair.

569
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,890
Who?

570
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm not gonna tell you who.

571
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
You're so telling me who.

572
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
Hanson.

573
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,820
Hanson north?

574
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,960
Again?

575
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,500
Are you nuts?

576
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,330
Luke is crazy about you.

577
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,510
He's a crusading
doctor that saves lives.

578
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,460
Hanson is an arrogant P. D. Who
lives to make our lives difficult.

579
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,970
Yeah, I heard you the last two
times I got involved with him.

580
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,520
And what happened to starting
over and a clean slate?

581
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,390
That's what I'm doing.

582
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,490
Clean slate starts now.

583
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
No wonder denise hates you.

584
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,400
What?

585
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,280
You know about her and hanson?

586
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,310
You don't know
about her and hanson?

587
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,160
They got together the
first time you split.

588
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,980
Wait, or was it the second?

589
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,200
Do you know how I
heard about mad dog?

590
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,760
On the scanner, with every
other cop and criminal hobbyist.

591
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,470
I'm sorry.

592
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,980
I got distracted by our suspect
almost dying on the way here.

593
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,630
You get a solid lead on the killer,

594
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,980
and it just doesn't come up
when we're passing in the hall?

595
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,800
Is this anger I'm
detecting in your voice?

596
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,700
You didn't tell me about
this guy on purpose.

597
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,200
You're withholding-

598
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,180
I didn't tell you because when I
walked into your office to tell you,

599
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,950
you and heather were playing dress
up, and it didn't seem apppriate.

600
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,450
Is mad dog our guy or not?

601
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,440
He pulled the trigger.

602
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,120
All right.

603
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,230
I am gonna call denise and
schedule a press conference.

604
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,290
But someone paid him to do it.

605
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,050
You know that?

606
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,960
Call it a strong hunch.

607
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,340
and if I'm right, a press conference will
send that somebody straight into hiding.

608
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,840
Just...

609
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,940
trust me.

610
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,800
If you can't trust her, trust me.

611
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,720
I didn't withhold anything.

612
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,900
no press conference, tom.

613
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,960
So this is it.

614
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,990
The inner sanctum.

615
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,530
can't believe I got in here.

616
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,650
Inner sanctum? Hardly.

617
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,570
They're just hiding
from their bosses.

618
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:17,030
Not hiding, just seeking shelter
from their constant interference.

619
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,560
Plus we'd rather
not be seen with you.

620
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,970
I had unis in pawn shops all day.

621
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,610
How is it they found nothing, but you
managed to find rodney boyce's laptop?

622
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,670
Uh, unis were showing the
pawn shop guys his mug shot.

623
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:35,360
I, on the other hand,
had this-candid mad dog.

624
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,500
I, uh, figured out that mad dog
vinny was vincent morelo eventually.

625
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,430
What did you do, go to a biker bar?

626
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,840
I went to seven.

627
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,310
They're a little scary.

628
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,065
Oh, but the people are surprisingly helpful
once they figure out that you're not a cop.

629
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:52,760
Bikers are not fond of cops.

630
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,570
Anyway, one of the bars
had that on the wall.

631
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,980
Martha, cut it out.

632
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,250
Little defensive about
the dog's affections?

633
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,420
At least I'm not
playing with other dogs.

634
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,040
don't make a person
sorry she confided.

635
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,830
clean slate, got it.

636
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,660
Just don't use up all
your chances like I did.

637
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,460
Rodney sure wrote a
bunch of boring e-mails.

638
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,940
He also watched a lot of youtube.

639
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,240
Wait, wait. Open that one right there
-"discrepancies.

640
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,770
" He named a file "discrepancies.

641
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,870
" Not very subtle.

642
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,260
It's a full rundown on the
books of lazar software.

643
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,140
Pretty detailed for a temp.

644
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,780
Projected earnings of the last year compared to some other figures
- I'm guessing his.

645
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,410
So the numbers weren't
adding up for him.

646
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,320
He was going to somebody
with the information.

647
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,420
Oh, he already went, and whoever he
went to didn't like what rodney found.

648
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,610
Enter mad dog.

649
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,020
Bet he was supposed to destroy the
computer after he killed rodney.

650
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,590
Never hire a meth head to do
a professional hit man's job.

651
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,370
I knew that the
laptop was important.

652
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,570
Otherwise why would mad dog take it and
leave behind a blackberry and an ipod?

653
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,370
I just suddenly became very
interested in digital software.

654
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,250
Yeah.

655
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,860
You know what?

656
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,480
Let's, uh, let's get
down there and, um...

657
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,900
right.

658
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'll hang.

659
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,190
Catch you on the "b" side.

660
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,300
inspectors.

661
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,050
Talk us through this, mrlazar.

662
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,750
Well, let's see.

663
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,850
It's, uh...

664
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,120
my company's private
financial records.

665
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,180
How did you get these?

666
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,090
Rodney boyce's computer.

667
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,840
Look closer.

668
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,860
Rodney?

669
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,180
I don't understand.

670
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,740
You never mentioned that your company
was going public in a few months.

671
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,560
It's a big deal for
a family company-

672
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,270
big enough you started cooking the
books so you could get a bigger payday?

673
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,590
No. I've always emphasized the fact tt our
numbers have to be aboveboard, especially now.

674
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,330
Emphasized it to who?

675
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,380
My son artie.

676
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm grooming him to take over.

677
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,210
He runs our accounting team.

678
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,640
He would never
- is this him?

679
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,430
Yeah.

680
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,870
bit of a weekend warrior.

681
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,410
You know, I think a little talk with
artie would help us figure all of this out.

682
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,970
Artie jr. 'S on his way in.

683
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,000
Chips, candy, cupcakes.

684
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,810
Is an apple too much to ask for?

685
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:21,320
Aside from driving his truly obnoxious motorcycle
55 through a school zone, his record is clean.

686
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,820
And here I was hoping he had a
prior for solicitation of murder.

687
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Get the dark chocolate.
It's healthy...

688
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,010
You realize we've
got jack on this guy.

689
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,290
Well, that's why god
invented lying to suspects.

690
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,380
That's also why I asked tom, no
press conferences about mad dog

691
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,940
till after we've smoked out whoever hired
him to kill rodney boyce, I. E., Artie jr.

692
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,800
It'll work.

693
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,450
You always say that.

694
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,460
And I'm always right...

695
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,280
usually.

696
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,180
More often than not.

697
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,720
Inspectors!

698
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,880
Hey, I need to talk to you.

699
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,950
Come on.

700
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,140
Please?

701
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
I'll pass.

702
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,930
I told your lawyer no deal.

703
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,230
I just want to know what's going
on with my brother's killer.

704
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:09,400
I can't comment on an
ongoing investigation.

705
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,110
That's bull.

706
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,380
That's protocol.

707
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,950
Hey, cho just called.

708
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,550
Artie jr. Has entered the building.

709
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,650
When there's news to be had,
I'll make sure you have it.

710
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,750
Best I can do.

711
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,930
Thank you for coming in, mr. Lazar.

712
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,650
Artie, please.

713
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,930
We're happy to do anything we
can to help find rodney's killer.

714
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Well, the thing is...

715
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,300
I think I'm looking right at him.

716
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,750
I told you, artie was
in portland on business

717
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,930
when the murders happened.
- Dad, dad, it's okay.

718
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,380
Anyway, didn't you guys
already catch the subway killer?

719
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:53,310
Rodney came to you with his concerns about the
discrepancies in your company's finaes, didn't he?

720
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:53,960
Sure, he came to me.

721
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,420
We talked throh it.

722
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,720
He knew everything was aboveboard.

723
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,130
You know, the only problem
with what you're saying is that

724
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,520
we got a guy who says you
hired him to murder rodney.

725
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,610
That's ridiculous.

726
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,490
What? Let me guess. Mad dog.

727
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,620
I heard the name on the
radio on the way over here.

728
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,110
Mad dog vincent something, I think.

729
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,620
Right?

730
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,430
Big press conference?

731
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,000
Subway killer apprehended?

732
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,080
They said he O. D. 'Ed, though.

733
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,180
Sounds like he won't make it.

734
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,050
You can't trust
everything you hear.

735
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,940
Either way, I think we'll head out.

736
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,350
You all set, dad?

737
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,450
Stay close to home, artie.

738
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,090
Hey!

739
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,990
Is that him?

740
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,680
You get the guy who
killed my brother?

741
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,230
Hey, I know it was you who
killed my big brother, man!

742
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,390
When I get out,
I'm-a get you, man!

743
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,140
I swear, I'm-a get you!

744
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,710
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Just
take it easy. We're...

745
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,120
lindsay?

746
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,820
What my partner is trying to say,
if she weren't too furious to speak,

747
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,430
is that your little press conference just got
artie lazar off the hook for rodney boyce's murder.

748
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:10,930
How could you?

749
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,430
I didn'T.

750
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,000
Denise was just filling me in.

751
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,370
The call came from on high.

752
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,910
Don't you dare defend this.

753
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,900
Artie heard it all on the radio.

754
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,370
He knew mad dog was never going to
be able to say a word against him.

755
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,870
It's very simple.

756
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,080
The mayor heard through the grapevine
that we had somebody in custody.

757
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,110
He didn't want to sit
on it one mite longer.

758
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,530
I really didn't have a choice.

759
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,530
You always have a choice.

760
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,910
I'm sure you'll make
the case another way.

761
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:36,980
So you can screw it up again.

762
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,810
That is enough, inspector.

763
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,630
Pardon me?

764
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,040
You cannot, no matter how
personally aggrieved you feel,

765
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,210
yell at the deputy district
attorney in the middle of my bullpen.

766
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,150
Your bullpen?

767
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,000
You heard me.

768
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Uh, e-excuse me.

769
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,180
I was told that you have
noreen's personal effects.

770
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,300
Yeah.

771
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,140
I'm sorry.

772
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Uh, yes.

773
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,250
Here you go.

774
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Thank you.

775
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,260
We will get him someday.

776
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Someday is not good enough.

777
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,860
It's not a good plan

778
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,940
Who sprayed my partner
and I with bullets.

779
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,600
You said yourself he
was a terrible shot.

780
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,940
That was luck.

781
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,740
His intentions were clear.

782
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,010
Look, his brother was getting
his life back together.

783
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,160
This kid could turn it around, too.

784
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,150
Didn't you give me a speech
about using up your chances?

785
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,380
It wasn't a speech.

786
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,090
It was more of a quip.

787
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,300
Come on.

788
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,650
We can still get some
good out of this day.

789
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,820
If I see that kid in here for so much as a
parking ticket, you're both gonna regret it.

790
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
I'll make that clear.

791
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,340
This is your lucky day, alberto.

792
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,100
I caught inspector boxer
in a warm and fuzzy mood.

793
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,400
So...

794
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,940
does that mean I get to go?

795
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
There are conditions.

796
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:23,010
First, you're finished with the gang,
and believe me, we will follow up on that.

797
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,830
Ll, he's gonna need protection.

798
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,920
We can do that.

799
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,610
What do you say?

800
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,710
Make your brother proud.

801
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,860
Artie...

802
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,730
remember me?

803
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,400
What you doin', homes, huh?

804
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
I told you we'd meet again.

805
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,190
Look, I have, uh, credit cards.

806
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,290
I have A. T. M. Cards,
little bit of cash.

807
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,610
What do you guys want?

808
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,460
I want mi hermano back alive.

809
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,640
I don't know what those cops told
you. I didn't even know your brother!

810
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,740
Carlos got his leg blown off fighting for
everybody's right to ride around in big cars

811
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,720
and work in fancy offices.

812
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,740
He finally gets out of that
hole and dies because of you.

813
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,280
This is all I got left.

814
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,260
Look, I didn't mean to do anything
- you didn't mean what?

815
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,890
I didn't mean to do anything!

816
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,990
It was just supposed
to be the one guy!

817
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,810
That was the deal, I swear!

818
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,710
That guy went nuts!

819
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,690
He went nuts-I just- I
wanted rodney boyce dead!

820
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,570
That was the deal.
- That's it. Let's go!

821
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,610
That was the gig!

822
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,860
I'm telling you the truth!

823
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,700
Look, your brother wasn't my fault.

824
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,900
Please believe me.

825
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,310
Artie lazar, you are under arrest for the murders
of carlos fuentes, rodney boyce and noreen davenport.

826
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,150
thank you, officers.

827
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,670
You have the right
to remain silent.

828
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,790
Anything you say can and will... Be used
against you in a court of law... are u right?

829
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,490
you did a good job.

830
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,500
You got us everything we need.

831
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,350
Now isn't that more satisfying
than shooting at cops?

832
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,130
You're a lot better at it, anyway.

833
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
whatever.

834
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,710
I think I kind of like this whole
clean slate/ fresh start thing.

835
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,720
And now is where you want me
to tell you it was a good plan.

836
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
No.

837
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,670
Maybe later.

838
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,090
It was a good plan.

839
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,340
"Exam room three.

840
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,460
Insomnia and bouts of withholding"?

841
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,710
Hey!

842
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,810
What's going on?

843
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,830
We closed our case tonight.

844
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,930
Congratulations.

845
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,030
How's mad dog?

846
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,060
Ohh.

847
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,460
Remember that poster
of your brain on drugs?

848
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,560
Yeah.

849
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,190
So what's with the dinosis?

850
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,850
I need to tell you something.

851
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,550
I'm glad we're together.

852
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,940
Well, I'm glad we're together, too,
but that can't be keeping you awake.

853
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,620
I wanted to give you this.

854
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
It's a getaway box.

855
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,740
It was a getaway box.

856
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,260
Now it's just a box of my stuff

857
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,210
that's gonna be in our apartment
with all the rest of my stuff.

858
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,850
A getaway box.

859
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,950
Let me guess.

860
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,380
The getaway box was for a quick
getaway if it wasn't working out.

861
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,080
You're kind of smart
for a handsome guy.

862
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,120
Yeah.

863
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,200
Is there anything else while
you're feeling confessional?

864
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,190
I sleep with a wave machine.

865
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,780
I can live with that.

866
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,100
who dining here

867
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,110
Um,
n-n-no one.

868
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,170
Yet.

869
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:37,790
See, it's been a long time since I've
made dinner, and I forgot about splatter.

870
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,770
And then...

871
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,370
I, uh, I forgot about
the part where, uh...

872
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,470
I really can't reach the splatter.

873
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,050
And, uh, so I guess I just...

874
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,230
created more work for you.

875
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,630
you haven't even tasted it yet.

876
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,730
Don't need to.

877
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,850
hey!

878
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,820
Hey!

879
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,440
Uh, can I officially
release artie lazar's name?

880
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,830
How are you always around?

881
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,930
I'm good at what i do.

882
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,660
Yeah, sure.

883
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,480
We're on the record.

884
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,620
So, um, am i in the club?

885
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,500
There is no club.

886
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,480
Oh, yeah.

887
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,580
I am in.

888
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,350
Hey.

889
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,080
Hey.

890
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,150
Good work today.

891
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,250
Thanks.

892
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,430
I didn't mean to freeze you out.

893
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,600
I didn't mean for you
to meet heather that way.

894
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,300
No matter how I met her, I
wouldn't have liked it, so...

895
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,820
is that your dinner?

896
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,110
don't start.

897
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,120
I was gonna offer you some of mine.

898
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,960
Heather dropped off a casserole.

899
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,360
Of course she did.

900
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,430
What is it, tuna surprise?

901
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,530
Cassoulet.

902
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,910
Really? My favorite.

903
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,020
I know.

904
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Ironic.

905
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,050
it's delicious.

906
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,550
eating dinner together is nice.

907
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,530
We never did it
when we were married.

908
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,630
We should have.

909
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:29,020
anyway, um, at least the
mayor will sleep well tonight.

910
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,120
The city will sleep well tonight.

911
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,940
Ooh lindsay, we got a hit on the prints
from the kiss me not killer's latest victim.

912
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,950
Her name was elaine lewis.

913
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,350
Her parents reported her missing from
silver springs, nevada, two weeks ago.

914
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,080
I'll call claire.

915
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,960
He took her across state lines.

916
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,610
That makes it federal.

917
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,970
The fbi is taking over the case.

918
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980
It's not my call.

919
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,490
you could fight for me.

920
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,590
And it's not open for debate.

921
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,200
This is not personal, lindsay.

922
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,930
It is to me.

923
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,830
Tell heather thanks for dinner.
