1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,250
Previously on "ugly betty"...

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,300
connor ran off with all the money.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,560
as of noon today,all of the meade
accounts have been totally cleared out.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,750
We clean up our own mess.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,840
I'm gonna start liquidating my
persol assets-- everything I've got.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,740
I'll contribute as much as I can.

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:20,030
Which fabulousfa shion world editor has
begun to sell off her clothes willy-nilly?

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,660
I have a son now,d
anit's his company,too.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,890
I have to be careful,though,sometimes--
remind myself that I am not his mother.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,380
A bus,really,daniel?

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,110
This is the lowest moment of my life.

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,060
For god sake,hold onto the pole!

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,540
No way.I don't know
who touched that thing.

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,070
My family is,sort of,really wealthy.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,210
I just feel like I don't
know that much about you.

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,790
well,here's something else you might
not know-- I'm kinda really into you.

17
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,080
for the record,I've decided
the limo treatment doesn't suck.

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,170
Noted.Also for the record,I'm
not really a limo kind of guy.

19
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,250
I just thought it might be
fun,since it's,you know,tuesday.

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,460
Tuesday--now officially
known as "limo day.

21
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,100
" seriously,matt,stop pampering
me.It makes me feel guilty.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,790
Damn.

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,100
There goes hot air balloon wednesday.

24
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,930
sounds good,doesn't it?

25
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,420
Seriously,I can make that happen.

26
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,970
I know,I believe you,but it just--
it all feels like a little much,

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,890
- you know,with the cutbacks
at work and-- I know,I know.

28
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,370
But for you,hot air balloon
wednesday,submarine thursday...

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,430
as long as it makes
you happy,just name it.

30
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,780
Anything.

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,240
Well,I don't think you can make me any
more happy,but I'm gonna go out on a limb

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,200
and say that things at
work are gonna get better.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,350
- Really?
-Yeah.

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,850
It's sort of my grand
unified theory of happiness.

35
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,870
With us so good,how could work be bad?

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,070
Coming through.

37
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,470
Excuse me.Sorry.Just trying to get out.

38
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,400
hey,watch it!

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,580
- excuse--
sorry.

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,120
What is going on?

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,040
That's mine."mode" magazine,please
hold."Mode" magazine,hold.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,170
no,he's not available.Please hold.

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,330
- Amanda.
- Hey,you cannot just take that!That is "mode" property.

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,580
Breathe,mandy.

45
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,230
Breathe.

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,770
guys,what is going on?

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,860
We're being looted.

48
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,230
I feel so violated,and
not in a good way.

49
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,160
Didn't you hear?

50
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,970
The sex issue was a limp noodle,and
now they've cut the budget to the bone.

51
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,100
Oh,god.This is so depressing.

52
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,700
I just used the word "noodle"
and "bone," and I got nothing.

53
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,440
Apparently,everything leased or
considered nonessential has to go.

54
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm looking for... betty suarez?

55
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,670
Do you need any help
loading her onto the truck?

56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,720
You need my I.D.For a delivery?

57
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,380
It's protocol.

58
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,370
Sign here.

59
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,020
and here.

60
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,610
Is this all really necessary?

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,540
inreial he.

62
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,480
And I need your thumbprint.

63
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,510
My thumbprint?

64
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,220
identity confirmed.

65
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,070
The calvin hartley charitable foundation requires
positive identification of all recipients.

66
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,730
The hartley charitable foundation?

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,030
Did he say,"the hartley
charitable foundation"?

68
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,280
Daniel,what's going on?

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,900
They're repossessing everything.

70
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,070
Betty,shh.Please.

71
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,020
With everything falling apart around
here,just let me have this moment.

72
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,750
every year,cal hartley hosts a charity easter
egg hunt at the museum of natural history.

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,810
Wait.Cal hartley?

74
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,440
Oh,it's incredibly exclusive.

75
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,190
I've been trying to
score an invite for years.

76
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,120
Um,daniel,I think maybe this might be...

77
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,700
"the calvin hartley charitable foundation
"is pleased to invite...betty suarez"?

78
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,920
Cal hartley is matt's father.

79
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,940
Of course.Matt... hartley.

80
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,150
I don't know why I
never put that together.

81
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,830
So things are going really
great with you and matt,I guess.

82
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,040
Yeah.

83
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,440
Seeing as...you got e big egg-vite.

84
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,020
Here you are.

85
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,030
Y,sorr daniel.I had no idea.

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,220
No,no,no,it's fine.I'm sure you're gonna have fun
mingling with the billionaires and the princesses...

87
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,300
and the popes and the...

88
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,940
oh,sorry,daniel,one second.

89
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,890
hello.

90
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,670
Aunt betty,dot ever break up with matt!

91
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,780
Why do you need my fingerprint?

92
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,830
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,150
We just got an invitation to
the hartley easter egg hunt.

94
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,840
Do you know how exclusive this is?

95
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,790
- I'm a U.S. Citizen...
- I have an idea.

96
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,940
I have rights,you know!

97
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,670
Grandpa,give him the thumbprint.

98
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,860
You're not gonna mess this up for me.

99
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,960
Go.

100
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,950
Look,justin,I don't really have time for
this right now,but I'll call you back,okay?

101
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,360
Bye.

102
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,180
Everything okay?

103
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,930
Yeah,he was just really excited
about going to the hartley thing.

104
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,260
Your family got an egg-vitation?

105
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,060
that is beautiful,willie.

106
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,200
You are one magnificent mama.

107
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,980
Oh,thank you,miles.

108
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,100
Can we take a break,please?

109
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,790
Christina.

110
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,490
Come get him.

111
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,330
come on,little man.

112
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,800
my back is killing me.

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,510
Oh,you poor thing.

114
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,090
You've been holding him
for,what,a whole five minutes.

115
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,210
Try doing it for nine months.

116
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,360
Yes,yes,yes,you're a saint.

117
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,500
And his diaper's full as well.

118
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,060
Miles,darling,thank you so much for
capturing these precious moments.

119
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,120
Oh,it's my pleasure,wilhelmina.

120
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,670
Uh,that woman?

121
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,240
Oh,she's my surrogate.

122
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,670
She's helped me out until I find
a more suitable nanny arrangement.

123
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,430
Was she your egg donor,as well?

124
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,730
What?

125
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,370
No.Why would you suggest such a thing?

126
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,710
Well,the baby doesn't
exactly look like you.

127
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,260
Well,miles,his father is white.

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,440
What do you expect?

129
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,920
I mean,he'll brown up eventually.

130
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,230
No,it's not just that,wilhelmina.

131
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,680
My business is seeing,especially faces.

132
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,840
And your child really
looks like that woman.

133
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,760
Well,that's preposterous.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,030
there.Yes.What are you doing?

135
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,180
Listen,not to worry.

136
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,550
I can work wonders with photoshop.

137
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,230
I'll give him the slater chin.

138
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,720
from the summit of mount everest
to the heights of earth's orbit,

139
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,380
whether he's brokeri peace in the
middle east,inventing a new artificial hip

140
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,690
or winning his third indianapolis 500,

141
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,920
cal hartley personifies the
pinnacle of human achievement.

142
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,280
Billionaire,philanthropist,innovator--

143
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,650
there is no part of your life that cal
hartley hasn't touched and probably made better.

144
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,130
Yep,that's dad.

145
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,190
Please adopt me.

146
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,620
Forget it.

147
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,710
Unless you take me,too.

148
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,020
Matt,we really appreciate you inviting us
to your father's fund-raiser,but I just...

149
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,730
feel we wouldn't fit in.

150
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,130
don't even go there,grandpa.

151
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,790
I've been waiting for
this my whole life.

152
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,840
Yeah,and I hear that they have a real
fah-burge egg hidden in with the easter eggs.

153
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,220
I'm so finding it.

154
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,120
"Faberg?"

155
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,680
no,sweetie,when there's an
"e" at the end,it's silent.

156
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,000
Matt,are you sure you wanna do this?

157
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,920
I mean,I didn't exactly start off on the right foot with
your mom,and I was hoping for less pressure with your dad.

158
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,930
You know,maybe we could
have him over for dinner.

159
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,920
Papi could cook...

160
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,180
mm,I would love that.

161
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,810
And we'll just talk
about mountain climbing.

162
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,910
Well,you know,meeting my
father is a really big deal.

163
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,950
I mean,this guy turns down
invitations to the white house.

164
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,660
Matt,you're not helping.

165
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,500
look,look,the point is,four former
presidents wanna meet that guy.

166
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,370
But to me,that guy is dad.

167
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,040
Betty,I want you to meet my dad.

168
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,120
Okay,all right,we're in.

169
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,350
yay. yay! What?!

170
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,640
I figured,the best way to make a good first impression
on mr.Hartley was to learn as much about him as I can.

171
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,710
Did you know he went into outer space?

172
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,390
Oh,I wish I was that rich.

173
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,440
I'd like to go into outer space.

174
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,490
Wow,there are,like,a
million interviews with him.

175
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,480
Here's one in the
"dubayy financial times.

176
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,320
" "Hartley made his reputation riding
to the rescue of struggling companies.

177
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,850
" I'd like to rescue
struggling companies.

178
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,570
Daniel,we are a struggling company.

179
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,860
Listen--"among the assets hartley considers
undervalued "and ripe for reinvestment "

180
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,580
are media companies,including
newspaper and magazine publishing.

181
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,820
" He said that?

182
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,400
Yeah.

183
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,560
Danielwhat if we got
hartley to invest in meade?

184
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,460
I mean,he--he could
be our white knight.

185
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,170
He could save the company.

186
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,880
No,but hartley is
notoriously hard to get to.

187
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,150
Do you really think you can set it up?

188
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,360
Are you kidding?

189
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,600
Matt would be more than happy to set
up a meeting with you and his father.

190
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,320
- Betty,if you can pull
this off-- I can do it!

191
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,600
I can't do it.

192
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,550
- It's jeta meing.
- No,I can'T.

193
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,560
Daniel only wants a
chance to talk to your dad.

194
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,490
Look,everybody wants
to talk to my father.

195
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,840
Invitations to the white house,remember?

196
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,070
Everybody in the world always
wants something from him.

197
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,780
No,but,matt,it's not like that.

198
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,460
This is an opportunity for him.

199
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,860
Yeah,and it's always an opportunity.

200
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,260
Betty,look,you have to trust me.

201
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,950
It is not a good idea.

202
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,590
- But,matt--
no.I'm sorry.

203
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,530
The answer is no.

Daniel realls myneed help,but I don't
want to do anything to upset matt.

209
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,570
poor matt.

210
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,580
You don't know how much
pressure is on these rich people.

211
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,970
It's incredible.

212
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,550
And what do you know about rich people?

213
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,730
Excuse me.

214
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,110
I've been watching "dynasty"
on the soap channel.

215
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,360
they're not like us.

216
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,140
Listen,I don't know about "dynasty," but if
the choice is between disappointing your boss

217
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,320
or keeping your rich boyfriend
happy,show me the money.

218
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,140
Oh,yeah,it's like when blake has to choose
between his wife krystle and her look-alike rita,

219
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,550
also played by linda evans in a red wig.

220
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,820
Catch up,people.

221
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,750
you know,mija,you tried to
help out,and it didn't work.

222
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,610
Daniel will understand.

223
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,730
Just tell him the truth.

224
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,340
You're probably right,papi.

225
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,270
I should just tell him the truth.

226
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,290
Look at little william here.

227
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,230
This shot really brings
out that slater chin.

228
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,750
Oh,honestly,willie,you haven't
had a slater chin since 1981.

229
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,010
Well,look at these cheekbones.See?

230
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,620
well,as much as I live to tell you what you want
to hear,I don't think babies have cheekbones.

231
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,280
Well,then he must take
after bradford,I suppose.

232
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,810
Actually,except for the fish belly
complexion,I don'see bradford in there,either.

233
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,820
What's this all about,willie?

234
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,930
Oh,nothg,I guess.

235
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,920
It's just... well,miles says the
baby looks a lot like christina.

236
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,400
Oh,my god,he does.

237
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,390
Uh,I mean,does he?

238
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,840
Really?I don't see it.

239
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,790
Marc,this is my baby.

240
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,040
I don't care what that overrated lens
jockey miles foster says,I know my own child.

241
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,310
Of course you do.Why are
we even discussing this?

242
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,400
We were both there when
they did thprocedure.

243
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,120
It was your egg mixed with bradford'S...
swim team. The baby can't be christina'S.

244
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,110
It's medically impossible.

245
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,620
Actually,it is medically possible.

246
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,010
you're joking.

247
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,180
If the surrogate had sexual intercourse before the
implantation,it's possible she was already pregnant.

248
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,770
In that case,your egg wouldn't have taken,and
the baby would be her biological child.

249
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,400
Well,that's all very educational.

250
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,600
thank you for coming down,doctor.

251
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,660
- That's it?
- Yes.

252
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,340
Because you--you
said it was urgent.

253
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,240
- I rushed out of surgery
to get-- thank you.

254
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,930
marc... dear god.

255
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,340
William might not be mine.

256
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,090
I'm so sorry.

257
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,020
Well,it's-- it's
unacceptable.

258
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:25,180
Without little william's share of the company,I go back to
being a paid employee with daniel's girlish fingers at my throat.

259
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,110
I need you to find out if christina
had sex right before the procedure.

260
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,400
And do it discreetly.

261
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,750
daniel,I need to talk to you.

262
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,110
And I want to talk to you,too.

263
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,630
All right,guys,thank you.

264
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,620
Everyone.Good work.I think it's
time to go home and get some rest.

265
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,920
Have you been here all night?

266
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,190
Why didn't you call me?

267
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,050
Well,I know you were busy with matt.

268
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,600
We decided to go all
inon your hartley idea.

269
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,220
All in?

270
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,890
Yep.I called in marketing,ad
sales,the art department,

271
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,030
and we put together such a kick-ass
proposal for my meeting with hartley.

272
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,300
Um,daniel,before you
start kicking ass,I--

273
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,060
just wait till you see
what we came up with.

274
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,370
We are gonna blow him away.

275
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,480
for over a hundred years,meade
publications has helped to educate,

276
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,550
inform and entertain
generations of americans.

277
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,180
Now leading this bold charge into the
next millennium is a true visionary,

278
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:32,610
businessman,humanitarian,and
world-class athlete-- daniel m athlete?

279
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,690
Yeah,I was on the crew
team--J.V. Besides,

280
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,710
if hartley's gonna put money into meade the
company,he's gotta have confidence in meade the man.

281
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,570
did you notice I got that guy who did
the voice for hartley's to do mine?

282
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,050
- Daniel,I-- I mean,it's
still a work in progress.

283
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,750
We're gonna photoshop the margarita out of
my hand,maybe put in,like,an orphaned baby...

284
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,150
betty,I gotta tell you,ithiss the first time
in months I feel like we actually have a chance.

285
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,340
So what do you think?

286
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,890
He's gonna love it.

287
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,550
you're gonna knock his
socks off in that meeting.

288
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,570
You didn't really say,"knock
his socks off," did you?

289
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,040
It just came out.

290
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,590
What am I gonna do?

291
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,680
Daniel thinks that this meeting with
hartley could help save the company.

292
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,710
And I have to tell him
it's not even gonna happen.

293
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,100
Well,the man is a "true
visionary," so he may already know.

294
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,410
Oh...there he is.

295
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,210
There's the little product of
an unholy deal with the devil.

296
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,410
Yes,you are!

297
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,860
You're so good with him.

298
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,510
Who knew?I thought my only maternal
instinct was nursing a bottle of whiskey.

299
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,590
Stuart's coming by in a little while,and
we're gonna go for a walk in the park.

300
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,240
Yes.Oh,how is stuart?

301
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,120
Better,actually.

302
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,240
At first we thought the treatment wasn't
working,but I don't know,it seems to be improving.

303
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,450
you should see him with this little
ankle biter,all cooing and making faces.

304
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,010
so what are you gonna do about daniel?

305
00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:00,220
I don't know,but I just have to make sure that he
and matt do not see each other until I figure it out.

306
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,840
speak of the devil.

307
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,940
Hello?

308
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,320
hey,it's me.

309
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,570
Hi,I was just about to call you.

310
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,020
Okay,we're still talking.That's good.

311
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,870
I just want to say,I'm sorry I lost it
about,you know,daniel wanting to meet my dad,

312
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,260
and I was hoping I could
take you out to lunch.

313
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,460
That sounds great.

314
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,600
Where do you want to meet?

315
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,660
Acally,I'm heading towards
your desk right now.

316
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,330
What?

317
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,480
Don't go to my desk!

318
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,700
I'm not at my desk!

319
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:33,260
uh,let'S... play a game.

320
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,530
Um,you try to find me.

321
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,720
sort of like a sexy scavenger hunt?

322
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,830
Yeah,yeah,I guess.

323
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,010
Okay...here I come.

324
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,390
where are you?

325
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,870
Hey,I have a lunch uptown.

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,610
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

327
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,740
Good.

328
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,220
Have a-a good lunch.

329
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,880
Thanks.

330
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:12,210
Warmer... warmer... found you!

331
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,210
Don't make me taser you.

332
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,760
uh,cold!Ice cold!

333
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,230
Freezing!Freezing!

334
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,890
Hey,I forgot my briefcase on your desk.

335
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,740
Oh,no!

336
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,800
Go back to the elevator.I'll go get it.

337
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,080
- Okay.
- Yeah,I'll see you there.

338
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,850
have a good lunch.

339
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,350
Thanks.

340
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,760
found you.

341
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,740
Yay!

342
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,680
- You found me.
- Yes!

343
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,210
You win.

344
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,650
- betty,I totally
forgot-- hey,matt!

345
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,490
Hey,daniel.

346
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,020
Um,we should probably just get going.

347
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,300
okay.

348
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,420
I can't thank you enough for setting
up this meeting with your father.

349
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,480
Daniel!

350
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,580
excuse me?

351
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,570
I really think it'll be an incredible
investment opportunity for him.

352
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,260
I didn't set any meeting.

353
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,170
What?

354
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,070
I told betty I couldn't do it.

355
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,840
Betty,what's going on?

356
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,090
Yeah,betty,what is going on?

357
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,900
Well,why'd you tell him I'd
set up a meeting with dad?

358
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,920
Well,I-I didn't exactly.

359
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,610
Yes... you did.

360
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,810
Look,I can explain this,just
not with both of you right here.

361
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,940
Daniel,will you go wait for
me in the conference room?

362
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,180
- I have a
lunch-- please.

363
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,240
I was gonna tell him this morning...

364
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,250
but when I came in,he'd been up
all night working on a proposal.

365
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,830
I didn't want to break his heart.

366
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,550
Look,but he was gonna
find out eventually.

367
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,890
Yes,but I was hoping that
I could talk to you again.

368
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,550
Remember when you said that
I could ask you r anything?

369
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,820
Submarine thursdays?

370
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,200
Okay,betty.Betty,that was different.

371
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,040
It's just a business meeting between the head
of meade publications and a potential investor.

372
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,400
It has nothing to do with us.

373
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,830
But it does.

374
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:25,440
Betty,being cal hartley's son-- it's
like I'm two different people.Right?

375
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,450
There's--there's a guy whose father
is worth more than most opec countries,

376
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,560
and then I'm the guy who writes
about sports and forgets his wallet

377
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,040
and gets a lump in his throat
every time his girlfriend smileshim.

378
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:43,630
Betty,there's my dad and business and
money,and then there's me-- my life.

379
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,090
You're part of my life,aren't you?

380
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,700
Yes,of course.

381
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,010
Daniel.

382
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,740
Why didn't you just tell me he said no?

383
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,640
Because you were so excited.

384
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,300
I didn't want to disappoint you.

385
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,380
So you let me look like an idiot?

386
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,360
I thought I could change his mind.

387
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,060
And?

388
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,700
Sorry. I don't know
what else to do,daniel.

389
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,250
I know how important this is to the
company,but matt is my boyfriend.

390
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,080
and if this is what he wants,then...

391
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,550
I have to respect that.

392
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,290
I understand.

393
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,750
You do?

394
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,390
I imagine matt's gotta have his reasons.

395
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,870
Family can be...complicated.

396
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,470
I oughta know.

397
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,760
It's okay,betty.

398
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,910
So what are we gonna do?

399
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,650
Well,I admit things don't look very good,but,um,we're
not ready to turn the lights out just yet.

400
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,750
We'll figure something out.

401
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,960
There are always other options.

402
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,760
There are no other options.

403
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,180
Well,I can't accept that.

404
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,600
Face the facts,daniel.

405
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,220
We barely cobbled together the cash to
put the last issue on the newsstands.

406
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,680
The government's not gonna help
us,and the banks won't touch us.

407
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,990
What you're talking about-- we
agreed we were not there yet.

408
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,960
Well,we're there now.

409
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,000
The company has survived
for over a hundred years.

410
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,550
People were reading "mode"
during the past two world wars.

411
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,680
They were burning it for warmth
during the great depression.

412
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,780
I mean,I will be damned if I'm gonna explain to my
son-- your half-brother--that we stood by and let it die.

413
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,500
I certainly don't want
that,either,but what do we--

414
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,350
we have poured every penny into
keeping this magazine afloat.

415
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,770
Money of our own.

416
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
If we let it go under,we have nothing.

417
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,170
it's time to make some tough choices.

418
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,230
You're right.

419
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,230
I'll take care of it.

420
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,040
I've been thinking,we
don't really talk very much.

421
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,110
That's because we don't
like each other very much.

422
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,860
And it tears me up inside.

423
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,000
We've been spending so much time together
because of the baby,we should be pals.

424
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,250
I'm good,actually.

425
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,820
You know what's a fun thing
for us girls to do--a sex quiz!

426
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,100
I am in!

427
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,400
My sex I.Q.Is crazy high.

428
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,810
I'm like the einstein of sex.

429
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:38,150
Um...okay."What is your
favorite season to have sex?

430
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,020
" Fall!No,spring!Winter!No,summer!

431
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,450
Oh,this is gonna be
harder than I thought.

432
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,060
I heard "summer."Good answer.

433
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,960
Like... june?Don't you
love having sex in june?

434
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,940
June 14th at 3:02 P.M.,I was
in the ladies' room at the U.N.

435
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,510
J*nos--he's the delegate
from hungary-- and he was.

436
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,430
I have a pornographic memory.

437
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,960
Back to christina.

438
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,760
Sizzling summer
sexcapades--go!

439
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,650
Why are you so
interested in my sex life?

440
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,760
What?It's just a quiz.

441
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,790
I started to think about
it,and then I realized...

442
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,700
june!

443
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,960
That was when I had
wilhelmina's egg implanted.

444
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,390
And the only reason that he would
want to know if I'd had sex--

445
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,370
-he's a pervert?
-No,listen.

446
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,190
Do you remember a coupdays of before the procedure,we went
out to dinner,to that little pub on the lower east side?

447
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,790
Yeah,yeah,you were pretty
upset about the whole thing.

448
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,420
You must've had,what,five or six
pints,couldn't keep your hands off me.

449
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,570
Shut up!Just listen.

450
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,780
They told me I wasn't supposed
to have sex before the procedure,

451
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,940
but I thought,it's just the one time,and
the chance of anything happening...

452
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,750
christina... could he be our son?

453
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,520
ll we,what are we gonna do?

454
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,790
Well... I've got to talk to wilhelmina.

455
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,280
And we've got to find out the truth.

456
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,810
Good mng!

457
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,890
come here,come here,get in,get in!

458
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,470
they're handing out pink slips.

459
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,880
What?

460
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,520
Are you serious?

461
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,420
this is like a reality show.

462
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,360
I hate myself for
watching,but I can't look away.

463
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,490
oh,not sven,not sven!

464
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,100
Well,I guess that'll save some awkward
conversation by the coffee machine.

465
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,950
This is crazy.

466
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,540
Oh,my god.

467
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,370
sorry... amanda.

468
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,180
Amanda?

469
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,600
I'm fired?

470
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,950
This must be some sort of mistake.

471
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,490
I know,right?

472
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:22,420
I mean,I understand them getting rid of the lunch intern
and the creepy copy guy and all those editors,but...

473
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,160
I'm amanda tanen-sommers.

474
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,120
Oh,mandy,I'm so sorry.

475
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,600
But... I am the--the
face of "mode.

476
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,010
" I am "mode"!

477
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,100
I'm the first person
they see en they walk in.

478
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,850
Who's gonna welcome them now
and tell them where to sign in?

479
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,740
But they need to see something pretty.

480
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,350
Oh,god.It's gonna be okay,sweetie.

481
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,490
This isn't the end of the world.

482
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,580
Someone's gonna hire you in a second.

483
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,450
Really?

484
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,430
Because I can do a job that a
clipboard and a vase of flowers can do?

485
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,630
Oh,mandy.

486
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,010
Marc,I don't belong anywhere else.

487
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,350
I belong at "mode." This is my home.

488
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,750
What am I gonna do?

489
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,220
Daniel,amanda was just
fired.What's going on?

490
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,230
Look,before you panic,your job is safe.

491
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,480
You're too valuable to let go.

492
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,560
Uh,well,thanks,but what
about everyone else?

493
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,350
I thought you said there were options.

494
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,320
Well,unfortunately,it turned out
there really was only one option.

495
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,480
Fire everybody?

496
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,010
Do you think I like firing people?

497
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,370
I like amanda,I like
jenny in accounting.

498
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,080
It was either cut the payroll
or file for bankruptcy.

499
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,470
Then none of us would have
jobs.Is that what you want?

500
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,010
No,no,of course not.

501
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,330
Betty,we shut down five magazines
today.That's hundreds of employees.

502
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,070
I didn't have a choice.

503
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,210
I'm sorry.

504
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,520
I'm getting you that
meeting with hartley.Come on.

505
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,770
I don't have an egg-vitation.

506
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,980
Daniel,it's now or never.

507
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,400
He's leaving for a trans-siberian
motorcycle race right after the party.

508
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,150
Yeah,but what about matt?How's he gonna
feel about you going behind his back?

509
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,580
I hope he understands.

510
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,180
ooh,fah-burge.Come to mama.

511
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,590
damn.Here.

512
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,620
-Matt,I have something I need
to-- -you look really pretty.

513
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,460
Thank you.

514
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,200
So ready for the moment of truth?

515
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,030
Yep.

516
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,840
hey,guys,you want to
come over and meet my dad?

517
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
He's right here.

518
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
All right.Here we go.

519
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,290
Dad,uh,I would like you
to meet the suarez family.

520
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,640
Uh,justin,hilda... ignacio,my father.

521
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,390
It is a pleasure.

522
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,420
Mr.Hartley,sir.

523
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,130
No,please,call me cal.

524
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,610
Uh,justin,hilda,are
we treating you okay?

525
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,170
Oh,yeah!

526
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,830
Istey,ln,you wanna give me a hint
on where the fah-burge egg is?

527
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,740
Mom!

528
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,280
I don't think that would
be fair to my other guests.

529
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,250
And this must be the young lady
that I've been waiting to meet.

530
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,920
It's a pleasure to meet you,mr.Hartley.

531
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,150
I heard you made quite an
impression on matt's mother.

532
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,400
I think the words she used
were,"over my dead,rotting corpse."

533
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,570
Dad...

534
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,110
well,the thing
is,I don't really--

535
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:37,100
anyone who can get under my ex-wife's
skin like that is okay in my book.

536
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,730
now I would love to spend the
whole afternoon just with you,

537
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,390
but I have to spend some
time with my other guests,

538
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,670
so please,everybody,have a good time,

539
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,550
and I'll just--I'll-- I'll
see you later. Bye-bye.

540
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,180
Ciao.

541
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,450
Wow,I never shook a hand that's
been in outer space before.

542
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,600
See?Piece of cake.

543
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,570
Work stuff that I just have
to deal with real quick.

544
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,540
But I'll be back.

545
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,480
Daniel!

546
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,710
What are you doing?

547
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,480
Where have you been?There's
security everywhere.

548
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,250
And people are starting
to look at me weird.

549
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,340
Because you're supposed to be a waiter,but you're
standing around eating cookies in a $10,000 prada suit.

550
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,850
This is from 2 years ago!

551
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,220
All right,look,I met mr.Hartley.

552
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,900
What's he like?

553
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,540
He'S... interesting,but nice.

554
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,600
And I think he'll be
open to your thoughts.

555
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,830
-You ready?
-I think so.

556
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,670
Okay,maybe leave the cookie.

557
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,990
you had sex?

558
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,390
Do I need to remind you that
we had a signed contract?

559
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,840
What,you're going to
sue me for having sex?

560
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,500
I gave you a great deal of money,money that
was supposed to help save your dying husband.

561
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,230
At least part of him
was alive and kicking.

562
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,990
Oh,don't get all high
and mighty with me.

563
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,960
You rammed that contract
right down my throat.

564
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,020
And you knew exactly what you
were getting yourself into.

565
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,700
And you knew that I couldn't say no!

566
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,580
God,the contract was barely dry before I
was lying on my back with my legs in the air,

567
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,460
someone waving a turkey baster at me!

568
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,560
Lovely.

569
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,440
I want to know what
we're going to do now.

570
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,500
Because there is a chance
that that baby is mine.

571
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,860
An infinitesimal chance.

572
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,010
It's still a chance.

573
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,130
I need to know whose baby that is.

574
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,250
And so do you.

575
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,820
Yes,I do.

576
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,680
we'll get a blood test.

577
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,980
Then we'll know.

578
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,770
Right.

579
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,270
there he is.

580
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,020
Let's go.

581
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,740
sorry.

582
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,420
Excuse me,sir.

583
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,010
May I see your credentials?

584
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,030
Wha--oh,yeah,of
course.

585
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,650
Uh,just a second.

586
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,630
Uh,I... sorry,I had 'em a second ago.

587
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,790
You know what?He's with me,so it's okay.

588
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,870
He needs his own invitation,ma'am.

589
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,200
This is outrageous.

590
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,400
I want both of your names right now.

591
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,180
Do you have a pen?

592
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,010
Oh,oh,oh,okay,mistake,sorry!

593
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,480
Please just let him go.I can explain.

594
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,910
Come on.

595
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,800
Listen,listen... he can clear this up.

596
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,510
I know you're mad.

597
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,550
You lied to me.

598
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:41,290
Matt,amanda got fired today,along with about
half of meade,and I couldn't just come here

599
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,650
and drink champagne and hunt for easter
eggs and pretend like nothing was happening.

600
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,680
What was I supposed to do?

601
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,590
You could've come to me.

602
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,420
Would you have changed your mind?

603
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,740
Is this really what you want?

604
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:59,390
Matt,you mean so much to me,but if giving daniel five
minutes with your dad is gonna help him save meade,

605
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:04,100
then,yes,it's wh i want.

606
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,810
It's okay.He's with me.

607
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,210
Dad,I'd like to introduce you
to betty's boss,daniel meade.

608
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,060
It's an incredible honor,sir.

609
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,680
Meade,huh?

610
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,210
Don't recall seeing your
name on the guest list.

611
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,280
Uh,uh,it's a fu--
uh,funny story.

612
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,220
Actually,um...

613
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,810
come on,I'm just messing
with you.Let's have a drink.

614
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,300
Great,great.

615
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,970
Matt,thank you.

616
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,740
I know you've shown an
interest in media stocks.

617
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,700
Of course,I read your amazing interview
in the "dubayy financial times.

618
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:05,400
" Anyway,um,meade publications
is poised to rebound in a big way.

619
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,750
mr. Hartley?

620
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,050
Cal.Cal.

621
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,640
Everything... all right?

622
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,690
I raise a lot of money at this shindig
every year for a lot of terrific causes.

623
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:28,290
But what I love about it
most is the kids,you know?

624
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,710
Absolutely.

625
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,400
The simple joy on a child's face.

626
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,740
That's what it's really about.

627
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,880
I couldn't agree with you more.

628
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,650
Anyway,all meade needs is a
short-term infusion of operating cap--

629
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,620
it's such a shame
floppy couldn't make it.

630
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,090
floppy?

631
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,350
Yeah,floppy the bunny.

632
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,090
He's the guy we hired to put on the
big pink bunny suit and hand out eggs.

633
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,290
Just totally flaked on us.

634
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,070
That is a shame.

635
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,160
as I was saying,a short-term
infusion of capital would really--

636
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,050
we got the suit and everything.We
just need someone to put it on,

637
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:09,500
hop around,wiggle his nose.

638
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,040
That'd sure make this day
a success,don't you think?

639
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,190
Make those kids smile?

640
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:23,380
And seeing those kids' smiling faces would
sure put me in the mood to talk business.

641
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,260
I got it!

642
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,920
I got the egg!

643
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,140
congratulations.

644
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,500
Now why don't you step
up here,young lady?

645
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,380
Oh,excuse me,kids.

646
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,720
-Excuse me,excuse...
-oh,here we go.

647
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,330
Now since you found the faberg?

648
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:50,090
egg,valued at more than
half a million dollars...

649
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:57,620
it will now be auctioned off and the proceeds
donated to new york children's hospital in your name.

650
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,270
but I-I found it.

651
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,720
I found the egg,sir.

652
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,040
-All right,sweetheart.
-This isn't fair!

653
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,780
Time to go.

654
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,620
isn't she wonderful?

655
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,600
I found the egg.

656
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,940
are we finished?Do you hate me,matt?

657
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,900
Because I hate me right now and...

658
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,860
no. No,no,I could never hate you.

659
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,690
Never.

660
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,470
And you were right.People's
jobs are at stake.

661
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,180
I mean,your friends are getting fired because
I have some crazy,rich-boy daddy issues?

662
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,110
That's messed up.

663
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,620
No,matt,I still should not
have gone behind your back.

664
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,290
True,you owe me for that one.

665
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,390
I may have to cancel
submarine thursdays.

666
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,830
betty,I just hope you don't regret
hooking daniel up with my father.

667
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,350
Why would I?

668
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,030
My dad can be a great guy,but you do
n want to go into business with him.

669
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,360
He needs to control everything.

670
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,130
I--I've spent my entire life trying to keep
him as far away from my career as possible.

671
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,860
That's why I didn't want him investing
in meade,working in publishing.

672
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,670
I mean,I'd finally found
something that was mine.

673
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,260
But,matt,you don't even work at meade.

674
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,110
But you do.

675
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,930
Betty,you don't know
where this could lead.

676
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,760
Oh,come on,it can't be that bad.

677
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,780
it's floppy!

678
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:31,450
floppy! Floppy! Floppy! Floppy!

679
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,680
Is that daniel?

680
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,060
I want an egg!

681
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,460
you thought my mom was the tough one?

682
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,660
My mom is like an easter egg-- hard on the
outside,but soft and gooey on the inside.

683
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,280
Dad's more like...

684
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,360
satan.

685
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,340
no,no,no,wait,wait,wait,wait!

686
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,330
Daniel,I'm so sorry.

687
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,390
I had no idea this would happen.

688
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,630
It's okay.

689
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,690
No,it's not okay.

690
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,630
Matt tried to warn me,and I wouldn't
listen,and his father humiliated you.

691
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:59,790
Betty... we did it.

692
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,810
What?

693
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,970
I just spent ten minutes with
hartley,running the numbers.

694
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,210
he's in.

695
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:12,540
He's actually delaying his trip to
siberia so we can make a full proposal.

696
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,930
He said he looks forward to
being in the publishing business.

697
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,100
Oh,my god,that's amazing!

698
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,810
wha--but what
about all of this?

699
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,090
It's just to prove what a big man he is.

700
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,640
So you knew what he was doing?

701
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,800
Yeah,of course I did.

702
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,640
I've been dealing with ego-driven
bastards like him my whole life.

703
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,230
You know,I've made a fool of
myself enoughimes for no reason.

704
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,050
I can do it once to save our company.

705
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,820
Daniel,I'm so proud of you.

706
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,880
What's that?

707
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,410
Uh,it's just my cottontail.I was
using it to stop the bleeding.

708
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,780
Those kids were vicious,huh?

709
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,770
here they are--
the lab results.

710
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,000
You haven't opened it?

711
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,290
No,I,uh... I didn't have the nerve.

712
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,620
You--you
open it.

713
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,710
it's yours.

714
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,690
The baby's yours.

715
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,710
thank god.

716
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,250
I was jus--
I was so sure.

717
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:46,710
Well... now that that is settled,I will be
making other arrangements for william's care.

718
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,530
What do you mean?

719
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,460
I will no longer be needing
your services as nanny.

720
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,120
Given the circumstances,I think it's
best that you stay away from my child...

721
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,290
permanently.

722
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:09,000
* there's a light 
that just won't go out *

723
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,860
* no matter what they try to do *

724
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:19,290
* 'Cause you can't
pull out the circuits *

725
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:25,010
* remove the bulb messages.* *

726
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:30,420
* And it just might be
e brightest star * *

727
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,330
* discovered yet by man *

728
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:43,960
* but it might as well be a
pinhole  from where we stand *

729
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,640
* so don't feel bad *

730
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,720
* don't look so sad *

731
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,660
* we're much more than that *

732
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,870
{\a6}*********

733
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:05,700
* but for now it's a death trap *

734
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,140
a carrot basket.

735
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,490
at least hartley has a sense of humor.
